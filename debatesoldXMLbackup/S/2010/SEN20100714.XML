	<P>The Order of Business is tributes to a former Member, the late Joe Doyle, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude within 30 minutes, when leaders may speak for three minutes; No. 1, Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the tributes to the late Joe Doyle; and No. 2, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 but not before 3 p.m.  There will be a sos between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will adjourn today until the end of September.  The Government will remain unaccountable to the people through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, yet the major issues facing the country remain to be dealt with and intensify.  All one has to do is look at the headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, which states, &ldquo;120,000 expected to emigrate by end of 2011, says report&rdquo;.  We speak about developing a smart economy yet we preside over this level of emigration.  The Government is in denial about the serious problems affecting the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night, we saw the fourth gangland murder in our capital city in just two weeks and the 17th overall.  What other capital city in Europe tolerates the type of gangland murders we see in Dublin, almost week in week out at this stage?  It is an extraordinary tally and very disturbing, especially for the communities most directly affected by them.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks we have also seen a series of reports on the protection of children, yet we have no date for the referendum.  After ten years of this Government we still have not put in place the type of child protection services necessary to put children at the centre.  We leave today without a date for the referendum on children.</P>
        <P>This week, we also heard the Taoiseach state there have been no cuts to front-line services in respite care.  However, we had evidence from tens of people outside the gates of Leinster House who spoke about the respite care cuts they themselves suffer.  This was a direct contradiction.  However, we have had no Minister in the House to tell us how the Disability Act will be implemented.</P>
        <P>These are all failures, but the biggest failure is the number of people emigrating because there is no work for them here.  We want to develop a smart economy, yet we have this level of emigration.  Our brightest and best are emigrating once again.  Today, the ESRI is stating that we have the largest deficit in the EU.  Of course it is because the money given to Anglo Irish Bank is included this year.  What a record of shame.  The Government is in denial.  The Fianna F&aacute;il website has a piece about turning the corner; this is the best example of denial.  We have spoken repeatedly in the House about a job creation plan and getting credit flowing.  As I speak on the last day of this Seanad term they remain problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="499"/>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;despite the words we have heard time and again from the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  Credit is not flowing, small businesses are not being supported and we are not giving a message of hope to the many people who are unemployed and who need access to jobs, training and education.  This must be the priority and Fine Gael will oppose the Government&rsquo;s plans for the House not to meet again until September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The points made by Senator Fitzgerald are very useful.  I felt the silly season had opened up full time this morning when I received a Bill from my Kerry colleague, Senator Mark Daly, and the two Green Party Senators that would require mobile phones to carry a sign stating they emit radiation.  It reminded me of my youth when people invented luminous watches and the view was that we could all die of radiation poisoning from them.  Another view was that florescent lights would make us all bald.  This is Luddite scaremongering and I will certainly oppose the Bill left, right and centre.  We can do more important things with our time and there are Kerry issues which are more important that this, if I may say so to Senator Daly.</P>
        <P>It is a pity we will not have an opportunity to discuss the ESRI report.  I do not want to get involved in a party row between the Opposition and the Government on this issue but I want to look at the two significant points in the report.  The first of these is the fact that the deficit has risen to 19.5%.  No matter who is in Government &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; this issue will have to be dealt with.  It seems that capitalisation is a draw-down figure and at the very least surely it could be made available on an annual basis so all of the hit would not have to be taken in one year because it damages the country externally.</P>
        <P>The second point in the report with which I take serious issue is the infrastructure question.  Both sides of the House have argued that we should have infrastructural work to create employment.  There are two reasons which the ESRI, with its academic response to the situation have missed.  One is a short-term employment bridge to create employment for people until more sustainable long-term employment is created but more importantly, it is an investment in future infrastructure on which we will build the economy and future employment.  That message has to be got out there.</P>
        <P>I do not want the Government running in front an ESRI report which is true in what it says but neglects a very important part of the future.  This point was made by the old Deputy Michael Noonan whom I heard on the radio this morning.  He made the point very clearly.  I took great pleasure in the fact that he had a right cut at his own PR and media people in Fine Gael when he ignored what was on the Fine Gael website and stated the true facts were what one hears from him.  We need more of this type of leadership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a difficulty with debating the ESRI report and it is a pity we do not have time to do so prior to the end of the term.  We are very fortunate to have an organisation such as the ESRI which does not seek to massage information or present it in a particular way that would be of value politically either to the Government or to anyone else.  In that context, I respectfully disagree with what Senator O&rsquo;Toole just stated on the Anglo Irish Bank money.  How anyone could possibly think the billions being sunk into Anglo Irish Bank by the Exchequer could constitute investment and could be characterised as such in the figures seems to me completely absurd.  Quite clearly, it is expenditure and has to be shown as such in our annual accounting.  That is the reality of the situation.  It has been explained that it is a once-off figure for this year.  I do not direct this at my colleague Senator O&rsquo;Toole but <Col N="500"/>generally, but let us not get so carried away with an attempt, particularly on the Government side, to make things look different from what they are that we misrepresent the reality of the situation and the figures as they are.  This is a multi-billion euro expenditure that the State will have to sink into Anglo Irish Bank and we have to face this politically in our economic and budgetary planning and in the basic facts and information we make available to people domestically and internationally.</P>
        <P>Another interesting point about the ESRI report which would be worthy of debate is the view that resources should be shifted away from expenditure on infrastructure and more in the direction of retraining and upskilling.  That is the area which the ESRI thinks would be most productive in terms of the jobs crisis.  They are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  There is a very strong basis for continued and improved infrastructural investment in our country but that should not be at the expense of an active labour market policy and investment in retraining, upskilling and education, which is what we need.  To that extent I regret the way it appears to have come out that we can have only one and not the other.  We need elements of both.  It is unfortunate that we do not have an opportunity to debate the report.</P>
        <P>At the risk of sounding like a broken record on the question of how we debate matters, when we return in the autumn is there any way we could structure a debate on a jobs policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than simply having a Minister come in and do a set speech after which we speak, which apparently constitutes a debate?  I would have no problem if the Labour Party&rsquo;s comprehensive jobs policy were tabled for debate and scrutinised and criticised if necessary by people on the opposite side so we could use this forum in a genuine way to see how best we can look to the future and examine what policies we need to put in place.  All parties and Independent Members could participate and, if necessary, debate it in the real sense of a debate rather than the set-piece stuff that passes for debate on these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Undoubtedly the country is facing very severe difficulties, as it has over the past two years.  It is an exaggeration, and it concerns me with regard to the signal it would send from the House, to state the Government is in denial, especially in a week when the Taoiseach is working hard in the United States marketing the smart economy approach of the Government.  It has tangible support in the &euro;500 million investment with which he is prepared to back it up.  We need to acknowledge these things.  There are people out there looking for signals as to what will happen and what their prospects are for the future, and we must offer them hope from the efforts that are being put in.  We need to do that in an honest and open way.  I do not disagree with what Senator Alex White stated about having a constructive debate on how we tackle unemployment, which will be with us for some years as it is in other countries.  Also, many Members mentioned the difficult financial position in which people find themselves because of over-leveraging during the good years.  Those issues need to be addressed and I would like to see that happening.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader if he could arrange a debate on a matter which appeared last night on RTE television.  I give credit to RTE for its good documentary on the Dublin bombings in 1974.  This is a matter that has been discussed in these Houses previously.  It engaged over a considerable amount of time a sub-committee of the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, and a report has been issued.  Arising from that, the D&aacute;il made representations to the House of Commons that its members would use their influence to arrive at the truth for the victims.  I would like to think the Leader might put the matter on the Order of Business when we resume in the autumn so this issue can be addressed and put to bed in <Col N="501"/>the interests of those people.  We have seen the considerable positive response from those who were victims of Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972 and a similar approach is required here in order to lance the pain and anguish which those people have suffered over the past three or four decades.  It needs to be done.</P>
        <P>Finally, I ask the Leader to arrange when we return a debate on the bankruptcy laws, which appear to be outdated and which are certainly out of sync with other jurisdictions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by asking the Leader a specific question to which I would ask him to reply when he responds to the Order of Business.  Is it appropriate that the chief executive and board member of one of the golden ten companies that propped up Anglo Irish Bank shares at the behest of its former chief executive, Mr. Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick, has been appointed to the board of the Irish Aviation Authority?  Does the Leader think that is right?  Do the Green Members here think it is right?  What does it say about the political standards of the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Government?  I want the Leader to reply specifically to that.  I will not name the person concerned out of respect for the Chair.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald is correct.  The Government is unaccountable for the next ten weeks or more, and yet there are 450,000 plus Irish citizens unemployed.  Senator Walsh missed the point.  They are in denial.  They stated we have turned the corner.  We have not turned the corner.  We need a comprehensive debate, not on a set piece but on a real jobs plan.  Where Senator Fitzgerald is spot on is we have heard nothing from Government.  The Government has borrowed a Fine Gael policy document about PRSI and has borrowed other policies from us, but it has not any plans of its own.  When will the Government give the Irish people a real say in how to run this country by calling an election?  The fundamental question that the people want answered is when will we have jobs and when will we have an election.</P>
        <P>I will make one further comment to the Leader.  I asked for a debate on aviation in this House.  Last week the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, raised the flag about renaming State airports.  It is imperative the people have an opportunity to have their voice heard in that process as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that Senator O&rsquo;Toole has left us because I could reply to his comments on the mobile phone labelling Bill.  No doubt he has done considerable research on the matter.  I ask the Leader to have a debate on this legislation.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is obviously a wise man from Kerry, but probably has not read&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the question to the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;this is related to the question to the Leader &mdash; the US President&rsquo;s cancer panel report that the true burden of environmentally caused cancers is grossly underestimated.  The report named mobile phones as a possible cause and stated precaution is required.  France has brought in legislation.  In the UK, they hand out leaflets at health clinics warning that children should not use mobile phones for more than ten minutes.  If we bothered to read the labelling and packaging from mobile phone companies, they would tell us that one should keep one&rsquo;s mobile phone an inch away from one&rsquo;s head.  I do not know whether anyone actually does it, but we should.  I look forward to debating the Bill with Senator O&rsquo;Toole and to giving him more information.  After he does a little more research rather than throwing a cursory glance at the legislation, he might change his mind.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader to organise a debate with the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Hanafin, in the House on car hire firms at airports.  They seem to be blackmailing and forcing people to pay for insurance they do not require.  In one case at Dublin Airport, an Australian couple were being badgered into paying over &euro;1,300 to the hire company for <Col N="502"/>insurance that they believed they already had and, eventually, the rental company, Thrifty, turned around and accepted &euro;90.  It had been looking for over &euro;1,300, which is extortion.  The same happened in Shannon Airport to people coming over from England.  From the York family, the company looked for over &euro;1,000 and eventually settled for less than &euro;100.  This is extortion by the car hire companies.  I ask the Leader to contact the Minister to see how we can welcome tourists to the country and that their first experience is not extortion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not get into the question of debating the mobile phone issue.  All I remember is that in the past with almost every scientific development there are people who get scared about them.  I have the same view on genetically modified foods.  It seems to me that the future of Irish agriculture will depend on us adapting the most modern scientific methods of growing foods for the world, but let us debate that when the time comes.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to the development in Britain which they call the biggest revolution in Britain&rsquo;s National Health Service, NHS, in 60 years.  As part of the coalition agreement in Britain, they have decided that doctors are to be given sole responsibility, rather than administrators, for patient care.  They have decided to take the power away from the administrators and put the decision in the hands of doctors.  When we made the decision here some years ago to do away with the health boards we established the HSE and to the best of my knowledge, we maintained all the administrators of all those various health boards.  As in many other businesses and enterprises, the power should be in the hands of those who are looking after the final customer.  In this case, it is the doctors who look after the care of patients.  I really believe that is the direction to go.  If the British coalition reached that as a deal that they would put into operation, and announced it yesterday, our health authority and the Minister should give serious attention to it during the next couple of months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want to bring my Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour and Independent colleagues up to date on developments in the treatment of the 32 thalidomide survivors.  The Cathaoirleach kindly secured the hearing of my Adjournment matter last night.  The significant role of an Adjournment was proved last night because at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, the Minister referred to the Adjournment that was taken last night on the thalidomide situation.  My requests, on behalf of the thalidomide survivors, are an apology, proper compensation and disclosure of all legal documents.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, declared she had no difficulty with disclosing all of the documents.  She did not see why they would not.  Therefore, we have a significant breakthrough on one of the significant items.</P>
        <P>The thalidomide survivors, as I explained to the Minister yesterday, are in constant pain, morning, noon and night.  They require physiotherapy and traction.  When one speaks to Ms Finola Cassidy, the association&rsquo;s secretary, one does not see or feel her pain because she can get by with one hand and three fingers.  She is such an inspiration.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s response to the Adjournment last night stated the State had sympathy.  As well as disclosing the documents, getting proper compensation, I want not only sympathy but an apology from the State on why it left it eight or nine months after the drug had been withdrawn in Germany by the manufacturer and it was not withdrawn here in time.</P>
      
        <P>Children were born deformed in this country when they should not have been.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I second and commend the remarks of the last speaker.  It is a very worthy cause.  Senator Fitzgerald, other colleagues and I share a concern that the Government will not be answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for a period of two to three months for the extraordinary conditions which apply at the moment.  We believe this is unacceptable and <Col N="503"/>very wrong.  Given the times we are in, it is contemptuous of the people who seek direction, leadership and hope.  For this reason, it is a serious matter.  Parliament should only be adjourned this year for the month of August.  It would be a way of saying to the people that at least we empathise and understand their situation.  Never would there be such an extraordinary set of circumstances pertaining whereby that would be necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator putting a question to the Leader on this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader comment on this issue and convey the concern of the House and my personal concern regarding the cutbacks in medical cards?  This is an example of what we should be debating in the coming weeks rather than going into recess.  I refer to the cutbacks in dental care under the medical card scheme.  I have raised this issue before.  When the cuts were announced in March, the Irish Dental Association warned of the negative impact this would have on medical card holders.  Yesterday, at the Joint Committee on Health and Children the chief executive of the Irish Dental Association, Fintan Hourihan, echoed this previous warning.  He said the cutbacks had caused chaos, confusion and hardship to vulnerable people  and he cited several examples.  It is a very serious matter.  People with chronic illnesses are being denied dental care.  I call on the Leader to hold a special debate and we should reconvene to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I enjoin Senator Mark Daly&rsquo;s comments on mobile phone labelling.  It is important to have a debate on this matter.  Unlike what Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, we are discussing the labelling of phones to allow people to make up their own minds.  It is not a silly season issue at all.  In the past, people used to say the same about cigarettes.  It is now commonly held that the health warning on cigarettes is important.  There is a proven link with lung cancer which, originally, was thought not to be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I enjoin Senator Mary White&rsquo;s comments on thalidomide.  This an important issue.  I trust Senators from all parties are behind the call.  There was a breakthrough in the committee yesterday because the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, stated full information would be made available to the 32 thalidomide survivors.  I hope their case will be fully dealt with in due course.</P>
        <P>I refer to the smart economy, which several Senators mentioned today.  It is important to hold a debate on the smart economy to be clear what we are discussing and what progress has been made in respect of it.  All parties on every side of the House believe there is great potential in the smart economy but the question I wish to put is whether it is happening on the ground.  There is evidence it is not taking place to the extent it must and it is important to hold a full debate on this matter and all other documents relating to the economy early in the new session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Leader he committed yesterday to informing us today regarding the Dublin mayoral Bill with which the Dingle &mdash; Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is matter is tied up.  This is the urgency.</P>
        <P>I refer to the availability of credit, a matter touched on by Senator Fitzgerald and others and about which there is a great difference of opinion.  Most of us believe credit is not flowing and I believe it is not flowing properly to oil the wheels of the economy.  Some of this is understandable because of the dire situation in which we find ourselves.  John Trethowan, the credit reviewer, is a decent, honourable man and a good prudential banker, not of the other kind, in my experience and knowledge.  If he states the main banks are making credit available, I believe him.  However, the question is the extent to which it is available and, sadly, this is where the <Col N="504"/>deficiency lies.  It is not available to the extent we would wish to make the improvements we wish to see materialise.  I have no doubt good, viable businesses are obtaining the credit they need.  However, we must go somewhat further than this given the situation we are in.  We could usefully hold a debate about the matter and it would be interesting to have the Minister in the House to outline his view and that of the Department with regard to the situation.  I do not agree with the length of the recess either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address it.</P>

	<P>Good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate my colleague, Senator Mary White, on the progress she has made in respect of thalidomide victims.  The three requests she is making warrant positive outcomes in each case, not only the disclosure of the legal documents, but in the compensation and apology.  I would like to think we will see these forthcoming.  I trust the Leader will take the opportunity to relay this message to the appropriate authorities and to encourage success on the other two fronts as well.</P>
        <P>I refer to Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposal regarding the difficulties we are in as a country and the challenges we face.  We are in extraordinary times which deserve an extraordinary reaction and response.  Many support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s view that we should not take a break for the period involved given the challenges with which we are currently faced and this is my view as well.  Equally, I maintain there is no point in saying we will sit unless we have a meaningful agenda on how to best address the challenges facing the country.  I refer to a point I have raised here on many occasions, that is, there should be all party and Leader agreement on such issues, they should be tabled well in advance and everyone should contribute in a meaningful and positive way.  This is how the public expects us to respond to such challenges.</P>
        <P>I refer to the comments of Senator Coghlan with regard to SMEs and moneys made available by the two main banks, namely, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.  I support the view that it is easy for banks to give to good, viable businesses.  The issue is that risk takers also require support.  Most importantly, the equity requirement must be played down rather than played up, which the banks are doing at present.  Will the Leader table a discussion later this year on supports by Government for SMEs?</P>

	<P>I did not get an opportunity to put on the Order Paper the motion, promised yesterday, on the application of the guillotine to debates on legislation.  It is probably as well to take time to consider the matter.  I advise colleagues that the following motion will be on the Order Paper in the autumn: &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that Committee Stage debates on legislation should not be curtailed by time limits, save where exceptional and emergency circumstances arise and where such circumstances are put to the Seanad for consideration.&rdquo;  There is no need to repeat what I stated yesterday other than to say I believe we took a wrong step.</P>

	<P>I trust parties will consider their position in respect of this issue.  I refer to the quarterly report of the ESRI.  One awaits its quarterly reports in the way in which one anticipates a ghost story.  Today&rsquo;s headline that 120,000 people will leave the country by the end of 2011 is stirring and disturbing.  In the coming months our motto should be to bring those people back home as soon as possible.  There are positives.  A total of 1.9 million are working, 500,000 more than at the beginning of the Celtic tiger period, but only by being willing <Col N="505"/>to make the hard choices in the coming months and keep to the programme on which we have embarked will we have any hope of bringing them home.  We have to focus, therefore, on competitiveness, bringing down the cost of doing business and efficiencies in the semi-State sector.  When we have debates in the coming months on the hard choices that must be made, let us think of the people we want to bring back home as soon as possible because if we are sincere about doing this, we will be ready to make the hard choices.</P>
        <P>I commend the Irish Missionary Union which, among others, has brought to our attention the plight of asylum seekers in Mosney, County Meath.  When one thinks of people being forced to relocate against their will without consultation or consideration of their individual needs from a place in which they have been based for the past five years, one thinks of the gulags and China preparing for the Olympic Games.</P>

	<P>Earlier we received indications from ESRI representatives about what they believe might happen to the structural deficit.  Its presentation as a <i>fait accompli </i>by the Opposition is typical.  The reality is EUROSTAT decides what will happen, not the ESRI.  It has been universally accepted, other than by the Opposition, that the way the economy has been managed is the best means of restoring prosperity to the county.  There are good news stories, but to present this one as a <i>fait accompli</i> and being the final word which is always negative is simplistic.  We need a debate on the economy to tease out the issues involved, not to look at this in the context of a good bank, bad bank or whatever Fianna F&aacute;il brings forward is wrong and whatever the Opposition will do will be right.  It is not as simple as that; tough decisions were made.</P>

	<P>Last week I asked the Leader about proposed legislation relating to on-line betting.  It is imperative that the companies involved are brought into the tax net as a matter of urgency.  The Taoiseach gave an indication that such legislation would be introduced before the summer, but we have not seen it.  I do not know whether the Leader has found out what the position is since last week, but I would appreciate it if he could find out as soon as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Hanafin mentioned the benefits of Government policy.  The benefits will result in 120,000 of our young people emigrating by the end of 2011 owing to the policies Fianna F&aacute;il and its coalition partners have implemented in the past ten years.  Unfortunately, our young people are reaping the reward &mdash; emigration.  Everything we do in government and opposition should be geared towards the creation of jobs in the next few years.  That should be the policy of every party; we should work together to ensure we can provide employment for all those who wish to work.  That should be our aim.  I, therefore, urge the Government parties to get together with the other parties.  They have taken on board some policies advocated by Fine Gael, with which we have no problem.  We will introduce more policies and will be delighted <Col N="506"/>if the Government parties take a leaf from our book.  I urge everyone to focus on the issue of job creation in the coming months.</P>

        <P>Earlier I listened to the debate on the ESRI report which made gloomy reading.  However, I compliment the Taoiseach on his efforts to implement a strategy to create initiatives between Ireland and the United States.  I hope that will prove more fruitful in the coming months.  I have problems with the phrase &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo;.  I do not know what it means, but it probably means knowledge and so forth.  We need to have a major debate on how educational institutions are linked with the business world in order that they can have a vision for the future and establish where jobs might be created.  The issue of how we keep our young people in jobs and can manage to bring those who have emigrated back should be at the forefront of the debate in the autumn.  We need to constantly discuss how best to move forward.  There is no absolute solution and there are no fixed ideas.  What one says today might be wrong next month.  Nobody has a panacea, but let us do everything we can to create an atmosphere in which jobs can be created.  I would like to discuss these issues time and again when we resume in the autumn.</P>

	<P>This is the final day of the summer session and I would like to respond to the allegations that have been continually made by Opposition Members about the Government&rsquo;s lack of interest in job creation.  I attended the launch of a new business park initiative at Ireland West International Airport, Knock, County Mayo last Monday which was attended by other Oireachtas and council representatives.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation made it clear that the entire focus of Government policy was on job creation.  The Taoiseach is in America trying to attract jobs.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport hit the ground running when she took over her brief.  More than 250,000 people are employed in the tourism industry and she has encouraged the businesses involved to maintain and increase the number of jobs.  The Minister for Social Protection also hit the ground running and will launch an expansion of the social employment scheme during the summer.  If Opposition Members want to make accusations &mdash; they are entitled to make political charges &mdash; it is important, as Senator Hanafin and others said, to indicate that the focus of the Government, now that there is financial and fiscal stability following its good efforts in the past 18 months, is exclusively on job creation.  As a former emigrant, I bemoan the fact that the ESRI should run lurid headlines that 120,000 people will emigrate.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Walsh, Buttimer, Cummins, Ormonde and Mooney expressed serious concern about the challenges facing the Government in job creation.  I join Senators in wishing the Taoiseach well.  As Senators Mooney and Hanafin said, the Government&rsquo;s top priority is job creation and the Taoiseach is doing <Col N="507"/>everything he can.  The new Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has attended the House to outline the current position.  I wish them well in what they are trying to achieve.  I also join Senator Hanafin in welcoming the announcement by Tesco of 750 new jobs.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan asked about the Dublin mayor Bill.  The up-to-date position is that the Bill is at an advanced stage and will be published in the late summer or early autumn.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Coghlan, Mullen, Walsh and Hanafin commented on the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Finance that &euro;6 billion would be invested in SMEs in the next two years.  This is the start of getting cash flowing again in the private sector.  I wholeheartedly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement.  I am surprised there was little mention by Members of this significant press conference yesterday.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the Minister for Finance told the people how rigid they will be in monitoring the distribution of this &euro;6 billion per year over the next two years.</P>
        <P>On the ESRI report, it is important we have these reports from time to time.  I look forward to the announcement to be made by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on training and upskilling and agree with that aspect of the report.  However, I remind Members of previous ESRI reports and urge them to recall those of early 2007 when all the party manifestos were being fine tuned and of how out of touch it was in its projections then.  Perhaps it is also out of touch in certain areas with this latest report.  We welcome the hard work being done by the ESRI, its expertise and its projections.  I fully agree with its recommendations on training, but point out that as far as our finances are concerned, the most important factor currently is the international and global market and how it views us.  The order of the day for us must be to do whatever must be done to ensure we hold the confidence of the international market.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh welcomed RTE&rsquo;s excellent and outstanding programme last night on the Dublin bombings.  I agree with his sentiments on that.  Senator Buttimer spoke about the appointment of board members.  As we all know, appointments to boards are made by the Government, on the recommendation, in most cases, of Ministers.

When we visited the University of Waterloo campus in Canada a few years ago, significant research was being done by one of the major suppliers on emissions from mobile phone earpieces.  I would like to assist the House with regard to a debate on this in the autumn.  Senator Daly also raised the issue of car hire insurance, particularly as it relates to airports.  He expressed his horror at and his <Col N="508"/>experience of the overcharging that takes place.  There is a procedure for reporting overcharging and the company involved.  I will pass the Senator&rsquo;s comments on to the Minister with responsibility for tourism.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn suggested we should be like the UK and give doctors rather than administrators responsibility for patient care.  I will pass his views on to the Minister.  It seems like a common sense and reasonable request.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly spoke about the difficulties faced by medical card holders in obtaining dental care.  I have no difficulty with arranging a debate on that in the future.</P>
        <P>Senators Mary White, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, Callely and Ormonde spoke about the proposals for dealing with the 32 people affected by thalidomide.  I compliment Senator Mary White on the great work she is doing with regard to the advances announced yesterday and the other outstanding issues.  The Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, has a caring attitude towards these unfortunate people.  I hope the extra step can be taken to bring the situation to a successful conclusion.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen spoke about the Irish Missionary Union at Mosney and I will pass his strong views on to the Minister.  Senator Cummins asked for up to date information on the issue of Internet on-line betting.  I will get back to the Senator later this afternoon on that matter.</P>

    <Title>Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It was with great sadness that we learned of the death of a former Deputy, Senator and Lord Mayor of Dublin, our former Senator, Joe Doyle, who passed away on 8 August 2009.  I wish to express my sincere condolences on behalf of the House to his much loved wife Peggy and his three children, David, Michael and R&oacute;is&iacute;n.</P>
        <P>Joe&rsquo;s career as a public representative spanned four decades, from when he was first elected to Dublin City Council in 1979, where he continued to serve until 2004.  One of his proudest moments was when he was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin, the city he loved so much, in July 1998 with the support of the Fianna F&aacute;il group on the council at the time.  During his time in office, he conferred the freedom of the city on another famous Dub, Gay Byrne.  Joe was first elected to the D&aacute;il in February 1982, on his third attempt, with running mate Dr. Garret FitzGerald, where he served until 1987 when he was elected to the Seanad.  He was re-elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1989, where he continued to serve until 1992, when he returned to the Seanad to serve a further two terms.</P>
        <P>Joe was an outstanding public representative as we all know.  He was an excellent parliamentarian who will be sadly missed by the constituents of Dublin South-East and, in particular, the parishioners of Donnybrook, whom he represented so well in the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and on Dublin City Council.  He was, without doubt, a dedicated public servant, a man who never looked for any recognition but who was, without doubt, deserving of it.  He spent his whole life, which was underpinned by his great faith, in the service of others.  Joe lived all his life in the parish of Donnybrook.  He was baptised in the Sacred Heart Church in Donnybrook, was married in that church and served as a sacristan there for 29 years.  He only gave up his job when he became a Deputy in 1982.  He was also a member of the Dublin Diocesan Pilgrimage to Lourdes for over 50 years, for which he was awarded a medal by the diocese.  Such was his faith and his love of Lourdes, that he and his wife Peggy celebrated a very special wedding anniversary there before his death.</P><Col N="509"/>
        <P>Throughout his life, Joe was also a wonderful advocate for people with epilepsy and used every opportunity to raise awareness of this condition.  For many years he was Ireland&rsquo;s best known champion of the cause of epilepsy and was always keen to speak publicly about the condition he developed at the age of 16 years.  During his time as Lord Mayor of Dublin, he hosted official functions in the Mansion House for Brainwave and was a member of the group&rsquo;s board of directors for more than 20 years, where he served the cause of epilepsy with as much dedication as he served his fellow parishioners and constituents in Dublin South-East.</P>
        <P>On my behalf and on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I offer our sincere condolences to Joe&rsquo;s wife Peggy, his sons David and Michael, his daughter R&oacute;is&iacute;n, his grandchildren, his sisters Maeve and Rita and his extended family and friends at this sad time.</P>
        <P>I had the great pleasure of serving in this House with Joe for the 12 years he was a Member here.  I was a close personal friend of his and his wife, Peggy, for all of those years.  He was a true gentleman, a wonderful husband, a great father and a proud grandad.  He was a hard working and decent public representative.  He was a man of great honour and integrity.  Go nd&eacute;ana Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the family of the late Deputy, Senator and Lord Mayor of Dublin, Joe Doyle.  I welcome, in particular, his wife, Peggy; his daughter, R&oacute;is&iacute;n; and his son, Michael.  Our thoughts are with David in Singapore.  I also welcome members of the extended families of Joe and Peggy.  No doubt Joe is looking down with a wry smile at these proceedings.</P>
        <P>Joe was an excellent parliamentarian, an outstanding public representative and a man of deep conviction, faith and integrity.  He was a wonderful family man.  He served his constituents as a member of Dublin City Council with real devotion and hard work for 25 years.  He listened to everybody who came to see him in his clinics and worked as hard as he could on every issue brought to his attention.  He was a Member of the D&aacute;il from 1982 until 1987 and a Member of this House from 1987 to 1989 and again from 1992 until 2002.  This is a record of service which is unrivalled and of which Joe&rsquo;s family, friends and supporters can be truly proud.</P>
        <P>Outside political life, as Senator Cassidy said, Joe served his parish as clerk at the Church of the Sacred Heart in Donnybrook for almost 30 years, a real centre of his and his family&rsquo;s life.</P>
        <P>I knew Joe very well.  From the first moment I met him, I found him to be an absolute gentleman.  In all my dealings with him he was a complete gentleman, totally committed to Fine Gael, a man of values and conviction and very hard working and consistent.  I have no doubt that his convictions and faith and the support of his family enabled him to deal with the ups and downs of political life.  The constituency of Dublin South-East is volatile, one in which there have been plenty of ups and downs, but Joe survived and thrived and went on to continue to serve the people of Dublin South-East.  One of the reasons he was able to do this was he was a politician who always took the long view and his vision helped him in that regard, as was evident during his time as Lord Mayor of Dublin, which honour came to him unexpectedly &mdash; I think Peggy will agree &mdash; but it was one of the honours of his life.  He loved the job which he really enjoyed; he brought many people to the Mansion House and was extremely honoured to have been elected to the position.  It was one of the highlights of his political career.</P>
        <P>During his time inside and outside the Oireachtas Joe worked very hard at raising awareness of epilepsy.  He was a man who embraced hard work which was very evident in his personal efforts when he went to study at night in UCD.  Many Members of the House will also fondly remember his love of the horses and dogs.  He certainly got great enjoyment from his pastimes and interests and was an enthusiastic member of the Oireachtas racing syndicate.</P><Col N="510"/>
        <P>To his wife, Peggy; his children, David, Michael and R&oacute;is&iacute;n; his wider circle of family and friends, many of whom join us today, I formally extend my most sincere sympathy on their great loss.  I know that Joe&rsquo;s faith and their own will have sustained them during the past year and will sustain them into the future.  It is difficult to believe he is not with us today.  I thank his family for sharing him with the constituency of Dublin South-East, this and the other House and the country.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I speak on behalf of Members on the Independent benches who wish to be associated with all that has been said in tribute to the late Joe Doyle with whom I served in the Seanad.  He was a Member of the other House for a brief period from 1987 and left the Seanad in 2002.  At all times I found him to be a generous, open and humorous man.  He was a great man to make a cutting comment out of the side of his mouth because he was never quite sure about what Independent Members should do, whether they should join a party or go about their business and leave matters to real politicians.  He had extraordinary passion, of which I am sure his family are aware.  The best politicians are the ones with conviction and passion, whatever the issues of the day.  He had that passion for his area and the city.  I recall a time when the Dodder flooded and he was so upset at the damage caused by the flooding to people&rsquo;s property in the area in which he lived.  He was their representative; he was part of and suffered with them.  He was a gorgeous man in that regard.  He was a man of conviction and devoted to his church.  As mentioned, Lourdes was always on the agenda; it was his other home, as he was always trotting over and back, but his real commitment was to his people.  </P>
        <P>Joe raised health issues and, in particular, awareness of epilepsy, a condition which used to be hidden.  A lot has happened since in that regard.  While Joe was a Member of the Oireachtas the issue was dealt with in a much more open way and received public recognition.  He deserves credit for being part of that movement.</P>
        <P>Joe was honest, diligent, humorous and gentle.  He said many times in the House that he had been a Deputy, a Senator and a member of the city council but that the pinnacle of his political career was being elected Lord Mayor of his city.  That is important in this day and age when local politics is often demeaned.  He carried that sense of being a true democrat, a true representative.</P>
        <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Fitzgerald and share in what will be said by other speakers.  We thank his family for being supportive of him and enabling him take on the very important role in politics of representing the people of his area.  Without that commitment, without people like him, politics would die a death and be all the poorer.  At the time of his death one of the local priests commented that he had had no enemies.  It struck me that this was a beautiful, personable and attractive epitaph for anybody to be given and that it had been truly well earned.</P>
        <P>Joe&rsquo;s dark side was mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald &mdash; he was a horse racing enthusiast.  He was a member of the syndicate which owned the highly successful Arctic Copper.  As soon as he saw that the horse had run its race, he walked away from the syndicate and said, &ldquo;You can have the rest of it, lads.&rdquo;  I think they had no luck after that.</P>
        <P>This is a day on which we thank Joe&rsquo;s family for sharing a lovely man with us.  He was a man of conviction and passionate about his work, politics and party.  We say goodbye him today.  Ar dheis De go raibh a anam.  Duine den scoth.  I echo the words of Senator Fitzgerald: he was a true blue, with Fine Gael blood flowing through his veins and he never moved from that side.  He is man of whom his family can be proud.  It was a privilege for us to have known and worked with him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I join others in paying tribute to the late Joe Doyle, a former Deputy and Senator.  I note the presence of members of his family.  I convey my sympathy to the Fine Gael Party on the loss of a truly great representative.  He was a local representative, a Member of the Oireachtas and Lord Mayor of Dublin.  </P>
        <P>As I am a latecomer to this business, I did not know Joe as a politician.  However, I knew him in a previous life when I worked in RTE and have two memories of him.  He gave an interview on the subject of epilepsy &mdash; it may have been one of the first key interviews he gave.  If I am not mistaken, he took part in a lengthy interview with Gay Byrne.  I am not sure if I was involved in programme, but as others have said, it was a groundbreaking interview in which he spoke about and helped to demystify the subject of epilepsy.  He is owed a huge debt in that regard.</P>
        <P>The second memory of him is his involvement with a programme with which I was involved.  He was closely involved in the programme but did not appear on the programme.  It was the morning after his election in the general election in 1989.  On one telephone line we had Garret FitzGerald and on the other line we had a certain Michael McDowell, who had just lost his seat to Joe Doyle.  It was an interesting moment because in the course of the general election, Garret FitzGerald had been extraordinarily generous to Joe Doyle.  He urged supporters not to vote for him but to vote for Joe Doyle, something other politicians have done with varying degrees of success.  The tactic succeeded on that occasion and a former close confidant of Garret FitzGerald, Michael McDowell, lost his seat.  The interview amounted to the former Taoiseach saying this was nothing personal, just business.  It was a wonderful moment.</P>
        <P>Joe Doyle was an extraordinary gentlemen.  That was my lasting memory on the one or two occasions I met him.  He was a real Dubliner with a great sense of the city and where he was from.  Joe Doyle will feature when we look back on the past 30 years of change.  Regarding the debate on contraception and divorce, he took a very strong position.  One quotation from him resonates today with regard to the debate we have had in this House over the past ten days.  He appealed for generosity from those would never want a divorce towards those who were not so lucky because &ldquo;life is difficult and stubborn and does not work out as people planned&rdquo;.  That is an extraordinarily generous statement about politics and what politics is about.  We can have convictions and consciences but the greater calling and demand of politics and democracy is that we have a country that is a warm place for all its citizens.  His contribution to public life went a long way with others to ensure Ireland became a warmer place for many people.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, I wish to be associated with these expressions of sympathy on the death of the former Senator, Deputy and Lord Mayor of Dublin, Joe Doyle.  His period of the time in the Houses of the Oireachtas ended as mine began but I recall his period as Lord Mayor of Dublin, which seemed to be the pinnacle of his career and a period he enjoyed greatly.  I also remember the 1989 election, where there was a Fine Gael strategy to win two seats in the Dublin South-East constituency.  This almost came unstuck in that Joe Doyle was comfortably elected and the fourth seat was won by Garret FitzGerald.  Fifth place went not to Michael McDowell of the Progressive Democrats but to John Gormley of the Green Party, to whom Garret FitzGerald almost lost his seat.  Joe Doyle also played a role in slowing down the progress of the Green Party in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I join in the welcome to Peggy, Michael and R&oacute;is&iacute;n and to send our good wishes, as Senator Fitzgerald said, to David in Singapore.  I welcome the extended Maguire family, all of Joe&rsquo;s in-laws.  Joe&rsquo;s wife, Peggy, is a native of my area.  She is a near neighbour of mine at home and in our area we took great pride in Joe&rsquo;s lifetime of achievements.  We took as much pride as the people of Donnybrook and we followed his career with a similar level of interest.  Joe was a regular visitor to events in our area and his friendly nature made him known to all of us and the extended area.  He was known to people of all traditions and all parties.  He holidayed in the area regularly.  I am privileged to be here and to be associated with these remarks.</P>
        <P>He was a councillor, Senator, Deputy and Lord Mayor of Dublin city.  That is some chronicle of achievement on a career level.  The pinnacle of his achievements and the success he took most personal pride in was becoming Lord Mayor of the capital city.  This was an enormous achievement and he was very proud of it.  Along with my wife and family, I had the great privilege of being a guest of Joe and Peggy in the Mansion House.  On the day in question, we were slightly embarrassed because our child was fascinated by the cat and spent the entire visit chasing around the room after it.  We were slightly embarrassed with the breach of protocol in the Mansion House but the Doyle family did not have a problem.  He had a wonderful record of achievement.</P>
        <P>He would want to be remembered for, and I would prefer to address, something very different.  He should be remembered for his personal qualities and it is from this we should draw inspiration.  He was a gentleman by nature, he had a lovely, friendly demeanour and was an accessible person at ease with people.  He was one of nature&rsquo;s gentlemen and that is not a clich&eacute; or a trite remark.  He was an absolute gentleman with a friendly demeanour and was extremely sincere and impeccably honest.  One could never doubt his sincerity.</P>
        <P>He was a man of sound values and had firm beliefs that he lived out in his life.  He was a man of deep conviction and sound values.  He had great commitment to his family and his community.  He was a spiritual and a religious man.  Lourdes was his second home.</P>
        <P>As a Cavan person, where his wife is from and where he spent so much time, we are proud of his memory and proud of his achievements.  I am very happy on behalf of the community of Cavan to associate myself with the sympathy and to pass our sympathies to Peggy and the family.  He was one of nature&rsquo;s gentlemen and we are the poorer for his passing but we will not be poorer if we learn and live according to the life.

	<P>I could see Joe Doyle chuckling when he was credited with slowing down the progress of the Green Party.  I say that in jest.  Joe was a real Dubliner, a gentleman and a friend.  He was elected to Dublin City Council in 1979, the same year I was elected to Waterford City Council.  The highlight of his career was being the first citizen of the city he loved so well, our capital city.  Joe was a man of deep faith, a true Christian and the sacristan at his parish Church of the Sacred Heart.  He knew everyone in Donnybrook and around his constituency on a first name basis.  That is the sign of a true politician.  I shared many hours of entertainment with him on his Seanad campaigns in Waterford with his friend, the former Deputy and Senator, Dick Dowling.  We shared a love of horses and having an occasional bet and we certainly enjoyed one another&rsquo;s company on many occasions.  I extend <Col N="513"/>my sincere sympathy to Peggy and all the family.  Today is an occasion on which Members celebrate the life of Mr. Joe Doyle, a man who gave so much to his community and to his people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words in tribute to my former friend and colleague, Mr. Joe Doyle.  I had the privilege of serving in both Houses with Joe and my relationship with him was a little deeper than the normal political relationship, in that we both shared political careers and an office for quite a number of years.  During the first Seanad in which I served, from 1987 to 1989, Joe, a few colleagues and I had offices outside the main complex of Leinster House at the fashionable Dublin address of 89 Merrion Street, which certainly impressed my rural neighbours and friends.  In that suite of offices, which we shared with the then Deputy Brendan McGahon, the then Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad, Charles McDonald, who had a working fireplace in his office, as well as new Senators such as the then Senators Gerry Reynolds and Phil Hogan, we spent many enjoyable hours and days.</P>
        <P>Joe took his politics very seriously.  He did so with a smile but he was a man of deep conviction and profound ability.  The first piece of political advice and education that I saw and heard from Joe was with regard to the twice-weekly clinic he operated from 89 Merrion Street.  For my first few weeks there, I could not understand the reason a succession of citizens of Dublin were calling to our office but they were calling to meet Joe.  While Joe represented a constituency that he shared with people of greater national renown and publicity, I always got the impression that he was the man in the constituency who did the work.  This was proven in 1989, when he was re-elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the strength of his constituency work, as well as his love of his people, his city and his constituency.  He knew every square inch of that constituency, from Donnybrook to Ringsend and to Pearse Street, and felt equally at home in each part of it.  This summed him up, as he genuinely was a man for all political seasons.</P>
        <P>He was a man with a great depth of interests.  Mention has been made of his sporting involvement in horses and greyhounds but he also enjoyed a sport that was a minority interest in this House, namely, cricket.  I recall that when the then Taoiseach, John Bruton, hosted a visit to Dublin by the then British Prime Minister, John Major, in 1995 or 1996, he brought Mr. Major to Doheny and Nesbitt&rsquo;s for a post-meeting drink.  There was Joe, who had been lined up to discuss cricket with the Prime Minister, because he probably was the only member of the Fine Gael Party who could have a rational discussion on cricket.</P>
        <P>He also had a wide range of friends in Leinster House.  While everyone knows of his friends in Fine Gael, he had a very deep friendship with Members&rsquo; former colleague in the other House, the late Tony Gregory.  Moreover, Joe&rsquo;s admiration for Tony was reciprocated fully.  He also had a great friend in Fine Gael&rsquo;s new Front Bench colleague, Deputy Andrew Doyle, and they travelled to many health board meetings together.  He built up all those relationships because of the depth of his character and because of the strength of his political soul.  He was a genuinely unique person and I always will recall vividly the Monday in June 1998 when he rang me at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. to let me know that as a result of a bizarre political fluke and breakdown in other parties&rsquo; negotiations, he was about to become Lord Mayor of Dublin.  I could literally feel the excitement down the telephone line because the honour of being first citizen of the city he loved so deeply was about to be bestowed on him.  Moreover, he carried out his duties in a magnificent fashion.</P>
        <P>I have all these pleasant memories of Joe and Members have given an account in the Chamber of his political philosophy, his deep Christianity and his belief in the philosophy of live and let live.  He was an outstanding ambassador for Fine Gael in both the city and the country and its members deeply and fondly remember him.  While I apologise for drifting on a little, I will provide a final anecdote.  Mention was made of the 1989 election when Joe and <Col N="514"/>Garret FitzGerald won, perhaps against the odds, two out of four seats.  Joe told the story with great relish of an evening two or three days before the general election when, while he was out canvassing and knocking on doors in a very committed fashion, a black former State car suddenly screeched to a halt beside him.  It was Garret FitzGerald, who exited breathlessly from the car to tell Joe that he had conducted an opinion poll and that Joe had been elected on the fourth count.  Although the election was still two days away, it looked as though the election could be called off and they all went off to have a nice drink.</P>
        <P>I am proud to have had this opportunity to pay tribute to him and am proud that we shared offices together.  He will be long remembered in this party.  May he rest in peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to be associated with the warm and genuine tribute to Joe.  He was a great Donnybrook man and quintessential Dubliner with whom I served in this House from 1997 to 2002.  He always sat in the outer chair in the front row of the Fine Gael benches and the then Senator Maurice Manning referred to him reverentially as the chancellor.  Consequently, that seat became known as the chancellor&rsquo;s seat as it was where Joe always sat.  As has been stated earlier, Joe had no enemies and I believe this is the reason he became Lord Mayor of Dublin, an office which he really prized and which probably was the pinnacle of his career.  All Members have lovely stories about Joe about which they could go on but I will not do that.  The point that summed him up is that he truly was a lovely man.  To Peggy and all of his family, Members extend their sympathy.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with my colleagues in expressing sympathy to Peggy, R&oacute;is&iacute;n, Michael, David and the extended family.  I got to know Joe pretty well over the years.  As Senator Cummins mentioned, he was a lifelong great political friend of my neighbour and political mentor, Dick Dowling.  They shared many interests, as well as sharing an office, for a long time.  On my first day as a Senator after the 2002 Seanad election, the House was recalled early to pass the legislation to hold the referendum for the first Nice treaty.  I was given a slot to speak at approximately 4 p.m., and as a result I missed my conferring ceremony in Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT.  I drove down late and my family gave out to me for missing the entire ceremony.  However, the institute allowed me to return to be conferred either the next day or the next week.  While I did not know anyone else who was graduating, Jill and Peggy were present at the back of the room as their daughter was receiving her qualification from WIT on the same day.  It is rather ironic that Members are paying tribute to Joe on the same day because although I have not pursued any studies in the meantime until recently, I am going to be awarded something today.</P>
        <P>Joe is fondly remembered and the staff of Leinster House still have a great regard for Joe Doyle.  Many of the secretarial staff within Fine Gael worked with Joe over the years and I spoke to a couple of them this morning over a cup of tea.  They knew this tribute was planned and spoke with great fondness of the little events organised by Joe, Dick Dowling, Madeleine Taylor-Quinn, Bernard Durkan and Professor John Kelly.  They were the first group of Oireachtas Members who took it upon themselves to bring their secretaries out to thank them for the efforts they put in on their behalf.  Moreover, most of these secretaries are still here and they hold him in great affection.  I remember the last time I met Joe was at the front door of Leinster House a few years ago.  We had a discussion about his time in politics and how he was so delighted to end his political career in Leinster House as spokesperson on finance.  He gave me a few tips because it was the position that I held at that particular juncture.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White mentioned the 1989 election in his contribution and I always will remember how Joe and Garret pulled off the great coup in Dublin South-East.  I believe it was Joe who subsequently said it was the closest Garret had ever come in his political career to committing a <Col N="515"/>sin, when he took such a relish in the defeat of the former leader of the Progressive Democrats in that election.</P>
      
        <P>Joe was the quintessential Fine Gaeler.  He represented a strain of Fine Gael in which I believe passionately.  His legacy will remain strong in the party for many years.  I extend to Peggy and her family my sincere sympathy on their sad loss.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Although Senator O&rsquo;Toole has spoken on behalf of the Independent group, I request that I be allowed to speak because I am essentially from the same parish as the late Joe Doyle.  I spent my childhood and young manhood in Dublin 4.  I was an Anglican and Joe a Roman Catholic.  He was very heavily involved in the Sacred Heart Church, which many of my neighbours attended.  I went every week to St. Mary&rsquo;s Church at the junction of Anglesea Road and Simmonscourt Road when I was not singing in the choir at St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Church.  We shared that Dublin 4 background.</P>
        <P>Joe was a very interesting person in the sense that he understood Dublin 4, a much misunderstood region of Dublin.  While it is assumed it conforms to the stereotype associated with wealthy people on Ailesbury Road and media conspiracy, Joe knew it intimately because he represented it.  Dublin 4 includes areas such as Ailesbury Road, but it also includes Dodder Cottages, Pembroke Cottages, Ringsend and Irishtown.  Joe represented the entire complexion of the constituency with great honour and dignity.</P>
        <P>I  knew Joe for many years.  I knew him when he was a member of the city council, Lord Mayor of Dublin and in the Seanad.  I knew him, liked him, respected him and honoured him.  He adhered to very high standards of general and political morality.  He was a great Dubliner and also sacristan at the Sacred Heart Church in Donnybrook in which I attended the funeral of Brendan Behan, whom I knew slightly.  Joe had been Brendan Behan&rsquo;s best man at his marriage and knew Brendan and Beatrice when they lived on Anglesea Road.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As a member of the Roman Catholic Church, Joe was a deep and devout believer, but he was able to separate this very clear commitment from his commitment to politics.  He was able to make the separation between church and State.  When he was working in the House, voting and campaigning, he remembered the people in his constituency who did not share the entirety of the Roman Catholic theological position on various contentious political issues.  I refer, in particular, to various very divisive referenda.  Joe was a man of conscience.  As we have heard a lot about conscience in recent weeks, I will not comment on it, but Joe had a real political conscience.  Although he was a good and religious man in good standing with his church, he held the line on these contentious issues.  He found that he was representing the full and complex nature of his background and constituents.  For this, in particular, I honour him.  I wish we had more politics of the kind Joe espoused, although I am glad to say events in recent weeks have shown these standards are widespread, at least in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Nevertheless, in those early difficult days Joe behaved very honourably and I know he was abused for adopting this position.  I not only knew, liked and honoured Joe, I also respected him.</P>

I did not know him personally but know from what my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and other colleagues have said that he was an honest, decent, hard working and Christian man.  He was obviously very astute in that he married a Cavan woman, Peggy Maguire.  While I do not know Peggy, I know members of the Maguire family which is well respected in County Cavan.

	<P>I am privileged to have the opportunity to join my colleagues in saying a few words about the late Joe Doyle.  I got to know him many years ago when we worked on the city council; I got to know him in this House also.  When we were councillors, somebody referred to the election of the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  When Joe was running for election, the Fianna F&aacute;il group met and I was very privileged to be able to second a proposal to back him.  The reasons given by all the members which I remember well were that he was straight up and fair, that he got on well with people and that there were no corners to him.  In other words, he was the person to back.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know Peggy Doyle.  My father rang me one day and asked me to give Joe a vote in the Seanad elections.  I could not understand how my father knew him.  He said he was buying a lot of stuff from the Maguires and that they had asked him.  I said it was okay.  I met Joe afterwards.</P>
        <P>Joe had a unique personality and took a keen interest in people and the community.  There were four parish priests in Donaghmede where I lived and every one of them asked me whether I knew Joe Doyle.  I discovered they had all worked in Donnybrook and they told me Joe ran the parish, not the parish priest.</P>
        <P>Joe gave me a bit of advice one day.  There was somebody arguing about something and he said to me that in our business one should not make enemies but friends.</P>
        <P>Joe had a great hearty laugh.  He had a few glasses of gin and tonic on occasion and would tell a yarn.  His hearty laugh is still embedded in my mind.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris mentioned conscience.  Joe had the idea that one should not do the popular thing.  One day there was a very contentious planning application from a developer and everybody was being lobbied thereon.  The residents were lobbying against it.  It was pretty rough and they were picketing outside City Hall saying &ldquo;Joe Doyle out&rdquo; and such comments.  It emerged that a casting vote was required.  Joe used his casting vote in favour of the application because he believed it was right to do so.  That was how he operated.  He asked me one day not to do what I perceived to be popular because it would backfire eventually and the people would see through it.</P>
        <P>Somebody referred this morning to not going on holidays.  I remember Joe talking about this.  He told me he could not wait to get out of here and that the rest of the Senators thought the same only that they were trying to play politics.  He said the public would not give them any credit for this and that everyone went on holidays, loved a drink and to get out of here for some rest.</P>
        <P>With regard to the planning application to which I referred, it turned out that Joe had done the right thing.  There is not a word about it now and everybody thinks the development in question is great.</P>
        <P>These are a few of the memories I have about Joe.  I extend my sympathy to Joe&rsquo;s family at this late stage.  I come from the same part of the country and remember the <i>Anglo Celt</i>.  Somebody asked me one day who Joe Doyle was on account of him being mentioned in it every week, more often than local politicians.  Joe used to frequent and enjoy the area.

	<P>I did not know Joe Doyle in his political capacity as Senator, mayor or Deputy and I never got to know him personally, but I knew him from attending mass in <Col N="517"/>Donnybrook when I lived in the area in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  He was always on duty in the church.  I was never conscious of the priest being at the church door, since it was always Joe who was there.  I never spoke with him, but he engaged with everyone he met.  He had an extraordinary gift of connecting with and smiling at each person he met.  It is no wonder he was a successful politician, given that human touch.  Every time I saw him, my imagination ran wild because he was the one who stepped in at the last minute as best man at the wedding of Brendan and Beatrice Behan.  I could never imagine how a wedding could be so chaotic as to require the sacristan to step in.  In this sense, he was an exotic figure.</P>
        <P>As a young person, I was conscious of him as being a real politician on the ground.  He dealt with local issues and looked after everyone in the area.  As the other side of the House did, I compliment Mrs. Peggy Doyle on the 100% support she gave her husband.  He could not have done what he did with her total support.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me this opportunity.</P>

	<P>I wish to add to the tributes to the late Joe Doyle.  Long before I became a politician, I knew about Joe from my late uncle, who also lived in Donnybrook and was a good friend of Joe.  I have a sneaking feeling that, when the election came, that is where the vote went, but we were never told about it.  Subsequently, I got to know Joe as a politician.  While I did not have many conversations with him in the Seanad, he and I used to meet and have conversations in the local bank that continued out onto the footpath.  Our conversations sorted out many issues of the day.  Joe had his views, but we were often in total agreement on how to solve a problem.</P>
        <P>I knew Joe as a Donnybrook person.  Joe was Donnybrook and Donnybrook was Joe, something that was reflected in how everyone in Donnybrook knew him.  He was a good person and a great politician.  As some Senators stated, he was able to interact with all of his constituents.  Seeing him at work was lovely.  He was a good church person who was devoted to his Sunday mass duties.</P>
        <P>We have lovely memories of Joe.  I miss him around the place, such as in the vegetable shop.  I do not see Peggy in the shop anymore, but I hope to see her there again soon.  I am glad of this opportunity to pay tribute to Joe and to extend my sympathy to Peggy and all his family.  He was a lovely man in my eyes.  My family in Donnybrook would say the same.</P>

	<P>I pay tribute to Joe Doyle.  I was his vice chairman on the eastern regional health authority, ERHA.  He was an outstanding chairman who did considerable work in delivering health services to the greater Dublin region.  He was the consummate politician and achieved everything in the political scene.  He was a councillor, lord mayor, Deputy and Senator who held various positions and chairs and delivered services to the people of Dublin who he represented.  He was an outstanding man and a great friend who I miss.</P>
        <P>Peggy is a fantastic woman who supported Joe in everything he did.  He and I used to meet at the various functions he chaired and officiated over.  Seeing him doing the job he loved so well was great.  He did a significant amount for epilepsy during his time on the ERHA.  He should be remembered and congratulated in that regard.  He made it clear he was an epileptic.  My son suffered from that disease, so Joe and I used to chat about it often.  However, he never allowed epilepsy to interfere with his work and was positive at all times.</P>
        <P>I extend my sympathy to Peggy and her family.  A great loss to us all, Joe was a good friend and a real gentleman.  I am sorry we have lost him, but I am delighted to have had the pleasure of working with him.</P>

	<P>I join with my colleagues in their expressions of sympathy on the death of Joe Doyle.  I salute the good life he lived.  It was my good fortune to enjoy his friendship and I have fond memories of him.  I first got to know him following my election to Dublin Corporation in 1985.  Even though we were on opposite political benches, he struck me during my early days as a warm, genuine and good man.  As most Senators know, various appointments to authorities were made within a few days of the election.  My good friend and colleague, Senator Butler, mentioned the ERHA, the predecessor of which was the eastern health board.  Joe and I were appointed to that board in 1985.  Following our membership of the corporation and the health board, Joe and I shared conversations three to four days per week.  We shared many common interests.  Joe influenced some of my decision making in my early days in politics.</P>
        <P>Arising from his childhood, he had a devoted love for his late mother, who was widowed at a young age.  He also had a deep faith, which reflected the life of my late father, a sacristan in our local church.  Joe and I shared common themes.  He would speak fondly of his childhood days in the cottages in Donnybrook.  If I remember correctly, his mother&rsquo;s landlord was a Jewish man for whom Joe had the height of regard.  Joe told me some great stories about that time in his life.</P>
        <P>Joe gave a significant commitment to Dublin Corporation, the eastern health board, the ERHA and both Houses.  In the passage of time, I also came to know his beautiful wife, Peggy, and had a great regard for the outstanding support she gave him and the manner in which he acknowledged it.  He was an extraordinary, kind and compassionate man who loved his family, city and constituents.  He had a particularly deeply felt social concern for the less well off in society who greatly benefited from Joe&rsquo;s input into this city.  This is a time to reflect, to mark the sad loss and celebrate the extraordinarily good and successful life of Joe Doyle.</P>

        <P>I got to know Joe through serving for a short period on the eastern region health authority and the east coast area health board with him.  In the latter case sometimes we would meet in south Dublin or Wicklow and when Peggy could not collect Joe, I would give him a lift home.  Colleagues have mentioned Joe&rsquo;s great hearty laugh and his great sense of humour.  Those car journeys would be filled with laughter as Joe recalled some funny event that had taken place during the week or in the course of the meeting.</P>
        <P>Those car journeys were also filled with stories about the wife that he loved deeply and the family he was so proud of.  In that context Joe would talk about any significant event that had happened at length on the journey home.  I will finish by saying that my abiding thought and appreciation of Joe will always be the very kind words and advice he gave to a young Fianna F&aacute;il councillor who was trying to find her feet.

	<P>I did not have the pleasure of serving in the Oireachtas with Joe, but I should like to offer a few words of tribute to him, and of sympathy to Peggy and the family, because he is a man who goes back a long way in my consciousness of politics.  I was in France last year doing some work with people from the Auvergne who told me, in great excitement, that the former Irish Prime Minister had been temporarily waylaid due to a swine &lsquo;flu scare.  In the course of getting in touch with Ireland as regards that, I was informed of the sad news of Joe&rsquo;s death.  He and his former constituency colleague were united in my mind, at that moment.</P>
        <P>One of my earliest lessons on the nature of party politics came in 1992 when then, as now, I was unaligned, but I take particular interest in certain political matters, conscience issues in particular, as Senator Norris has briefly alluded to.  I believe Senator John Hanafin&rsquo;s father, <Col N="519"/>Des, was in the middle of a Seanad campaign at the time, having taken a stance that made him temporarily unpopular within his tribe.  I contacted a much loved relation of mine who had a vote in the Seanad to ask him, not on the basis of any party preference on my part but given the issues involved, whether he would consider giving a vote to Des.  I then discovered that party men do not cross parties that easily, and I got half an hour on the merits and virtues of Joe Doyle.  By the time he was finished I was convinced that Joe was every bit as worthy of the vote as any person running in the Seanad election.  I have no doubt that he was.</P>
        <P>He was a man of deep faith and Christianity, as well as a man of conscience.  It is not easy in politics to combine those qualities, but perhaps the maxim, &ldquo;In essentials unity, in non-essentials diversity, but in all things charity&rdquo; can be applied to all of us, and it certainly applied to Joe on the basis of anything I ever heard about him.  Christianity is as much about what one does as what one says, as we all know.</P>
        <P>The second time I came across Joe was in happy circumstances when in a previous job I was accompanying people from the Dublin archdiocese on the 50th anniversary pilgrimage to Lourdes, which was a subject of some media interest.  I had a job in the press office of the Dublin archdiocese and I accompanied a crew from &ldquo;Nationwide&rdquo; on that particular pilgrimage.  Anyone who has ever been on that pilgrimage will know that there is a particular bar, or perhaps several, where people, including and especially the volunteers, let their hair down at night, and boy do they let it down.  I will never forget the sight of Joe Doyle posters, fresh from a previous successful election, which adorned this bar, and it was not just a case of one, but several.  He was on that particular pilgrimage and was very well got and popular with all the people involved.  His commitment was well known, and his goodwill was without condition towards all he encountered.</P>
        <P>I should just like to add my words in that context, to share that memory with people and to say, ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh s&eacute;, agus suaimhneas s&iacute;ora&iacute; dh&oacute;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I should also like to be associated with the tributes to the late Joe Doyle.  As has been said, he was a Member of this House from 1987-89, and from 1993-02, when he successfully contested three Seanad elections on the Administrative Panel.  I had the honour and pleasure of serving with him in the Seanad from 1997-02.</P>
        <P>He made an enormous contribution to Irish political life and the Houses of the Oireachtas in his role as Senator and Deputy.  He was reliable, good-humoured and a true gentleman.  I extend my sincere sympathy to his wife, Peggy, his sons, David and Michael and daughter, R&oacute;is&iacute;n, as well as to the extended family here today on their sad loss.</P>
        <P>I ask Members for a minute&rsquo;s silence as a mark of respect to the late Joe Doyle.  May he rest in peace.</P>

    <Title>Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 <?oasys _cf1- ?>[<?oasys _cf2- ?>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il<?oasys _cf1- ?>]<?oasys _cf3- ?>: Report and Final Stages</Title>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 113, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and has been placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration,&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For the convenience of Senators, the Cathaoirleach has arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the <Col N="520"/>list of amendments it is proposed to group.  A Senator may contribute once on each group of amendments.  I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the Minister to speak to the first group of amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to thank all Senators for their varied, interesting and positive contributions to the debate on this legislation.  I am confident the Bill, as amended, will safeguard the welfare of dogs and dog-breeding establishments, will ensure a thriving greyhound industry over time and will create employment by enhancing the standards and reputation of dog breeding in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Every Member is aware that I have proactively engaged with the stakeholders and Members to address any concerns the proposed legislation might contain for various interest groups.  Over 650 submissions were received after the publication of the report of the working group, established in 2005 by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Dick Roche, a point overlooked by many in the course of the debate.  Its terms of reference were to examine the current position regarding the management of kennels and to make recommendations for such improvements.  Greyhounds were, therefore, always considered to come within the remit of these terms.</P>
        <P>To underline this fact, the Irish Greyhound Board was represented on the working group and has been consulted extensively since then.  Senior officials have met the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club on several occasions recently.  They have also met with the Dogs Trust and the Irish Kennel Club.  The Irish Coursing Club, in particular, has played a constructive role in the development of greyhound welfare and has engaged positively and openly during the course of the debate.</P>
        <P>As a result of these engagements and as promised when I was last in the Seanad, I introduced amendments on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il which addressed concerns relating to inspection, finance, the powers of authorised persons, breeding limitation, microchipping and the effects of implementation.  I am satisfied these amendments will successfully allay the concerns of the stakeholders involved.</P>
        <P>The definition of a &ldquo;dog-breeding establishment&rdquo; is specified by the working group appointed by the then Minister, Deputy Dick Roche, as being based on the number of female dogs on the premises with breeding potential.  The working group included veterinary representation from Veterinary Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Louth County Council and the ISPCA.  I believe the definition developed by the group is clear and unambiguous and, as such, will aid enforcement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The group noted the difficulty experienced in the UK with definitions based on breed which have become unenforceable.  I acknowledge the estrous cycle ranges from six months to 18 months, depending on the breed of dog.  The working group definition had to ensure all bitches capable of breeding were included.  Accordingly, it set four months old and capable of breeding as a definition of a bitch.  I modified this by amendment to six months old and capable of breeding.  However, this is not a marker for when to start breeding.</P>
        <P>The Bill allows three litters in any three years, thereby providing a dog breeder with the flexibility to assess the bitch&rsquo;s potential prior to commencing breeding.  Concern has been expressed regarding the impact the Bill might have on the casual breeder with a few pups. <Col N="521"/> Establishments with less than six bitches of six months old and capable of breeding will not be affected by the Bill.  In the event a bitch produces a litter of female pups, the breeder has six months to consider what to do with the pups before they become reckonable for the purposes of the Bill.  Sterilised or spayed bitches are not capable of breeding and, as such, are not reckonable for the purposes of defining a dog-breeding establishment.</P>
        <P>I have extended the fee ban so that an establishment with up to 18 bitches over six months old and capable of breeding will only pay &euro;400 in registration.  This is not a high fee when one considers the level of production that can be achieved from 18 bitches and the market value of a good pup.</P>
        <P>Inspection by a local authority veterinary officer will be a prerequisite for the issuing of an improvement notice.  A dog warden will not be authorised to issue an improvement notice.  This will reassure those who question the objectives of dog wardens.  Dog wardens, in turn, will be reassured by the provision that they should be accompanied by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as necessary.</P>
        <P>I am convinced the full set of amendments has strengthened acceptance of the Bill and addresses the concerns of stakeholders, including the Irish Coursing Club, the Hunting Association of Ireland and the Dogs Trust, while ensuring the local authority veterinary and dog control staff have workable legislation to safeguard the welfare of dogs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government back to the House.  Many of these amendments from the D&aacute;il were debated at length in this House.  If the Minister and some Members from the Government side had taken on or resubmitted some of the Seanad Opposition amendments, they would have saved themselves and the Government a great deal of the trouble and grief over the past several weeks.  While the Minister might have escaped accepting amendments in the Seanad he was eventually hunted down and forced by a pack of Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers to table amendments to the Bill as initiated in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I presume I will have an opportunity later to speak to some of the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes the Senator may speak to the groups of amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister may have eased some of the concerns of the Irish Greyhound Board and Hunting Association of Ireland, Fine Gael continues to have reservations about this legislation.  We are being asked to put a lot of trust in what the Minister is saying, which I find hard to do.  I made a genuine effort to amend this Bill during its initial Stages in the Seanad.  However, my suggestions fell on deaf ears until the Minister&rsquo;s hand was forced.</P>
        <P>I will outline Fine Gael&rsquo;s reservations in respect of this legislation as the Minister makes his report to the Seanad of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Bill.  Fine Gael supports animal welfare legislation to ensure the proper administration, inspection and regulation of puppy farms.  As stated during the early stages of debate on this Bill, we have no difficulty whatsoever in this regard.  Many Fine Gael Deputies and Senators were the first to raise these issues in both Houses a number of years ago.  The issue was raised in the Seanad by Senator Cummins and in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Doyle.  We welcome measures to improve animal welfare in terms of puppy farms.  However, we believe the legislation as initiated in the Seanad goes far beyond that and into areas it need not have gone at all.  While the amendments made to the Bill have addressed some of the issues raised we continue to have reservations about it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="522"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am sure we will deal expeditiously with these matters.  I compliment the Minister on the constructive manner in which he dealt with the entire process, which cannot have been easy.  It was in fact remarkable that an appointed head of a semi-State body, Bord na gCon, was on occasion so vociferous against the Minister.  That was most regrettable and unusual and in my opinion raises certain questions.  The Minister was correct to listen to advice from within the industry.  If would be foolish of anybody to criticise him for taking advice on board given Ministers are regularly criticised for being unresponsive and for not taking advice on board.  The Bill has in the Minister&rsquo;s opinion been improved following discussion with the relevant people.  I was amused to hear people object to their establishments being subject to an inspection on the basis that their premises are so wonderful and beyond reproach.  If they are, they should be delighted to receive an official certificate confirming this.  What could they possibly have against that?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will put the matter of the helpfulness of the coursing clubs in the fridge.  As I have said previously, I share the views of St. Thomas More, a quotation from whom I once provided to my colleague the late Deputy Tony Gregory which states: &ldquo;thou shoudst rather be moved with pity to see a silly innocent hare murdered of a dog: the weak of the stronger, the fearful of the fierce, the innocent of the cruel and unmerciful...the citizens of Utopia think not that the merciful clemency of God has delight in blood and slaughter.&rdquo;  The evidence of the Old Testament suggests that St. Thomas More may have, at least in Volume 1 of his collected works, slightly over-estimated the moral sensitivities of God.  I believe the Minister has done a good job.</P>
        <P>I realise that many honourable people have paid the price in terms of the passage of this legislation and the legislation on stag hunting.  I regret that Senator O&rsquo;Donovan lost the whip for the position he took.  He was outflanked by events.  Had these or similar amendments been around he might not have lost the whip.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is a decent person whom I hope is quickly re-admitted.  I hope we will deal quickly with the report of the amendments.  I support the Government on this occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I welcome also the amendments to the Bill as made by the D&aacute;il.  Heretofore there was a lack of regulation in this area.  A lack of regulation in any sector limits the sector&rsquo;s ability to mature and develop new markets.  As stated by Senator Norris, the next step, with certificate in hand, is the creation of an identity for dog breeding in Ireland which is equivalent to the identity we enjoy in respect of horse breeding.  This legislation is not alone welcome in terms of animal welfare but in terms of job creation as it provides real prospects for Ireland and its dog breeders to penetrate the larger markets of Britain and Europe.  This legislation will prove robust enough to withstand international inspection.  Potential customers will as a result of this legislation know Ireland is a compliant nation when it comes to breeding establishments and that its name in that marketplace can be trusted.  I believe there is tremendous prospects in the years ahead as a result.</P>
        <P>I regret this issue was conflated with the stag hunting issue.  It is worth pointing out that this legislation was initiated following recommendations of a working group set up in 2004 and which reported in 2005 to the then Minister, Deputy Roche.  I commend the current Minister, Deputy Gormley, for carrying on with what is the correct trajectory in this regard and on seeing it through to the end despite some ill-conceived and ill-considered criticism which has since been proven to be wide of the mark.  It is hoped that people who had their doubts will acknowledge that voices were heard and that people in the industry can now take ownership of the new regulations and begin to make them work for themselves and the animals in their care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I acknowledge his response to the genuine concerns raised during the past couple of months in regard to this Bill.  I acknowledge also the <Col N="523"/>Minister&rsquo;s undertaking to re-examine the 1958 Act.  This is very much welcomed by the sector.  It is hoped we will deal quickly with the report before us.  I hope the consensus on this issue in the Lower House will be carried through to this House.  I welcome the inclusion of a time span in respect of the operation on the ground of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  As the first person to raise the puppy farm issue in this House more than six years ago, I welcome legislation that may eradicate the problems we saw on our television screens and on many occasions witnessed.</P>
        <P>As I stated on the last occasion when Report Stage of the Bill came before this House, I regret the Minister was not in a position to bring these amendments before the House.  Had he done so he would have saved himself and many Members what followed.  The Minister was not aware of the Greyhound Act 1958 when first mentioned on this side of the House.  I am glad he has undertaken to look at it as it deals with animal welfare and that he will ensure the greyhound industry will continue to be regulated under that Act.  I look forward to speaking on some of the groups of amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome the amendments to the Bill.  I compliment the Minister on finalisation of a Bill which is important to anyone who regards himself or herself as an animal lover.  That the Minister was able to accept amendments in the Lower House is to be respected.  The Bill is all the better for the amendments.  As Senator Cummins stated, it is unfortunate we were not able to tease out some of the amendments on the floor of the Seanad.  In one particular case it has led to the loss of the Whip from a valued colleague, Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, which I am sure will be temporary, whose proposals were subsequently accepted and vindicated in the D&aacute;il.  Despite that, however, I am not one who subscribes to the conspiracy theory and I do not agree with Senators who state the two parties in Government are bullying each other.  The partnership appears to be working well and in a mature way.  That is due in no small part to the Minister&rsquo;s calm, moderate and effective presentation of policy at all times and the way he enunciates Government policy.  People in my party appreciate very much the important role he is playing in this coalition Government.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments refer to the definition of a dog breeding establishment.  The Bill as initiated defined it as a premises at which bitches are kept, not less than six of which are four months old and capable of being used for breeding purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Apologies.  I will give the Minister the clear direction as it has been given to me.  We are on group 2, definition of a dog breeding establishment, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 2, 15 and 22.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the Senators are saying that amendment No. 1 in group 1 was not dealt with.  I am in the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s hands and I will take the lead from her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the amendment we have just discussed.  We have moved on to group 2.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The stipulation of four months was to ensure that any bitch which fell pregnant no matter how young would be reckonable when defining a breeding establishment.  The D&aacute;il accepted the amendment to change the four months to six months in response to calls here in the Seanad; Members may recall we had a discussion on that.  It is important to state this does not invalidate the rationale for specifying an age threshold which was to ensure that any dog with breeding potential was included.  It should not be considered as setting down a marker for when to start breeding.  It would not be wise, as some have proposed, to have a threshold at 12 months or even two years.  The Senators will recall an amendment on that was put down in this House which the Labour Party voted for, as I recall, and then subsequently voted for the legislation in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I believe everyone would acknowledge that most breeds of bitch could breed in the first 12 months of life and greyhounds in their second year.  A 12 month or two year threshold would discount litters born before that time elapsed, possibly leading to an increase in the overall number of litters per bitch to the detriment of her welfare.  It would be difficult to justify such provision in a Bill concerned with animal welfare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>This side of the House did put down an amendment to increase that period from four months to two years.  We expressed amazement that any expert on dog breeding would suggest that a bitch could breed at four months but the Minister refused to accept or even discuss that amendment.  We even offered to withdraw it in favour of a lesser period at that time.  We suggested six months, a year or whatever the Minister would be willing to consider but, unfortunately, he was unwilling to consider any of those proposals.</P>
        <P>We put down the amendment because a bitch cannot breed at four months.  I would like to know the breed of bitch that can breed at six months because I believe they are few and far between.  I will give an example.  Many people in the greyhound industry rear greyhounds up to a year.  They do not breed greyhounds.  The breeding establishment would pass on the young pups at an early age to a rearer of greyhounds who would take them on and rear them up to a year old, to sapling age, when they would then be put into training.  However, many of those people do not breed dogs yet they will still fall under the definition of dog breeding establishments.  That is mainly the reason we suggested the period should be increased to a year at least to ensure those people would not be included in this legislation.  We could let them come under the 1958 Greyhound Act regulations which, as I said here many times previously, is the legislation that is the controlling authority for greyhounds.  It is only in the past week or two that the Minister has belatedly agreed to come to that position even though it was pointed out to him here on numerous occasions in recent months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I, too, feel sorry for Senator O&rsquo;Donovan who was speaking a great deal of sense from the opposite side of the House.  He understood the reasonable argument we were trying to make on this side of the House.  Unfortunately, as some Senators have said, he is the victim as he was out-flanked by the pack of Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers who hunted down the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  That unfortunate Senator is the victim and I hope people in his own party will see that <Col N="525"/>he should be readmitted.  It is none of my business but the man made a reasonable argument.  He stood his ground on principle, and I appreciate and respect that.</P>
        <P>Those on this side of the House argue that definition of a dog breeding establishment should state that a bitch should be a year old and not six months old because as far as breeding is concerned, it is a more reasonable and proper term for bitches to start breeding and it would also exclude the people I have just mentioned who are in the business of rearing dogs and not breeding them.  We have pointed that out.  It has fallen on deaf ears.  I see an attempt was made, and perhaps it is some form of compromise to some of the backbenchers I mentioned, to raise it to six months but as far as we are concerned it does not go far enough.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The reference to public trainer&rsquo;s licence is used to facilitate the exemption from registration fees to which the public greyhound trainer will be entitled.  This will eliminate the costs associated with registration for trainers which was a cause of concern for the Irish Coursing Club whose members I wish to thank for their positive input to this Bill.  The Senators will see that I, in turn, have made every effort by way of amendments to meet their legitimate concerns.</P>
        <P>The regulations of 1961 state: &ldquo;public trainer&rdquo; means a person holding a licence from the [greyhound] Board authorising him to train and manage greyhounds for reward&rdquo;.  The public trainer differs from a private trainer in that a private trainer is authorised to have no more than four greyhounds and, therefore, would not fall within the scope of this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the Minister has listened to the stakeholders in regard to this amendment and that he sees the sense in exempting public trainers&rsquo; licences from having to make that payment.  We welcome that.  We believe that if that engagement had happened at a much earlier stage the Minister would have saved himself a great deal of grief in this House, in the lower House and in the public domain but we welcome this and acknowledge that the Minister has listened to us on this occasion in terms of this amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment refers to the regulations of 1961 which define a stipendiary steward as a &ldquo;steward appointed by the Board to fulfil the duties of an authorised officer under the [1958] Act&rdquo;.  I proposed that a stipendiary steward or veterinary practitioner may accompany a local authority veterinary inspector for the inspection of premises containing registered greyhounds under the amendment to section 18, which deals with authorised persons.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make the inspection and improvement order process transparent to the Irish Coursing Club and Irish Greyhound Board and hence to reduce their concerns in that regard.  It will become apparent that well-run dog breeding establishments with or without greyhounds will have nothing to fear from inspections of this sort.</P>

	<P>Senators will appreciate the significant number of concessions I offered by way of amendment.  I have consistently pointed out that this legislation is not intended to be harmful to dog breeding in Ireland.  It is my firm belief that this Act will be seen in the long run as beneficial to the industry by enhancing its reputation at home and abroad.</P>
      
        <P>However, to further allay any concerns, I proposed in the D&aacute;il introducing a review clause to the legislation to examine its impact at a point 12 months after commencement of the legislation.  I hope this clause will find favour in the House.</P>

	<P>This is another significant amendment made to the Bill since it left the Seanad.  There is a reason for it being made and I presume it is the number of compromises the Minister has reached with his Government colleagues and the industry since discussions were belatedly carried out.  Unfortunately, as members of the main Opposition party, we were not privy to many of the behind the scenes discussions and agreements made.  I certainly have not been briefed by a departmental official or anyone from the industry on these discussions.  As an Opposition spokesperson, I thought I might have been.  In the interests of reaching a consensus, it might have been a good opportunity for the Minister or his officials to engage with the Opposition on the compromises and agreements reached.  Unfortunately, even though we were among the first to raise many of these concerns, that offer has not been forthcoming.  Will there be a review by the Minister and his officials only, or will they engage in a consultation process with stakeholders to obtain their opinion?  Will they have an opportunity to give their opinions and make submissions on their experience of the Bill in the first 12 months?  I am sure the Minister will agree that this is a pertinent point.  He is not the only person who will have an opinion on the effect the Bill has had.  It is very important that all stakeholders have an opportunity in the review to give their opinions and make submissions.  Will the Minister clarify this point?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I was also approached on this subject by some stakeholders who welcomed the provision for a review.  It is very good that the Minister will allow an opportunity to assess how the legislation is working in practice.  However, it will be necessary to consult stakeholders, not the Department alone.  That is what a review is all about.  I hope the Minister will succumb to our way of thinking on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea behind the review is that we engage positively with stakeholders who include those who are involved with the breeding establishments, the Irish Greyhound Board and, most importantly, the welfare organisations.  It is the firm view of the welfare organisations that tattooing for traceability purposes is not the best or the cheapest way.  I will be very anxious to establish after implementation for one year whether there is a case to be made for microchipping.  I accept there are people who are far more expert in these matters and defer to them, but they have clearly said to me that microchips are used in Australia for tracing greyhounds, as well as in the United Kingdom, that this does not impair performance or cause cancer, as has been claimed, and that it is cheaper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Would that be in place of tattooing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Tattooing is done for a reason, as discussed in the D&aacute;il.  We want to establish a database, to which we will refer when dealing with other amendments, in order that a tattoo could be used to trace a dog.  Senators may have seen media reports on &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; about a stray greyhound, the origins of which could not be traced because the <Col N="527"/>tattoo had faded.  This would not occur with proper microchips.  We need to be very clear on this issue.  The Irish Greyhound Board and others will come to this view.  They will see after one year that this is the best way to proceed.  I understand a system of tattooing is in place and that it seems to be far more convenient for them.  However, the review to be undertaken after one year, in which there will be total engagement with stakeholders, will reveal that the points made by expert groups are valid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the question of tattooing, identification and microchipping has been introduced at this point because I was reserving my power for a later amendment.  I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this issue because I fully support the Minister on the microchipping of dogs.  He mentioned the case of a greyhound bitch.  I saw her at the newly developing headquarters of the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Mount Venus and it was utterly shocking.  This was an elderly greyhound bitch with ten pups and she was in very poor condition.  There was marking by tattoo which had been completely obscured deliberately such that it was impossible to read the identification mark.  If there was microchipping, it would be a very different matter.</P>
        <P>I fully concur with the advice given by the lobby groups and the professionals that microchipping is significant.  The risks of cancer are negligible; they have never been demonstrated adequately and I do not believe there are such risks.  On the question of the value of a dog and harming it, if it were true, it is highly unlikely that the owners of stallions at stud, very valuable racehorses, for some of which there is a covering fee of &euro;150,000 per performance, would permit microchipping.  Any objection to this is a tissue of nonsense.  I, therefore, strongly support the Minister.  If any votes are called on a series of amendments dealing with this issue, I will return to the House to strongly support the Minister.  I will vote in favour of the Bill in the event that a division is called.  I cannot imagine that happening after a series of positive amendments and the welcome given to them from all sides of the House, sometimes in tones that were clearly partisan and designed to have a political impact.</P>

	<P>The subject matter of the sixth group of amendments is the extension of the lead-in period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>To give sufficient time to dog breeders and local authorities to familiarise themselves with the requirements of the legislation, the D&aacute;il accepted this amendment to allow for a six month period from commencement of the legislation for dog breeding establishments to be registered.  Dog breeding establishments can continue to operate during this six month period prior to registration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister to extend the period.  However, I remind him that Fine Gael proposed an amendment as a reasonable approach and to ensure a full stakeholder buy-in to the legislation.  On earlier Stages we suggested it should be extended from three months to one year.  However, at the time the Minister did not entertain this opinion or idea.  Now we see he has come around to this way of thinking after much grief, torment and public debate on the issue.  It is important that we indicate that these matters were raised in good time for him and his officials to amend the Bill to allow for the use of common sense.  I recall his answer at the time was that people should be well aware of the provisions of the Bill because the working group had been in place since 2005.  I considered that was very unfair to all stakeholders.  The small guys down the country would not have been aware of the workings of the working group, not all of whom were represented on it.  There was one representative from the greyhound industry.  I do not think the breeders&rsquo; association was represented.  People would not have been aware of the lead-in period.</P><Col N="528"/>
        <P>Despite all of the public debate on this matter in recent weeks, I still contend that some people have establishments that will need to be redeveloped and, possibly, rebuilt.  For that reason, we submitted that the lead-in period should be extended to one year to allow such persons to get their house in order via the obtaining of planning permission.  If a person breeding greyhounds or pups submits an application to the local authority, as we all know, it could take up to two to three months in the normal course of events for the application to be processed and a decision made.  If a neighbour or someone else objects to that application, it will go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and take quite a long time more.  At least people should be given that opportunity to see through the planning process and that is why my party felt a year would be more appropriate.  The six months is a compromise on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf.  He might clarify that for us, but it does not go far enough.  My party felt a year would be more appropriate to allow people get their building establishments in order if they needed to.</P>
        <P>It was highlighted that standards will be required and I still have not see the regulations concerned.  The Minister might clarify whether they have been published.  I do not think they have.  Those regulations, on the housing conditions and the physical environment that will be required for these establishments, will be important.  The Minister could opt for a two-star establishment or he might even like a five-star establishment for these puppies, but maybe a two-star one is acceptable.  Until we see these standards we will not know.  It will have a bearing on planning applications and a year would be more appropriate.  Six months is an improvement but it does not go far enough.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact is the legislation needs to address those who are not operating under a best practice regime.  It is important that those people are not allowed continue for another 12 months with what they are doing.  Six months, I would have thought, is more than adequate to allow for registration.  It is being done locally.  Information should be easily available locally and action should be well possible within six months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>The point on breeding is the same one.  Senator Coffey asked that the Minister name him a breed that is capable of breeding after four months.  I am sure many can breed within 12 months and it is important we lay down an early marker at six months.  The legislation is aimed at those who are not compliant with good practice and forces them into a decent practice.  It should not give <i>carte blanche</i> to those operators who operate at a substandard level.  Senator Coffey&rsquo;s basic premise is incorrect.  The legislation needs to deal with those who are not operating at a good level, not make the assumption that everyone is whiter than white in the sector because they certainly are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>

        <P>My party made this suggestion regarding six months or 12 months in the House and we were laughed out of court.  We were opposed by most Members on the Government side, except some sensible Senators, such as Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and Ormonde, who saw what we were looking for, namely a lead-in period.  It was not being entertained at all by the Minister and, indeed, some other colleagues in the other House.  I am glad we have gone some way in addressing this problem.  I welcome the fact that there is a six-month lead-in period.  I would like it to be 12 months but I welcome the fact it is six months and that it has been acknowledged that what we on this side of the House were saying months ago was the correct position to adopt.  I am glad the Minister has come around to that way of thinking as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Points have been made.  We are all talking about good standards in the operation of this Bill.  However, there was a suggestion that to put one&rsquo;s house in order, one might have to apply for planning permission.  Has the Minister taken into account that if the planning permission is refused, An Bord Plean&aacute;la might come into play?  I am curious about that.  I acknowledge he has gone some way down the road by providing six months.  Ideally it should be 12 months but six months is fine if everything goes well.  What would happen where planning permission was refused and the application was delayed beyond six months?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators will appreciate that this is an amendment to deal with the concerns raised by individual Senators and Deputies.  No doubt the six-month period from commencement of the Act will allow people.  In all sincerity, I cannot believe that they do not know of the existence of this legislation.  They would have to be living in a bubble not to know about it.</P>

	<P>They certainly know about it.  I have gone out of my way to ensure we deal with any of the outstanding issues.  On Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s issue, if some people&rsquo;s establishments are so below par, of course they will get the opportunity to comply.  She must remember it is not the stick that is being used here, more the carrot.  I made that point when I was in the Seanad previously.  The individual will engage with the local authority which will ensure adequate time is given to him or her to upgrade his or her premises.  That is what this is about.  Ultimately, it is about getting the best welfare standards for dogs and in a way that does not penalise individual dog breeders.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments extend fee exemption to public trainers of greyhounds as defined in the regulations of 1961.  This responds to Irish Coursing Club&rsquo;s concerns regarding the cost of registration.  I am sensitive to these concerns and am happy to provide for such an exemption.  It is my understanding, based on assurances given at meetings with the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club, that trainers focus exclusively on training and do not breed greyhounds.  I am, therefore, happy to exclude them from the registration fee, but not from the registration process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this amendment.  Numerous Senators in this House pointed out the problem regarding dual registration costs for those involved in the greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>An important point that applies to trainers, this amendment and all dog establishments is that this Bill will become law within the next couple of days and then it will be incumbent on all the local authorities to enforce it.  I am interested to know how those who run dog breeding establishments and how the local authority officials who will be required to enforce this law can know what is required of them if we do not know now the standards and physical and technical environment that will be required of those.  Have they a manual, template or guidebook to which they can refer to ensure adequate standards?  It is important if we are introducing laws that the Minister would have the technical detail to back them up.</P>
        <P>The reason I mentioned two-star versus five-star establishments is I am trying to display in simple terms the different levels that may be required.  As I do not know and I am sure the Senators on the Government side do not know, how can those running these establishments or the local authority officials know what is required of them under this law?  I am asking a simple question.  I am just wondering.  I raised on Committee Stage the issue that surely the standards or physical environment required should have been annexed as a Schedule to the Bill or that a regulation should follow.  How soon will such a regulation follow?  These are important points, of which those involved in the various dog breeding establishments must be aware.  It is all very well to suggest we are introducing laws to improve animal welfare, but we must give those <Col N="531"/>involved the benchmarks they are expected to reach.  I have not seen them to date.  This is a reasonable question.</P>

Several times on Committee and Report Stages I raised the matter of the standards required to be met by dog breeding establishments.  The Minister has suggested the order will not commence until January next year, but this is a recent development.  When the Bill was initiated in this House, the amendment dealing with the commencement order was not included.  However, all of the requirements of the legislation related to a dog breeding establishment were contained, without a reference to a standard level or benchmark.  That is my point.  The Minister is not listening to me.  He should be aware of the consequences of this from the debates in the Lower House and the public domain.  I am making a reasonable request.  Why is there no regulation or benchmark of standards required to be met by dog breeding establishments provided for in the Bill?  I am not trying to be divisive.  I am entitled to ask these questions in the interests of having proper legislation and providing information for all stakeholders.  I suggest the Minister is fudging the matter by suggesting a recent amendment addresses the point I am trying to make because it does not.</P>

	<P>These amendments deal with widening the registration fee bands having regard to concerns expressed by the Hunting Association of Ireland, HAI; the Irish Coursing Club and the Irish Greyhound Board.  I have agreed to a registration fee exemption for HAI registered members and greyhound trainers.  I have also agreed to widen the fee bands such that a dog breeding establishment with six to 18 bitches, each greater than six months old and capable of breeding, will pay a fee of &euro;400.  I reiterate that someone with less than six breeding bitches will not be subject to the legislation.</P>
        <P>Fees and bands vary to reflect the size and scale of the operation, as recommended by the working group.  To this end, the new appropriate fee bands will be as follows.  In the case of a dog breeding establishment, at which six to 18 eligible bitches are kept, a fee of &euro;400 applies; for an establishment with between 19 and 30 bitches, the fee will be &euro;800; for an establishment with between 31 and 100 bitches, the fee will be &euro;1,600; for an establishment with between 101 and 200 bitches, the fee will be &euro;3,000; and a further &euro;1,600 for each 100 bitches thereafter.  The fee will be payable to the local authority and the moneys raised are intended to cover the costs of regulation and inspection.  It is intended that any balance remaining will go towards the cost of dog control in general.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the time.  I indicated I had been waiting outside for a considerable period.  It is now approaching 1.30 p.m. and I have further engagements.  I had expected that we would conclude soon, but I find myself in a situation where I do not know how I should proceed.  I will probably have to leave at 1.30 p.m.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to amendment No. 23, the Irish Coursing Club and the Irish Greyhound Board have suggested the legislation is excessively restrictive in regard to dog breeding estrous cycles.  To address this issue, I proposed changing the provision for breeding frequency from one litter every 12 months to three litters in any three-year period.  This will provide flexibility to address situations where a bitch might not fall pregnant within a 12-month period or might fall pregnant twice in a 12-month period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I again welcome the compromise on this matter.  Concern about this was raised by industry representatives and many Senators.  Senator Norris referred to the issue of Bord na gCon officials who became involved in the public debate.  I hope there are no consequences for those officials.  They are leading an industry which was concerned about the implications of the legislation.  The amendments the Minister has brought forward as a result of consultations with industry representatives and officials prove he is making compromises regarding the legislation.  I hope there will not be consequences for these officials who were defending the industry for which they are responsible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>They decided to operate in that way.  If individuals in statutory agencies under my remit behaved in that way and came out in public to criticise policy, eyebrows would be raised.  I understand the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food spoke to the chairperson, which is right and proper.  There is a right way to conduct business.  In this case, people overstepped the mark and that is why it was right and proper for the Minister to take the course of action he did.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the people involved in the greyhound industry and the chief executive officer and others involved because they represented what was going on and the concerns of the industry.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>To address the existing market requirements and to enable a smooth transition to microchipping, I proposed in amendment No. 24 to extend the deadline for microchipping pups from eight to 12 weeks under section 15(2).  This provision will apply for 12 months following commencement of the Act and that should allow sufficient time for all concerned to become acquainted with the requirements.  Thereafter, under section 15(1), dogs will be microchipped at eight weeks old and before they leave the premises, which is important.  Breeding establishments will at that stage have prepared themselves to meet the microchipping requirements and should not have any difficulty in moving to eight weeks.  Section 15(3) will allow hunt clubs not to microchip but section 15(4) provides that clubs which do not microchip will be obliged to keep a register of dogs at the premises and make such records available to the local authority.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 25 outlines the requirements for notifying the local authority of the particulars of the sale of dogs in order that the register can be maintained.  Currently, a number of companies operate databases of microchipped dogs.  A dog warden with a handheld device can scan the neck of the dog.  If the dog is microchipped, the warden will be able to identify the owner.  This provision will assist in the identification process by ensuring breeders have to notify the local authority and the database provider of the details of sale or transfer of dogs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 26 provides that a stipendiary steward or a veterinarian nominated by the ICC or the IGB can accompany a person authorised by a local authority on an inspection of a dog breeding establishment used for the training or breeding of greyhounds and registered with the IGB-ICC.  This amendment aims to provide reassurance to greyhound owners who may have concerns regarding an unaccompanied visit by a person authorised by a local authority.  I hope the amendment will help provide sufficient reassurance to the ICC-IGB regarding inspections.  Joint inspections will also lead to better mutual understanding and enhanced liaison between local authority staff and the IGB-ICC nominees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The effect of amendment No. 27 is to provide that an improvement notice can only be issued on foot of an inspection by an authorised officer rather than a dog warden.  This is intended to assure dog breeders that such notices will not be issued by anyone other than a local authority veterinary inspector.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 28 is a technical amendment to improve the original wording, enabling a local authority to issue a licence for the lifetime of a dog.  The licence will cost &euro;140, which equates to seven annual licence fees at the new rate of &euro;20.  Most family dogs can be expected to live up to 14 years and, therefore, the lifetime of a dog licence would represent a saving of 50% compared with purchasing annual licences.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take amendments Nos. 30 to 36, inclusive, together.  Currently, owners of numerous dogs have the option to pay a general licence fee which covers all the dogs they own.  More than 400 such licences were issued last year.  Amendment No. 30 is designed to ensure anyone who pays a registration fee or annual charge for a registered dog <Col N="535"/>breeding establishment will not have to pay the proposed &euro;400 fee for a general dog licence.  Technical amendments Nos. 31 to 36 are consequential on amendment No. 30 being accepted.</P>

	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 113, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister of State may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  For Senators&rsquo; convenience, the Cathaoirleach has arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to return to this House with the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, as amended by the D&aacute;il.  The D&aacute;il amendments have been grouped into thematic areas and I propose to outline each group of amendments to the House.  There are a significant number of amendments to the Bill.  Some of them are substantial amendments but a number are technical amendments.  I reassure Senators that the substantial amendments inserted into this Bill were flagged to this House at the time of the Bill&rsquo;s debate and are required to comply with EU law and to avoid substantial EU fines.  Senators will be heartened <Col N="537"/>to hear that a number of the concerns raised during the debate on the Bill in this House have been addressed by amendment in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>The first group of amendments to the principal Act are predominantly technical in nature.  Amendment No. 1 inserts section 1A into the principal Act to provide a table listing all Community Acts that are given effect through the planning Acts, which is the new section 3 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 2 amends section 2 of the principal Act to update the current definitions and to insert a certain number of new definitions through section 3 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>On foot of consultation between officials of my Department and officials at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food since the Bill was passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann, amendment No. 3 was introduced to retain the exemption for the construction of forest roads from the planning consent system, as currently provided for under section 4 of the principal Act.  The requirements of the environmental impact assessment directive with regard to private forest roads will now be fulfilled through a separate forest consent process as prescribed by EC regulations made by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  In response to the issue raised by the Labour Party, section 4(1)(i) of the Act has also been amended to provide that land reclamation or reclamation of estuarine marshes or callows under the Land Reclamation Act 1949 will no longer be exempt from planning permission.  The Minister is also empowered to make regulations to ensure developments that are ordinarily exempted can be de-exempted within specific areas if necessary for the purposes of ensuring that any such development that could have a significant effect on a Natura 2000 site is screened for appropriate assessment and appropriately assessed if required.  This amendment is required as part of Ireland&rsquo;s transposition of the habitats directive in section 4 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 4 is a consequential amendment to section 7 of the principal Act on foot of the new Part XA, substitute consent procedure, and the new Part XAB, appropriate assessment of plans and proposed developments, to ascertain whether, having regard to the habitats directive, there would be an adverse effect on the European site.  Amendment No. 58 makes a further technical amendment to section 37 of the principal Act which deals with works affecting character of a protected structure or a proposed protected structure.  This is in section 26 of the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 59, 60, 65, 76 to 79, inclusive, 81, 93 to 95, inclusive, and 97 provide for technical amendments.  Amendment No. 96 will not be commenced and will be repealed in due course as the required provision now stands part of a separate Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have no doubt about his interest in and passion for proper and sustainable planning, which is shared by many Members on this side of the House.  We have concerns with regard to how the Bill has been handled.  The Minister of State referred to putting us on notice that the Bill would be heavily amended as it passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I remind the Minister of State that when the Bill was initiated in the Seanad, it consisted of 40 pages.  It generated quite an amount of debate and Members on this side of the House, as in the Lower House, have concerns about the autonomy of local authorities and the powers of the elected members of local authorities.  These are elected on a five-year basis and are closest to the citizen in the governance system.  By the time the Bill arrived before the Select Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, it had increased to 124 pages, a considerable amount of additional substance.  I accept that much of this is necessary and is a requirement under EU law.  The Minister of State said it is important to address shortfalls in our legislation to ensure Ireland is in compliance with EU law regarding the habitats directive.  I understand that but I consider that the information was readily available when the Bill was initiated.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify if this is the case and why we did not have the information when it was initiated.</P><Col N="538"/>
        <P>Today we have a substantial book of amendments, with more than 120 pages of amendments in addition to the 124 pages discussed in the Select Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  A substantial portion of this Bill was guillotined through the Lower House without any debate or proper analysis and consideration.  As the Minister of State is aware, Members of this House do not get an opportunity to make further amendments at this stage.  Moreover, they do not get an opportunity to vote on the amendments but are more or less obliged to accept them as the Minister of State submits them to the Seanad in report.</P>
        <P>As Members go through the amendments, I will have some comments to make for the public record.  At the outset, however, it appears as though this is quite a substantial Bill that I accept to be necessary in many ways to reform the planning systems and processes to reflect the current and modern needs of society for a sustainable planning model.  I will be the first to acknowledge that serious mistakes have been made in the past from which one must learn and many legacies have been left behind by bad planning practices, management and decisions.  However, one must be careful to avoid trying to crack the nut with a hammer.  There are ways to remodel the planning system to ensure full engagement from local communities and to give them the say in the system the Minister of State claims to be providing.  Fine Gael is concerned that in many ways, this planning Bill will manage planning in the future with a top-down approach and that the bottom-up approach is being abandoned to a large degree.  This is evident in many areas, even among local authorities that at present are adopting city and county development plans.  Even though this Bill has not yet been enacted, the Minister of State is aware that the management of many local authorities already are engaging with it.  While that may be as the Minister of State prefers, they are acting as though the Bill is already in place.  Many local representatives, who are elected by the citizens on a regular basis and who are accountable to those people for decisions made in those communities, have serious concerns about the Bill&rsquo;s substance and the impact it will have on smaller towns and villages in particular.  As I will outline later, a hierarchy is being created through this legislation that more or less will sideline many smaller towns and villages and will take away their ability to exploit their full development potential.  This is a genuine concern I outline on behalf of many people to whom I listen and who represent local communities.</P>
        <P>The Bill is based on the national spatial strategy, which I consider to be a good model.  However, having been in place for eight years, it needs to be reviewed and no analysis of its impact has been conducted.  Moreover, it has never been adopted by the Oireachtas but is a Government model.  While I acknowledge it contains much that is good, it must be analysed closely to ascertain how successful it has been since its inception.  While this issue can be teased out further, I argue that it has not been as successful as intended in some areas and this certainly must be reviewed and analysed to ensure a proper model.</P>
        <P>As for the group of amendments under discussion, I accept that many of them are technical in nature and that Ireland is required by European law to comply with them.  Only last week it was necessary to rush through emergency legislation on the compulsory purchase order process to prevent a potential exposure of the taxpayer to a significant amount of money with regard to the Galway city bypass.  I am aware the Bill contains provision for this matter and that it had passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il.  When enacting legislation, one must be careful that any law passed must work for the benefit of society and the people who live within it.  Ireland must comply with European law pertaining to special areas of conservation, which I support.  However, it is a cause of great concern in rural Ireland, which will be most affected by such directives on habitats, and the deeper consequences and implications of such directives on rural Ireland remain to be seen.  Obviously, it will not have the same impact in the city, apart from protected structures and institutions.  However, people have been living in rural Ireland for <Col N="539"/>many generations and I suggest they are the people who care most about the natural environment in which they live.  Nothing in this legislation should impinge on how they wish to continue to live in rural Ireland.  Obviously, existing dwellings in rural Ireland will remain in place but there is grave concern that on foot of this Bill, the building of new houses will not be allowed in any local authority area in rural Ireland.  The Minister of State might give Members his views in this regard because were this to be the case, there would be serious problems.  This also is a matter that can be discussed further as deliberations on this Bill continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">All Members welcome this Bill because the planning system probably needed to be tidied up to an extent.  One or two items may give rise to conflict.  Amendment No. 3, which inserts section 4, includes the words &ldquo;&lsquo;consisting of land reclamation or reclamation of estuarine marsh land and of callows, referred to in section 2 of that Act&rsquo; after &lsquo;the works are commenced&rsquo;&rdquo;.  However, it may be necessary for some farmers to undertake land reclamation to fulfil the regulations regarding area payments by the European Union.  In some cases, farmers have been queried with regard to scrub.  I refer to clearing scrub on land or rushes on wetlands, not about removing hedges or anything similar.  There have been queries in this regard and in some cases, on foot of the satellite photography that is available to the European Union, queries have been made to ascertain the legitimacy of such lands being classified as grazing ground.  Were someone to be queried in this manner and were they obliged to remove such scrub, would it be necessary go through the full planning process to have it removed or can this be achieved in the traditional manner by cutting it away?</P>
        <P>Another point about which all Members are worried concerns the question of forestry roads.  There is no problem with creating forestry roads but I am worried about the county and regional roads onto which such forestry roads will lead and which will be seriously impacted when the timber is being extracted.  Will this Bill facilitate the imposition of limits regarding the tonnage that may be put on some of these roads?  All Members will have seen minor county roads that were in reasonable repair being turned into pulp by people who have no consideration for the local community or anyone else.  It is simply a case of going in and getting out as quickly as possible and to hell with the damage because the local authority or someone else will pick up the tab.  Will such a scenario be covered by the amendments introduced by the Minister of State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I have strong feelings about the question of rural houses.  The greatest resource and greatest part of any environment are its people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While it might not appear to be politically correct, I consider that people come first.  Anything that would stop the son or daughter of a farmer or anyone else in a rural community from building on or around the ancestral home should be neither legislated for nor tolerated.  At a later stage in the deliberations, the Minister of State should make a clear statement on the position in the future for those who wish to build in the country.  I refer to those who wish to maintain a traditional way of life.  While one might think it was efficacious to have people moving into villages from the perspective of economies of scale, social engineering and so on, ultimately it is the people&rsquo;s choice to live in the way they do and this should be supported.  Consequently, I seek an assurance from the Minister of State in this regard.  How does he perceive the influence of the habitats directive on the capacity of people to secure planning?</P><Col N="540"/>
        <P>I refer to a senior county councillor who is a colleague of Senator Wilson and mine in that he is an elected representative from County Cavan.  I do not wish to name him because that would be unfair.  He was told at a meeting he attended recently that 80% of the planning applications in Cavan would henceforth fail under the terms of this Bill.  I seek an assurance from the Minister of State that this is not the case.  I believe the failure rate should be 8% given that obviously there are certain conditions in which planning cannot be granted because health and safety issues are involved or the complete ruination of an environment or the building of a monstrosity on the top of a hill is proposed.  Everyone is familiar with the exceptions but within reason and while giving people the benefit of the doubt, I believe people should be fit to build where they wish and to live in the communities of which they are part.</P>
        <P>I have just had lunch with a family from Cavan.  When I told them the Seanad was about to consider the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, they said it was very important to them to know their children would have the option to build on their property.  That is a reasonable aspiration for any family to have.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>We are legendary for our generosity.</P>
        <P>We need assurance on this matter from the Minister of State.  I need to know that I will be able to tell a county councillor the 80% provision is not applicable.  If it were, it would be very wrong.  If we were even remotely party to legislation that applied such a provision, we would be totally remiss in our duties towards the people we represent.  It is incumbent on me to make this point.  I want the Minister of State to offer assurance.</P>
        <P>No planning permission application should fail, unless there are glaring reasons for its failure.  Such reasons include health and safety.  In the normal run of play the people are the greatest part of the environment.  While this may not sound politically correct, wildlife should not come before people.  Keeping people at home and happy and building good communities should be our ultimate ambitions.  No social engineering that achieved the contrary would be prudent, nor would it be accepting of the indigenous nature of our people.  I hope the Minister of State can reassure us on that score.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a lot of work to get through this afternoon.  I welcome the Minister of State and the technical amendments made.  I listened carefully to the Senators opposite and believe we will find common ground on many issues, including the need for sustainable planning and development.  Senator Ellis&rsquo;s understatement on there being a need for some tidying up will probably prove to be below the mark later in the day.</P>
        <P>The many amendments made are to be welcomed.  They will remove a lot of unnecessary demands from councillors, not by way of taking power from them but by giving them a much clearer direction on what is possible.  It is most unsatisfactory that the legislation in place is such that a planning decision need only have reference to higher planning documents within the cascade of planning.  That this has been the case has left me and other Senators who have acted as county councillors open to undue pressure at times.  In many cases throughout the country the existing legislation has caused poor decisions to be made that may have satisfied some short-term need but which have left communities with a legacy of planning problems in the longer term.</P>
        <P>As the Bill begins to be understood more broadly, its key themes will be accepted as realistic and inform a realistic assessment of the position in which poor planning has placed us.  The Bill <Col N="541"/>is so important because of the role of bad planning in contributing to the bust we are experiencing.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>It was through an unhealthy set of relationships, partly caused by the shortcomings of the Planning and Development Act 2000, that considerable overzoning was spawned.  This, in turn, led to speculative purchasing on the back of reckless lending.  There are untold stories concerning planning, planning advice and council decisions that need to be addressed.  The pain we are all enduring with regard to NAMA will be for naught, unless we change the planning system.</P>
        <P>The Bill passed through the D&aacute;il on the same day as the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009.  Rightly, the latter stole the lion&rsquo;s share of the publicity on the day.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed, the Senator is.</P>
        <P>I would like to believe that on this quieter day in the Oireachtas due recognition will be given to the truly important nature of planning legislation.  This is a landmark Bill which will create new landmarks on the environment which I hope will be more sustainable.</P>
        <P>On Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s point about families living in the community, I take it he was referring to families from those communities.  We are trying to stop unnecessary migration from towns.  The Bill will lead to the creation of a better landscape, better planning and more sustainable delivery of services.  It will give a better direction to councillors and planners, increase the efficiency of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and lead to a wider distribution of development levies in the community.  I regard this as a truly important day in legislative terms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Stage of the Bill.  I hope to be able to refer to section 33, in particular, but I must attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>I welcome the emergence of the Bill from the D&aacute;il.  It is interesting that the amendments fill a very thick volume.  This may suggest the Bill was not as carefully thought out as it might have been.  There are 117 pages of amendments to a Bill that I believe has fewer pages.  It is unusual and interesting that the Bill, after passing through the Seanad, has been returned from the D&aacute;il with an enormous volume of amendments.  Nevertheless, I welcome its return.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the help of the staff of the Houses, particularly those of the Bills Office.  I am the first person to advert to the fact that in the old days amendments were grouped according to number.  I have not heard anybody else mention this.  In recent days amendments were given to us that were grouped not only according to number but also according to subject matter.  This is immensely helpful.  I thank the civil servants involved for their help in this regard because it makes our work as parliamentarians much easier.</P>
        <P>When Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said it might not be politically correct to say people came first, I felt it was about the most politically correct statement one could possibly make.  I certainly support it, but it can be used as a fig leaf for other views.</P>
        <P>I have stood in this House as more or less the lone supporter of An Taisce which I acknowledge has made mistakes.  It warned us about the difficulties and dangers of one-off developments in the countryside in terms of sewerage, road access and other services and in terms of the cost to the environment and the Exchequer.  It was perfectly right on this issue, although <Col N="542"/>it might have made some tendentious objections in certain circumstances.  I refer to certain offices around the country.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the notion of people living in the countryside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Many are empty.  Therefore, why are they being built?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not empty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea that because one is born on a particular patch of land, all of one&rsquo;s extened family have the automatic right to live there is absolute nonsense.  Reference has been made to the flight from the land and the desperate efforts made to bring people back.  If a family has ten children, should all ten have the right to build on its land?  Can they sell that right?  This is complete nonsense and arguing to the contrary is a vote getting exercise.  Senators should not tell me they are representing rural Ireland.  My family is only one generation in this city.  For the previous 2,000 years they lived in the bog.  Therefore, I know as much about bogs and rural living as anybody else in this Assembly.</P>
        <P>I have reservations, but we should be flexible.  If there is a clear and defined relationship between an individual and a family on whose land he or she wants to build, the case should be considered with sensitivity.  However, I have never believed in an automatic right.  I also deprecate the idea that certain areas can be closed off such that only people from these areas are entitled to build or buy houses there.</P>
        <P>If I can detach myself from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I look forward to returning to the House to discuss section 33.  If I cannot, I suggest the Minister of State consider the reservations expressed about it.  In particular, it has been suggested the cumulative effect of the provisions could be such as to reduce the capacity of the public to challenge important planning decisions.  This relates to charges and whether legal fees should be paid.  I hope I will have an opportunity to return.  If I do not, I will pass on my briefing document to the Minister of State, as this is an important matter.  I know him of old and he is in favour of the widest possible public consultation on these issues.  My briefing document suggests that, although the Government is seeking to implement a European directive, the public should be able to seek a judicial review of important planning decisions in a process that is required to be fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive.  With the best will in the world, the Government might not have achieved this result.  Therefore,I hope I will have an opportunity to return to make my points, to which the Minister of State may have an answer.  If I do not return, I hope I will be excused and not considered rude.  I will pass on the points I wish to make to the Minister of State by letter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to respond to each of the Senators in turn.  </P>
        <P>Senator Coffey was concerned about the way the Bill had been handled.  The discussions between the Attorney General and the European Commission continued until late May.  The officials in the Department and the Bills Office worked long hours and pushed themselves hard to ensure the Bill would be ready.  In an ideal world I would have had these amendments three months ago, but we needed to engage in protracted negotiations on the transposition of European directives into Irish law.  Had it been possible to table them in the Houses earlier, they would have been.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not contain too much by way of commands and the control of planning.  For the past ten years Ireland has suffered as a result of there being too little planning and a <Col N="543"/><i>laissez-faire</i> approach.  The changes proposed in the Bill will reduce the need for ministerial intervention.  The last thing a Minister, irrespective of the political strings on his or her bow, wants to do is to assert the Department&rsquo;s views over the development plans of individual planning authorities.  One could spend one&rsquo;s life doing this.  The proposed changes will ensure co-ordination between what is occurring on the ground within communities and the national spatial strategy.  They will also ensure joined-up thinking between all of the elements involved.  One does not want national, regional and local policies to differ.  The ethos behind the Bill is to ensure joined-up thinking.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey mentioned the national spatial strategy.  Although it is eight years old, it is a document which spans a period of 20 years.  We are refreshing it to reflect the changed reality of Ireland in 2010.  The new document will better inform the decisions that must be made in the next while to ensure we will not duplicate spending on health, education and transport services and social issues to ensure the State will get the best value for money, given the limited amount of cash available.</P>
        <P>Regarding rural housing, the rural planning guidelines still stand and are a strong attempt to find a compromise between opinions on whether housing should be located in cities, towns and rural areas.  A reasonable compromise is possible.  The effect of the Bill on small towns and villages will be beneficial, as no town or village wants to be swamped by unnecessary traffic.  We want them to work better and be developed more coherently.  We do not want to see an awful, enormous and empty apartment development suddenly appearing two miles outside a town as if by magic.  We are trying to ensure there will be no surprises and that there will be some level of commonality, understanding and support for what occurs, instead of the adversarial system evident in recent years, under which developers were pitted against communities and urban dwellers against rural dwellers.  The object of the Bill is to ensure co-ordination and a coherent strategy.  It will lead to better towns and villages and more vibrant rural areas.  People who need to live in the country will be able to do so, but in some areas we have reached the point where one cannot push a buggy down a country road without needing to jump, buggy and all, the moment one hears a car, normally driven by a young blackguard, shooting down the road at 50 mph.  We must slow things down and ensure our limited resources will be available to build footpaths where necessary, instead of adopting a scattergun approach, whereby a council acts like a headless chicken in trying to work out where it should spend money to accommodate every demand made on it from north, south, east and west.  The rural planning guidelines stand.  The Bill is concerned with the better co-ordination of development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ellis made a point about land reclamation.  We argued the toss on Committee Stage.  Through Coastwatch Ireland and the Labour Party, the strong opinion conveyed to me was that we should be careful in wetland and estuarine areas, the areas where endangered species are often found.  I am referring to the corncrake and other species that one would like to see co-exist peacefully with humans.  We need to get the balance right between people, flora and fauna.  I take St. Francis&rsquo;s view of the world more, rather than place humans above everything else.  The Bill tries to strike this balance and will not interfere with REPS or the agri-environment programmes.  If particular concerns are brought to the attention of the Senator, we will consider them.  Given that I have one foot in the door of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I would be happy to pursue any issues raised.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes an allowance for forestry roads, but in respect of their connections with public roads, planning permission will be required for health and safety reasons.  I take the point about the damage forestry trucks can inflict on minor rural roads.  According to an amazing equation, the damage is proportionate to one million times its axle weight.  It is for the Department of Transport to address this issue.  As I wear a hat in that Department, I might <Col N="544"/>revert to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to determine what can be done about it.  Overloaded forestry trucks can be a disaster on minor roads.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly mentioned the concerns about whether rural dwellings will be permitted.  They will be, as the rural planning guidelines still stand.  Carefully phrased, they are more than generous for those who need and deserve to live in rural areas in which their families live.  I sympathise with Senator Norris in many of his comments in that a child of a rural dweller does not have a God-given right to have a house in the same area.  I am one of eight children and grew up in one of the few rural parts of south Dublin.  I do not believe that I and my seven brothers and sisters have a right to build a new house beside the family home.  The road would not be wide enough to take the amount of traffic.  The late Spike Milligan said, I believe, that having five or six children, he had not realised he and his wife had given birth to an entire traffic jam.</P>
        <P>When we look back 50 or 100 years to the bailte fearainn that Professor Seamus Caulfield and some great champions of rural life advocate, we moved in very different ways in the countryside then.  These days we drive 20 or 30 miles to work very often and we have given rise to an enormous amount of carbon emissions associated with transport.  We must be careful in weighing up the strong social and economic ties as to whether we are getting the balance right in that regard.</P>
        <P>There are cases where permission is refused, on very strong grounds, and often it is on road safety or flooding grounds or as regards failing percolation tests.  I have seen houses with rushes growing up to the back door, and the owners are surprised when the water laps in during heavy rain.  Neither I nor any Minister or Minister of State wants to be here in two or three years time in late November watching Jim Fahy telling us how failed planning policies gave rise to building on flood plains.  We have brought in flood planning guidelines and I want to see them enforced.  I want to ensure that people do not walk blind into buildings somewhere, where it is inappropriate.</P>
        <P>Not only have we had significant flooding in many areas, we have also had widespread contamination of water supplies in our towns and cities, whether Ennis or Galway, and very often the roots of these contamination problems lie in inappropriate planning and a lack of thinking as regards agricultural emissions and septic tanks that are not doing the job.  This has got to be balanced.</P>
        <P>As regards the assertion about 80% of housing being removed, I do not see any evidence for that.  I do not see any evidence in the legislation, the regulation or in the circular letter.  I invite the Senator to go back and see where that assertion came from because I do not believe it stands up.  However, we want to protect people from flooding.  We want to ensure they are entitled to clean water and that road safety concerns are addressed.  There is tremendous pressure on all of us.  I was a councillor for 12 years and I am aware there is enormous pressure to try and sort people out as regards planning and other issues.  We have got to get the balance right.  I do not apologise for a second for trying to push through the legislation to get the balance right.</P>
        <P>I would like to believe we will make it possible for people to live in the right place.  I want to make it easier for children to walk to school, for older people to walk to church, the pub or to the shops.  That does not mean shoehorning everybody into towns and cities, but it means getting the balance right between people who should be in the countryside being there and those who perhaps are better off in towns, cities or villages having affordable housing available in tandem with decent design and planning.  I reiterate that it is the absence rather than a surplus of planning that has got us into the difficulties we are in.</P><Col N="545"/>
        <P>I agree with the concerns raised by Senator Dearey.  As he pointed out bad planning or the absence of planning contributed to the enormous legacy we and our children will have to bear, as regards the National Asset Management Agency.  I make no bones about it, and believe that if we had thought more carefully about where developments should go and the types that were required as well as whether the community needed them, we would have produced a much better Ireland.  In the cold grey light of paying the interest payments on NAMA, we have to think carefully about those issues.</P>
        <P>I agree with much of what Senator Norris had to say.  I look forward to taking up the debate on section 33 of the Bill perhaps.  On the issue of judicial review, we have to get the balance right.  I notice some concerns were raised on what is in the draft legislation.  I believe we are trying to get a decent compromise between what is necessary to ensure people have access to participate in the planning process while ensuring we do not bog down the courts with vexatious or excessive amounts of judicial review.  I hope we have the balance right in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I invite the Minister of State to deal with the second group, amendments Nos. 5 to 49, inclusive. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This second group of amendments deals with the forward planning aspects of the Bill.  Amendment No. 5 amends section 10 of the Bill by inserting subsection(1)(<i>d</i>) to provide for the inclusion of a separate statement in the development plan, which shows that its development objectives are consistent, as far as practicable, with the conservation and protection of the environment.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 6 is required to transpose Article 10 of the habitats directive into Irish planning law.  Article 10 of the habitats directive obliges member states to endeavour, where they consider it necessary in their land use and development policies, in particular with a view to improving the ecological coherence of Natura 2000, to encourage the management of features of the landscape that are of major importance for wild flora and fauna.</P>
        <P>Among other new mandatory objectives for inclusion in development plans an objective is provided to promote compliance with the water framework directive and its consequent river basin management plans, ensuring that the relevant local authorities set out their objectives in line with the relevant regulations.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, are technical amendments to the proposed new text of section 10 of the principal Act, and amendment No 11 makes a number of technical procedural amendments to section 11 of the principal Act, which deals with the preparation of a development plan.  That is section 6 of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for outlining a brief explanation of these amendments.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage and Committee Stage we had good engagement on this area, and the whole question of the making of development plans, variation of plans including local area plans etc.  I can see the Minister of State&rsquo;s reasoning.  He is trying to achieve a consistency across the whole of Ireland, but our concern is that this is a top-down approach, as I said earlier.  Everything is emanating from the national spatial strategy, which we see as not being totally legitimate because it has not had any proper environmental assessment or test as to its justification.</P>
        <P>If the Minister was changed in the morning his or her successor has the power to change the national spatial strategy.  In turn, he or she has the power to change every single regional plan, every development plan and local plan.  That is the point we are trying to address here.  There is a democratic deficit as regards the national spatial strategy, while I appreciate there is much good in it.  However, it is not democratically accountable.  It is for the Minister of the day to <Col N="546"/>formulate the national spatial strategy and there are no structures for engagement with stakeholders throughout the country to ensure that it has been properly and democratically arrived at and accounted for.  That is the fundamental problem we have with the model the Minister of State is presenting through this Bill.</P>
        <P>From the national spatial strategy every regional authority is required to draw up a plan and every constituent local authority development plan is meant to comply with aspirations of the regional plan.  I have made the argument on previous Stages as regards the present regional structures not being adapted for this Bill.  At the moment delegations from local authorities attend regional authorities.  Even the members selected &ndash; not elected &mdash;  for the regional authorities are sent by the constituent local authorities to represent their interests.  If the structure was to be properly in keeping with the aspirations of this Bill, therefore, those regional authority members should in fact be directly elected in my view.  They should be accountable for the plans they make to the full and entire region they represent.  That is a fundamental point I wanted to make on regional plans.</P>
        <P>As regards the county and local area plans, every county, town and city is unique in its own right.  That is why we have places in Ireland that are culturally very different.  Waterford city, for example, has a strong manufacturing tradition and heritage which is reflected in the docklands and Waterford Crystal site.  This would be very different from, say, Galway city which has a more cultural and academic background.  Accordingly, one size does not fit all.</P>
        <P>We need to exploit the uniqueness and cultural potential of cities, towns and villages.  However, this planning model will make every town and village the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it will not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it will just create a bland structure.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should consider how the legislation&rsquo;s provisions will trickle down through the planning system.  The regional plan for an area or county will limit the potential for any village in it to exploit its full agricultural, manufacturing or cultural history.  While I agree with the Minister of State that we need to strike the right balance, this Bill may go too far.  As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said earlier, a social engineering model is being implemented which may cause the uniqueness of each county&rsquo;s identity to be lost.  Waterford will become the same as Cavan, Galway and Limerick.</P>
        <P>I took on the Minister of State&rsquo;s points about poor and excessive development.  However, this really only occurred in the large estates in the commuter belt around Dublin.  There are many areas in Waterford that have not seen any evidence of development.  However, this Bill will limit the potential of such areas to develop in a good and proper way.  We cannot put the lid on the aspirations of individuals, communities and villages.</P>
        <P>Portlaw, County Waterford, the town in which I live, was a social experiment of a model industrial village built in the 19th century by the Quaker family, the Malcolmsons.  The family started first with industry and then built the social structures around it.  Up to 5,000 people lived in good quality houses never seen previously in Ireland.  The streets were wide and laid out in the shape of hand leading to the town centre and then on to the cotton mill.  It was an example of what I consider to be good planning.</P>
        <P>The problem with current developments is that they do not have social infrastructure attached to them.  The Malcolmsons proved that if one builds houses, they must be followed up with social infrastructure.  Unfortunately, these successful models are not being examined.  This Bill could be a retrograde step by removing planning autonomy that will prevent villages and towns to grow in their unique way.</P><Col N="547"/>
        <P>Another concern about the democratic deficit in this Bill centres on the numbers required to alter a county development plan.  Under this legislation, it will take a two-thirds majority of a local authority to adopt the plan when previously it was just a simple majority.  This could be a dangerous exercise in that it gives more power to smaller groups on local authorities while taking from the majority.  The simple majority in any institution of democracy always rules.  This legislation interferes with that fundamental element of democracy by increasing the requirement to a two-thirds majority.  This will only increase the power of the minority on a local authority, allowing it to hold the majority to ransom by insisting on the inclusion of its own suggestions in a county or city development plan.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s intentions are good and I can see why he is trying to get it right.  However, this legislation will have far deeper consequences for our society than we realise.  While I understand it from a political point of view, I am surprised Fianna F&aacute;il, the largest party in the Government, is accepting this Bill without properly analysing its implications on its local authority members and rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am not for a scatter-gun approach to rural housing development.  Constitutionally, however, people are entitled to live where they choose so long as their development is compliant with planning and environmental rules.  There are, however, very few one-off houses empty, with nearly all of them inhabited by happy families.  There are many estates in cities and major towns, on the other hand, which are empty.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage I pointed out that much of the core strategy with regard to this model of planning and development is based on statistics.  It is important they are scrutinised and verified before development plans are designed around them.  We know the effect when statistics have not been verified.  Before the last general election, a survey was done of the electoral register in Waterford city.  Anyone who did not get back to the council about it was struck off, leaving thousands without a vote.  The statistics used for planning models need to be 100% correct because they will shape the futures of those towns and villages in which people live.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Portlaw, County Waterford, had its own local area plan until now.  When I cautioned that it would lose this under this planning model, the Minister claimed a local area plan was not a statutory requirement but the local authority could have one.  Waterford local authority is now resisting the calls for a local area plan for this town, blaming a lack of resources and this legislation.  For the first time in generations, Portlaw, a planned industrial town, will not have its own local area plan.  It will be subsumed into the county development plan.  In the eyes of the local authority and the Department, Portlaw will be no different from the other towns in the county.  While the Minister of State gives one side of the arguments about this planning legislation and I give the other, finding a balance between the two must be achieved.</P>

        <P>I am keen to talk about the happiness of our population.  The Government and some Members are foolish in thinking that people&rsquo;s mental health cannot be affected by the area in which they live.  For some, living in a rural area is best for them.  For others, it may be a city.  I reject Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in&rsquo;s recent claim that Fine Gael was irresponsible when it came to planning.  It was a low and cheap shot.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always been concerned in facilitating people in building houses where they wanted.</P><Col N="548"/>
     
        <P>It is not always appropriate for people to live in a cluster or a city.

I grew up in the country and later moved to live in the city.  I now live in the country again.  I lived in a place called Foster Court in Galway city, which while I loved it for a while I knew was not the place for me to live.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>This group of amendments, if removed from the overall set of amendments, would result in a gutting of the legislation.  Forward planning is at the core of what we are talking about.  We are talking about the development of evidenced based &mdash; the Senator is correct that the evidence must be accurate &mdash; core strategies that are consequent on the superior planning document and based on the national spatial strategy which, incidentally, was introduced at a time when environmental assessments were not required, from which cascade the regional plans which, if the regional representatives from the various country councils are doing their job properly, will reflect the character of the region and will allow for differing variations, colour and definition in the subsequent development and local area plans.</P>
        <P>The assumption that this model is a type of social engineering that will lead to a type of blandness in terms of how Ireland will look in future is based on the premise that all regional plans are the same, which is not the case.  I was heavily involved in the development of the Border regional plan.  It is a difficult region to plan for as it stretches from Tory Island to the <Col N="549"/>River Boyne on the east coast.  The only thing the regions have in common is that they are on the Border.  We tried our best to reflect the character of our region.  I have no doubt our regional plan is different to that of the south-eastern region.  As a result the consequent planning documents will similarly continue to diverge from each other and will reflect the character of the local area.</P>
        <P>I understand the reason Senator Coffey is distressed about the fact that a local area plan is not now necessary for a town with a population of under 5,000 people.  However, such plan can still be ordered.  The Bill does not deliver that as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  It is important to make the point that it remains possible for local area plans to be developed in small population centres.  I commend this grouping of amendments.  I see forward planning as being the absolute driver of this legislation and of the amended Act, which as the Minister of State said was characterised by not keeping a lid on or trying to control the expectations of land owners and developers.  I agree in part with Senator Coffey that we cannot completely suppress the entrepreneurial spirit among people with aspirations to develop their properties and so on.  However, we do need to control expectations.  Owning land does not confer on a person the right to develop it in whatever way he or she would like, which is what the 2000 Act allowed people to do.  We have paid the price for that; it was a heavy price.  Controlling those aspirations does not amount to social engineering; rather it is responsible planning and the delivery of proper future planning for the entire population so we do not end up having future generations pay for our recklessness.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree and appreciate that the Acting Chairman will be even-handed in this instance.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael accepts that all was not well in the State of Denmark.  We know there were unsatisfactory developments.  We are painfully aware of it as we drive pass many of them on a daily basis.  However, we are concerned that we may be, in providing a solution to the problem, throwing the baby out with the bath water or using a sledge-hammer to hit a nut.  As I listened to Senators&rsquo; contributions on this group of amendments a popular song, all the words of which I cannot recall, came to mind.  It is a simple ditty which includes the words, &ldquo;little boxes, little boxes&rdquo; which caused me to think we are going to create bland villages.</P>
        <P>With the greatest of respect to many of my colleagues who are members of regional authorities, regional authorities are not directly elected.  While they have a function and are made up of fine people they are not a directly elected fora nor should they be.  I believe in the local authority-county council model and that the county structure is satisfactory.  I believe in the county structure for the delivery of all services and I believe in the principle of subsidiarity.  I am not convinced of the imposition of regional plans.  While we must have guidelines and broad rules I am confident of the genius and capacity of people at local level to plan their futures.  People are sobered by their past experiences.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey eloquently articulated that people on regional authorities are not democratically elected and that the regional structures are not responsive to people at a local level as are county councils.  Another serious issue arises, one about which we are concerned in terms of its implications in practise.  I remind Senators who like me are elected by county councillors that our county councils are energised by and engaged with this issue.  Councillors are concerned that it will take a two third majority to alter a development plan.  If one removes the majority vote, which is a democratically functioning model used for generations, a small grouping of, say, one third plus one, with an agenda of its own could hold up progress and change <Col N="550"/>the wishes of the people.  We are concerned about this, as are councillors.  We cannot be too patronising, elitist or doctrinaire in our approach to councillors who are elected representatives with enormous commitment to community and the good of the environment.  There is no one more conversant with or patriotic about their areas.  They love their communities, which is the reason they do what they do.  They are of the community and as such, are very annoyed about this provision.  I do not joke about it.  The Minister of State can use whatever empirical method he wants to assess this or send a questionnaire to councillors, but I can tell him that they are enraged about the issue.  We are concerned about the democratic deficit in planning that will now be apparent.  We are concerned about imposition, blandness and the little boxes to be ticked principle.</P>
        <P>I believe in the one-off rural house concept.  That might not be the trendy view to have and it might not be the view in Dublin 4, but there is a world beyond it.</P>

	<P><i>Laissez-faire</i> planning is not something in which I believe.  That is the point I am articulating.</P>
        <P>A Senator made an interesting remark to me today about these amendments.  In recent years in County Monaghan supposedly democratic groups of councillors zoned sufficient land to have a city the size of Dublin built in parts of the county.  I find that outrageous.  The Minister also considered it outrageous and put a stop to it.  He believed he had to do so using the powers available to him.  In planning there must be proper checks and balances.  We cannot have a situation where enough land is zoned to build a city the size of Galway without recourse to proper planning procedures.  That is not feasible or realistic and it is not what happens or will happen.  The Bill will ensure there will be a proper policy from the top to the bottom.  While grassroots democracy is vital, the Oireachtas is important also in planning.  It must set guidelines.  It is not a case of deciding that we will not set guidelines, that we will leave it instead to councillors.</P>
        <P>I want to make a specific point about something of which I have experience.  It relates to the idea that a majority of councillors can put in place a development plan for the future.  A majority of councillors can put in place a plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am trying to make the point that it can be difficult for new councillors because they are not properly trained when it comes to planning.  In the Oireachtas a Minister is somebody who has gained a great deal of experience, but insufficient training is provided for councillors.  I know of cases in which individual councillors are making serious decisions without understanding the implications.  They are going along with the crowd, so to speak.  We had a situation in Galway city where eight new councillors dealt with a development plan from day one.  That presents a problem.  There must be adequate guidelines in place and sufficient training provided.  We must take planning seriously.</P>
        <P>The issue of one-off rural houses is a red herring.  Having proper local area and city development plans, proper regional plans and a proper national spatial strategy working in tandem with each other is the way to go and there is no reason this cannot happen.  There is no reason development cannot proceed within that context.</P>

	<P>When it comes to development plans, common sense should prevail.  I know that for the bulk of county councillors it does.  I put in almost 30 years on a local authority and in the early days there were very few planning problems because there was nobody there to live in a place or look for planning.  The number of planning applications was minimal.  Then we saw the big drive.  We also saw some county development plans being influenced by officials who did not take the needs of the people of an area into consideration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Every one of us is aware of this.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in spoke about new councillors.  In many cases new councillors are intimidated by some of the officials and led to take decisions that are not in the best interests of the community.  If we are to have proper regional development, everybody living in a rural area should have the right to continue to live there if they wish; they should not be forced out of it.  That is accepted by everybody, even those who might say people should be moved to towns and villages.  Many local authorities did not put in place the necessary infrastructure in some of these villages to allow them to be developed.</P>
        <P>It would be much better to see somebody with a septic tank on an acre of ground that has been properly installed, maintained and controlled, or a treatment unit which is what is installed in all new one-off houses.  We all know that such units can provide a standard of outflow that is drinkable and can be proved.  It is done through the provision of secondary treatment; even some primary treatment units can meet all of the count standards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday a number of us from County Leitrim met the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to discuss the problem of one-off houses and the T-test which in some parts of the country cannot be met, despite the fact that there are other means of dealing with the problem.  We do not want to see a situation where the T-test becomes the rule of law.  To be fair to the Minister, he saw the sense of what we were saying and stated he would have his officials deal with the issue to try to find a compromise solution.</P>
        <P>We need to ensure we plan for the future based on ten rather than five year programmes.  There should be an initial five year plan to be reviewed after three or four years and then continued for the following five years.  We all know it was suggested in the national spatial strategy that the population of some towns would double or treble during its lifetime.  However, the population of some will not increase by 10%.  When we discuss the revision of development plans, we must be in a position to update them on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>I am a little concerned about the two thirds majority required for changes.  In some cases lobby groups can exert such pressure on local authority members that they can act not to the good but the detriment of a community, as Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in mentioned.  Sometimes revision is required which can be for an ulterior motive.  Something can be turned on its head, despite the fact that it has the support of 95% of the local community and 95% of officialdom in a local authority.  Perhaps a procedure should have been included in the legislation, whereby, where there is failure to achieve the two thirds majority, the Minister of the day would have the right to intervene if he considered it would be in the interests of the common good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>A lot of ground was covered in those contributions.  To respond to Senator Coffey, if there is social engineering in the Bill, it is based on the theory that developers will no longer be able to call the shots; if that is social engineering, I support it.  We are restoring the balance with the community having more of an input and greater control over the development plan.</P><Col N="554"/>
        <P>I was really pleased with the way Senator Coffey used Portlaw as an example because it is a planned town.  The Quakers did a fantastic job 150 or 200 years ago.  They have made a great contribution to Irish society in the past two centuries, but in this instance they thought ahead.  They were philanthropic and ensured that not only would the housing needs of their workers be met but that also that they would think beyond this, to consider schools, health care and other issues.  We need to return to that fundamental philosophy, not just tick the boxes and let a developer build whatever he or she wants and wherever he or she wants.  We want to let the community gain.  To me, that is a crucial part of outlining the core strategy in the plan.  It will allow the planners and officials to ensure the developer will give back something to the community, as opposed to lashing out houses like snuff at a wake, with scant regard to the needs of the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We could cite good examples during the years.  We had the Bord na Mona planned towns during the middle part of the last century.  Fantastic new communities, with open green areas, were built, with careful consideration being given to how the new houses would be connected with the town.  The late Arthur Gibney&rsquo;s father planned them and did a really good job; they have stood the test of time, 50, 60 or 70 years on.  It is about thinking about the way towns are planned.  If there are limits in the Bill, they are to prevent urban sprawl and every last piece of land being rezoned.  I understand that in Waterford the issue is being re-examining.  It is being stated one has to think again about the misplaced optimism because if every last acre one, two or three miles out the road is rezoned, it will take away from the town centre where there will be dereliction, with development on the outskirts rather than close to where schools, pubs and churches are located.  Irrational exuberance and optimism are very dangerous qualities in elected representatives.  What the Bill does is restore a sense of realism to how we plan.</P>
        <P>I will not name the small town in question, but I had a delegation to see me to speak about how the council had rezoned every last acre around the town.  The owners of the big shopping centre wanted to build on the rezoned land beside the motorway and bypass.  That is where the battle is taking place.  The town centre traders came to me to state the viability of the town was under threat from the major supermarket multiple.  Rezoning the land had laid the seeds of decay in the town centre.  Traders who had traded for generations &mdash; retailers who had bought turkeys and carrots from the local farmer &mdash; would be killed off because of the absence of planning based on hope value.  That is why we need to ensure we have a core strategy.</P>
        <P>To clarify matters for Senators Ellis and Coffey, we revisited the two thirds majority provision and they will be glad to know that we are removing the proposal that there be a higher approval threshold.  They made very good points on a blocking minority.</P>

        <P>To respond to Senator Healy Eames on mental and emotional health issues, this is a planning and development Bill, not a health Bill.  However, since 1 October 1964 the community&rsquo;s concerns have been enshrined.  We have discussed that balance between the wider benefits to the community and the well-being of the individual.  I think we are striking a balance and as the years go by, the balance gets better.  When one looks at the policy documents from organis<Col N="555"/>ations as diverse as the Irish Heart Foundation or transport bodies, they all pretty much state we need to have more planning rather than less.</P>
        <P>While the core strategy is strong, there also are the rural planning guidelines.  They still stand.</P>
        <P>What we will be touching on is the urban-generated rural commuting, the long-distance commuting that is tearing the heart out of the countryside because the roads are merely racetracks and tearing the hearts out of our towns, cities and villages because these just have large surface carparks.  That is where a balance is being struck.  Senator Healy Eames must be careful.  She made reference to officials from my Department.  In fairness, they cannot respond to her at this debate.  She specifically mentioned the problems from DOE officials, and that is unfair.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Irish equivalent of <i>laissez-faire</i> is &ldquo;whatever you are having yourself&rdquo;.  We have had too much of that and we need to think much more sharply about the problem.  Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in spoke of the connection between water contamination and planning.  That is very real.  In fairness, the then mayor of Galway took strong action.</P>

	<P>One may disagree with that, but I certainly believe that the mayor led the initiative to improve the quality of water in Galway at a challenging time.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly spoke of little boxes on the hillside made of ticky-tacky.  There is a green one and a pink one, and a blue one and a yellow one, and they all are made of ticky-tacky and they all look just the same.  That resonates with myself.  We agree on that issue.</P>
        <P>The problem for far too long in Ireland is that the choices in housing have been limited.  They have been limited to a shoe-box apartment in the city, a semi-detached house or a single house in the countryside.  We need to provide a greater menu of choices for people in where they live, improve the choice, and give people more possibilities of where and how they live.  Good design is crucial to all of that.</P>
        <P>We have issued guidelines on design.  We have much more in the pipeline on local area plans.  That will deal with the issue of everyone living in ticky-tacky houses, playing on the golf course and drinking their martinis dry, which reflected the one-size-fits-all problem which has been a significant legacy of the past 30 years of suburbia.  Looking ahead, we want to give people more choice and that might lead to fewer people reaching for the martini glasses.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the T-test, we need to apply the most modern technology to how we assess applications.  There is a concern out there that this will stop people building where they should <Col N="556"/>build, but it is important to look at the science.  There are new technologies and we should use them.  Nonetheless, we must take into account flooding issues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This group of amendments provides a number of substantial amendments to the planning Bill, some of which were required to bring the national planning laws into compliance with EU law.  The drafting of these complex amendments was not finalised in time for debate in this House but the legal proposals were outlined at that time to this House.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 50 makes a number of amendments to section 34 of the principal Act.  Section 34(8)(<i>f</i>) currently provides that where a planning authority fails to make a decision on a planning application within the prescribed period, normally eight weeks from the date of lodgment, a decision to grant permission shall be regarded as having been given on the last day of the period, that is, a default permission.  That provision is now considered undesirable.  It has been criticised by the High Court and the Supreme Court.  It means that if through administrative error a decision is not made in time, a wholly unsuitable type of development could be permitted or even, where the proposed development is accepted in principle, no planning conditions, including conditions requiring a development contribution, may be attached.  The amendment to section 34(8)(<i>f</i>) of the principal Act provides that a default decision to grant permission will only be deemed to be given 12 weeks after the expiration of the time for deciding the application.  It has been provided that the default decision to grant permission will not apply to applications for development which require environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment under the habitats directive.  In such cases, a series of fines will be paid by the planning authority if it continues not to decide an application.  In the highly unlikely event of a year having passed without the planning authority making a decision on the planning application, the application will require to be advertised again at the expense of the planning authority and submissions invited from the public and prescribed bodies.  In no uncertain terms, this tells the planning authority to make a decision or else.  It deals with the very few cases where a decision has not been made by the planning authority, which is a good thing.</P>

	<P>On this issue of substitute consent, I echo a number of concerns that have come to me from already legal, compliant small quarries in Galway, and I am sure this applies nationwide.  I emphasise at the outset that the quarries to which I refer are already legal, compliant and with planning.  They are not the ones that are illegal, which I completely accept are out of order and which the Department should be pursuing.</P>

	<P>Which particular amendment?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is where the Minister is requiring quarries to apply for substitute consent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la when their extracted area is over 3.5 hectares.  Some of these small quarries&rsquo; extracted areas are already over 3.5 hectares if one takes into account their roads and through-ways.  On this ruling, can the Minister of State clarify if the Department will be adding the roads and the through-ways as part of the extracted area?</P>
        <P>Second, by enforcing this measure in this legislation, the Minister will be imposing considerable professional fees on very small businesses.  Many of these quarries employ five to six persons.  It has been assessed by two of the quarries that have come to me that this will cost them a minimum of &euro;40,000 in professional fees for services such as those of a hydrologist, a planner, an engineer and whoever is needed to prepare the documents.  I am strongly making the case that this is far too harsh.  This is not about irresponsible planning.  This is about being reasonable.  It is far too harsh in that it will affect livelihoods in a detrimental way and affect job retention.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a Second Stage speech.  This is a point.  Is it possible to increase the extracted area to five hectares or ensure a quarry may apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for substitute consent without incurring fees?  This would mean jobs would not be lost as a result of the measure.  I have no difficulty with the proposal as long as we are not damaging people&rsquo;s livelihoods.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 51 amends section 37A of the principal Act to afford an applicant the choice to make an application for a proposed strategic infrastructure development within a strategic development zone, SDZ, in accordance with section 37A or under section 34 of the principal Act.  Amendments Nos. 73 to 75, inclusive, provide for technical amendments to sections 168 to 170, inclusive, of the principal Act.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="558"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to amendment No. 75 which requires environmental impact assessments for developments in respect of the impact they might have on human beings, flora and fauna, soil, water, air, climate, the landscape, material assets and cultural heritage, and the interaction between the factors mentioned in section 171A of the principal Act.  I am aware of several circumstances where air quality in planning legislation is not properly regulated after planning has been granted.  Let us suppose an activity is carried out as a result of which an odour or smell emanates.  As part of the original planning application, odour assessments are required.  Once the planning is granted, there is nothing in law to protect the environment or the human beings in that environment from that activity.  I presume the Minister of State cannot address it in this Bill but I call on him to take into account.  We must examine the law to ensure no enterprise or development impinges in a negative way on a given environment.</P>
        <P>I refer to some examples.  Local authority landfill operations are among the greatest offenders.  Issues also arise whereby waste management operators work under licence.  There is nothing in the licence or the planning laws to require waste management operators to keep the odours emanating from an enterprise to a certain level.  My advice from local authority officials is that a change in legislation is required.  The Minister of State may be unable to answer me today which I fully understand, but he should take this on board as a point of concern.  The legislation must be strengthened in the area of odour control for the protection of the environment.  There is strong regulation with regard to noise and physical waste.  There is a weakness in the system.  I can provide more detail to the Minister of State at a later stage in respect of odour control.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has engaged very positively with us today, which is welcome.  While we may not always agree, it is important to hold robust debate, tease out the issues and come up with solutions.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister of State and his officials have taken on board the issue of the two thirds majority requirement, removed it from the legislation and replaced it with a simply majority requirement.  There are other areas where progress can be made over time if we engage in proper, focused and robust debate.  I call on the Minister of State to consider these areas of concern related to odour control.  It is not nice to live in an area where an enterprise has been granted planning permission and is producing an odour resulting in a significant negative effect on the people in the area.  This remains a concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Two aspects occur to me in this regard.  If there is an integrated pollution control licence, the conditions applying to that licence must be enforced.  If there are planning conditions, it is up to the planning authority to enforce them.  The issues of enforcement are of considerable concern to me and the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  As the Senator will be aware, we are examining these issues in several planning authorities.  If there are specific cases, I call on the Senator to bring them to my attention or that of my officials and we will do our best to address them.</P>
        <P>At the heart of a planning system is the presumption that there will be enforcement.  If there is not, then the entire planning system could be heavily criticised.  Section 172 provides that permission for development in a strategic development zone will be granted if the development complies with the SDZ planning scheme.  This amendment ensures the environmental impact assessment and other appropriate assessments must be considered within an SDZ also.  That does not touch exactly on the odour issue but I am satisfied it is an issue for planning enforcement.  In larger local authorities there is usually an environmental section.  In smaller local authorities it falls to enforcement and, sometimes, to the country engineer.  There must be robust enforcement of the planning law and especially of planning conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Next is group 5, which comprises amendments Nos. 52 and 53 which refer to permission extensions.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="559"/>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 deal with extensions to planning permissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments have wide implications.  The Minister of State may correct me if I am wrong but the thrust of this change in the law is due partly to the legacy of incomplete developments.  It will afford some leeway to developers or NAMA to ensure over time that developments which have been commenced but not finished are given appropriate time for completion.  A balanced view would suggest it is better to give that time rather than allow the planning permission to run out and have unfinished estates and all the associated problems that come with them.  This is my understanding.  However, there is another side to this matter.  It relates to unfinished estates or estates finished to a relatively good level but not to a level required by the local authority such that it could take over.  I realise we will return to the taking charge of estates at a later stage.  However, these amendments deal with permission extensions and they are relevant for the reasons I will outline.</P>
        <P>Where permission is extended on a particular development, the local authority does not have the power to enforce or take over that development until the full planning time has elapsed.  This will have implications in cases where residents are lobbying to have estates taken over and properly managed by local authorities.  If the permission has been extended, the local authority cannot take over such an estate until the full term of the permission has elapsed.  It will have implications for those residents and groups which seek for their estates to be taken over sooner rather than later.  Will the Minister of State take this into account?  The taking charge of estates is a significant issue.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue of bonds.  While the intention of a bond system is to ensure a developer finishes an estate, anecdotal evidence suggests these bonds relate only to the superficial finishing of estates such as footpaths, public lighting and the final surface.  The bonds do not cover the infrastructural deficits in unfinished estates at present such as sewerage and water schemes.</P>
        <P>During the cold snap in January and February this year it was discovered that water mains and the main, fundamental infrastructural elements of housing estates were not installed to proper standards.  Local authorities are limited in the extent to which they can enforce the law in this area.  They can go after the bonds but this represents only a small percentage of the cost of correcting and rectifying the problems which have arisen.</P>
        <P>Much of this comes down to enforcement, proper management and ensuring proper installation of infrastructure when estates are being developed.  We can learn from other jurisdictions in this regard.  A local authority inspector is allocated to any large estate in Northern Ireland but in this country we rely on engineer&rsquo;s reports.  Unfortunately, many of these engineer&rsquo;s reports have been found sadly lacking, to the great detriment of the residents, local authorities and the State.  I fully acknowledge this.  Councillors did not create this problem.  Professional bodies certified infrastructure that was not up to standard and this is a major problem.  I agree with the Minister of State that we have inherited many problems and legacy issues but councillors are not the only ones at fault.  Professional planners, engineers and officials were involved.  I do not point the finger at a specific person but we need to learn from the mistakes and ensure they are not repeated.  Let us not point in only one direction.  A range of mistakes were made and I have cited one example regarding unfinished estates and permission extensions that has implications.  Professional bodies that certified substandard infrastructure have a great deal to answer for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>Some estates have barely started, while others are unfinished.  Under section 53, the local authority can impose additional conditions and penalties in granting the five-year extension.  What happens if the extension is not sufficient?  What future amendments <Col N="560"/>may be in store for us regarding, for instance, rezoned agricultural land on which drainage and initial service works for access have been carried out?  It is highly likely an extension would not cover these developments.</P>

	<P>Group 8 addresses the issue of unfinished estates in more detail.  This group deals with the extension of a permission, which can impose further conditions on the issue of the bond.  A new provision has been added to the effect that a person who, on the day the section commences, is on an extension of permission can apply for a further extension and the planning authority may grant that where it considers the development has not been completed owing to circumstances beyond the control of the developer.  The possibility of securing a second extension was available to all applicants under the 2000 Act but it was decided as a matter of policy to remove it.  However, it has been decided to provide that persons currently on an extension who may have had an expectation that they could avail of a second extension may apply for such an extension.  Each application will be considered on its merits.  While I recognise the fairness of allowing an extension in some cases, people are also living on unfinished estates who want closure and they do not the developer to be given another five years to do very little.  The county manager is probably the best person to decide on getting the balance right.  One could err on either side on this issue.</P>
        <P>We conducted a survey of unfinished estates in the midlands and we hope to extend it throughout the country.  We will take the knowledge we get from that and apply it to regulations or a circular.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This group deals with judicial review procedures for planning and environmental matters.  Amendment No. 56 applies the relevant recommendations of the 2004 Law Reform Commission report on judicial review procedures for planning and environmental consents, and amendment No. 57 gives effect to a particular point of the public participation directive and will comply with the judgment of the European Court of Justice in respect of access to justice in environmental matters.  The amendment introduces a provision which will mean that in relevant judicial review cases, parties will only be responsible for their legal costs.  The provision will also give the courts the discretion to award costs in favour of a particular party if it is considered to be in the public interest to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred to county development plans currently being revised.  Where dezoning of lands for which planning permission has been granted occurs, will local authority members be exposed to challenges in the court?  He may be unable to reply to that question.  However, this is a concern for local authorities.  If county and city development plans are subject to revision, we need to establish whether elected members will be exposed to court challenge owing to their actions to dezone or to follow instruction under this legislation. <Col N="561"/> This important matter needs to be addressed, if not today, at some point in the future, to put the minds of elected members at ease.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is that where land is dezoned, the elected members are not liable to compensation.  However, several options are available if a planning authority is considering changes to its development plan.  It can dezone the land or zone the land for a different use.  Quite often officials can say the land is more appropriate for industrial use than residential use.  The planning authority can consider a prioritisation of development.  In other words, the lands closer to the town centre could be developed sequentially before going to the outskirts.  For example, Clare County Council is examining this option.</P>

	<P>Group 8 relates to taking in charge and housing supply provisions, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 61, 82 to 85, inclusive and 100.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments deal with Part V of the planning Acts relating to taking in charge and housing supply provisions.  Amendment No. 61 provides for an important change to section 96 of the principal Act.  It will ensure the delivery options available under Part V, which deals with housing supply, will fully reflect the wider restructuring of the social housing investment programme.  The shift in emphasis away from an over-reliance on bricks and mortar solutions towards more targeted, flexible supports such as the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and, more recently, long-term leasing is part of the planned restructuring clearly signposted in the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  What is now contained in the Bill in addition to the various options under Part V, including the transfer of land or houses on a permanent basis or, in some case, the payment to a planning authority of a financial contribution, provides that local authorities will be able to take houses in charge on a temporary basis under either RAS or a long-term leasing initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for that information.  I referred to the taking in charge of estates earlier but the bonds local authorities have for developments cannot be drawn down until a permission expires.  That has a serious impact on the taking in charge of estates.  For example, if 80% of an estate is completed and residents are trying to put pressure on the local authority to enforce the conditions of the permission where the deadline for the permission is almost up, the local authority can put pressure on the developer to finish the estate.</P>
      
        <P>If we extend that permission another three or five years, that will lengthen the process for the estate to be taken in charge.  The Minister of State has said we do not want to extend permission just to allow developers do nothing for another three or five years, but that will be the consequence of any extensions.  As a result, we will have hold ups in the taking in charge of estates.  This needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The bond issue also needs to be addressed.  I understand from anecdotal evidence that local authorities do not secure sufficient bonds to ensure that if the estate is seriously deficient in infrastructure, it can be completed.  The bonds must be strong enough to be able to ensure proper and full completion of the estate.  This is another lesson of the property bubble from which we need to learn and I urge the Minister of State to take it into account.</P>
        <P>Part V provisions were mentioned in connection with housing provisions.  Throughout the country local authorities have been left with housing stock on their hands.  They have been left holding the baby in that regard or have been left in contract to take these houses for which there is no demand in large expansive housing estates.  This issue needs to be addressed, but I <Col N="562"/>am not aware whether this Bill does so.  Local authority housing taken under Part V provisions was originally taken as part of an integration process for social and affordable housing.  Does the Bill allow those Part V houses to be sold and is legislation required to facilitate that or is it just a matter of the local authority requesting the permission of the Department or Minister to sell them or find an alternative use for them?  Will the Minister of State clarify that for me today or some other day?</P></Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Surplus Part V stock is now being directed towards social housing.  With regard to whether local authorities can simply sell off that stock, I do not have that information to hand and will come back to the Deputy on it.</P>

	<P>We move on to group 9 which relates to An Bord Plean&aacute;la membership, oral hearings and fees.  Amendments Nos. 62 to 64, inclusive, 66, and 67 are the pertinent amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This grouping of five amendments relates to issues concerning An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  They empower the Minister to appoint additional members urgently on a short-term basis to deal with areas of significant activity in the economy and empowers him to reduce membership where appropriate.  We are also amending the principal Act, through section 106, to empower the Minister to appoint a person with satisfactory experience, competence or qualifications relevant to environmental sustainability issues to be an ordinary member of the board.  That involves a consequential, technical amendment.  We are also expanding the list of matters under the principal Act under which the board can determine and charge a fee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the efforts being made to make An Bord Plean&aacute;la more efficient.  In the past there have been backlogs and delays, but that may have been due to the amount of development taking place.  I have no problem with legislation that will improve efficiency and the decision making process within the board.  However, we in the Fine Gael Party think it a retrograde step to reduce the number of board members required to make decisions, even in the case of small appeals.  This legislation allows for two members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make a decision rather than the heretofore requirement of three members.  We believe it creates a democratic deficit to allow just two members make the decision.  Basically, on any committee there is always an odd number making decisions, or at least someone with a casting vote.  Reducing the requirement for making a decision to two members is a retrograde step.  I understand the logic behind it was to allow greater efficiency by requiring fewer members, but it creates an issue with regard to decision making.  There should be at least three members so as to be able to have a natural majority, whether for or against a decision.</P>
        <P>I would also, without mentioning a specific case, like to highlight the fact that proper records of meetings where decisions were made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la were not kept, yet some of these decisions exposed the taxpayer to high costs due to cases being taken to the High Court.  Proper records and minutes of meetings held by An Bord Plean&aacute;la members when they made decisions were not always kept.  They may have made the right decisions or may not.  Proper records were not kept and proper procedures were not followed in a case in Kildare, for example.  Any efficient measures or procedures introduced through legislation to ensure a proper and transparent process are welcome.</P>

	<P>I apologise to the Minister of State who is not responsible for what has happened.  However, it is impossible to participate in debate when one cannot rely on the monitors we all use when we are not present in the House.  I understand group 9 amendments have to do with An Bord Plean&aacute;la membership, oral hearings and fees.  Generally we see much of this Bill as being progressive in import, but there has been a difficulty &mdash; in terms of the lack of scrutiny that has been enabled &mdash; for both Houses.  Given that 90 amendments were never reached in the D&aacute;il and given the number of amendments made by the D&aacute;il with which we are presented now, it is essentially a new Bill that has come before the Seanad today.  Given it is a Bill that started in the Seanad and on which we had an opportunity to debate amendments previously, it is unfortunate we are confronted with such a volume of new amendments at this stage.</P>
        <P>Some of the amendments deserve more scrutiny, particularly amendments which could have the effect of limiting access to the courts for individual litigants, particularly environmentalists.  These are a serious concern.  With respect, I refer, in particular, to amendment No. 57 to section 33 of the Bill because the new section 50B it inserts will have a seriously chilling effect on litigation in the environmental field.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

	<P>I take the point being made by Senator Norris that this is also relevant to group 11 and will wait to speak further on it when we reach that group.  Having made the point, it is unfortunate we are faced with pressure to complete this.  I know we are short of time and that this is the last sitting day.  I do not want to lay the issue at the Minister of State&rsquo;s door, but it is most unfortunate that a Bill of this import, with the sort of impact it will have on local democracy, is being rushed through in this way and that we are faced with amendments which were never scrutinised in the D&aacute;il and with which we are confronted for the first time.</P>

	<P>On a point of clarification, nothing is being rushed through.  We have been here for the past number of hours and have had an excellent debate on all of the <Col N="564"/>groupings.  If somebody missed a grouping, perhaps that person should take closer cognisance of what is going on in the House.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister of State to clarify something relating to the planning process.  Councils are obliged to make a decision on a planning application within a two-month period.  However, there is no statutory obligation on An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make a decision within a certain time and as a result it can take up to a year or longer for it to make a decision.  In these economically dismal times, it is important that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is statutorily obliged to work within a specific timeframe and provide quicker decisions.  Will the Minister of State address this point?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always cognisant that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is a quasi-judicial body and that it must carefully evaluate the case before it.  For many, the board is the final adjudicator on their application or on an application in which they take an interest.  The Bill introduces more flexibility to ramp up the staffing of the board at a time when it has a lot of cases or, conversely, when the demand is not as great.  This introduction of greater flexibility to the board will result in more timely decision making, but I would be cautious on the issue of laying down a guillotine by which decisions would be made.  The board has an objective target of 18 weeks and this was achieved in 60% of cases.</P>

Amendments Nos. 70 and 71 amend sections 157 and 160 of the principal Act, respectively, to remove the seven-year limit for enforcement in respect of quarries and peat extraction, because of the damaging nature of these activities.</P>

	<P>This is like bingo night.  Amendments Nos. 86 to 92, inclusive and amendment No. 105 technically amend sections 181A, 181B, 181C, 182A and 182C, of the principal Act to comply with the new appropriate assessment provisions being introduced in this Bill.  Also under group 11, amendment No. 91 amends section 182C to provide that the board must determine that a proposed development satisfies the criteria set out in section 37A(2) prior to acceptance of the application for approval for a strategic gas infrastructure <Col N="565"/>development.  Amendments Nos. 90, 92 and 105 provide further technical amendments to sections 182B and 182D of the principal Act and to section 47DD of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 to comply with the new appropriate assessment provisions being introduced in this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested particularly in the alterations to section 33 and the introduction of a new section 50B.  This relates to cost recovery and, as I mentioned at the beginning of this debate, the whole matter of the way in which we implement European regulations and directives that require planning decisions to be fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive.  The problem is the section operates on the assumption that adequate compliance is granted with Article 10A, in the sense that applicants can be protected from legal costs ordered against them and that Article 10A does not require that applicants are assisted with their own legal costs.  There is a real question about this and whether the section in fact amounts to compliance by Ireland at all.  People can be accruing costs for their own side and this only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I understood this was dealing with cost recovery, according to the helpful note.  If it is dealing with cost recovery then it certainly should deal with this matter.  My brief states that the cumulative effect of the provisions may well be to reduce the capacity of the public to challenge important planning decisions because of the question of costs recovery.  If this is incorrect, I am happy to stand corrected but it states very clearly, cost recovery, consultation and directive requirements.</P>

	<P>To which particular amendment is the Senator speaking?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am dealing with group 11 amendments.  My briefing notes state that this is the subject matter of these amendments.  If I am wrong, then I apologise but this is what the advice states.  In any case, the principle certainly stands.  For example, if a litigant, an applicant for review, is successful, it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that he or she can recover the costs incurred in making a legal challenge.  Otherwise the applicant&rsquo;s full costs spent on lawyers and other necessary environmental experts can never be recovered.  This replaces the ordinary rule whereby a successful applicant is only entitled to recover the cost of proceedings.  The position of the ordinary citizen is actually disadvantaged as a result of this amendment.  I am sorry if I have got it wrong but if I have, it is under official advice.  I am talking specifically about the new section 50B introduced in section 33, if the Minister of State is interested in seeing it.  What about people who may well conduct their proceedings successfully, briefly and efficiently but in most cases at a heavy cost to themselves, unless they choose to do so without a lawyer?  That is the effect of this new amendment.  I am very concerned about that because there may be something unintentional here and the interests of ordinary citizens may be militated against unintentionally by the operation of the new section.</P>
        <P>In light of this, there should be a specific transitional provision.  The Act could apply to proceedings instituted after the commencement or to proceedings issued in respect of acts or omissions which occurred after commencement.  The latter would seem to be preferable as using the former would create an incentive to institute proceedings in a rush to have them <Col N="566"/>started pre-commencement.  In other words, it could be used as an incentive and this would have a very bad impact, although an unintentional one, on the legislation.  I bow to the authority of the Chair and I am sorry if this is in the wrong place.  I do not believe it is.  Either one set of information I have given is correct and the other is incorrect but I was given it and, as a parliamentarian, I accept the advice I am given by people who know better.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo what Senator Norris has said on the issue of cost recovery and on section 33.  I agree it gives cause for concern.  It is about how the Bill is implementing the provisions of the directive.  There is a concern and it has been raised with me by environmentalists and others that the Bill may be in breach of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention guaranteeing access to justice because of the change it makes.  Although it protects applicants from legal costs orders against them, as required by the directive, the section really does not do this.  The effect of the section will be to exacerbate and worsen the power imbalance that exists between individual environmentalists who litigate and the developers against whom they are generally litigating.  Following the bringing into force of this section, which was not, I understand, debated in the D&aacute;il, the environmentalists will be left with no option but to represent themselves in court.  There will be significant costs, especially to a solicitor, in taking on a case like this, such as overheads and so on.  Many solicitors, as we know, may do that currently on a no foal, no fee basis.  There is a concern about access to justice and about its effect upon that.  Senator Norris has put it very well.  The provisions in some of the amendments in this group 11 refer to reasonable costs.  We all agree that costs have to be reasonable and there has been recent reporting about the scandalously high level of legal costs in particular cases.  I query as to who determines this.  I see it as a theme running through the Bill.  The board will determine the matter, according to amendments Nos. 90 and 91.  That is why we need to scrutinise provisions to ensure they will not have a chilling effect on environmental litigation or worsen the power and money imbalance between the majority of individual litigants in such cases and the people against whom and the organisations and companies against which they litigate.  We must be careful to ensure we are adequately complying with the directive and not worsening the power imbalance and obstructing litigants in taking action in planning cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Acting Chairman has shown significant, if not exceptional, latitude in allowing speakers to raise significant issues in commenting on a new subsection, inserted in all three sections, which requires An Bord Plean&aacute;la to state the reasons for its decisions and it is attaching related conditions.  The subsection also empowers it to recover its costs.  In the interests of permitting discourse and debate on the significant issues to which the Senators referred, I will refer to section 50B.</P>
        <P>The question was asked why the new cost rule was required.  Its genesis is in Article 10A of the EIA directive which was inserted by the so-called public participation directive, 2003/35/EC.  Member states are required to provide for a review procedure that is not prohibitively expensive.  Specifically, the new rule is required to ensure Ireland complies with the judgment of the European Court of Justice.  Ireland was the subject of EU infringement proceedings relating to the public participation directive which culminated in the judgment of the European Court of Justice last summer, which upheld the system of judicial review as a suitable review mechanism <Col N="567"/>for the purposes of the directive.  The court ruled that the judicial review procedure did not meet the requirement that it not be prohibitively expensive.  The amendment seeks to remove the cost barrier by ensuring applicants will only be responsible at most for their own legal costs when they initiate judicial review proceedings.  The court retains discretion to make a different cost order in specified circumstances.  The amendment aims to avoid providing an undue incentive to initiate judicial review proceedings but also removes the very real risk that if the current cost rules were to be litigated before the European Court of Justice, they would be found to be in breach of the terms of the public participation directive.</P>
        <P>How will this impact on individuals and NGOs in seeking to challenge decisions?  In practice, anyone seeking a judicial review of a decision covered by the new rule will have clarity in advance on the legal costs to be incurred.  Regardless of whether they are successful, such individuals will only be responsible for their own costs.  Some have asked if this will have a negative impact on <i>pro bono</i> representation.  The legal profession has a proud history of providing its services without charge, <i>pro bono publico</i>.  A majority of judicial review applications challenging planning decisions fail and in most cases the lawyers involved will not receive payment.  Notwithstanding this, there is no evidence that applicants will not be able to secure legal representation because practitioners are willing to give of their time and provide their services <i>pro bono publico</i>.  In practice, the deterrent to engaging in judicial review proceedings is not a supposed difficulty in securing legal representation but rather the risk of exposure to liability for the costs of the other side.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to respond on the arguments made by Senator Norris and me.  The provision may have a chilling effect, even though this is not the intention of the Minister of State.  Subsection (4) which changes the entitlement of the court to award costs in favour of a party significantly raises the bar in terms of when costs can be awarded.  I do not practise in this area, but many who do, particularly barristers, do <i>pro bono</i> work.  It is asking a lot of a solicitor who may have significant overheads in running a case such as this to bear these costs or to insist that litigants bear their own costs because there will be no prospect of winning unless one gets over this very high bar.  Subsection (4) may have the unforeseen chilling effect of preventing or obstructing litigation other than by those who have sufficient money to bear their costs.  I accept the points made by the Minister of State that in most cases it will prevent costs being awarded against people.  That is an advance, but subsection (4) sets the bar too high.</P>

	<P>It is a challenge to respond to the judgment of the European Court of Justice, but a balance must be struck.  We do not want to see the courts being clogged by judicial review proceedings.  How can we strike the right balance?  This brings us back to the definition of <i>pro bono publico</i>, which means one is acting for the public interest.  We must wait and see how this works in practice.  I hope it will represent a suitable transposition of the directive which the Green Party wants to be implemented in a consistent, robust and democratic fashion.</P>

	<P>I bent the rules a little bit in allowing Senator Bacik to speak twice on Report Stage, as there is a voluminous number of amendments, which is unusual.  I will allow Senator Dearey latitude also, as this is an important matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>This presents a challenge to our party.  We all have a background in activism and have been the beneficiaries of <i>pro bono</i> work, in my case in the action against the Sellafield plant which was of exceptional public interest, as was the case concerning Mul<Col N="568"/>laghmore and several others.  I do not know how high the hurdle is, but it will be interesting to see how the provision will be interpreted.  The public participation directive is a difficult one for people from my political tradition to grapple with and embrace by allowing the public interest to be served by allowing legal challenges to be taken on a <i>pro bono</i> basis.  I recognise that in many instances this will remove any prospect of receiving payment to cover administration costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>In support of the motion and on behalf of Fine Gael Senators, I welcome this report.  The Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests of Seanad &Eacute;ireann has done very good work and has acted expeditiously.  This was an issue that did damage to the House and it is important that it was dealt with quickly and decisively which is what the committee did.  It also took a decision on grounds that are sustainable.</P>
        <P>It is also important that for the first time in many years Members are prepared to hold their own colleagues to account.  What will come as a surprise to people, however, is that the penalty of suspension is as far as this committee and the House can go.  There is an issue of the repayment of moneys which were claimed in expenses and deemed inappropriate.  In this case, it was an intentional act, grave and serious and not in good faith.  Furthermore, for a lot less, people are amenable to the courts.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the issue of repayment should be addressed.  The other authorities which are appraised of this case, the committee&rsquo;s report and the decision of this House should follow up on this matter.  The committee has done good work and there is no hesitation on this side of the House in supporting this motion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for taking time to take this matter.</P>
        <P>The decision by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, to place an embargo on Fingal County Council&rsquo;s spending accumulated planning levies is a disgrace.  It is also of questionable legality.  It has had an appalling effect on communities that have been working for, and had been promised, much-needed community based facilities.</P>
        <P>One of those communities is the Brackenstown community.  For years, residents of Brackenstown, Swords have been campaigning for and working towards the provision of their own community centre to meet the community, sporting and recreational needs of the area.</P><Col N="572"/>
        <P>Brackenstown parish includes St. Cronan&rsquo;s, Abbeylea, Ardcian, Brackenstown itself, Daleview, Elmwood, Glasmore, Rathbeale, Oakwood, St. Columba&rsquo;s, Windmill Lands, Swords Manor, Ormonde, Berwick, Abbeyvale, Parkview, Pinegrove, Applewood, Knocksedan, Lioscian, Bunbury Gate and Mooretown.  It has in the region of 3,600 houses, with an estimated population of 15,000.</P>
        <P>For a long time the local soccer club, Swords Manor, had no pitches.  Pitches have now been provided by the local authority, but they still have no proper dressing room facilities.  The only facilities available in the area are provided by BASE, Brackenstown Adult Scene of Education, which provides rooms for community activities.  Facilities for the youth of the area are totally inadequate.</P>
        <P>Those young people who are not interested in sport are hanging around and open to the temptation of anti-social behaviour and possibly more serious crime.  Parents in the area are extremely worried about that possibility.  The local community has been involved in local fund-raising over the years, and Fingal County Council has responded to the situation after a long battle by local activists and public representatives of all parties.</P>
        <P>Following many difficulties a site was identified and commitments were given by Fingal County Council.  Community leaders and activists were told that they are top of the list of priorities for community facilities in the area.  Moneys were identified and ring-fenced for the project.  Approval was given for the project by the council and councillors.  Planning permission was lodged and granted last year.</P>
        <P>Expectation grew that the first sod was to be turned in September of this year, but then the rug was pulled from under the community by the Department.  A directive was issued by the Minister that moneys collected in development levies relating to previous years, and banked for those specific purposes, could not be spent.  That is nothing short of a disgrace.  It is a scandal.  As I said previously, in my view it is of questionable legality.</P>
        <P>The council has the money which it has raised from development levies.  It wants to spend it on this project, but the Minister has frozen it.  Where does subsidiarity come into it?  Why is the Minister not allowing the council to manage its own affairs?  It is quite capable of doing so in my view, and I know this council very well.</P>
        <P>We all know that housing developments eventually result in communities.  How long should they have to wait for community facilities?  The first estate in this area was built in 1973.  Development levies are part of the planning process and are an important resource for local authorities to provide community facilities.</P>
        <P>On the day the Minister has brought the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill through the Houses and into law, I call on him to lift the embargo immediately and allow this much-needed facility to go ahead without further delay.</P>
        <P>The Brackenstown community is waiting long enough.  All the community groups are signed up.  They have a viable business plan which has been accepted by the council.  They are<?oasys _jy ?>ready to go, as is Fingal County Council.  I ask the Minister to let them off and give them the go-ahead.</P>
        <P>I spoke to an activist from Brackenstown today and asked her what she would like me to say to the Minister on this matter tonight.  She said:</P><Col N="573"/>
        <P LI="1">Ask him to think of the young people of the area now.  Our children are disillusioned.  Tell him that I fear what will happen in the area over the next number of years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I begin I would like to pay tribute to all the officials and staff who contributed to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill which was passed in the House earlier.  I did not get an opportunity to put my thanks on the record of the House and I do so now.</P>
        <P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.</P>
        <P>The short answer to the Senator&rsquo;s question is the Stability and Growth Pact but I will go into some detail in the reply.</P>
        <P>I begin by pointing out to the House that capital funding to local authorities has not been frozen.  In 2010 local authorities have budgeted for capital expenditure of around &euro;4 billion.  That will be financed through grants, loans and other capital income.</P>
        <P>In February 2009, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to their overall management of capital and current accounts.  These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht treaty, and the associated limitation on budget<?oasys _jy ?>deficits.</P>
        <P>The Government set a limit of &euro;200 million for the contribution of the local government sector to the deterioration in the general Government balance, GGB, in any one year.  This was not a new requirement.  However, the downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally required a sharp focus in all sectors, including local authorities, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.</P>
        <P>In order to stay within the overall GGB limits, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance.  Development contributions, which the Minister understands are at issue in this case, were an important addition to the capital funding resources of local authorities in recent years, but were only one element.  There is no specific prohibition on any local authority spending development contributions <i>per se</i>.  The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income must equal capital expenditure in the year.</P>
        <P>Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their own development contributions as an element of their overall investment programme.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities themselves.</P>
        <P>Within the overall limits there is additional capacity for non-mortgage borrowing by local authorities.  Subject to the maintenance of balanced current and capital accounts, and allowing for the repayment of existing borrowings, up to &euro;250 million in new loan finance can be made available to the local government sector annually to fund capital investment in necessary infrastructure projects.</P>
        <P>For 2010, the process of prioritising loan applications for such projects has already been completed.  During this process the Department has been guided by local authorities in respect <Col N="574"/>of the most critical projects requiring funding at this time.  Final sanction to local authorities to draw down loan financing is being provided as required throughout the year.</P>
        <P>While the Minister appreciates that these GGB requirements impose limitations on local authorities, there are considerable funding constraints at all levels of Government and local authorities cannot be immune to the effects of the downturn in the economy.</P>
        <P>As the Minister has already indicated, it is a matter for every local authority, including Fingal County Council, to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out here.  In this regard it may be of interest to the House to note that in 2010 so far some &euro;15 million in new loan financing has been allocated to Fingal County Council for capital investment projects.</P>
        <P>The Department will continue to work with all local authorities to ensure that, within the context of the overall GGB requirements, decisions on matters of capital investment are taken in a way which maximises available resources and gives the necessary prioritisation to the environmental, economic and social infrastructure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, Fingal County Council does not require loan financing.  It has the money from previous development levies.  It has made several cases to the Department to spend that money.  It was disallowed from doing so and therefore loans are not appropriate.</P>
        <P>In terms of a specific answer to a question relating to this matter, Fingal County Council stated that the project cannot be advanced at the moment because of the freezing of capital funds as instructed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I have nothing further to say on the matter but I ask the Minister of State to raise the matter with his senior Minister and tell him that if there is a misunderstanding between Fingal County Council and the Department, it should be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>On that point, balance is only required at an overall level.  There is considerable flexibility for local authorities to make decisions as to how they wish to minimise spending in some areas to maximise spending in other areas.  We do not micro-manage the local authorities.  We leave it to them to decide how they will spend their money.  The local authority in this instance does intend spending &euro;15 million and therefore there is some flexibility in the way it goes about that work.</P>
        <P>The big picture, however, is the Stability and Growth Pact and we cannot ignore the wider economic picture.  I know that means tough decisions have to be made in some cases but they have to be made at all levels of Government expenditure.  As I am sure Senator Ryan is well aware, 80% of the Government budget goes on health, social welfare and education.  There are tough decisions to be made but we have to get Ireland through these difficulties in order to emerge and create employment in the future.</P>

    <Title>Semi-State Bodies</Title>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The matter I wish to raise is one with which he will have some familiarity because he was a member of the Joint Committee on <Col N="575"/>Transport in a former life.  The issue is the refusal of the non-executive directors of CIE to appear before the Joint Committee on Transport.  I regard this as an extraordinarily serious issue.  These non-executive directors were asked by the committee to appear before it to answer some extremely sensitive but important questions about the running of CIE and the conduct of its executives.  Their refusal to do so is a straightforward two fingers not only to the committee but to the Houses.  I do not know of any precedent where employees of the State or of semi-State bodies have said they will not appear before a committee in such a case.  The company of which they are non-executive directors is under a cloud because of corruption that has been found to exist by a group of independent consultants who were employed to find out the extent of corruption in CIE.</P>
        <P>The questions that have to be answered are multiple, not only relating to the corporate governance of CIE during that period but also relating to the knowledge of the non-executive directors about what was going on.  The evidence at present about the knowledge of the non-executive directors indicates they did not know what was happening and that they had not seen the Baker Tilly report on the corruption.  What is necessary to know and what we are entitled to know as taxpayers and as Members of the Oireachtas is how much they knew and whether they were doing their jobs.</P>
        <P>The chairman of CIE appeared before the committee after the publication of the Baker Tilly report on corruption and losses at Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann of at least &euro;2.7 million, with an earlier draft stating &euro;8.6 million.  After that report, the chairman was asked about the knowledge of the non-executive directors.  He stated they had received the report after it was issued.  He then clarified that they had not received the Baker Tilly report.  Not only had they not received the Baker Tilly report, the Minister had not received it either.  This was a report into corruption at one of the State&rsquo;s most heavily subsidised companies and even the Minister did not know what was going on.  He did not know about the report, he had not read it and he did not know the cost of the report, which at &euro;500,000 must be a world record.</P>
        <P>What is happening is that political appointees, and all of the people we are looking for are political appointees, who earn &euro;17,000 a year from the State &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; are being asked by the State&rsquo;s representatives, that is Deputies and Senators, to come in and explain their stewardship of a company which receives &euro;300 million, and they are saying to go jump in a lake, that they will not do it, that they are not answerable and will not answer the questions that are necessary.  There is no excuse for this.  What is going on in CIE is very murky.  There is a continuing dispute in CIE, particularly in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, about whether the losses reported on by Baker Tilly were &euro;2.7 million or &euro;8.6 million.  The evidence is contradictory.  In the earlier report Baker Tilly found it was &euro;8.6 million and in the later report, when it was picked up on by CIE, it was found to be &euro;2.7 million because CIE or Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann stated it was two different things.  It is a really sorry situation.</P>
        <P>There are two groups of people who can clarify this.  One is the group which brought in Baker Tilly and told it the terms of reference were wrong.  This group comprises three people, all of whom are employees of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, one of whom had a court case against Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann which has just been settled.  He has been asked to appear before the committee and it is hoped he will agree to do so in September.  He may shed some light on this.  The other people who can shed real light on this are the non-executive directors.  They can also shed light on their own participation in board decisions and on whether they are simply passengers or sleepers in this controversy.</P><Col N="576"/>
        <P>This goes to the root of whether Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is being run by a cabal or small executive of very powerful people, or whether the non-executive directors are hands on and know what is happening.  It seems to me that by their refusal to appear before the committee, they have reneged on their duty to the Minister and to the State.  The appropriate action for the Minister to take now is to sack them and replace them with people who are prepared to be transparent, appear before the committee and answer questions which tell us what is happening with this very important but extraordinarily expensive drain on taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The executive chairman of CIE, Dr. John Lynch, has regularly made himself available to the Joint Committee on Transport on a variety of issues relating to the CIE group.  Since September 2009 he has appeared before the committee on four occasions.  It is accepted practice that the chairman and chief executives of State companies appear as requested before Oireachtas committees to represent the State body concerned.  For example, in enacting the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, which provided for the setting up of the Dublin Transport Authority, now the National Transport Authority, the Oireachtas provided under section 41 that the chairperson and chief executive would appear before Oireachtas committees as required.  No provision was made for entire boards or individual non-executive directors to appear before Oireachtas committees.  It would be entirely inappropriate, therefore, for the Minister for Transport to dismiss the non-executive directors of CIE.</P>
        <P>The Minister received a copy of the Baker Tilly Ryan Glennon report into procurement practices in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in October 2009 and arranged for a copy, with some deletions for legal reasons, to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.  The chairman and chief executive of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have been before the committee on two occasions regarding the issue of procurement practices at the company.  The chairman of the board audit committee appeared at the last such meeting in December 2009, together with the chairman and senior management of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister sought and received from the board of CIE a full report, dated 15 January 2010, on the background to the Baker Tilly Ryan Glennon report and the state of implementation of its recommendations.  A copy of this report was provided to the Committee of Public Accounts and to the Joint Committee on Transport.  The Minister is satisfied that the CIE board has taken the necessary steps to ensure adherence to the procurement requirements detailed in the code of practice.</P>
        <P>There are a range of measures in place to ensure CIE accounts for the discharge of its functions, including annual reports and accounts which are placed before the Oireachtas, annual reports by the chairman certifying compliance with code of practice requirements, regular appearances before Oireachtas committees, and annual audit of accounts by independent auditors.</P>
        <P>Dr. John Lynch was re-appointed by the Government as chairman of CIE, as executive chairman of the company and as chairman of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, for a maximum period of one year until 28 March 2011.  The reappointment of Dr. Lynch is to ensure continuity at this critical juncture in the implementation of the cost recovery measures under way and planned across the CIE group.  The successful implementation of these measures is critical for the financial viability of the group.</P>
        <P>During his ten-year period in office, the chairman has overseen a transformation in the quality and reliability of bus and rail services.  Major projects have been delivered on time and within budget, including a major revitalisation of the railway service with Exchequer support and the renewal of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann fleets.  The Minister is satisfied that as regards <Col N="577"/>its obligations to Oireachtas committees, the CIE board has complied with all reasonable requests relating to the issue of procurement within the CIE group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, the reply did not answer the question and the Minister of State should be ashamed of himself for reading that script given to him by the Department of Transport.  The issue here is not whether it is compliant.  As he stated, CIE complied with all requests about procurement.  The issue here is whether non-executive directors &mdash; take CIE out of the equation &mdash; should appear before and be answerable to Oireachtas committees.  Is the Minister of State telling me he and the Government approves of them saying they will not appear and be answerable and transparent in these or any situations?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe.  It is not a personal attack on him, but when I put down an Adjournment motion and there is not a Minister from the relevant Department present, I always place on record that one should be here.  I have never been involved in a debate with Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, and I hope he will have positive news for me on this issue.</P>
        <P>It concerns the fallout from a number of scandals in private nursing homes across the country.  The State correctly took a decision to introduce standards of care for patients in both public and private nursing homes across the State and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the body that is responsible for implementing these standards.  Everybody accepts they are necessary and that nursing homes, be they private or public, should have minimum standards of care for their patients.</P>
        <P>The reason for this motion is that there is another group of facilities which cater for older persons and which are not nursing homes, but which provide a form of sheltered accommodation, and these are called supported care homes.  No provision has been made, as I under<Col N="578"/>stand it, in the legislation or regulations dealing with nursing homes for this category.  There is a number of them around the country.  There is a concentration of them in Kilkenny because the late Dr. Peter Birch, as Bishop of Ossory, was a forward-thinking man in the early 1980s and he donated much church property to local communities, and these supported care homes were developed in those communities.</P>
        <P>My difficulty, and the difficulty that these facilities are having at present, is that the HIQA standards for nursing homes are being applied to these supported care homes.  The difference is that nursing homes require 24-hour nursing care to be available for patients.  Most of the residents &mdash; they are not patients &mdash; in the supported care homes live independently.  Most of them leave the homes during the daytime, go to the shop, to the post office, mix with their friends and go for a drink, but they are not capable of independent living for one reason or another, and they get meals provided communally every day.  Indeed, in many such homes, at least in Kilkenny, other elderly persons in the community come into the facilities for the provision of services during the daytime.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that these particular homes are faced with a stark situation at present.  They will either have to double, or possibly increase even further than that, the charges to their residents or some of them will have to consider the possibility of closure.  Between the five homes in Kilkenny of which I speak, namely the O&rsquo;Gorman Home in Ballyragget, Prague House, Freshford, Mount Carmel of Callan, St. Joseph&rsquo;s, Kilmaganny and Gahan House in Graighnamanagh, there are over 100 full-time residents, but they cater for a much larger number of people who come in for day-care facilities and services.  If these homes are forced to close, obviously, it will be a considerable loss to the local communities concerned.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will be able to provide clarification.  I have sought direction from the Department of Health and Children on this issue over the past few months and I have not got a satisfactory answer.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for taking my Adjournment motion concerning these fantastic facilities.  In many instances, much of the work that goes into these facilities is voluntary.  They raise much of the funding independently through local fund-raising efforts.</P>
        <P>What they really want is not no standards because they accept there must be standards for them, but that account be taken that they do not provide 24-hour nursing care.  If a resident becomes ill, he or she goes to the acute hospital or goes to a nursing home, be it public or private.  If they require that level of care and support, they leave this sheltered accommodation.  They want standards that are suitable for the type of care these institutions provide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and to support access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  The Government places great importance on the policies and practical reforms we are implementing to ensure patient safety and quality-assured health services.</P>
        <P>The Minister assumes the issue the Senator is referring to is the registration and inspection regime in respect of designated centres for older people, or nursing homes.</P>
        <P>It is important to have effective mechanisms to maintain and enhance public confidence in the delivery of quality residential care.  Residents, their families and the public need to be <Col N="579"/>reassured that the authority is monitoring the care people receive.  The Health Act 2007 provides this, with a regime designed to protect the public through an independent inspection and registration system for residential services.  The primary legislation also defines what is a designated centre, and this includes an institution at which residential services are provided.</P>
        <P>On 1 July 2009, statutory responsibility was given to the chief inspector of social services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority, for inspecting and registering nursing homes.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising the Health Act 2007, the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 and the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Over the past year the system, nature, frequency and duration of inspections have changed.  Some homes may receive just one inspection a year, others may have four or five, depending on risk analysis and their previous inspection history.  The formal inspections may also last a number of days.  HIQA has advised the Department of Health and Children that between 1 July 2009 and 28 May 2010, it carried out 548 inspections covering 371 centres.</P>
        <P>The standards themselves acknowledge the unique and complex needs of the individual person at the centre of care, and require service providers to deliver a person-centred and comprehensive service that promotes health, well-being and quality of life.  They are about much more than infrastructure.  They are patient-centred, providing a blueprint for the provision of a higher standard of care delivered against a set of understood and developed criteria, designed to improve and enhance care and to recognise good practice.  They are evidence based, and identify whether the best services possible are being delivered in an effective and appropriate<?oasys _jy ?>way.</P>
        <P>National standards are set by HIQA and under section 10 of the Health Act 2007, it is required to submit proposed standards for the Minister for Health and Children for approval.  She approved the current ones on 17 February 2009.  The authority has confirmed it will not be reviewing them in 2010.  However, it is intended that the Department of Health and Children will commence a review of the care and welfare regulations later this year.</P>
        <P>All nursing homes for older people are subject to the same core standards on quality and safety.  The Minister is sure the Senator will agree lessons had to be learned from the well publicised incidents in nursing homes over the last few years and from reports such as that of the Leas Cross commission of investigation, published just last year.  This new system of regulation and inspection is to underpin quality and safety for residents in nursing homes.</P>
        <P>The Minister reassures the House that the residents are our primary concern.  Quality care and patient safety come first with all residents receiving the same high standard of quality-assured care.  It is my hope the progress we have made will reassure older people and their families that high quality care is available and will make the transition from independent living a less daunting prospect.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to thank the staff of the Seanad and everyone involved in the running of the Houses for all their care and work during the year and wish everyone the best for the summer recess.</P>
