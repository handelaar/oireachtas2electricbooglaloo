      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact we have an opportunity to debate the banking crisis tomorrow.  We should also have an opportunity to discuss the agreement reached yesterday.</P>
        <P>Many days are described as momentous in politics, but clearly for this country, its citizens and the economy, today is a momentous day.  We heard the disturbing news this morning about the Quinn Insurance Group.  I raised the future of that group on the Order of Business here some time ago, and the connections between that business and Anglo Irish Bank, and what this would mean for the future of the industry.  We will need to discuss this in detail in the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When we read about the billions of euro to be poured into the banking sector, today is a culmination of the failed policies of the Government over many years, the greed of bankers, poor decision making, poor management and the poor monitoring of our economy.  The taxpayer and our children will carry this burden.  If we look at the total amounts that are going into the banking sector, we are talking about &euro;47,000 for every family in the country.  If we look at what is proposed for Anglo Irish Bank, we are talking about &euro;18,750 per family.  When we talk about billions of euro, we forget what these billions could do if they were directed properly.  There have been cutbacks in social welfare, the Christmas bonus was abolished, the medical card was taken from those over 70, while access to special needs has been reduced.  Fine Gael does not believe that &euro;30 billion should be poured into a failed bank like Anglo Irish Bank.  We believe that this money should be redirected into the areas I have mentioned and into the development of our infrastructure to create jobs.  It is not right for the Irish taxpayer to carry the mistakes of Sean FitzPatrick&rsquo;s bank and other bankers.  This is the wrong <Col N="865"/>decision, but we will have an opportunity tomorrow to discuss this in detail when we hear what the Minister has to say this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>For the last six months, a number of us here have been calling for everybody to move in the same direction to deal with the economy, and I refer in particular to the social partners.  Senator Marc MacSharry has raised this many times and Senator Buttimer has done so as well.  It is good to acknowledge the progress that has been made today.</P>
        <P>It is discouraging to hear the response from the media.  All the interviews to date have been to the effect that this is no deal at all and why anyone would accept it.  Perhaps it is good to know this because it will be very difficult to sell to the membership of the trade unions.  I commend the union leadership for putting the economy and the country first by backing this agreement in these troubled times.  The Government has finally seen sense and recognised the importance of this.</P>
        <P>Selling the agreement might be more difficult because everything was new before Christmas, but everyone is aware of it now.  People are looking down the muzzle of job losses in the public sector and huge amounts of flexibility taking place.  I hope these things happen, and I will do what I can to support it.  We should acknowledge today that we are moving forward.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the important issue of the Quinn Group, which is something she and others have done before.  I should declare that I have a remote interest in this in that I am vice-chair of the Injuries Board, which deals with this company all the time.  I hope the Leader of the House will support my viewpoint because he chaired an important committee on insurance in the Lower House a couple of years ago.  The last thing we need in this country is to lose an insurance company.  Insurance has been competitive for the last four or five years.  Five years ago in this House, we were talking about the cost to drivers of trying to get insurance, as well as the cost of insurance for companies and small businesses.  We have finally cracked that but for the past year insurance companies have been using everything, including snow and flooding, to try to make the case for increasing premiums.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Losing a competitive company would be a bad move.  It is important to recognise that this is more of the knock-on infection from Anglo Irish Bank.  Anglo Irish Bank shares were being used by Quinn Insurance as part of its solvency fund.  It should not have done, but did so and acknowledged it last year.  That is the reason the company is now in trouble.  However, this is not liquidation, receivership or examinership &mdash; it is administration.</P>
        <P>I wish to correct one thing because I checked the relevant legislation earlier today.  On the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; somebody was asked if the administrators would consider selling the company.  They gave the impression that this would be one of the things they would consider.  I wish to read into the record, however, the fact that section 3 of the Insurance Act 1983, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">An administrator shall take over the management of the business of the insurer and shall carry on that business as a going concern with a view to placing it on a sound commercial and financial footing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is what is required to be done here.  People should recognise that we need this company and we must ensure it is regulated.  We must also recognise that the Financial Regulator has moved in very quickly.  The company is trading profitably in this country, but is losing money in the UK; that part of the business is going to be closed, while the Irish end of it will be fine.  Meeting the regulation as regards the level of solvency is what has created this problem.  We need to ensure this company is maintained in the competitive insurance market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Today is D-Day for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and how he deals with the Irish banking sector.  As one commentator in <i>The Irish <Col N="866"/>Times</i> put it, it is the most significant day in the country&rsquo;s economic history since the foundation of the State.  We have spoken before in this House about whether we should nationalise the banks.  The fact is, however, that by the Minister&rsquo;s actions today in pumping in over &euro;20 billion to shore up the banks&rsquo; capital, they are in effect being nationalised.  As previous speakers have pointed out, this means that over &euro;6,000 for every man, woman and child in the country will go to propping up the banks.  I am glad the Leader has arranged for a debate on this issue tomorrow because much has changed since we originally debated the NAMA legislation.  Indeed, many Members of this House and the Lower House have also changed their views in this regard.  Yesterday, a leading Government backbencher of 28 years&rsquo; standing announced he does not think the plan is workable.  He is worried about the long-term interests of the banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>He is a bank shareholder. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not share his concerns.  Today&rsquo;s announcement is potentially good news for the Irish taxpayer.  I am glad to see we are having a debate on the issue, however, and I suggest that from this point forward we should have a rolling debate on banks and how we can get out of this crisis. </P>
        <P>People will be relieved by the announcement this morning that the Government and trade unions have come to a draft agreement on public sector reform.  We must salute those officials who have been involved in a marathon task in recent days, and Kieran Mulvey in particular.  Last December, my party said the Government should not have broken off from the talks.  I am worried that the atmosphere has been soured and polluted somewhat since then.  We have seen the outbreak of public sector action, which perhaps could have been avoided if those talks has not been broken off.  I worry that the public sector action may have clouded the whole issue when it comes to discussing the draft agreement.  It is in everybody&rsquo;s interest to move on from here.  The goal of public sector reform has the potential to deliver real benefits to the public, whether they involve passport applications, reform of Revenue services or ensuring people get their social welfare payments on time.  There are great benefits to be gained from getting an agreement between the Government and the public sector.  I hope they can manage to discuss this draft agreement in a positive way and hopefully put it into action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must welcome the draft agreement between the Government and the social partners which was reached yesterday evening.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that some of the reporting on this has been quite peevish.  The need for this agreement is due to the lack of certainty on decisions that have been made over recent months.  People working in the public service needed reassurance that there would not be any further cuts and that any reorganisation of the public service, especially if aimed at making it more effective, would be accompanied by appropriate incentives.  The agreement on the table allows that to happen.  It will now go through a process in which the various social partners will debate the proposal and, it is to be hoped, agree on it.</P>
        <P>A similar process should exist in this and the other House, although this did not happen when previous social partnership agreements were reached.  Especially at this time when important decisions on our economy must be made, the <i>imprimatur</i> of both Houses of the Oireachtas to an agreement of this type, which will be economically important for decades, should be sought and given.  I believe it will be given.</P>
        <P>The decision on the Quinn Insurance Group is worrying and further discussion is needed in the House.  Current events in the banking sector have had an impact in this regard.  The approach of appointing an administrator will be helpful.</P><Col N="867"/>
        <P>Pre-empting the debate the Leader is offering the House tomorrow on NAMA, I will say that today&rsquo;s announcement contains much for Members of this House to consider.  It will show that NAMA as an organisation has been doing its work effectively.  Many of the loans from financial institutions are to be discounted by a far greater amount than was discussed previously.  Recapitalisation in each of the financial institutions will be done on the basis that NAMA has not been oversold and has not acted as a cushion for those who, it is claimed, were bailed out by this process.  It has done its work on behalf of the State well.</P>
        <P>When we discuss the wider issue of the individual banks, the context will be one of continuing disappointment at the efforts of those who have brought us to the state we are in.  There is a realisation on the Government&rsquo;s part that difficult decisions must be made, but they will be the correct decisions because they are part of a process that has seen a series of correct decisions being made in this area.  I hope the debate is not in any way corrupted by comments such as those we have heard along the lines of &ldquo;If we had done X, things would have been easier.&rdquo;  If we had done anything differently, it would have cost the taxpayer far more and would have had a bigger impact now and in the future.  I look forward to the debate tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a serious interest in the issue raised by Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole of the Quinn Insurance Group.  There should be less scaremongering and misinterpretation in the media, which has a destabilising effect.  The Financial Regulator made the application to the courts for an administrator to be appointed.  It is not the banking system as such that has lost confidence in the Quinn Group.  It is about the concerns of the regulator.  That is important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must also consider the positive side of this.  I ask the Leader to ask the relevant Minister to come to the House and make a statement to create confidence in the insurance industry and the Quinn Group.  He must be proactive in dealing with this issue, in conjunction with the regulator and the various other interests, to stabilise the industry.</P>
        <P>This issue is critical to County Cavan because up to 600 people are employed by Quinn Direct insurance, which is a stand-alone company, in Cavan town and 1,200 by the larger Quinn organisation in County Cavan.  The company is of the utmost importance to our county and to the economy.  I know my colleague will be speaking on this as well.  Families and homes are at risk.  There are people around the country who have insurance from Quinn Direct.  Some people have multiple insurance with the company, because Quinn Direct sells a package.  The people employed in Quinn Direct and their families need confidence restored.  They need a statement from the Minister and need the Leader to make a statement after the Order of Business.  We should not dramatise this or present the bad side of it.  The banks have not expressed a lack of confidence, the company has not gone into liquidation and I hope the industry will continue.  The Quinn Group is a very strong firm and I have every confidence it will continue.  That message must go out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I was shocked and saddened to learn this afternoon that an administrator had been appointed to Quinn Insurance.  I know Se&aacute;n Quinn personally.  He is a practical patriot whose initiative, risk taking and investment have created over 7,000 jobs worldwide.  Some 5,500 of those people are employed in Ireland, thousands of whom are employed in County Cavan and the surrounding counties.  The Quinn Group issued a statement today stating that in the context of the continued profitability of the group &mdash; currently in excess of &euro;20 million per month &mdash; it was deeply disappointing that an administrator had been appointed to one of its branches, namely, Quinn Insurance.  The statement went on to point out that the group felt that given time, the issue could have been resolved to the benefit of all concerned.  I appeal, through the Leader, for the Minister with responsibility for this area to be called into the House.  We should put to him the importance of Quinn <Col N="868"/>Insurance and the Quinn Group to the economy.  The Quinn Group is equivalent to five Dells and should be given all the time and support necessary to continue in operation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; today, a Mr. McCann said customers in Ireland would not be affected and that the decision on whether to sell the company would be made in the future.  It is outrageous for him to make this statement within minutes of being appointed as an administrator to the company.  I call on him to withdraw that statement and clarify the situation.  This is a case of administration, not liquidation.  The Financial Regulator has a job to do and is now on site in the company&rsquo;s office in Cavan.  If it was not for Se&aacute;n Quinn, the Financial Regulator and Mr. McCann from Grant Thornton would only see waste ground and bogland when they came to Cavan.  The man we are talking about made that difference through his commitment, initiative and investment in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We often talk about historic days.  This is probably the most historic day I can remember in terms of the life and economic future of the country.  I have just been looking at an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 March by Professor Brian Lucey in which he said the recently revealed figures could only have been written by Pollyanna.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Despite admitting that it expects a 30-per-cent-plus discount on assets to be transferred to NAMA, AIB actually booked provisions less than half that.  Expect much the same to come from the other banks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is what we have now.  The Bank of Ireland has a cynical and dishonest policy of under-declaring its liabilities and bank loans.  It reduced its NAMA bad loans listing from &euro;16 billion to &euro;12 billion.  Anybody looking at the situation would realise the liabilities are greater rather than less.  Why did the bank do this?  It did it because if the liability of &euro;16 billion was accepted, it would wipe out the shareholder funds and it wants to avoid majority takeover by the State.  However, what we are getting is nationalisation by dribs and drabs.  That is the way we are going, but the bank continues to be acutely dishonest and not face reality.  Some of the things the bank is doing, such as selling its profitable overseas investments, may appear to be a good idea in the short term, but doing this reduces the viability of the bank and leaves it to be carried exclusively by the taxpayer.  I am very concerned.  This is an historic day, but I hope it will not be a black day.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The final matter to which I wish to refer is the report of the Law Reform Commission.  Its recommendations will have a number of important repercussions for the work of the House.  My extremely hard working secretary who works a great deal of overtime for which she is never properly compensated by the State was recently called for jury service, which is inappropriate.  In view of the inadequate nature of the backup services available to us, as parliamentarians, it is not appropriate to remove the very important support we receive from the secretarial and other staff of the Houses.  I welcome the fact that the Law Reform Commission has recommended a series of new exemptions from jury service and that the staff of the Houses are covered thereunder.  The level of support available to us is insufficient and it should not be further weakened as a result of people being called for jury duty, regardless of how essential and important the latter may be to the functioning of the justice system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers, I welcome last night&rsquo;s announcement that agreement had been reached in the pay talks.  This is a momentous development, particularly in the light of the problems we have experienced in recent years.  It was difficult for those who work in the public sector and their families to sustain the extremely draconian pay cuts imposed.  I am pleased that there is now a basis on which we might move forward, for which <Col N="869"/>the leaders of the various unions deserve our gratitude.  While they are contemplating whether to vote for or against the agreement, I hope union members will be in a position to pull back from the current industrial action in order to allow normal working to resume.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange for a debate on this matter at an early date in order that the House might assist the public sector in its deliberations on the details of the agreement.  It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to Mr. Kieran Mulvey who, in conjunction with his officials, has done an outstanding job in recent days.  Everyone from the Labour Relations Commission deserves our gratitude.</P>
        <P>Many have described today as a momentous day in the history of banking in this country.  There is no question that this is the case and that substantial announcements relating to the investment of valuable resources owned by the State in the financial institutions will be made later.  That investment is extremely unpalatable for all Members of the House and the general public.  No one would wish to be obliged to do what needs to be done today.  However, this does not mean that we can shy away from the necessity of taking the action required.  In the light of the transfer of loans to NAMA, the recapitalisation of the various institutions and the great news relating to the agreement reached at Croke Park last night, we will finally be presented with a template which will bring about stability and act as a catalyst to encourage growth in the coming years.  That must be welcomed by everyone concerned.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader make time available for a debate on third level education?  The number of applications made for university places this year is the highest ever.  This augurs well for the future and it is incumbent on us to ensure there is an adequate number of places available for those who have made applications in order that they might assist with and build upon the nation&rsquo;s recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the draft agreement that emerged from the negotiations at Croke Park in the early hours of the morning.  Given our current situation, the agreement is realistic in nature and I hope its emergence augurs well for the economy.  I wish it a fair wind and hope it will bring finality in respect of the current uncertainty.</P>
        <P>As previous speakers stressed, Quinn Insurance has merely been placed in administration.  As in other sectors, competition is extremely important in insurance.  The entry of the firm in question to the market has been extremely important in an overall context.  I again stress that it is only the general insurance arm &mdash; the life and pensions business is not involved &mdash; that has been placed in administration which I hope will prove successful, particularly in the light of the various aspects of the matter and the jobs at stake that are vital to the economy.  I do not like what I have heard but we must await the statement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>There are so many matters which remain up in the air in respect of the banks.  We do not know if the European Commission has made a definitive ruling on the sale of assets by the various institutions.  The haircut that, it is hinted, will be applied in respect of loans from AIB seems particularly severe.  I am delighted the Leader has arranged a debate on the banks for tomorrow.  Such a debate is badly needed and timely.  I hope it is not a make or break plan because we are in a period of change and readjustment and must be prepared to move on these lines.  We await with interest what the Minister has to tell us and I hope it will lead to a final clear-out of the boards and at senior management level with the removal of those persons responsible for landing us in the appalling mess the State has to deal with.  We will hear more on this anon and I am glad we will have a debate tomorrow morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I was very annoyed about bomb scares in Derry which affected access between Belfast and Dublin.  On Saturday I had the pleasure of attending the joint birthday party of an 80 year old and a 76 year old in Bridgend.  Their entire family circle <Col N="870"/>was together for the party.  On Sunday night I had the less pleasurable task of checking with a superintendent that they were safe because they were in the house closest to a van which potentially held a bomb and reportedly had been driven across the Border from Derry and abandoned by four armed and masked men.  Fortunately, it was a hoax.  Unfortunately, however, there was much disruption.  We had to wait for a bomb disposal unit to come from Athlone.  Yesterday one of the two people mentioned ended up in hospital and we still do not know whether it was directly or indirectly related to the scare received.  Another device was left outside a head shop in Letterkenny.</P>
        <P>I again call for a debate on the type of republic we want on this island as we approach 2016.  I call for a joint debate on the issue with the Ministers for Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as well as any other relevant Minister.  People from England attended the quiet happy family event mentioned.  They are asking whether it was because they had come from England that the bomb was left near them, even though it was not a bomb.  Locals are wondering what potential outside investors and tourists are thinking.  We have to be clear and state this is not supported by us.  We need the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister to state there is full North-South co-operation in the north west to ensure this action is not allowed to persist and that the people involved are pursued vigorously.  I ask that we consider having cross-Border bomb disposal units because the more we allow the inconvenience the more effective they are.  While we do not want to have bomb disposal units&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very important day from the point of view of economics, banking and finance.  However, there are pressing justice issues which should also concern us.  Where is the justice for a young woman with Down&rsquo;s syndrome who is blocked from giving evidence in court against her alleged attacker on the grounds that she lacks the mental capacity to give evidence?  As everyone knows, this is what happened to Laura Kelly.  The Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 does not define &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; or provide guidelines.  It is arguable that the judge could have allowed her to give evidence but given a corroboration warning to the jury.  Even in that instance there is a debate to be held because in 1990 the Law Reform Commission recommended that juries not receive corroboration warnings in such cases, but in case law Judge Hardiman in the DPP <i>v.</i> Molloy in 1995 stated that matter about which a jury should be advised was the child-like mental capacity of a person giving evidence.  Whether or which, we should leave the matter to the common sense of juries; people should certainly be in a position to give evidence.  We should also note that if we are to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we will need to comply with Article 13 of the convention which requires state parties to ensure effective access to justice for persons with disabilities.  Will the Leader bring the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to tell us when, where and how this might be achieved?  I also seek the appearance in this House of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the light of the failure of the European <Col N="871"/>Heads of Government to agree a poverty target at their recent meetings.  They failed to set targets on reducing poverty or addressing educational disadvantage, despite the European Commission having proposed relatively modest targets on both issues to be among the headline goals for the Europe 2020 strategy.  This failure displays a completely unacceptable lack of any sense of urgency or determination to take the necessary measures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Last week, I had occasion to compliment the trade union movement on its display of courage in changing direction when the common good required it.  Today, I again salute the leadership of the trade union movement for the manner in which it engaged with and facilitated the outcome of the Croke Park meetings.  I am disappointed at the manner in which some people were very quick to talk down what has emerged from the Croke Park discussions.  Some sections of the media appear to think that nothing should be given the opportunity to progress and the ink could hardly have been dry on that draft agreement when it already was being put in a position of negativity.  It is not right for the media to do this as they should give leadership in such a case.  The contents of that draft agreement must now go back to the membership and the last thing one wants at this time is for further negativity to be heaped on what already exists.</P>

	<P>What is required at present is an injection of confidence into the national mood and this is precisely what the Government and the trade union leadership provided last night.</P>
        <P>It behoves all Members to contemplate for a moment the importance of what happened at Croke Park.  Members should consider how prospective investors in Ireland or those who already have money invested and who have provided such important employment will reflect on what is happening.  I have the feeling that the draft agreement will be accepted by the membership.  The reason I say this is, with an ear to the ground, it is quite clear the public sector is the engine of the economy and the State at present.  The trade union membership knows full well that everyone has a contribution to make to the recovery and I believe that as the leadership of the trade union movement has reacted positively, the membership will do likewise.</P>

	<P>It is indeed a momentous day when the Irish taxpayer must contemplate the recapitalisation of the banks, the administration of Quinn Insurance Limited and the public sector pay talks, which hopefully will come to a proper conclusion.  These are the major issues that Members will debate this week.  However, I wish to reflect on two issues that may be smaller in the context of people&rsquo;s general concerns but which are significant issues within the sectors involved.  The first issue, on which I seek a debate with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, as soon as possible, pertains to the non-availability of non-consultant hospital doctors in accident and emergency departments nationwide.  A total of 25% of senior non-consultant hospital doctor posts are about to fall vacant in accident and emergency departments across the country.  This is a serious issue for those patients who will be using accident and emergency departments in the coming weeks and months and must be dealt with.</P><Col N="872"/>
        <P>Another issue on which I seek a proper debate in this House concerns a media report I read over the weekend to the effect that public servants going about their duty on behalf of the people now must get security personnel to accompany them.  It is an incredibly sad reflection on the direction our society has taken that one must employ security guards to assist social workers, community care workers, doctors and nurses to do their jobs.  As someone who has worked unsocial hours in deprived areas, I acknowledge that hairy situations can arise.  However, in the past I never felt the need to have anyone riding shotgun with me when entering any such places.  It is a sad reflection on society that there is an obligation for someone to ride shotgun with public servants as they go about their duty on behalf of the people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>Any one of the three major stories breaking today would have made it a red letter day.  To have three in the one day is truly an indication of the type of flux with which we are living in political and economic terms.  It behoves everyone to keep one&rsquo;s head, not least the administrator appointed to Quinn Insurance, the commentariat on the Croke Park deal to be put to the union membership and Members in this and the Lower House.  We all need a degree of calm and moderation in the face of everything that is occurring.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to hear Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; speak with some optimism about the eventual outcome of the ballots on the deal to be put to union members.  It is the beginning of the healing of a dangerous rift that has opened between the public and private sectors.  Each side has a sense of bitterness towards the other.  Some of this bitterness has been stoked while some of it has been caused by circumstances.  It is important that this opportunity be grasped and that people in the two major parts of our working economy begin looking at one another as colleagues in common cause, not as competitors.</P>
        <P>I have noted an intersection between the announcements on NAMA and the potential deal, namely, the degree of certainty that will begin to return to business.  Certainty in public sector pay will feed into the business community&rsquo;s approach to pay within its sector and create a good basis for planning business until 2014 at least.  This is welcome.</P>

	<P>Combined with this is the fact that NAMA will begin to take bad debts from the banks.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s comments in terms of making credit flow again for the sake of all of the economy.  The coming together of these two key factors &mdash; stability in costs and the availability of credit &mdash; is a significant intersection today.</P>

	<P>We must proceed carefully and with respect for the taxpayer.  According to today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated he would unveil a recapitalisation plan that would draw a line under the financial crisis once and for all.  It will be in the order of &euro;20 billion.  How can the public trust that, yet again, a line will be drawn under the financial crisis once and for all?</P>

	<P>Let us consider the steps.  We have had the deposit guarantee scheme, with which we were in agreement.  Last year saw a recapitalisation.  We saved the zombie bank, Anglo Irish Bank.  NAMA was the penultimate plan, but the problem is still not solved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This all reverts to the fundamental question that the Minister must answer.  What guarantees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want a debate?  The Leader has promised one for tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that, but what guarantees for the taxpayer will the Minister seek from the banks?  He has not yet intervened for small business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is being strangled by a lack of co-operation and credit from the banks.  May I tell the House what I heard locally in Galway?  Our local banks are not even sending loan applications to their headquarters because they know it would be pointless.</P>
        <P>The Minister has all of this on his shoulders and he must intervene for the taxpayer.  He must tell the banks that, if the Government gives them something, they must give a legal guarantee to provide credit for small and medium-sized enterprises, which the good Leader has always stated is the lifeblood of business, and protect the mortgages of home owners.  It is time there was a dividend for the taxpayer.</P>

	<P>Emergency legislation to ban the sale of mephedrone is currently going through the British Parliament.  This will boost the profits of these despicable head shops in Border counties.  It is important to establish how the Government intends to respond.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share the concerns expressed on all sides of the House at the placing in administration of the Quinn Insurance Group.  In particular, I agree with the comments made by my friends and colleagues, Senators Joe O&rsquo;Reilly and Diarmuid Wilson.  This will have an impact on people who work for the group in Derrylin and Cavan town.  I caution commentators that the administration applies to the UK arm of the insurance group and gives, perhaps, an interesting insight into the state of the British economy rather than the relatively robust Irish economy.  The Irish arm of the business is not affected.  Those who follow football will know that a number of clubs in the English Premiership and championship have gone into administration, the most recent being Portsmouth FC.  They will survive.  No club has gone out of business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members have referred to this as a very important day.  Yesterday was a great day for the west, although it has been underreported.  The first phase of the western rail corridor was opened.  I pay tribute to those who have been campaigning for this for many years.  I met many of them during the European Parliament election campaign, as did Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.  They are committed people who operate on a voluntary basis.  They have now seen the realisation of the first part of this project.  The naysayers in the Dublin-based media immediately began to question the viability of this railway line, before the trains were even on the track.  We did not hear this questioning about Luas or the DART.  Of course, because the service is in the west, questions must be raised about its continuing viability.  I have no doubt this will be an important extra dimension to the economic regeneration of that part of the west.  Phase 2 of the line to Tuam and then to Claremorris will be the start of a widespread economic regeneration.  Unless there are joined-up transportation links between towns across the west, we have little hope of surviving.  This is a positive story.  Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the importance of optimism.  This is a good news story which shows optimism about the future, especially in the west.  I wish everyone well with the new line and I look forward to using the service.  I applaud <Col N="874"/>the decision of the Green Party at its convention last week to endorse the implementation of metro north which will be vital in the ongoing regeneration of the country.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to have a debate this week on the issue of social partnership.  In so doing, I commend the unions on their ability to reach a deal last night.  This is but one step.  Why could Government not have done this last November or December?  Why were four months of hardship endured by people who are already under great pressure?  The reason is that we have a failed Government with failed policies and a lack of leadership.  The Government&rsquo;s failed political policies are coming home to roost today, with the Minister for Finance about to unfurl the latest recapitalisation.  Senator Healy Eames is absolutely right.</P>
        <P>When will the taxpayer no longer have to bail out banks?  When will it end?  When will small and medium-sized enterprises, which the Leader says are the lifeblood of the economy, be given liquidity and allowed to fulfil their role in creating employment?</P>

	<P>I wish to support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s call for a debate on a change in the law on mental capacity following the disturbing news of a young woman with Down&rsquo;s syndrome who was precluded from giving evidence.  That was a very disturbing report.  We heard an announcement yesterday by the Law Reform Commission of recommendations on reforming the law on juries, but we also need to revisit some aspects of the law on evidence.  The Law Reform Commission examined the law on hearsay.  I request a debate on these matters and changes in the law on criminal evidence and the jury system.  That would be useful.</P>
        <P>I join others in welcoming the outcome of the Croke Park talks but highlight the real mistake the Government made in pulling out of those talks so early and precipitously in December.  By pulling the plug when it did it caused immense inconvenience to enormous numbers of the public.</P>

	<P>The Leader will be conscious that a number of Members raised the issue of those unfortunate people queuing for passports outside the Passport Office.  The Labour Party and others had called for the suspension of the CPSU action to facilitate members of the public who were not in any way responsible for the crisis in the public finances and to ensure they would not be disadvantaged in this way.  I am disturbed that they are still being disadvantaged.  It is important we see an end to that particular industrial action and an acceptance of the measures announced in Croke Park, particularly for the low paid public sector workers with whom we all sympathise.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on jobs in the construction sector and construction-related jobs.  Alarming news of the collapse of the very prestigious architects firm, Murray &Oacute; Laoire, last week shows the immense knock-on effects of that loss not only in terms of jobs directly in the construction sector but related jobs and jobs with an international dimension because that firm had an international reach.  It is disturbing that the explanation given by the firm for it going into liquidation was that it was not being paid by creditors.  The decision today to put billions of euro into the banks has created a sense of alarm.  Could the banks not have tided over firms such as Murray &Oacute; Laoire with a view to preserving jobs, particularly given that they are about to become State-owned?  Notwithstanding the fact that Senators will debate the issue of banking tomorrow, the House needs to have a debate on whether the billions of euro we are pouring into the banks will free up credit for ordinary firms and small and large businesses, including architects&rsquo; firms which desperately need to stay afloat.</P>

        <P>I welcome the progress made in talks with the trade unions, specifically the changes proposed in the public service.  The agreement should return us to an even keel.  I request that public service employees discontinue the work to rule action.</P>
        <P>We have reached the final stage of the measures required in the banks.  Although it appears at this difficult juncture that it will be necessary to put further significant sums into the banks, the measure should provide the banks with sufficient funding and the impetus needed to allow them to start lending again.  While many bank officials are a little wary and, from what we have heard, saddened by the inevitability of the State taking majority control of the banking institutions, recent developments are the consequence of greed by a small number in the banks.  Bonuses were paid not on the basis of quality but on the quantity of loans and without regard to their true value and long-term sustainability.  Today we will see the fruits of greed.</P>

	<P>As they moved from the normal venue of Government Buildings to Croke Park, participants in the social partnership talks will have passed by Leinster House.  I am disappointed that, notwithstanding numerous requests for the Seanad, as part of the body politic, to discuss in detail the current economic position and the social partnership models, problems and solutions required, the House has been bypassed again.  Notwithstanding the fact that the horse has clearly bolted, I ask the Leader to have the good grace to arrange a debate in the House to discuss fundamental economic matters, proposals and options and invite all the relevant parties to attend.  Fundamental decisions are being made without an input from elected representatives, other than a small number of Ministers.  It would be helpful, therefore, if the House were to discuss the range of options available.</P>
        <P>That progress appears to have been made in the talks is welcome, even if the precise details of the proposals are not available.  The important information we have gleaned from this morning&rsquo;s agreement is that everything is contingent on the economic state of the country not deter<Col N="878"/>iorating further.  If passports can be obtained, individuals can receive a response to their social welfare benefit applications and public representatives, on behalf of citizens, can receive answers from the staff of various offices, that is a step forward.  Nevertheless, the parameters of the agreement made in our name must be made available as soon as possible in order that the House can have a reasonable debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that while Senators&rsquo; requests for debates appear to be acceded to, in many cases nothing happens.  Debates on the economy in this and the other House should be the genesis for solutions to our economic problems.  That is our role on behalf of citizens.  I ask the Leader to ensure the House is made more relevant before the summer recess.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Hannigan, Boyle, Norris, MacSharry, Coghlan, Mullen, Twomey, Dearey, Healy Eames, Buttimer, Mooney, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, Bacik, Callely, Hanafin and Bradford welcomed the successful outcome of the Croke Park talks.  I congratulate everyone involved in the agreement on the draft proposals.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; stated, the agreement gives an air of confidence at the start of this, one of the most important days in the careers of Members of the Oireachtas.  As the snow falls outside the window, the Government and the nation must rise to a major challenge.  All those who participated in the talks have done the country a service.  Many decisions must be made in the national interest and employers, workers and others have now agreed draft proposals.  I hope common sense will prevail.</P>
        <P>As Senators will recall, last week I invited Members who had proposals on financial matters to make contributions of 15 or 20 minutes on Second Stage of the Finance Bill with the Minister present.  I acknowledge the contributions of the many Senators who availed of the opportunity.  The role of the House in assisting the Minister for Finance must be commended and is much appreciated by the Minister and his officials.</P>
        <P>On the National Asset Management Agency and the banking proposals the Minister will set out at 5 p.m., the Government faces unprecedented challenges.  Commentators and others take a view that Anglo Irish Bank is not important.  The bank is more important to Ireland than Lehman Brothers was to the United States.  The prospect we face is similar to that which occurred when Lehman Brothers was allowed to go to the wall.  Senators should note, when expressing a view on the importance of Anglo Irish Bank, that it is of the utmost importance that a friendly banking system is operational as soon as possible.  The incoming chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Alan Dukes, has taken on this responsibility.  I am very confident in the knowledge that this man has always been responsible and answerable to the people.  That is the difference in having a man of his stature taking over the running of Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>A way must be found to make credit available to the self-employed and family-run businesses.  We must remember that 75% of businesses in Ireland are family-run.  That illustrates how important it is that credit is made available.  Thousands of employers are waiting for credit to be made available again.  That is the Government&rsquo;s duty and the reason this evening&rsquo;s announcement is of such importance.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan requested that we roll over the statements to be made tomorrow on banking.  They will continue after the Easter recess.  In the meantime, we will be able to observe progress which I hope will be made.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Boyle, O&rsquo;Reilly, Wilson and Mooney referred to the Quinn Group.  I wish the group well, on behalf of the Upper House of Parliament.  It is a shinning example of what can be done with a can-do attitude and shows what one brilliant man and his <Col N="879"/>family have achieved.  It has created 5,500 jobs in Ireland and another 1,500 abroad.  It is one of the captains of industry in Europe, not only the British Isles.  I know it will come through this.</P>
        <P>I had the pleasure of chairing the committee which inquired into the insurance industry.  At the start of our inquiry we were told it was an industry in which it was very difficult to achieve anything for policyholders but we succeeded in having the cost of policies reduced by 50% over a four-year period.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole played a major role in that regard.  Senators Coghlan and Leyden were also members of the committee.  The Quinn Group made this possible in no small way and played a hugely significant role.  Whatever the difficulties it is experiencing currently, it has made a magnificent contribution in reducing to current levels home insurance, commercial or private motor insurance, employers&rsquo; and public liability insurance and health insurance premiums.  We are all solidly behind Sean Quinn and the Quinn Group in its endeavours.  I hope everything that can done will be done in the interests of sustaining the great work being done by what is a huge employer in Ireland plc.</P>
        <P>I will accede to the request made by Senators Wilson and O&rsquo;Reilly for a special debate which will take place on Thursday after the Order of Business.  We will have statements on the up-to-date position in the Quinn Group.  We will roll over the statements which will continue after the Easter recess when the picture will be clearer.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the report of the Law Reform Commission and the exemption from jury service for staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We welcome the report and hope it will be implemented.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator MacSharry called for a debate on education, in particular third level education.  I will have no difficulty arranging for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House for such a debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keaveney referred to activities in the Bridgend area of County Donegal last weekend.  We support her call and I will convey her strong views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We will see if we can arrange a debate on the up-to-date position on these activities which have been taking place too frequently in recent months.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen raised the issue of persons with a disability giving evidence in court, in which regard he was supported by Senator Bacik.  He also called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to discuss the failure of EU Heads of State to reach poverty reduction targets.  I will have no difficulty in arranging such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey called on the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to debate non-consultant hospital doctors and accident and emergency services.  I will have no difficulty in arranging such a debate.  I congratulate the Minister on her appearance on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; programme last night.  She told the people about all the good work taking place under her stewardship.  Senator Twomey also raised the issue of social workers and I will pass on his comments to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators Mooney and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in wholeheartedly welcomed the opening yesterday of the western rail corridor.  It is great to see progress being made.  I would not worry too much about the Dublin media because I remember what they said when we were trying to build Knock Airport.  How wrong they were.  I remember my father telling me what the media had said about Se&aacute;n Lemass when he had opened Shannon Airport.  They said only rabbits would run along the runways.  We all remember the doubting Thomases but when it comes to being confident and visionary, Fianna F&aacute;il can be proud of its achievements during the years in what it has done for the people of the west.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney highlighted what the British Government was doing about mephedrone.  I will pass on his views to the Minister.  He also referred to the Green Party support at its <Col N="880"/>conference for the Government&rsquo;s plan for metro north.  It is a huge investment which will benefit the people of the north side of Dublin and the entire country.</P>

        <P>Senator Callely referred to the attitude of banks to customers.  The issue can be raised in the special statements on banking after the Order of Business tomorrow.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for a debate on the railways, in particular the good news announcement yesterday about services in Galway.  I will have no difficulty in arranging for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, to come to the House.  I take the opportunity to congratulate him on opening the first phase of the western rail corridor yesterday.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to jobs in construction, in particular the difficulties experienced by Murray O&rsquo;Laoire.  I was in Dubai when the then Taoiseach opened its office there.  The global and local downturn has affected the company.  It goes to show what is happening worldwide when a company such as Murray O&rsquo;Laoire must cease business owing to a lack of credit in the system.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin asked me to write to the Russian ambassador to offer our support in regard to yesterday&rsquo;s tragic events.  I will certainly do so, as it is a good proposal.</P></Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to refer specifically to amendment No. 2 which deals with the decommissioning of petroleum infrastructure.  As a result of the amendment, the Bill now defines &ldquo;decommissioning&rdquo;, in relation to petroleum infrastructure, as &ldquo;taking the facility, structure or installation or any part of such facility, structure or installation permanently out of use with a view to its abandonment <i>in situ </i>or removal&rdquo;.  I presume inherent in this definition is a requirement that such infrastructure be left in a safe condition.  Perhaps it is specified elsewhere in this legislation.  Efforts should be made to ensure the decontamination process is fully effective.  It is obvious that decontamination is a huge issue when one of these facilities is being decommissioned.  I assume it is understood in this legislation that such a facility should be left in an environmentally acceptable condition.  Perhaps it is specified in the Bill.  I have to say I would prefer the Bill to be prescriptive in this regard than to define &ldquo;decommissioning&rdquo; in a loose manner.  It is one of the issues and thoughts that have occurred to me.  I have some small knowledge of the issues that can arise when petroleum installations are decommissioned, especially when they are left <i>in situ</i>.  I am concerned when they are left <i>in situ</i> because proactive steps need to be taken immediately to ensure decontamination takes place.  If that is not done, vapours can present risks to people who might enter the sites involved legally or illegally.  I would like the Minister of State to provide some clarification on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome amendment No. 2 because it will ensure there is monitoring of the aftermath of works that are done.  This favourable change in the legislation will ensure there is safety after drilling and other works are done.  I welcome that.  I appreciate the points made by Senator Walsh.  I would welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to them.  I welcome amendment No. 2 as a response to points made on my behalf by my colleague, Senator Donohoe.  He raised this issue with great competence and eloquence when I was absent for the Second and Committee Stage debates.  We are happy with this amendment as a response to our arguments.  I support its inclusion and I think it represents a change for the better in the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his positive support.  I reassure Senator Walsh that there is no question of decommissioning and leaving facilities <i>in situ</i> if they are at variance with our environmental legislation.  We have to deal with the safety plans as well.  I take on board what he is saying with a certain degree of scepticism.  I deal with fish farms under my own brief, and there is a problem in Bartra Bay in Connemara where fish tanks are floating around the bay and causing a hazard to marine navigation.  The relevant authorities have not tidied up the situation, even though some of the companies involved were funded by the State through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Their fish tanks are lying around the bay and they represent a potential hazard.  I brought this matter to the attention of the relevant authorities, but I am not convinced that action has been taken.  We <Col N="884"/>cannot leave ourselves in a situation where structures are left in a marine environment or another environment and are not being addressed by the relevant authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 3 deals with the risk assessment nature of the safety framework and is the subject matter of amendments Nos. 4 and 21.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The core objective of these amendments, together with a number of further amendments that I will also be discussing today, is to provide the maximum level of clarity for everyone with an interest in the development of the new safety regulatory framework.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a national risk assessment safety framework based on international best practice, as recommended by Advantica following its safety review of the Corrib gas pipeline.  A risk assessment framework is a regulatory mechanism that will require petroleum undertakings to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission that they have reduced and are managing safety related risk to a level that is as low as reasonably feasible.</P>
        <P>Having reflected on this core purpose and to ensure clarity for all parties interested in the formulation of the new safety framework, I consider it necessary to make explicit reference in these amendments to risk assessment, in both the definition of the petroleum safety framework and in the reference to that framework in the body of the Bill in section 131.  This hardens up the definitions in response to a number of issues raised by Opposition Members on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that, but I would like an assurance from the Minister of State that there will be clarity for the public and that all of these risk assessments and documentation will be presented to the public at all stages.  We need constant confidence building and awareness for the public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission for Energy Regulation will be as open as any other State body in respect of the safety framework documents.  Clearly, the safety plans are another matter.  They are not published internationally, because they involve commercially sensitive operational information.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was some debate on Committee Stage and Report Stage in the D&aacute;il as to which bodies would be specified for the various consultation processes required by the Bill, such as the designation of petroleum activities, the establishment of the safety framework and the safety case guidelines.  These amendments have two purposes.  First, they clarify further which bodies should be consulted when the commission is designating petroleum activities, developing the safety framework and developing the safety case guidelines.  Second, they will ensure it will always be possible to consult the appropriate bodies.  I propose to provide with these amendments that the Minister may, by order, add an additional body he considers appropriate to the specified bodies to be formally consulted.</P>

	<P>Will there be a clear provision for consultation for local community interest groups?

There was a lack of transparency and awareness, and if there had been a better public education and consultation campaign at the outset, it might have helped.</P>
        <P>It would be welcome if the Minister of State said on the record of the House that he viewed that properly organised and elected local interest groups, such as local community councils, local environmental action groups and so on, would be part of a consultation process as well as the industry and all relevant safety authorities, public authorities and scientific bodies.  There should be a democratic dimension to this in terms of public consultation with local interest groups.  That would be a confidence-building measure and would make for a better delivery of energy in our country.  Had this been the case following the Corrib gas find, we would not have had the inordinate delay and the fraught situation that has ensued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No doubt mistakes were made on a number of fronts in respect of the Corrib pipeline.  The public discussion on the safety frameworks will involve public consultation to the maximum extent.  Local interest groups can also be represented at the oral hearing stages of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Commission for Energy Regulation will be present at those to fulfil the democratic mandate and answer the relevant questions from interested bodies at the oral hearing stage.</P>
        <P>We are not entertaining a new level of public consultation.  International investors are highly critical of the possibility of exploring in Irish waters because they believe our systems are too arcane and bureaucratic.  Part of this Bill is about reducing the red tape associated with trying to explore off Irish waters.  We are not adding an extra dimension of consultation but we will clearly draw the lessons from the Corrib controversy.  I am sure local groups get involved early in the safety framework, but also in the planning process.  Many people say this is only the oral hearing process, but it is a democratic process and it involves the presence of the relevant safety authority, namely, the CER.  Therefore, people will be able to challenge the safety information presented by the relevant bodies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission for Energy Regulation is being conferred with a number of functions under this Bill.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of these amendments is also to increase the clarity of the intention of the Bill in the context of the formal consultation process associated with the establishment of the petroleum framework.  This amendment provides that codes of practice and technical standards used in setting the minimum safety benchmark to be achieved by developers will be specified in the safety framework.  The individual details will be set out in the safety case guidelines specific to each designated petroleum activity.  By specifying codes and standards within the framework, the Commission can outline recognised best practice which must apply at a minimum to a petroleum undertaking.  This does not obviate the responsibility placed on petroleum activities to reduce their safety related risks to a level that is as low as reasonably feasible.  An additional benefit of setting out the relevant codes and standards in <Col N="886"/>this manner is that it will remove any ambiguity as to which appropriate codes are standard for each activity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome amendment No. 17E to provide safety information for the public when appropriate.  However, Fine Gael would have preferred a more formal consultative process with local communities.  In our view, we should not merely give interested persons, organisations and other bodies an opportunity to make representations, but should also be proactive in informing and consulting people and listening to what they say.  Avoidable major problems arise in large development projects because local communities do not have involvement at an early stage, and thus develop a resistance to the projects later.  This resistance is sometimes valid and sometimes not, but can be dealt with by having an early public consultation process.  While I would have preferred the amendment to go further, I welcome it none the less.  The democratisation of the consultative element cannot be overstressed.  It is crucial to a peaceful and harmonious approach to the delivery of energy in future, which is in everybody&rsquo;s best interests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome these amendments, particularly in light of the valiant fight of the people in the Shell to Sea campaign.  They stood up for the justifiable rights of Irish citizens in protecting their homes.  They were vilified and calumniated all over the place, including in this House, in newspapers and on television programmes.  I recall with horror a particular television programme, which was extremely biased and slanted.  All the television critics said, &ldquo;Oh yes, this was biased and slanted, and what a good thing, too.&rdquo;  The Shell to Sea campaigners were not permitted to make their concerns felt, but they have subsequently been justified by a series of reports dealing with safety questions, including pressure in the pipeline and its proximity to domestic housing.</P>
        <P>In welcoming these amendments, I am glad of this opportunity to record my admiration for the brave people who were involved in that campaign.  This is despite the fact that a very large multinational corporation, with a record that stinks to high heaven in places like Nigeria, was able to enlist the support of State agencies to brutalise some of these people.  I am glad of the opportunity to record my admiration for them.  Attempts were made, for example, to discredit people on the basis of guilt by association.  I was told that I was consorting with extreme republicans and splinter groups, but I was not.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="887"/>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The desire to provide for an appropriate level of public consultation in this Bill has been a common theme of the debate both here and in the D&aacute;il.  Having listened carefully to the views expressed by Members, I have proposed amending the Bill explicitly to require a formal public consultation process to be carried out by the commission when it is establishing the safety framework.  While the Bill, as published, had envisaged that the commission would consult widely when developing the safety framework, it is now proposed to include a specific requirement that the commission carry out a formal public consultation when developing the safety framework.  It is my view that the overall regulatory framework relating to upstream petroleum activities will now provide sufficient scope for any concerns members of the public might have to be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>As amendment No. 23 is something that my party stressed on Second and Committee Stages both here and in the D&aacute;il, I welcome it.  It is important to provide for the publication of such matters in newspapers, as planning permissions already are.  The notification of a public consultation process within a specified time in newspapers is also important, as is this transparent dimension.  It is well incorporated in amendment No. 23B, which I welcome and support.  We campaigned for that strongly, both here and in the D&aacute;il.  It makes good sense and as my party&rsquo;s spokesperson in this area, I am certainly proud of our achievements in this respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I add my voice in supporting this good amendment.  The consultation process on the safety framework should obviate difficulties down the line, which have emerged concerning the Corrib.  I also welcome the introduction of timelines, whereby people must make their submissions within a specified time.  I presume the commission will also have to function within a timeline, subsequent to getting those commissions from the viewpoint of finalising the safety framework.  The general public must have confidence in the process as well as having a mechanism for their views to be taken into account in the safety statement.  We must, however, get away from this idea that everybody in the State has a veto on any sort of development.  We have seen examples of that.  There is a lot of obstruction of all sorts of development, including our natural resources.  We need a more incentivised policy of encouraging the exploration and production of those natural resources.  The Minister of State and his Department could do a lot to give effect to that.  We should perhaps examine the licensing mechanism and the charges we apply.  From the citizen&rsquo;s viewpoint, rather than seeking licence fees up front, we should perhaps look at taking a benefit down the line if the exploration is successful and leads to oil or gas production.  I would like to see us developing a policy along those lines.  If we are successful in identifying such fields, we will obviously benefit through employment and an important revenue stream to the Exchequer at a time when we are looking at serious and tight fiscal constraints in the medium term.  I would like to encourage such an approach.  I welcome this provision because it might reassure reasonable people that positive steps are being taken in their interests.</P>

	<P>This amendment also has its origins in the D&aacute;il during the debate on Committee Stage with regard to the appropriate timeframe for the introduction of the new petroleum safety framework.  Having listened to the views of Deputies, and in the interests of ensuring the framework will be introduced without undue delay, I am proposing to reduce the timeframe by which the Minister may give a direction to the commission with respect to the <Col N="888"/>publication of the safety framework.  This amendment now proposes that where the safety framework has not been published within six months of the commencement of the safety framework provision, the Minister may direct the commission in writing to publish it no later than the date specified in the ministerial direction.  I thank Fine Gael and Labour Party Members for their suggestions in this regard.  I understand this was specifically suggested by Deputy McManus and I was delighted to respond to it.</P>

	<P>This amendment is in the interests of endeavouring to establish as clearly as possible what the Bill is to achieve.  The purpose of the amendment is to set out clearly that while petroleum undertakings are to be subject to a number of obligations under this legislation, the principal duty of a petroleum undertaking would be to ensure that petroleum activities are carried out in a manner that reduces any risk to safety to a level that is as low as is reasonably feasible.</P>

	<P>These amendments also arise out of the debate on the Bill during its passage through the D&aacute;il.  On Committee Stage, I introduced the amendments aimed at removing any ambiguity from the transitional nature of &ldquo;established petroleum activity&rdquo;.  Established petroleum activity is a petroleum activity being carried out by an undertaking at the time this Bill becomes law.  The purpose of this amendment is to introduce further clarity to the scope and intentions of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the passage of this Bill, but I wish to raise a question.  I note the onus will be on the applicant to provide its safety case within a certain timeframe so it can be adjudicated upon for the issue of a safety permit.  I can see difficulties with specifying timeframes for the commission because the complexity of the safety case may vary from applicant to applicant.</P>
        <P>The State is always great at specifying timeframes for everyone else but is not so wonderful at doing so when it comes to its own operations, if the Minister of State does not mind my saying so.  In that regard, is there any redress for an applicant who feels the commission is tardy in dealing with their application?  What recourse does the applicant have to have their case expedited?  I am not seeking to have safety relegated in importance but, nonetheless, it is important we perform to a level commensurate with the requirement of the applicant.  I do not think I saw such a provision in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the point made by Senator Walsh.  We want efficiencies on both sides &mdash; from the point of view of Government, the companies and the public making submissions.  The entire process needs to become more efficient, transparent and inclusive.  The Minister of State mentioned earlier that we must learn the lessons of Corrib.  The lessons of Corrib are that efficiency and tight timeframes, within reason, are necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their support and their suggestion that tight timeframes be imposed on State bodies.  State bodies include regulators, and that is why the Taoiseach met all the State&rsquo;s regulators in Farmleigh recently to discuss the need for better and speedier regulation.  In addition, some regulators &mdash; I do not want to single out the Commission for Energy Regulation in this regard &mdash; have not been taking a developmental approach <Col N="889"/>to their work.  Such an approach is important in view of the economic crisis, and should be adopted by regulators when they consider the timeframes they apply to such cases.  That is why the specific measure put forward by members of the Opposition was welcome.  We had pencilled in an eight-month process, followed by recourse to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh asked to whom a promoter can appeal if they feel a regulator is not doing its job properly.  They can appeal to me as Minister of State or whoever occupies this position in the future.  The Minister of State can then enforce a timeframe if the regulator has not been efficient in dealing with the case.  That is irrespective of complaints or the mention of resources and so on.  If a promoter has a worthy proposal and believes the process has been too slow, I or my successor as Minister of State can order the regulator to complete the process within a specified time.  That is how it should be.  Many people within and outside the House are sceptical and believe we set up regulators and then let them go off and do their own thing.  The political system ultimately must be in command.  People elect Members to this and the other House with the expectation that we will put pressure on the system and ensure it performs to a high level.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad, I thank the Minister of State for his co-operative and proactive approach in listening to what was said and in seeking to improve the Bill.  The legislation ultimately will be of benefit to our economy as it involves the rationalisation and centralisation of regulation of safety standards and the elimination of a multiplicity of agencies and bodies adjudicating on safety.  The focus of the process is now in the regulator&rsquo;s office.  It is important that a public consultation process has been established and the lessons of Corrib have been learned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Bill and the Minister of State&rsquo;s approach and attitude to our suggestions, which were aimed at bettering the legislation.  We have no difficulty with the legislation in principle.  In fact, the needs of our economy dictate that it be passed.</P>

The Minister of State has been incisive and constructive and has taken a businesslike approach to the various suggestions, including those which may have been outside the ambit of the Bill but were certainly related to its functioning and operation.

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary White.  As it is her first visit to the House, I congratulate her on her appointment and wish her well in her new portfolio.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I am delighted to be in the House and welcome the opportunity to speak on this most serious topic.</P>
        <P>These statements on domestic violence, which are taking place so soon after the publication earlier this month of the Government&rsquo;s National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2010-2014, are timely.  The strategy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling domestic and sexual violence, which is reflected in the establishment in June 2007 of Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  Cosc is a national executive office within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a whole-of-Government remit.  As well as dealing with violence against women, Cosc&rsquo;s remit extends to violence against men and violence against older people in the community.  Cosc&rsquo;s actions therefore have a broad focus across all Government activity with the essential aim of preventing and responding to domestic and sexual violence.  In carrying out its remit Cosc works closely with the many Departments, State agencies and non-governmental organisations dealing with domestic and sexual violence.  In the past 18 months or so the development of the national strategy has been the main priority of Cosc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before discussing the development and content of the national strategy, I would like to say a few words about the nature of domestic violence.  Three different dimensions of abuse characterise domestic violence &mdash; physical abuse, sexual abuse and emotional abuse.  Behaviours which commonly occur in situations of domestic violence include various forms of physical violence such as kicking, punching, slapping, choking, and threatening with an object.  Equally sexual abuse, in its many appalling variations, can be part of a pattern of domestic violence.  Controlling and intimidating behaviour, including threats and blaming the victim, are common forms of emotional abuse.  The use of isolation can be a key backdrop to domestic violence.  An example of this is where the perpetrator restricts communication between the victim and friends or relations.  Isolation can significantly hinder the victim in getting help and recovering from the cruel and degrading crimes concerned.  More specifically, it can prevent reporting of the violence and make it difficult to access support services.  It is relevant too that domestic violence may also include economic abuse.  An obvious example of this would be where, as a means of exerting control, money for everyday expenses is deliberately withheld by one partner from the other.</P><Col N="891"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>The situation is exacerbated by the fact that these types of crimes usually take place behind closed doors where there are no witnesses or, worse still from the child&rsquo;s point of view, where the only witness is a child.  The hidden nature of the violence makes it very difficult to tackle.  There are various reasons this behaviour is kept hidden.  It can be due to the misguided view that the violence is a private matter or due to the embarrassment of some of those involved.  Often it is kept hidden because the victim considers he or she will not be believed.  Violence is a crime, whether it is inside or outside the hall door.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most domestic violence and the most severe forms of it are perpetrated by men against women.  At the same time men can be, and often are, victims of domestic violence.  Children also become embroiled in such violence, sometimes as direct victims, but more often as secondary victims.  Sadly, older people can experience domestic violence perpetrated by their children or by members of their own families.  Other groups which can be at high risk of becoming victims of domestic violence include people with disabilities, ethnic minorities and members of the Traveller community.</P>
        <P>I will now focus on the development of the national strategy in the past 18 months or so.  A wide range of State and non-governmental organisations dealing with domestic and sexual violence played a key role in assisting with the strategy&rsquo;s development.  Those organisations responded to the call for submissions on the strategy and participated in subsequent rounds of consultations.  The organisations included Departments, State offices and agencies as well as the more than 70 non-governmental organisations at national and local level which deliver services to victims of domestic and sexual violence.  In addition, domestic and international research was considered.  A conference was held in Waterford at which international experts spoke of their experiences and research.  The conference focused on improving and evaluating the responses of specific services such as housing, the police, the criminal justice system and the health care system, as well as specific co-ordination issues such as risk assessment models.  The conference was followed by a forum on domestic violence hosted by President Mary McAleese, which explored why victims find it difficult to seek help or report abuse.  The material gathered from all these sources was analysed and formed the basis of discussions with Departments and public sector bodies to identify the goals and actions required.  This culminated in a final round of consultations with all the Departments and State bodies concerned late last year.  All relevant Departments and bodies indicated their commitment to the strategy and to the actions with which they are specifically involved.  Some Departments offered to lead on certain actions and others made valuable suggestions on implementation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s action in this area has been driven by its concern at consistent evidence of high prevalence and low levels of reporting of these crimes.  Soon after the establishment of Cosc in 2007, it became clear that a national strategy was required to set out a common vision, to form a basis for a joined-up approach and to identify priority actions.  Now that the Government has approved the national strategy, we have a document which represents a blueprint for more strategic and co-ordinated action on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in Ireland in the five-year period from early this year to the end of 2014.  The finalisation of the strategy is a significant milestone.  It is the first time there has been such a strategy and the achievement is a credit to all concerned, including Departments, State agencies and NGOs that all had such a large part in getting the strategy over the line.  It is the first time in Ireland there has been a common vision and collaborative plan of action to tackle these horrific crimes.</P>
        <P>The main focus of the strategy is, on the one hand, to prevent the violence concerned and, on the other, to respond effectively to such violence.  Ultimately, the impact of the strategy will be fewer victims of domestic and sexual violence, better services for those who are victims and increased accountability by perpetrators.  The strategy places a high value on evaluation and evidence-based policy planning.  This is crucial to ensure effective interventions and best public <Col N="892"/>value.  The strategy is very much an action-focused one.  Not only does it outline actions and activities, it sets out clear targets against which progress on implementation will be measured.</P>
        <P>More specifically as regards domestic violence, the national strategy has two central pillars which deal with primary and secondary interventions.  I will briefly indicate the actions to be implemented under these interventions.  Primary interventions are those that aim to prevent a problem from occurring or, when it has taken place, to prevent its recurrence.  In the context of domestic violence, the national strategy&rsquo;s primary interventions will raise awareness of the crime and increase understanding and recognition of it.  Another aspect of the primary interventions will be to educate people about the dynamics and impact of the problem and equip people to better respond to it.  Actions relating to primary interventions will include developing an understanding and recognition of domestic violence among the general public, specific audiences and across the State sector.  Action will also be taken to embed domestic violence-related content in programmes in second and third level education institutions.</P>
        <P>Secondary interventions arise once an incident has occurred and there is a direct role for services to deal with a report, respond or refer on for needs to be met by a more specialised service.  Secondary interventions are mainly the services offered to victims.  They range from routine inquiry in hospital or GP settings which aim to facilitate disclosure to direct service provision for victims.  Services for victims can include assistance with accommodation, counselling and medical attention, as well as relief provided through the civil courts and the criminal justice process.  A focus on victims is of central importance and a basic first step in increasing their confidence in service provision is to ensure that information on services is available to them in user-friendly formats.  One of the actions under secondary interventions addresses this.  Another action aims to improve opportunities for disclosure in the health and non-health sectors.  Work is planned to promote high-quality standards in service delivery for victims as well as perpetrators and to strengthen intra and inter-organisational co-ordination, with a view to improved service effectiveness and consistency.  Action will also be taken with a specific focus on supporting and enabling collaboration across State agencies and NGOs.  In addition, specific actions are included to improve protection and support for victims, through improvements to counselling as well as ensuring effectiveness and consistency in housing responses and the co-location of services in a one-stop-shop setting.</P>
        <P>The strategy also includes an action to minimise attrition levels in domestic violence cases, to the extent that is appropriate.  This will include examining recent research with a view to developing proposals to improve the situation.</P>
        <P>Through the establishment of a domestic violence perpetrator programme committee, Cosc will develop and implement a plan to strengthen perpetrator programmes by improving intra and inter-organisational co-operation, co-ordination and data collection.  The final actions under secondary interventions aim to address the accountability of offenders and strengthen the protection of victims through a review &mdash; and any necessary improvement &mdash; of legislation on domestic violence.</P>
        <P>The strategy aims to provide a clear direction for all Government action on domestic violence across the various Departments and agencies concerned.  This should lead to more co-ordinated and effective action in respect of victims and perpetrators.  In so doing, the strategy will address the key problem of the disjointed nature of current action across the many organisations involved.</P>
        <P>The vision in respect of the national strategy, in so far as it relates to domestic violence, is that, by the end of 2014, there will be progress in a number of respects.  There will be clearer societal acknowledgment of the unacceptability of domestic violence.  There will be greater <Col N="893"/>recognition and a broader understanding of such violence.  There will be greater confidence in high quality and consistent services for victims of the violence.  Crucially, there will also be increased safety for victims, and potential victims, as well as increased accountability of perpetrators.  In order to assist in making this vision a reality, structures have been put in place to ensure the effective implementation of the strategy.  Central to this task has been the establishment of a strategy oversight committee to monitor the implementation of the national strategy and to assist in identifying solutions to any high level difficulties or delays.</P>

	<P>I apologise for interrupting the Minister of State&rsquo;s fine contribution.  However, I was wondering whether copies of her speech will be made available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure copies will be made available.</P>
        <P>The oversight committee is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Se&aacute;n Aylward.  It will meet twice yearly and will report progress to the group of Secretaries General and the Government.</P>
        <P>The national strategy is being published at a time of great economic difficulty for our country and some would say that restricted resources will militate against its effective implementation.   The strategy, however, takes account of the difficult economic climate.  The implementation of actions in the strategy should not involve a great financial outlay.  What it will involve is a new approach to working and interagency co-operation.  This is very timely, particularly as this is a period when all organisations are reviewing their purpose and how they work.  A successful implementation of this strategy will help to increase efficiency and effectiveness.  It will also reduce the financial burden on the State that arises as a result of domestic violence.  The latter is, of course, in addition to the horrific personal human cost.  Recognising the economic challenges, and the current state of interventions in Ireland, it is realistic to expect the strategy to provide a strong framework for sustainable intervention to prevent and effectively respond to domestic violence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All of this action under the national strategy is being taken by those employed in Government Departments, State agencies and NGOs the work of which has a direct impact on victims of domestic violence.  However, committed as those organisations may be, we cannot just leave matters to them.  Domestic violence is a societal problem and the entire community is affected by it.</P>
        <P>At a forum on domestic and sexual violence hosted in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in in October 2008, President McAleese posed a question as to &ldquo;what we can do as a civic society, as a community, to help further an ongoing national debate around domestic abuse and help turn the tide of this repulsive blight in our land, bringing reassurance and vindication to victims, bringing accountability and the opportunity to change to perpetrators&rdquo;.  There was a clear view at that forum that civic society has a vital role to play in addressing not just domestic but also sexual violence.</P>
        <P>Victims of domestic violence may become confused by the complexity of their situation or they may find it difficult to navigate across the range of services provided to meet their needs.  Regardless of their capabilities, they may lose confidence in their capacity to make the right choice for themselves and their families.  It is essential that each person in Irish society should play his or her part in building confidence in victims.  They must have confidence that not only will they be believed if they report abuse but that there will be understanding in respect of their circumstances.</P>
        <P>We should all be open to listening to a disclosure of domestic violence and we should also know what action to take.  With the assistance of the various services working in this area, Cosc has developed a website showing how and where to obtain help.  All types of people are affected <Col N="894"/>by domestic violence.  As we never know when we may be called on to help, we should be ready to do whatever is in our power.  The Cosc website &mdash; <i>www.cosc.ie</i> &mdash; has useful information to assist people in deciding, depending on the circumstances involved, on the best course of action to take.</P>
        <P>Through ongoing development and the commitment of Government Departments and State bodies, working in partnership with all relevant NGOs and supported by a more engaged society, the new national strategy will deliver a strong foundation for an improved system of prevention and response leading to safer lives at home and in our communities.  The strategy is not a dry document with the early signs of dust gathering on its cover.  It is both a statement of national understanding of the complexity of domestic and sexual violence, as well as a realistic collaborative action plan for the coming five years.  Implementation has begun and there are clear commitments which will be met.  The strategy sets out a vision of a society that says it will not tolerate, nor remain silent on, domestic, sexual or gender-based abuse or violence in our neighbourhoods and communities.  The implementation of this strategy provides a clear direction to achieve this vision.  The Government is strongly committed to proceeding with that implementation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate her on her new role.  I hope she will make a real difference in respect of the victims of domestic violence, women and children, who are largely invisible.  Those who work with them cannot be photographed for their own safety.  Since I became a Member of the House three years ago I have run a number of coffee mornings for the victims of domestic violence and for the refuge centre at Waterside House in Galway and these are some of the facts I have learned.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on the scale of the problem of domestic violence as it relates to the COPE Galway Waterside House Refuge.  I spoke to people at the centre earlier today and discovered that the number of women who are trying to avail of its services is continually increasing.  In 2009, some 152 women were admitted to the centre.  Of these, 99 were individual admissions and the remaining 53 were admitted more than once.  It is obvious that the rate of recurrence of domestic violence in the lives of the latter women is quite high.  Some 227 children were admitted to the centre in 2009.  However, 238 women and 425 children were turned away and had to be referred to a different refuge or bed and breakfast establishment due to a lack of space.  I am delighted Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, who, like me, comes from Galway, is present, particularly as the centre to which I refer represents both the city and county.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2008, 10% of all callers to the Women&rsquo;s Aid national freefone helpline disclosed that they were being abused by former partners to whom they were not married.  It is obvious, therefore, that a person who leaves an abusive relationship remains at risk.  The stalking of victims by their abusers after they have left the relationship is a major issue.</P>
        <P>It is also important to consider the number of women who have died as a result of domestic violence since the mid-1990s.  Since 1996, 162 women have been murdered in the Republic of Ireland as a result of domestic violence.  In 51% of resolved cases, the woman was killed by her partner or ex-partner.  Domestic violence can, therefore, prove fatal.  One of the most striking media campaigns I have ever witnessed, was that which took place last year and which showed 150 empty pairs of women&rsquo;s shoes.  They had been filled by women who had been murdered as a result of domestic violence which is a very serious crime against women.</P>
        <P>What are the effects of domestic violence on women and children?  There are physical health effects such as asthma and high blood pressure which are stress related.  As one in eight victims is abused throughout pregnancy, there are high numbers of miscarriages and stillbirths.  The mental effects include depression, low self-esteem, inability to cope with everyday life, dis<Col N="895"/>rupted sleep patterns, eating disorders as a result of poor body image, panic attacks, suicidal tendencies, substance abuse, self-neglect, alcoholism and serious risk to one&rsquo;s own life.</P>
        <P>The longer the victim is in the abusive relationship the worse it is.  Some women have a history of visiting their local GP on a regular basis with minor ailments which normally is a sign of a call for help.  I would like the Minister of State to consider flagging a protocol for women at risk of domestic violence through a pattern of GP visits.  A number of years ago when I was a teacher, I dealt with a family of children and it was obvious to me that there was neglect in the family home.  They were forever at the accident and emergency department or visiting their GP, both of which could identify abuse.  Even when a woman leaves an abusive relationship, this does not mean the violence will stop.  Many women experience additional violence and stalking by their abusers.</P>
        <P>There are also the effects on children.  In the short term there are language and speech development problems such as stammering; panic and anxiety attacks; mood disturbance; low self-esteem; feelings of guilt and self-blame; depression; lack of concentration in school; bed-wetting; withdrawal and babyish behaviour.  The effects on education would be sustained.  The long-term effects are serious and include the danger of the children becoming abusers or bullies themselves because fundamentally at the root of domestic abuse of women by men is the issue of control and power.  One must consider where this need comes from.  Perhaps it goes back to a cycle of inter-generational abuse and being bullied which brings us back to low self-esteem.  Other effects include mental health problems; substance abuse; running away from home and delinquency.  Young girls, in particular, have trouble in forming their own relationships after seeing domestic violence in the family home, as they distrust men in general and also have a distorted view of what constitutes a healthy relationship.</P>
        <P>The economic downturn has had an effect on the level of domestic violence, as more women and children are seeking refuge.  As a result, it has become increasingly more difficult to move women on from sheltered accommodation.  In general, beds in refuges are scarce but they are being blocked by women who are in permanent residence.  Perhaps &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; is the wrong word to use, as the women concerned need a home.  An increasing number of women are seeking accommodation.  There has also been an increase in the number who stay in refuges on a long-term basis.</P>
        <P>It is important that we examine the main causes of domestic violence in order that we can act to prevent it.  The Green Party puts forward the notion that it believes in prevention through health promotion.  I also support and welcome this.  The main causal factors for domestic violence are power and control.  Other contributing factors are self-esteem issues, the media, bullying, drug abuse, alcohol and unemployment.  It is important to focus on the power and control issue which is often cultural and has to do with the way a person was reared.  We need to consider what is the need that makes one want to have such power and control over another.  It comes down to one person wanting complete control and power in the relationship.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A large proportion of the women affected are in traditional relationships.  The husband &mdash; the abuser &mdash; sees himself as the main breadwinner and his position in the relationship as being superior to that of his wife.  He uses various means of control over his wife such as access to contraception, money which the Minister of State mentioned and a mobile telephone.  The wife or partner who is the victim of the abuse feels her responsibilities lie with providing and caring for the children, cooking, cleaning and caring for her husband.  Her role is secondary to that of her husband.  The key point is that she and her husband share this ideology.  However, this does not mean she expects to be abused.  While she entered the relationship or marriage with that ideology, it does not mean it is a licence to be abused.</P><Col N="896"/>
        <P>Mr. Don Hennessy, the former director of the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency<b>, </b>believes men consider they are entitled to behave in this way and have power over their wives.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Male offenders hide their intentions under a veneer of love.  His sense of entitlement that his needs always have priority and his intention to take what is &lsquo;his&rsquo; are covered in this cloak of love.  &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; when spoken by a male abuser means that I love what you do for me.  The same statement when made by a non-abusive male means I want what is best for you.</P>
        <P>It is an important tweaking of the locus of control.  When male abusers are challenged about their behaviour, they usually respond with a long list of excuses as to why they acted the way they did.  Mr. Hennessy stated they would inevitably try to blame the women for the abuse.  He also stated we should not ask if the victim had said, &ldquo;No&rdquo;, we should ask whether she had ever said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Let us consider the most urgent issue that needs to be addressed to prevent a continuation of domestic violence.  The most important matter is reform of the criminal justice system, which is badly needed.  We strongly support Women&rsquo;s Aid&rsquo;s recommendations, in particular those relating to the qualification criteria for eligibility for protection under the Domestic Violence Act.  To qualify for a barring or safety order under domestic violence law an unmarried woman has to be living with the perpetrator for six of the previous nine months.  However, abuse could take place in the first month.  Married women can take out an order at any stage.  This excludes a significant number of clients of Women&rsquo;s Aid from availing of protection under the Domestic Violence Act, including those who have children with a partner but who do not live together.</P>
        <P>I will give the example of a woman who had been with her partner for two years when they moved in together.  They had been living together for two months when he seriously assaulted her, as a result of which she had to be hospitalised.  She does not qualify for a barring or safety order under current domestic violence legislation and can only use the Non-Fatal Offences Against The Person Act.  This discriminates against women who are not married.  Teenage mothers who do not live with the father of their child can also be victims of domestic abuse and are also unable to take out a barring order under the Domestic Violence Act.  This is a critical issue that needs to be emphasised in any strategy.  It is probably the most important one.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Women&rsquo;s Aid and the refuge centre in Galway consider strongly that more follow-up work needs to be done and aftercare provided for victims of domestic abuse.  When a woman finds she is no longer in need of the services the refuge offers, she moves on, which can be good.  As a result, it is hard for the refuge to collate information on the quality of life these women and their children enjoy afterwards.  However, many of the women and children who leave the refuge are still in need of additional counselling and therapy services which the refuge is unable to offer as a result of budgetary constraints.  The Minister of State mentioned an inter-agency approach to examine how other agencies could liaise with refuge centres and Women&rsquo;s Aid to ensure women and children receive ongoing help.  I ask her to imagine what would happen if she or I were abused.  Even if we were to receive help, it would not mean we would not live with after-effects or flashbacks.  Abuse victims provided me with accounts in which they were unable to have sexual relations again because such flashbacks were so severe.  Consequently, there is a need for ongoing aftercare and follow-up.  Refuges do their best to offer additional services with the small funds available to them.  However, they consider that the follow-up services they offer are only a fraction of what they should be doing.  There is a lack of consistency in respect of follow-up services, which resource is badly needed.</P><Col N="897"/>
        <P>I turn to the question of how the problem of domestic violence can be made more visible in order that society will become more aware of its prevalence.  This is an interesting point because when I held the aforementioned coffee morning, I noticed that men who were sitting in the outer section of the hotel in which it was being held were highly uncomfortable with its progress and snide remarks were made and so on.  There must be far more media attention, while the profile of the various rape crisis centres and women&rsquo;s refuges must be raised.  Many women who were murdered had had a history of domestic violence.  However, this detail is often not disclosed by the media.  Agencies such as Cosc, to which the Minister of State referred, provide money for leaflets, etc. but this is not enough; a general public awareness campaign is needed.  Moreover, this must not be perceived to be a woman&rsquo;s issue only.  I have applauded the men who have shown up at, for example, coffee mornings in support of women who have been abused in relationships.  I also applaud the men who intend to speak on the issue in the Chamber today.  In addition, advocacy agencies must be encouraged.</P>
        <P>I refer to the work that has helped women and children to recover.  Women&rsquo;s refuges received a small amount of funding recently that enabled them to set up a 12-week programme entitled the Power to Change support group which was of great benefit to women who had been victims of abuse.  When a woman leaves an abusive relationship, she often can have feelings of severe isolation and loneliness.  The self-esteem of such women is very low.  Some music and play therapy groups are available to children.  Equally, MOVE, men overcoming violence, is a nationwide organisation which engages male abusers in a weekly group therapy session.  The therapy they receive is cognitive, which is welcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue and thank those colleagues who made strenuous efforts in recent months on the Order of Business to ensure it was raised in the House.  It is very important that the Legislature is seen to send a strong message on domestic violence.  I also welcome the Minister of State, on what I understand is her first appearance in the House, and wish her well in her new portfolio.  Having had the opportunity to listen to her several times on radio in recent days, I was highly impressed.  If she brings the same clarity and focus she demonstrated on radio, this portfolio will certainly benefit from her input.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I will try not to repeat points made by either Senator Healy Eames or the Minister of State, it has been stated domestic violence is and continues to be a huge problem in society.  It refers to the use of physical, psychological, sexual, emotional, verbal or economic abuse, including the threat of violence, as well as the use of violence in intimate and close relationships.  It can affect anyone in a household, a point the Minister of State outlined clearly.  However, statistics strongly demonstrate that it affects women, in particular.  It can affect every woman, regardless of age, marital status, class or cultural background, and knows no boundaries.  Every day in Ireland women are beaten, raped and trapped in their homes by those closest to them.  The Minister of State outlined in graphic terms the forms such violence can take and the statistics are stark.  One in five women in Ireland suffers from domestic violence and it is estimated that globally one in three women faces abuse, violence and rape every day.</P>
        <P>Although the figures are less clear regarding the number of men who face violence within the home, it is known they do and in recent times there has been a greater tendency for men to come forward, even though it remains very difficult for them to so do.  However, they are <Col N="898"/>aided and supported by organisations such as Amen.  Moreover, as the Minister of State noted, older people and children also are subject to domestic violence.</P>
        <P>In Ireland it is estimated that 213,000 women are living with severe abuse every day by boyfriends, husbands or partners.  This stark figure demonstrates that 250,000 women, Irish citizens and residents, live with abuse every day.  As Senator Healy Eames observed, since 1996 a huge number of women have been murdered in the Republic of Ireland and in 51% of the cases that were solved, the women involved were murdered by their partners or ex-partners.  However, there also are many hidden injuries and it is possible there are many hidden related deaths, of which one is unaware, that statistics cannot capture but were at the hands of abusers.</P>
        <P>The economic costs of domestic violence also are stark.  The estimated annual economic cost of domestic violence to the economy is &euro;2.2 billion.  Given the current economic climate, it is apt to also include consideration of the economic costs of domestic violence.  In Ireland women experiencing domestic violence make 50% more emergency visits than other women, have double the mental health costs and incur costs for drug and alcohol services that are six times higher.  Overall, 3% of total HSE expenditure is due to physical injuries that are directly attributable to domestic violence.  The personal costs to victims of domestic violence are enormous.  Women and men experience a significant loss of confidence and quality of life.  People in situations of domestic abuse are not living but merely existing from day to day.  They are simply hoping to survive or that when they get out of bed in the morning, they will be able to return to it that night in a condition somewhat similar to that in which they left it.  They suffer a range of injuries and, in extreme cases, death.</P>
        <P>Children are also victims of domestic abuse, whether directly or as witnesses of abuse.  Even as witnesses, the impact on them is extreme.  There has not been an opportunity to examine this subject closely.  Anecdotal accounts come from schools of how they can identify children in classrooms who come from homes in which domestic abuse occurs through conduct issues, a lack of concentration or a general state of unhappiness.  To make matters worse, I refer to attempts by schools to intervene purely on behalf of children in such situations such as, for example, efforts to seek additional support to catch up on the lessons on which the child is missing out as a result of the aforementioned lack of concentration and attention or to find another way to manage behaviour other than being obliged to suspend the child.  Often such attempts by schools to intervene on the part of children are met by resistance.  Due to the conflict, the child often finds himself or herself being used as a pawn by parents.  The consent required from both parents for a particular action is not forthcoming because what happens to the child has become an extension of the conflict in the home.  This is not acceptable.  I know of situations in which children are not getting access to the supports they need because consent forms are not being signed as a result of conflicts in the home.  This increases the abuse&rsquo;s impact on innocent bystanders.</P>
        <P>Children who have grown up seeing their mums subjected to abuse have tried to intervene with the best of intentions.  This escalates the abuse to a new level.  I have heard accounts of young children who tried to stand in bedroom doorways to stop their dads getting to their mums.  This is an horrendous way to live.  One would come home from school unsure of what one would be facing that evening.</P>
        <P>We have considered what we would say and hoped to achieve in this debate.  We have raised the matter on the Order of Business a number of times.  We hope that this debate will, as a minimum, highlight domestic violence and the national strategy outlined in great detail by the Minister of State.  It is important we raise awareness among ourselves as legislators and among anyone outside the House who hears of our debate on domestic violence.  This is an opportunity to reflect on the effectiveness of the measures that have been put in place.  Every Senator in <Col N="899"/>attendance has a broad range of contacts.  Sometimes, these allow us to refer to anecdotal evidence of how people are finding the situation.  It can inform debate and future measures.</P>
        <P>In considering what else we may get out of this debate, I take this opportunity to advocate for the building of circles of support within our communities.  Everyone has a role to play in respect of dealing with domestic violence.  When the Minister of State discussed the strategy, she mentioned inter-agency work.  A strategy on domestic violence must be owned by the people if all of us, as residents and citizens, are to take some degree of responsibility.  I will revert on this matter.</P>
        <P>The final thing I hope this debate will achieve is to send a message to people who find themselves in situations of domestic violence, namely, they are not alone, there is help and support and they should come forward.  I have cited statistics, but we do not know how much of the real situation they are conveying.  I have no doubt that statistics will never capture events that are occurring today and will occur today.  We will never hear about them.  All of these statistics are the minimum, not necessarily a realistic reflection.  To those who find themselves in that situation, I would like to say they are not on their own and I ask them to come forward.</P>
        <P>I revert to my point on developing circles of support within the community, a matter on which I feel strongly.  Everyday, I am struck by the question of how many of us have wondered what to do after hearing a disturbance in a neighbour&rsquo;s house.  Recently, I encountered an example of a lady who experienced considerable abuse at the hands of her husband.  Since I knew her living situation, I knew there was no way her neighbours could not have heard what was occurring.  When I asked her whether anyone had taken action, she told me that everyone had been afraid to call the Garda because they did not know whether they should have interfered in a private situation.  One person who used to live across the road from her had always made a point of calling the Garda.  When he moved out, he made a point of asking a neighbour to call the Garda if it occurred again, but that person said he or she would not because what happened behind closed doors was no one else&rsquo;s business.</P>
        <P>This is what we must tackle.  I appeal to people.  If they hear a violent disturbance, they should call someone.  Domestic violence is just a fancy name for assault and brutality.  It makes us feel a little bit better, a little more comfortable when saying it, but it boils down to physical assault and brutality.  We have no business standing by without taking action.  We are horrified when newspapers, &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; or other chat or radio shows tell us of how a young lad or girl was set upon and beaten up while going home.  We are horrified when we hear of that young person&rsquo;s injuries, but they are no different than those being suffered by the victim behind closed doors.  That assault is no less wrong than what is occurring behind closed doors.  We all need to take a stand.  Sometimes, this means picking up the telephone and calling for help.  If the victim was me, another Senator, one of our daughters, sons or sisters, would we not like to believe that some neighbour would have the decency to pick up the telephone and protect the victim?</P>

        <P>Senator Healy Eames raised some issues, but I wish to raise others.  There is a waiting time for obtaining barring and interim protection orders, even where one is eligible to seek them.

        <P>Will the Minister of State consider what supports could be put in place for children?  In terms of prevention, it is important we examine what is occurring in schools.

	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State.  I was unusual in welcoming the Cabinet reshuffle and the general Government move.  I specified this development.  The separation of equality issues from the Department of Justice, Equality of Law Reform in a new arrangement between the current Minister and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, is welcome news and must be positive, although it is a pity the issue of domestic violence still appears to fall principally under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Clear issues are to be addressed, one of which I read about this morning and has already been raised in the House, namely, a Down&rsquo;s syndrome child who was raped and prevented from giving evidence by the judge because he believed that, under outdated legislation, she lacked the capacity.  This matter must be re-examined, as it was a serious and horrifying case.  Yesterday, I spent a very pleasant 20 minutes interviewing Mr. Frank Crummey, who was one of the founders of the Irish Family Planning Association.  In the early 1960s when talking about violence against children on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;As we sit here in this studio, children are being abused by the Christian Brothers.&rdquo;  I can put a variation on that statement.  As we speak, domestic violence is being practised, predominantly by men against women.  That should not obviate an interest in violence against men, either by other men or by women.  The facts are quite clear.  The issue is the violence and not the gender.  However, the gender appears to be a determining factor in the majority of cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I regret that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is still so directly involved.  The Minister of State said the strategy oversight committee to implement the report by Cosc is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Se&aacute;n Aylward, and will meet twice yearly and report progress to the group of Secretaries General and to the Government.  I do not know Mr. Aylward and I have nothing against him.  However, this is an internal group, which is exactly what the Equal Rights Alliance and many others warned against.  It will tend not to be critical of Government policy.  That is a serious flaw.  The committee should report, not to Secretaries General and the Government, but directly to the Oireachtas so we can discuss these issues and make recommendations.  I ask the Minister of State to give us an undertaking that the report will be made to the Oireachtas.  Once again, the Oireachtas is being bypassed and that is not a good idea.</P><Col N="901"/>
        <P>The Cosc report is a very odd sort of document.  It is full of sentimental twaddle and waffle as well as some reasonably good and specific suggestions.  It is an extraordinary mixture.  The Cosc press release states, &ldquo;We have a plan!&rdquo;  The report talks about &ldquo;your wonderful help and advice&rdquo; and goes on to bleat about thanking Cosc&rsquo;s partners for the wonderful this, that and the other.  It is not professional.  There is a mixture of authorship, in my opinion.  The report would be strengthened by being independent.</P>
        <P>The national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender based violence, which was published in February 2009 after a number of consultations, huddles, chats and so on, is supposed to be implemented by the Government.  I hope the suggestions made in the strategy will be implemented.</P>
        <P>I would embark on a slightly broader definition of domestic violence than some of the earlier speakers, one of whom suggested it was confined entirely to physical violence.  Psychological violence can be equally damaging, particularly over a long period.  Two definitions are useful.  The first comes from the report of the task force on violence against women published by the Office of the T&aacute;naiste in 1997, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Domestic violence refers to the use of physical or emotional force or threat of physical force, including sexual violence, in close adult relationships.  The term domestic violence goes beyond actual physical violence.  It can also involve: emotional abuse; the destruction of property; isolation from friends, family and other sources of support; threats to others, including children; stalking; and control over access to money, personal items, food, transportation and the telephone.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a very useful definition.  If one analyses it and applies it to the situation one finds that the policies of successive Governments, including the current one, have made the situation worse.  I will give some instances of this.  I do not attack any particular party or Government.  I simply say this is the impact of the policies of successive Governments of various complexions.</P>
        <P>The second definition is an international one from the World Health Organisation.  It is cited by Ellsberg and Heise in their thesis of 2005:</P>
        <P LI="1">Violence against women encompasses but is not limited to physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, and the sexual abuse of female children in the household.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I do not know why it should be confined to female children.  There are plenty of examples of violence against male children.  Recently we heard of a case of both parents who were sexually molesting their children.  I object in the strongest possible terms to newspapers such as <i>The Irish Times</i> referring to groups like the Iona Institute as pro-family.  They stupidly let similar kinds of groups get away with the tag pro-life, which puts the rest of us into the pro-death camp.  Whether the Iona Institute is pro-family, I most certainly am.  I am a member of a family.  I did not come down the hot tap in the bath; I am part of the family.  These groups, which call themselves Christian, should read the Gospels where, for example, Jesus Christ was attacked by the Pharisees because He ground an ear of corn between His fingers and was told He was working on the Sabbath.  He said that &ldquo;Sabbath is made for man, not man for the Sabbath&rdquo;.  We should beware of idolising institutions like marriage even when they operate against the interests of individuals, particularly the children contained in them.  I am part of the family.  I am very pro-family.  I am also a bit picky about the families I support.  I would not, particularly, support families in which incest was a natural part of the daily routine.  I do not think they deserve my support.</P><Col N="902"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>One in five women in Ireland has experienced domestic violence by a partner or ex-partner.  Some 162 women were murdered since 1996, some quite recently.  That is an astonishing statistic.  There have been 215,000 incidents of domestic violence reported to Women&rsquo;s Aid.  One in eight women surveyed in a Dublin maternity hospital had experienced domestic violence during pregnancy.  One in four perpetrators against adult women are partners or ex-partners.  There has been only one conviction for marital rape since the introduction of legislation 20 years ago.  Marital rape is a comparatively frequent phenomenon but no one is held to account for it.  The situation is roughly similar internationally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have mentioned the Equal Rights Alliance and I pay tribute to it.  When the Government decided, in the teeth of an economic storm, systematically to dismantle every organisation that was speaking out for the vulnerable, including the poor, women, gay people and others, the Equal Rights Alliance held the fort.  I also thank God for the Green Party.</P>

	<P>The Green Party, the Minister of State and the other Green members of the Government made sure the damage was as limited as possible and they fought to reverse it.  Part of that reversal has landed the Minister of State in the House tonight.</P>
        <P>Women are in this wonderful situation where they are a minority although they are 51% of the population.  I am not good at arithmetic but even I can see there is something a little suspicious about that.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, who has drawn these circumstances to our attention.  Some 4% of Irish women have executive positions in Irish business and women earn 14% less than men.  Women graduates, such as our voters, earn 11% less than men so they are 3% better off.  Some 23% of women have incomes which put them in a poverty situation.  I could go on.  These statistics show there is a structural discrimination against women.</P>
        <P>The question of legislation was not addressed in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  Domestic violence is not named or statutorily defined as a crime in legislation.  The Domestic Violence Act 1996 does not define or name domestic violence.  It refers to assault.  The Cosc report recommends that a definition of domestic violence be included in legislation and that it should incorporate both physical and psychological abuse because abuse other than physical can be more damaging.  Let us have some action and accountability.  If even this weak report recommends this measure I would like to see it done.</P>
        <P>I read with immense interest a wonderful thesis by Ms Paula Fagan.  I do not know who she is but she writes very incisively.  Her research is on the provision of services to migrant women in Ireland.  We have had a huge increase in the number of migrant women.  For most of my lifetime Ireland was a totally homogenous society.  That has changed and fractured and there has been a particular growth in female immigration.  These women are particularly vulnerable because of their marginal status in society.  Structural barriers for migrant women include immigration status, racism, lack of language and culturally inappropriate support.  These can have a really serious effect.  Ms Fagan&rsquo;s thesis depends on information culled from a series of sources.</P>
      
	<P>There are six &mdash; Longford Women&rsquo;s Link, Longford; Meath Women&rsquo;s Refuge, Navan; Rathmines Refuge, Dublin, for which I remember performing a Joyce one-man show as a fundraiser about 25 years ago; WAVES, Sligo; Women&rsquo;s Aid, Dublin and Women&rsquo;s Aid, Dundalk.  It is clear from all of this evidence that women are vulnerable within marriage and other domestic partnership arrangements.</P><Col N="903"/>
        <P Just="Left">On the barriers and difficulties faced by migrant women, the first is our immigration legislation.  We are promised immigration and nationalisation legislation which I have read and it stinks.  It is one of the most corrupt pieces of legislation I have ever come across and it stinks on a constitutional and legal basis.  I attended a series of briefings by senior legal people &mdash; solicitors and, in particular, barristers &mdash; and was so impressed by them that I brought them to the AV room to talk to my colleagues.  I hope their concerns will be taken on board.</P>
        <P>Immigration legislation impacts greatly on the lives and choices of migrant women, increasing their physical vulnerability and distress in situations of domestic violence and severely curtailing their options.  That is a stark fact to face.  Our legislation exposes them to physical danger.  Individual women face the restriction on public funds through social welfare restrictions.  Restriction of services as a result of underfunding limits women&rsquo;s choices and curtails the development of appropriate responses.  They often face both racism in wider society and cultural attitudes within their own community.  There is an attitude, not only on the part of the Government in this respect &mdash; it is a broad phenomenon.  A United Kingdom study states that with the focus on abuses by asylum seekers rather than abuses against them, successive governments have justified the introduction of measures to reduce the duties they have to immigrants and asylum seekers, reducing the amount of money and services, inlcuding housing, available to them.  That is evident both here and in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>There is the question of deportation.  I spoke outside the House at lunchtime to a group, Residents against Racism, of which I know the Minister of State is aware.  There have been many such cases, including the case of Pamela Izevbekhai and that of the five year old girl with sickle cell anaemia who had to have her spleen removed.  Thank God for that wonderful Irish female consultant who stood up against the bureaucracy and insisted that the girl not be returned to Nigeria where she would have faced certain death.  Having had her spleen removed and having sickle cell anaemia, if she had to move to live in a malarial area, undoubtedly she would have died, yet faceless bureaucrats were prepared to contemplate this possibility very easily and comfortably.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is the question of social welfare restrictions.  Migrant women are denied access to affordable housing, which is a real problem.  In 1999 the then United Kingdom Government introduced the domestic violence concession, under which women who are subject to domestic violence are allowed to claim residence.  Have we done this here?  No, we have not.  Has the Cosc avoided the issue?  Yes, it has.  We should introduce such a measure.</P>
        <P>There is the question of undocumented women, women who are trafficked in the country for sexual purposes and who are even more vulnerable.  Our immigration policy has been focused primarily on economic interests.  That is why we do not give the women involved a degree of permanency.  We take from them any support that is available.  For example, rent allowance has been taken from them, which is a disgrace.  We must make sure we make such provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All of the groups have joined together to state these measures should be introduced.  Measures should be put in place to ensure all migrant women, documented or undocumented, and children who experience domestic violence whose immigration status is dependent on their spouse should be given temporary leave to remain.  All migrant women and children in this situation should be automatically deemed compliant with the habitual residency condition.  They should be given the right to work and support should be provided in situations of domestic violence.  This is an opportunity to make such provision because the Government&rsquo;s policy leaves women exposed.  They are often dependent on their husbands for financial support, which makes them vulnerable, unless the State moves in to assist them.  We have a good and idealistic <Col N="904"/>Minister of State and also a party in government which has some access to the decent elements in Fianna F&aacute;il.  We should use them and address these real issues, not just the blather contained in the Cosc report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White.  I hope she lives up to the great things expected of her.  She has responsibility for equality and integration matters and it is great that she is in the House today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first issue I wish to address briefly is that this debate was largely called for by the female Members of the House who account for roughly 20% of its membership.  It is mainly they who have spoken on the matter.  I very much welcome the fact that Senator Norris has spoken on it, as this is not just a matter for women, it is very much a matter for everyone in society.</P>
        <P>On the various reports on the subject and the level of domestic violence in the country, Senator Norris mentioned that perhaps one in five women had been abused at some stage.  The 2005 ESRI report stated that one in seven women had been abused.  It also stated that one in 17 men had been abused.  Therefore, domestic violence is not purely a gender issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Male physical abuse is not commonly acknowledged in society.  Therefore, it is hard to know the extent of the problem.  Figures for domestic violence are hard to quantify because much of it occurs behind closed doors and is not reported.  What I have given are the reported figures.  The figure that almost 500,000 women in the country have been abused is startling.  If one were to add together all of the women living in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick, they would not number 213,000.  That the incidence of domestic violence is higher than the number of women who live in these four cities is startling.  However, that appears to be reality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that something should come out of this debate.  We are in the midst of a recession.  Senator Healy Eames referred to Waterside House, a women&rsquo;s refuge in Galway.  In a recession people face difficult challenges.  When I talked today to people in that refuge which was set up by COPE in 1981, they advised that the peak time when people tried to get into the refuge was Christmas, a time when people come together and have to face one another head on.  It is difficult when people have to face one another without the distractions of work or daily life; that is often when violence erupts.  A significant number of people are now unemployed and more partners have to face each other on a daily basis.  This will probably lead to more violence and difficult situations.  The people to whom I spoke told me that Government funding for the service was drying up, as is community funding and fund-raising, on which far more emphasis is put.</P>
        <P>I also spoke to people at the Galway Rape Crisis Centre who told me that they had to raise &euro;170,000 publicly simply to survive and provide the most basic of services.  The centre has a male counsellor who I understand is the only male counsellor in the west, a stark statistic, and there is a long waiting list of people to see him.</P>
        <P>Violence perpetrated against men is violence that dare not speak its name.  Senator Norris referred to the issue which is often lost in a debate such as this, in which, unfortunately, not enough men participate.  There is violence against men.  The Minister of State has responsibility for equality and integration issues and I have been told time and again by various organisations that men are not equal in family law.  That is the factual position.</P>
        <P>Men who are responsible for violence is one issue but many men who experience physical, emotional, sexual or other forms of violence in the home find it difficult to deal with the <Col N="905"/>problem on the basis that the law and services are not supportive to the extent necessary.  If a man experiences domestic violence, where does he go and what does he do?  His name is placed on a waiting list and he faces the danger that he, rather than his partner, will lose access to the couple&rsquo;s children, despite the fact that in some cases it is the man who is trying to protect the children.  Men who are faced with these circumstances are not properly protected by the law.  This is largely because men, unlike women, have not stood up and been counted in debates on the issue.  This is wrong and men must become more involved in this area.  This debate also makes a good case for having more women in politics.</P>
        <P>I refer to an interesting one-day survey carried out on 4 November 2008 which showed that on the day in question, 263 women and 216 children were accommodated and received support from domestic violence services, 239 helpline calls were received from women and 17 women and 15 children were admitted to refuges, while six women could not be accommodated owing to a lack of space.  In these recessionary times, we must ensure that in certain services the base line is not breached.  While money is always a great difficulty in a recession, we must ensure the integrity of certain services is protected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I concur with Senator Corrigan on the need for a safety audit.  The delay between reporting and a barring order being issued can be exacerbated when services are reduced in a recession.  A safety audit is an important aspect of the overall process.</P>
        <P>In 2008, according to the Courts Service report on 2008, a total of 10,401 applications were made for protective orders under the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  In the same year, 1,251 barring orders, 1,502 safety orders, 2,955 protection orders and 445 interim barring orders were granted.  The Garda recorded crime statistics for 2008 indicate there were 1,184 incidents of breaching of domestic barring order offences in that year alone.  These resulted in 349 convictions, with 95% of the persons convicted men and the remaining 5% women.</P>
        <P>Domestic violence is an important and serious issue which will not go away in a recession.  Unfortunately, based on anecdotal evidence, the number of cases of domestic violence is likely to increase in a recessionary period.  When we talk about base lines and matters of vital importance, we must bear in mind that domestic violence services are vital and their integrity must be retained.  We can, however, take an imaginative approach to how we maintain these services.  The current services cannot be treated as acceptable because it is necessary to continue to make progress in this area, regardless of the economic position.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White, is present and that her portfolio does not come within the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Domestic violence is largely a social problem for which many possible solutions can be found by working together as communities and using our imagination to protect people.  We must act to ensure that years from now we do not experience the same horror and disgust we experienced as a result of the reports on institutional child sex abuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the House has been afforded an opportunity to have this debate on domestic violence as it has been sought by many of us for some time.  I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State and pleased that she has been given the new portfolio of equality.  As Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in noted, it is welcome that domestic violence comes within her remit.  I look forward to engaging with her, not alone on this issue but also on the issue of women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  As members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, Senator McDonald and I recently produced a report on this issue on behalf of the Sub-Committee on Women&rsquo;s Participation in Politics.  We are anxious to debate the report in the House and have some interaction on it with the Minister of State. </P><Col N="906"/>
        <P>On the issue of domestic violence, I will cite the words of Professor Susan Edwards, one of the foremost writers on this topic in Britain.  In her 1996 text, <i>Sex and Gender in the Legal Process</i>, Ms Edwards described the treatment of domestic violence in the law, the issue on which I propose to focus given that it is my area of expertise.  According to Edwards, domestic violence until the 1970s was regarded as a rare phenomenon.  This is as true of Ireland as it is of England and this view may even have persisted longer here.  Criminal law, Edwards adds, was rarely if ever invoked to prosecute aggressors.  A far wider range of remedies in law is now available but stereotypical attitudes and expectations of women and men persist and these inform the law and militate against the justice and protection victims receive, she continues.  The law, while it makes claims to offer remedies and protection to victims, is replete with obstacles and difficulties for the applicant seeking safety and protection, she concludes.  Much of what Edwards wrote about circumstances in Britain in 1996 is still true and is relevant in this country.</P>
        <P>I am glad a more serious approach is being taken to domestic violence.  The establishment of Cosc was a positive step, as was the publication of a national strategy this year, although much of the latter is framed in aspirational terms and, from a lawyer&rsquo;s perspective, does not set out a sufficient number of focused goals.  Despite this, I welcome the goals set out in the strategy.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the great work done by non-governmental organisations in highlighting the issue of domestic violence.  I pay tribute, as other Senators have done, to Women&rsquo;s Aid, which has done much work in providing support to victims of violence, highlighting the relevant issues at policy level and making policy proposals.  In that context, I refer to the Women&rsquo;s Aid submission on the Civil Partnership Bill which is before the D&aacute;il.  The submission raises concern about one aspect of the Bill which has not been highlighted to any great degree in the debate thus far, namely, the amendment it makes to domestic violence legislation.  Having worked with Women&rsquo;s Aid on developing its submission, I was concerned when it was pointed out to me &mdash; I had not noticed &mdash; that some of the provisions in the Civil Partnership Bill would have the effect of weakening protections for victims under domestic violence legislation.  More care needs to be taken in terms of how the amendments affect the domestic violence legal framework.  If Women&rsquo;s Aid has not provided the Minister of State with a copy of its submission on the Bill, I will ensure it does so because it is important she is aware of it.  This is a cross-over issue, as it were, and, given the importance the national strategy attaches to a whole-of-government approach to domestic violence, it is one area in which cross-departmental work and liaison is clearly required.  This will be necessary to ensure domestic violence protections are not watered down, even inadvertently, through the civil partnership legislation.</P>
        <P>Before referring to some of the figures and statistics, I propose briefly to discuss the term &ldquo;domestic violence&rdquo;.  The use of the adjective &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; has been criticised by many academic commentators over the years on the basis that it can trivialise the nature of the abuse.  In a criminal law sense or criminal justice context it somehow divorces this form of violence from the normal criminal law on assault, violence and offences against the person and, therefore, neutralises the full viciousness of the abuse involved.  This can render its victims somehow less worthy of the protection of the criminal justice system.  The use of the word &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; can also serve in a subliminal or indirect way to reduce or minimise the seriousness of this type of abuse in terms of those in the criminal justice system dealing with the perpetrators.</P><Col N="907"/>
        <P Just="Left">I very much welcome one of the commitments in the national strategy to strengthen the measures used to ensure accountability when dealing with perpetrators.  I am very concerned about this issue.  Susan Edwards has advocated that where the term &ldquo;domestic violence&rdquo; is used, apostrophes should be placed around the word &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; to signify the problematic nature of this term.  In some of the Irish research, the phrase &ldquo;violence in intimate relationships between women and men&rdquo; has been used but that is a cumbersome phrase.  The advantage to using the term &ldquo;domestic violence&rdquo;, albeit with that kind of proviso, is that the meaning is widely understood and it emphasises the particular issues that arise with this violence.</P>
        <P>The statistics on domestic violence show that although the myth is that the main source of risk and danger of violence is from strangers in the street, the reality is that the home may be a place of serious danger and violence for many.  We have seen many different figures in the statistics on the level to which people are at risk of domestic violence.  The 2005 national survey conducted by the National Crime Council found that approximately one in seven women, or 15%, and approximately one in 16 men, or 6%, had experienced severely abusive behaviour of a physical, sexual or emotional nature from a partner at some point in their lives.  The earlier Women&rsquo;s Aid study showed it to be 18% of women in intimate relationships.  The SAVI report showed a higher proportion &mdash; 20% of girls and 10% of boys had experienced sexual abuse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The National Crime Council is perhaps the most conservative but it still points out that even according to its figures, the reality is that in the region of 213,000 women and 88,000 men have been severely abused by a partner at some point in their lives.  It found that women&rsquo;s injuries tended to be more serious and that women were almost twice as likely as men to require medical treatment for their injuries and ten times more likely to require a stay in hospital.  Not only was there a great deal more women victims involved, the injuries tended to be more serious.  For that reason, research and discussion have justifiably tended to focus on women victims, although there is a very clear acknowledgement of the existence of male victims.  The law is gender neutral.</P>
        <P>Looking briefly at the law and at what is currently in place, it was not until 1976 that we introduced a civil remedy for domestic violence through the concept of the barring order in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act.  This was strengthened in 1981 and we now have the Domestic Violence Act 1996 which extended protection beyond spouses to non-marital partners.  The barring order, the main remedy, provided for in the court, was changed in 2002 following a Supreme Court judgment stating that interim barring orders had to be time limited.  The difficulty had arisen owing to delays in the courts, of which the Minister of State will be well aware.  There was a problem in that interim barring orders obtained on an <i>ex parte</i> basis remained in place for months at a time.  We also have protection and safety orders.  The range of orders is extensive but we need to focus on the enforcement of the law and on the powers of the Garda.  The Garda has the power to arrest for breaches but the National Crime Council survey found a significant amount of regional variation in the rate of arrests and charges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I looked at the most recent figures.  One of the tasks and priorities of Cosc is to try to ensure some sort of national system of collation of statistics.  One of the big difficulties dealing with domestic violence has been obtaining reliable statistics.  It does not help that in 2006, the Central Statistics Office took over crime statistics collection from the Garda.  We now have a different system of collection which is a source of great difficulty when trying to compare figures.  In 2007, there was a 4% increase in the breach of domestic violence court orders.  Up to 1,229 breaches were recorded by the Garda.  Of that figure, 366 persons were convicted and 351 of those were men.  There were also 435 non-convictions, and this is where the concern arises. <Col N="908"/> Some 435 cases of breaches of domestic violence orders proceeded to court but resulted in non-convictions.  I should have declared an interest as a practising barrister who has worked on some cases.  I know from experience that there are many reasons a non-conviction might be recorded.  There is some controversy about how strenuously the Garda should prosecute in these cases and there is a divergence of opinion.  There has been some academic writing suggesting that quite often the victims or complainants may not wish a conviction to be obtained.  They may not wish the perpetrators to go to prison.  This is a difficult area and I acknowledge that it is difficult for garda&iacute; working in it.  It is important the seriousness of this sort of abuse is emphasised through co-arrest policies.  That is a policy inherent in the 1996 Act.  However, there is still this difficulty with enforcement and regional variation.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Is the law adequate as it currently stands?  I will deal first with the difficulty with statistics.  We have difficulty establishing the actual incidence of domestic violence and establishing the adequacy of the enforcement mechanisms.  There is a core problem with the use of the criminal law.  We are still grappling with how to deal with so-called domestic violence because such abuse is generally carried out as part of a pattern of behaviour.  The criminal law is designed to deal with one-off incidence of offending such as a one-off assault, a one-off rape, a one-off murder or a one-off burglary, and we see this problem also with child sexual abuse.  Where there is a relationship between the victim and offender, as in many child sexual abuse cases and domestic violence cases, one finds a pattern of behaviour where there is an ongoing abusive relationship and yet the criminal law seeks to attribute liability for isolated events in regard to particular offenders.  It is a real problem when dealing with child sexual abuse cases in that there is this somewhat mythical idea in prosecuting these cases that one prosecutes sample charges.  However, a child may have been abused from the age of seven to the age of 12, or for five years, and yet as anyone working in this area will know, one has sample charges.  There might be ten or 12 separate accounts of sexual assault or rape during that period and yet it does not really reflect the pattern and the ongoing nature of the abuse.  It is similar with so-called domestic violence.  The seriousness of it needs to be emphasised because the pattern tends to be an escalating pattern.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Women&rsquo;s Aid reminds us that since 1996, 162 women have been murdered in Ireland.  Of the resolved cases, it points out that 51% of the perpetrators were the partner or ex-partner of the women.  We can all straightaway think of very high profile cases of murder of women where there was alleged to have been a pattern of abuse leading up to the ultimate murder.</P>
        <P>There are many difficulties with our application of the criminal law to the area of domestic violence.  The existence of the civil order mechanism through the 1996 Act &mdash; it is only when these orders are breached that criminal liability attaches &mdash; recognises the specific nature of domestic violence and it offers an interim way of ensuring some protection for the abused women and their children.  There is a difficulty with criminal liability and when we seek to attach that, we attach it for specific breaches of a barring order when there may be an ongoing abusive relationship and, in many cases, ongoing breaches.</P>
        <P>I refer to the ongoing nature of the abusive relationship.  As the statistics kept by the Garda do not identify repeat call-outs, it is impossible to know how many recorded incidents of domestic violence involve the same individuals.  That is perhaps one way to try to address this problem of the pattern of abuse we see.  While the criminal law seeks to attach liability for individual breaches and individual abuses, through statistics gathering Cosc could do a great deal to help us to deal with this by ensuring statistics are more detailed, that they identify repeat call-outs and where the same individuals are involved.</P><Col N="909"/>
        <P Just="Left">The national strategy is to ensure we strengthen protection for those most at risk.  Where there is a pattern of abuse and where it is seriously escalating, we need to be confident the Garda is aware of that, that it is, therefore, upping its strategy to ensure a very strong pro-arrest policy and that people are dealt with severely in the courts where necessary to ensure this abuse does not escalate. </P>
        <P>Clearly, the law is only one aspect of the package of measures to deal with the huge problem of domestic violence.  As other speakers said, an enormous package of other measures is necessary.  I am glad the national strategy identifies such measures as the provision of sufficient places in shelters for victims and their children.  We need to provide treatment services for abusers, where appropriate, and adequate resourcing for victim support groups such as Women&rsquo;s Aid.  These are all vital measures.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to a book written by Frank Crummey who played a vital role in establishing and maintaining the women&rsquo;s refuge in Rathmines.  I think it was the first shelter to cater for women suffering domestic violence and their children.  I thought it would be nice to finish by acknowledging Mr. Crummey&rsquo;s work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy White, is very welcome.  I was delighted by her appointment and hope it will be the dawn of a new era of equality for women in Ireland.  I have found the varied and measured contributions to the debate very interesting.  I was supposed to speak at the start of the debate, but I had to attend a meeting with the Minister for Transport.  I thank Senator Corrigan for speaking in my place.  We were given some good news today for a change.  The news about the south-east rescue service is to be welcomed.  I am delighted to have heard the speeches of many Senators and apologise for missing the Minister of State&rsquo;s, although I went through her script quickly.</P>
        <P>When one considers the number of women involved in business and leadership roles, it is clear that a patriarchal system is embedded in Irish culture.  Politics is a glaring example of this.  Historically, Ireland&rsquo;s legal system has been hostile to cases of domestic violence.  We have to acknowledge that the number of convictions for domestic violence, by comparison with the number of people who come forward, is affected by a huge rate of attrition.  We have come a long way from the old repressed Ireland which had a hostile legal climate.  That the victims of sexual violence found it difficult to come forward has been clearly demonstrated in the horrific stories we have heard of late.  We should honestly admit that we have known about the victims of clerical child sexual abuse for some time.</P>
        <P>We need to examine the nature of sexual violence if we are to ascertain why women find it so difficult to come forward.  The Listowel rape case which came before the courts in December 2009 demonstrated again the difficulties encountered by female victims of sexual violence.  It is worrying that the victim in the case was clearly targeted as a villain in her community.  I am concerned about some of the statistics in this regard.  For every 100 cases of sexual violence reported in Ireland, there is a fall-off in 95 cases and just five cases result in a conviction.  That is the attrition rate we are dealing with.  We have an awful long way to go.</P>
        <P>I was very excited when the Cosc report was launched by the Minister.  However, my excitement waned when I read it because it is full of jargon.  It is okay and grand.  There is nothing wrong with it.  It sets out how we will deal with aspects of domestic violence, other than those covered by the Domestic Violence Act 1996, until 2014.  Various non-governmental organisations such as Women&rsquo;s Aid are doing tremendous and super work in this area.  Will we have to wait until after 2014 for the law in this area to be augmented or improved?  If that is the case, it is not acceptable.  We need to do better in this area.  We have been calling for a debate <Col N="910"/>on domestic violence since 2007 and it has taken three years for it to be arranged.  Progress has been slow.  I do not think anyone will jump up and down and say it is the most amazing thing ever.</P>
        <P>I wish to hone in on a couple of aspects of this issue such as the lacunae in the law.  One can seek a safety order or a barring order under the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  If one wants to obtain a safety order, one has to have been cohabiting for six of the previous 12 months.  If one leaves the house and tries to secure a conviction thereafter, one has six months in which to do so.  The timeframes and the cohabitation rules are wrong and missing the point.  We are talking about men and women who have suffered violence.  I do not want to get involved in a debate on whether more women or men are affected by domestic violence, although I accept that women are more vulnerable.  Men are involved also.  I will deal with that aspect of the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fact of the matter is that our definitions are bad.  They do not get into the nitty-gritty of what is domestic violence.  The cohabitation rule needs to be amended.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he intends to use the Civil Partnership Bill 2009 to do so.  However, that raises other issues.  Do we need a cohabitation rule at all?  Why have we put in place the provision, whereby people need to be in a committed relationship?  This provision may act as an additional barrier to women seeking safety orders or may be used by abusers to prevent them from being deemed eligible for such orders.  As a practising family law solicitor, I find it very frustrating that I cannot help people whose relationships do not fit within the requisite timeframe or the legislative definition.</P>
        <P>As someone who has dealt with the issue of domestic violence from two sides &mdash; as a politician and as a lawyer &mdash; I hear far worse stories as a politician than I do as a lawyer.  I do not believe women are coming forward to use the framework available to them under the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  They are far more likely to contact local politicians to ask what they can do.  It is devastating that those who look for safety orders and barring orders tend to be those whose cases are at the lower end of the scale.  I am sure Cosc can back this up with statistics.  I do not mean to diminish the abuse they have suffered.  As many are not seeking help, many perpetrators of violence are going free without having the rigour of the law applied to them.  When it is applied, the law applied is bad.</P>
        <P>I do not like the phrase &ldquo;domestic violence&rdquo;.  It needs to be changed because the crimes of rape and sexual abuse do not seem to be covered by it.  Members of the Garda are not trained to be in a position to deal with such violence.  Senator Norris mentioned the most telling statistic in this regard &mdash; that just one marital rape conviction has been secured in the last 20 years.  We are not getting to the real story.  Until we face up to this crime, we will never truly have equality in Ireland.  We need to state clearly that it is wrong to beat up, rape, physically abuse, mentally abuse or torture a member of one&rsquo;s family in any way.  I refer to abuse by economic means, for example.  Given that domestic violence is experienced in one in five families, what proportion of the population as a whole have to tolerate it?  If it can be said women in one in five families have suffered some form of domestic abuse, bearing in mind that they comprise 50% of the population, I suggest between 15% and 20% of the population are dealing with this problem at any given time.  People are not coming forward because they seem to think it is okay, or a part of life.  That is why I am saying we need to get into the nitty-gritty of it.</P>
        <P>I am worried that the Cosc report is not good enough.  We need to change the law immediately.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to examine the possibility of using the Civil Partnership Bill 2009 to extend eligibility for safety orders.  Given that 95% of cases of rape do not result in a conviction, we need to consider deeply the issues of justice and accountability to <Col N="911"/>ascertain where we are going wrong.  I am not sure we are doing this.  Approximately 12 years ago research in the United Kingdom found that one in three people was suffering from domestic violence.  They had statistics to prove that such violence was leading to homicide in the home and took action on foot of this.  The UK model is one we should examine.  The United Kingdom has introduced 122 specialist domestic violence courts across the country.  We would not need that many, but these courts have been phenomenally successful, with a conviction rate of 70% which compares with a rate here of 6%.  The difference is stark.  The British are going about this in a far better way.  They have the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 which deals with the problem of people being trafficked into the country and forced to marry.</P>
        <P>I spoke today to a journalist about a Filipino girl in Wexford who is going home tomorrow to the Philippines because she suffered domestic abuse.  She had no recourse under the law and could not go to the Garda.  Women who are members of the Traveller community or ethnic minorities are not as inclined to come forward under our law to seek redress.  There are also issues in the immigration Bill that need to be addressed, but I do not have the time to go into them.</P>

	<P>The Senator has one minute remaining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea of a specialist domestic abuse court is a very good one.  If a person is looking for a barring order, he or she has to enter in front of the entire District Court.  He or she can go in at the back, but everybody can still see him or her.  If there is a breach of the terms of a barring order and the matter must go before the criminal courts, the case is heard in open court.  That is why we are not securing convictions.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in made a point about family law provisions being balanced against men.  That is a valid point.  I wonder how much domestic violence there is as a result.  We need to look at family law and give men far more rights in respect of child guardianship.  I would welcome a change in the law, a matter we have neglected.</P>
        <P>There are so many laws on the Statute Book that are anti-family and anti-women.  I agree with Senator Norris.  I cannot see how any association could call itself &ldquo;pro-family&rdquo; when it propagates abuse within the home.  People from the Catholic Church have told women to stay where they are because they are married and that is where they have to be.  That is absolute nonsense.  This is a fundamental human right.  Migrant women are coming here and suffering abuse and we are not doing anything about it because we think they are operating in a different culture, that some of them are Muslims and we cannot delve into their circumstances.  Under the laws of the State everybody has to be treated equally, as that is the essence of a republic.  We cannot let any church hide behind its own laws.  If we are to learn anything about child sex abuse in cases involving the Catholic Church, we should divorce the State entirely from it and apply the law dispassionately but that is not happening.</P>
        <P>We need to have a specialised Garda unit to deal with these issues.  I am not sure if the garda&iacute; involved completely understand what they are doing.  They receive calls from women, then get to know them and promise to call out to them, but that is it.  Then tragedy strikes, as we have seen in my own county on several occasions.  We do not want to see this happen again.</P>
        <P>The report is fine, as it highlights all of the issues involved.  I especially welcome the points raised about education because we need to educate young migrant men not to hit women.  If they see it at home, it will happen.  We have to stop this in our society.  We need to change our structures and laws.  We cannot leave this to NGOs alone because the women&rsquo;s refuge in <Col N="912"/>Wexford was denied funding for three months last year by the HSE, which was absolutely outrageous.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus gabhaim comhgairdeas le&iacute; as ucht an post a fuair s&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Senator McDonald has to be commended for her passion.  I compliment her on her fine speech.</P>
        <P>I would like to begin by making reference to Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs.  If we start with primitive needs and work towards self-actualisation, we need to begin with education.  We need a proper education programme in our schools to allow young people to realise their potential.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State quoted the President and they are both correct.  Civil society has a vital role to play on the important topic of domestic and sexual violence.  We must bring about change within the community and the schools system, but it must be led by the Government and public representatives.  There is a starting point with the publication of the national strategy, but we need to bring about change to create a culture that will allow the reporting of abuse and action to be taken by the courts which have to demonstrate in sentencing that this behaviour will not be tolerated or condoned.  The Listowel case indicates there is a soft underbelly in society that must be eradicated.  We can no longer allow the victim to be seen as the villain.  We must learn that message from the Listowel case.</P>
        <P>As someone who taught religion for nearly 20 years, who spent many years in Maynooth doing pastoral work and who is very involved in his community, Article 5 of the United Declaration on Human Rights always jumps out at me.  It states no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.  In talking to women and some men in our society today that article means nothing to them because they are subject to such cruel and inhumane treatment.  Young women and men who have been the victims of abuse have come to me.  They have seen barring orders being breached and have had to put their children under the bed or up in the attic at 4 a.m. before going downstairs to meet their former partners.  I have also dealt with gay men who have been abused.  We all see physical abuse, but <Col N="913"/>we cannot understand emotional abuse or the effects on children.  I have dealt with children in school who were afraid to go home, wondered when it was going to happen again and whether they were the only children to be affected by such abuse.  I have seen shelters full of women who had no place to go to.</P>
        <P>This is not about politics.  Senator McDonald is right in saying that, if we learn nothing else from cases of abuse in the Catholic Church, it is that we must collectively transfer all of the information into the public domain.  We must wash the sins in public and no longer excuse or condone mistreatment.  There is a need for joined-up thinking between the law, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the local authorities and the Government.  All the t&rsquo;s must be crossed to ensure action will be taken.  If we start from the premise that this is about protection, provision and prevention, we will have a good launching pad.  Senator Bacik referred to the number of men and women involved.  In Cork some 20% of those attending the sexual violence centre are men.  However, we will never know the true figures because many women and men are afraid to admit what has occurred to them and will not seek help.  As a result, they suffer in silence, which is not good enough.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to Mary Crilly in Cork who has been a campaigner and women&rsquo;s rights advocate for many years.  She acts in an admirable and provocative way, while also being humane, caring and concerned.  In addition to healing with words, we must implement strategies to allow victims of domestic violence to be heard in a multiplicity of ways.</P>
        <P>I welcome publication of the national strategy on domestic violence.  I hope it is not just aspirational but will result in action.  I do not believe many garda&iacute; and teachers have been trained to deal with the results of domestic violence.  In addition, the resources provided are insufficient.  If we are serious about tackling this matter, we must put in place structures and mechanisms to stop the knock-on effects of domestic violence, as well as providing safe havens for the victims involved.  The education system should imbue children from a young age with respect for human values.  We must also tackle problems such as intimidation, physical violence and sexual abuse, making it clear that they have no place in society.  The national strategy must have a firm foundation in our schools, be it in religious education or SPHE classes.</P>
        <P>Women are physically abused every day, while trapped in their own homes.  It is telling that this is occurring in their own homes.  The ethos of having respect for and valuing each other must be enshrined in law.  The courts have a major role to play because they have abdicated their responsibility in this regard.  I might not be very popular for saying this, but I think that is what they have done.  Senator McDonald is right in referring to the family law court and the way in which women are not allowed privacy in making their case.  I have accompanied women to the door of the court, yet they are afraid to go any further.  They are afraid of being seen by the perpetrator or his family.  There is intimidation by the family of the perpetrator who say, &ldquo;He did not mean it,&rdquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the drink,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the drugs.&rdquo;  That is no longer acceptable.</P>
        <P>It comes back to the issue of resources, financing and prioritisation.  Many agencies in Cork, including women refuges, do not have enough beds and, therefore, cannot cope.  While I will not name the areas involved, I know that some such organisations have insufficient places for victims of domestic violence because the beds available are full or the women involved are separated from their children.  It is unacceptable in the 21st century to separate a woman from her children.</P>
        <P>Where the terms of barring orders are breached, there should be no second chance.  It may not be the legally correct thing to say but, to my mind, one cannot keep giving people chances when they breach the terms of a barring order.  Such orders are granted for a specific reason. <Col N="914"/> If we amend the Domestic Violence Act, we will have done a great service for women, in particular, but also for male victims.  I hope we will see reform of the criminal justice system in this regard because it is long overdue.</P>
        <P>Mn&aacute; Feasa is an organisation in Cork which provides a support system for women.  Its slogan is, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a bruise to be abused&rdquo;.  Women should not have to suffer in silence.  They deserve not just respect, but also the protection of the courts and implementation of the law.  It is time we stopped merely debating such matters but acted on them.  I appeal to the Judiciary to implement the law and hand down sentences which will send a message that we will no longer allow this situation to continue.  Women deserve no less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the Minister of State.  Like most other speakers, I have faith in her and welcome her appointment.  She has raised our expectations but I have no doubt that she will fulfil them.  I hope she will enjoy the next two years and look forward to the legacy she will leave after that period.  Her track record shows that she is a woman who wants to achieve things in the areas about which she is concerned.  The equality agenda is safe in her hands.  I welcome her appointment in that regard. </P>
        <P>I also pay tribute to Senator McDonald who through her persistence finally succeeded in having this matter raised on the floor of the House.  Her contribution showed why she has been agitating to have it debated.  Senator Bacik is also dealing with the legal position and knows what is happening daily in the lives of those suffering as a result of legal shortcomings.  Their contributions were particularly valuable.  They have provided a great understanding of the small measures by which improvements can be made.  Senator Corrigan has asked what we can achieve.  We are all united in seeking to ensure something positive will happen as a result of this debate.</P>
        <P>President McAleese has invited groups tackling domestic violence to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, which indicates her strong commitment in this regard.  It is an issue about which she cares and which will no longer be swept under the carpet.  Those who have to suffer domestic violence must be encouraged to speak up and let their voices be heard.  As everybody has said, we have no real idea of the level or extent of the violence.  I refer to violence in the traditional manner, that is, in terms of physical abuse, but there is also emotional violence, which is just as damaging, especially for children who grow up in a violent atmosphere.  This is shocking to think about.  One&rsquo;s home is a refuge, a place to return to after a hard day or even a holiday, a place to be settled and be one&rsquo;s self.  In circumstances in which there is domestic violence, that home is ravaged by abuse &mdash; whoever it is perpetrated by and whoever is the victim &mdash; and the resulting loss of a sense of safety shatters the core of one&rsquo;s person.  That is why people are reluctant to speak out about domestic abuse.</P>
        <P>Senator McDonald alluded to traditional values, while Senator Corrigan spoke about the need for the community to take ownership of this issue.  Traditionally, what happened inside a house stayed inside a house; those outside ignored it.  It is one of the great privileges of being a public representative that when one canvasses one sees what goes on behind people&rsquo;s doors.  It is extraordinary to see this and to appreciate the way in which people open up to one about what goes on in their houses.  It can be the beginning of a cry for help.  If the word has gone out and people have heard this is an issue we take seriously and that it is vital for people to speak openly about it, they may feel they can speak, as a first step, to a public representative, who will then encourage them to contact someone for help and not to put up with abuse.  That is why the President, in particular, has done society a tremendous service by highlighting this issue.  This is something we should try to keep on the agenda in the Seanad.  We need to give <Col N="915"/>as much encouragement as possible to people who are suffering from abuse to take these first steps.</P>
        <P>I noted in the Women&rsquo;s Aid report the mention of the fact that many people who call the organisation hang up immediately when the call is answered.  The person answering the call knows this is somebody trying to reach out.  He or she has taken the first step but still cannot articulate his or her anger.  It is difficult to be intimately involved with someone who abuses one.  How can one reach out to try to solve the problem?  One wants it to stop, but may not want the consequences, which can include the break-up of a family.  The issue needs to be discussed more openly in order that people will feel they have the courage to take these first steps and obtain advice.  Particularly for the perpetrator of the violence, it is important to discuss what is causing it.  A dialogue about trying to change behaviour can be entered into in order that the abuse can, I hope, cease.</P>
        <P>There is a very good advertisement about domestic abuse on television, although I do not know whether it is being broadcast on Irish television or some other channel.  It is particularly good because it portrays two young people dealing with the eruption of violence.  The fellow wants to have intimacy with the girl but she is not having it, and he completely turns on her.  It is extraordinary how quickly it happens.  The advertisement is effective because one could imagine it representing a teenager anywhere who wants to belong and does not want to be tagged with some kind of phrase because she refused to allow a boy to have his way with her.</P>
        <P>In the advertisement, the young girl refuses to put up with this treatment.  It is a particularly strong advertisement; I do not know whether Senators have seen it.  It is really powerful in teaching young people they do not have to put up with violence.  That is where we must start.  If we teach children in school that they do not ever have to put up with abuse or violence from anybody and give them a sense of dignity and self-respect, we will change behaviour.  That is why I found the advertisement to be such a strong message, and its propagation through the broadcast media is terribly effective.  For youngsters, it does not portray domestic violence as something that happens to people of their parents&rsquo; age but possibly to themselves.  It is a very good message.</P>
        <P>Senator McDonald also mentioned the shortcomings in the law, which we really need to think about, and the question of cohabitation as dealt with in the Civil Partnership Bill.  Why must a person be cohabiting with somebody for domestic abuse to occur?  One need only be in an intimate relationship.  The rights of the victim should not be subjugated just because both people do not live behind the same door.  There is greater freedom if one lives independently, but we know what often happens in circumstances of domestic violence.  Even when partnerships break up, one party can be subjected to terrible cruelty and violence.  I agree that we are complicating things by introducing the issue of cohabitation rules.</P>
        <P>As Senator McDonald said, the conviction rates speak for themselves.  Our legal framework is not functioning properly and is not delivering what we need it to deliver, namely, security, refuge and a sense of justice.  We need to consider this.  The issue of the cohabitation rule indicates a simple way in which we can streamline the legal process.  In so many cases of domestic violence, as Senator Bacik mentioned, people do not want the perpetrators to go to prison but they do want the violence to stop.  We must recognise their need to be safe from their abusers, and deliver this.  Convictions are one thing &mdash; in any case, prosecutions take a long time to go through the courts system and can be terribly costly &mdash; but we need to provide solace and comfort to victims of violence.</P><Col N="916"/>
        <P>Senator Bacik raised an interesting point about patterns of behaviour, and there is no better woman to think of a way for us to overcome this challenge.  I have always thought that sexual violence is different from regular crimes because it is an utter and total violation of one&rsquo;s person.  A person who has been raped does not want to go through a moment by moment re-enactment of what happened in court.  We need to recognise this.  The burden of proof should not be quite so high in cases of sexual violence.  In cases of rape or similar, it is almost the case that the burden of proof rests with the victims &mdash; they must prove they were raped.  That is a terrible thing to do to somebody who has been subjected to such violence.  I am not sure how we can deal with this.  As Senator Bacik said, our legal system does not allow the admission of patterns of behaviour; it must consider cases on an individual basis.  That is not very satisfying in terms of elucidating the type of person involved.</P>
        <P>The Council of Europe has stated that domestic violence is the major cause of death and disability for women aged between 16 and 44 in Europe, which exceeds the corresponding statistics for traffic accidents or cancer.  This is shocking, especially as these women are quite young.  Domestic violence has a highly detrimental effect on our society and we must tackle it properly.  I welcome the appointment of the Minister of State, with her obvious interest in this area.  Amendments will be necessary to some Acts.  Like many others, I hope we can organise streamlined legislation that will facilitate and achieve greater levels of conviction of perpetrators of sexual and domestic violence in order that victims will see the point of bringing forward a case.</P>

It has been wonderful for me to have the first debate in my new portfolio in this House on an issue that is so significant for all of us and one on which I have been working for years.  I thank Senator McDonald for her persistence in getting this debate here.  Let us hope we have many more debates of this quality, whether on women in politics, violence against women or other issues of equality on which I would be very happy to engage.  This is an issue we must highlight and about which we must do something.  We should not leave these reports sitting on shelves, but implement them.  If we need to change the legislation to achieve that, we must consider doing so.  Before I address some of the Senators&rsquo; remarks, I would like to make some comments on matters I did not address earlier.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government takes domestic violence very seriously.  It is a heinous crime with serious consequences for victims.  I take the opportunity to say something about aspects of domestic violence I did not deal with in any great detail in my earlier statement.  Some Senators addressed the issue of the prevalence of domestic violence in Ireland.  It is not easy to obtain good data on this.  This is often owing to the hidden nature of the crime and the reluctance of victims to report it.  We have, however, empirical data on the prevalence of the problem in the national study of domestic abuse published by the National Crime Council in 2005.  According to the study, some 15% of women and 6% of men have experienced severely abusive behaviour from their partners at some stage or on some occasion over the course of their lifetimes.  The percentage is much higher if minor incidents are taken into account.  The study found that where severe abuse and minor incidents are combined, 29% of women and 26% of men suffer domestic abuse at some stage in their lifetimes.  In other words, almost a third of all women and a quarter of all men experience some form of domestic violence at some stage.  This underlines the seriousness of the problem and the magnitude of the task faced in tackling the problem.</P><Col N="917"/>
        <P>Increasing knowledge about the problem is the key to making progress on dealing with it.  In 2008, Cosc carried out a survey of attitudes of the Irish public to domestic abuse that came up with some interesting findings.  One of the main findings was that a majority of the population exhibits a high level of awareness of the problem of domestic abuse.  People perceive domestic abuse to be a common and increasing problem.  They have a broad understanding of what constitutes domestic abuse and regard it as unacceptable.  These are broadly positive findings.  In terms of responding to domestic abuse, the study showed that people feel responsible and are willing to intervene if they witness it.  However, if the victim is somebody outside the family circle, such as a neighbour whom they do not know well, people are reluctant to become involved.  An understandable concern or fear of making things even worse is the main reason given for not becoming involved.</P>
        <P>The survey provides a baseline for understanding public attitudes to domestic abuse in Ireland.  Cosc is using the survey to inform work being undertaken to improve the system of prevention and responses to domestic violence.  This includes the development of accessible information for the public to assist them to understand and be prepared to take appropriate action to counter these crimes.  A practical example of such information is, as I mentioned in my earlier statement, the details of local and national support services on Cosc&rsquo;s website at <i>www.cosc.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Once the problem has been identified, it should be reported and dealt with through the provision of direct services to victims.  One of the areas being examined to improve service provision to victims is the one-stop-shop facility.  I touched on this idea in my opening statement.  The primary purpose of such a facility would be to reduce the number of locations and organisations that victims of domestic violence must visit to receive basic support services.  The main partners in such a resource may be from very different backgrounds.  They may be from the justice sector, housing services and community-based support services.  There is potential for a one-stop-shop facility to provide great benefit to victims of domestic violence and to benefit the support services contributing to the project.  In a one-stop shop, each organisation is clearly committed to focusing on the victim.  This should facilitate joint working to deliver effective support services to the victim to overcome the negative consequences of domestic violence.  Where the model has already been used elsewhere, there have, by and large, been positive outcomes in terms of reduced rates of repeat victimisation and increased rates of reporting.  Moreover, the model may well be able to improve co-ordination and co-operation between various service providers.</P>
        <P>As well as victims in domestic violence cases, there are also perpetrators.  It is important to work with perpetrators to help create genuine changes in their behaviour to prevent further victimisation.  Domestic violence perpetrator programmes in Ireland are delivered through a combination of non-governmental organisations and the probation and welfare service.  In the past 15 years or so, a network of perpetrator programmes has developed throughout the country.  The nature of the programmes delivered differ in most cases.  The national strategy includes an action to strengthen measures to deal with domestic violence perpetrators.  A particular focus will be on devising means of ensuring greater effectiveness of the programmes.  Through the establishment of a domestic violence perpetrator programme committee, Cosc will, in consultation with programme managers, develop and implement a plan to strengthen perpetrator programmes.  There is a specific action in the national strategy to update the law on domestic violence to give further protection to victims.</P>
        <P>The most widely availed of remedy in Ireland in cases of domestic violence has been the civil law remedies under the Domestic Violence Acts of 1996 and 2002.  Applications under the <Col N="918"/>Acts are family law cases and are heard in private.  The Acts provide for the protection of a spouse and any children or other dependent persons, and of persons in other domestic relationships whose safety or welfare requires it because of the conduct of another person in the domestic relationship concerned.  Contravention of any order under the Acts is a criminal offence and therefore subject to sanctions under the criminal law.  The Acts provide for the issue, variation or renewal by a court of the following orders: a safety order, which prohibits the abuser from further violence or threats of violence and can last up to five years; and a barring order, which requires that the violent person leave the family home.</P>
        <P>When an application for either of the above orders has been accepted by the court, the applicant is given a date for a court hearing.  The waiting time varies in different parts of the country.  There are two ways the court can protect the applicant awaiting the hearing for one of the above orders.  The first is by way of a protection order.  This is granted if the court thinks there are reasonable grounds to believe the safety and welfare of the applicant is at risk.  The second order which can be made pending a hearing is an interim barring order.  If the court is of the view that a protection order would not be sufficient to protect the applicant awaiting a court date, then an interim barring order is granted.  The domestic violence legislation aims to address the accountability of offenders and strengthen the protection of victims through review and any necessary improvement of domestic violence legislation.</P>
        <P>I would like to address one or two of the issues raised during the debate.  With regard to suggested shortcomings in domestic violence legislation, the national strategy specifically provides for addressing these.  One of the strategy&rsquo;s actions provides for the updating of domestic violence legislation to give further protection to victims.  The views of Senators will inform further work in this area and we will keep this in mind.  I am glad Senator Healy Eames is present as she raised the issue of the importance of disclosure of domestic violence in accident and emergency departments and general practitioner surgeries.  It is known that, in general, reporting of domestic violence through professionals is still strikingly low.  The national strategy includes a specific action to ensure a reasonable opportunity is provided to the victim for disclosure of domestic violence.</P>
        <P>Many other issues were raised during the course of the debate but I cannot possibly deal with all of them.  I assure Senators I have listened intently to their views.  As a new Minister of State, I am in listening mode and will take on board what I have heard and it will inform consideration of actions to address the domestic violence issue.  The Government is committed to tackling the problem of domestic violence.  That commitment was reflected in the priority given to the preparation of the national strategy and is reflected in its implementation.  It is expected the strategy will drive greater progress in dealing with the domestic violence problem and, ultimately, deliver greater safety for victims and potential victims.</P>

    <Title>Sports Capital Programme.</Title>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This Adjournment Matter relates to the important area of sport and, in particular, the need to reopen the sports capital programme.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last weekend Alan Ruddock stated|: &ldquo;Whatever the demands in tourism and culture, sport is crying out for direction and policy.&rdquo;  The lack of a sports capital programme in 2009 and to date in 2010 has affected many sports and local community groups and organisations.  I am heavily involved with my local club &mdash; Bishopstown GAA Club &mdash; and other community organisations.  I understand, therefore, the importance of sport and community groups to the development of sustainable communities.  In that context, the lack of funding and the abolition or suspension of the sports capital programme is having a profound impact.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the work done in rural and urban areas, particularly the constituency of Cork South Central in which I live and work, as a result of funding provided under the sports capital programme which makes a difference to clubs and communities across the country.  As a result of the RAPID programme, the public realm has been enhanced and the facilities of sports organisations have been improved, which is of benefit to communities.  The activities that occur in community halls have been developed and enhanced as a result of improvements made to such halls.</P>
        <P>Everyone welcomed the creation of the national lottery in 1986.  Everyone also welcomed the establishment of the sports capital programme by Donal Creed who served as Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science in one of the Governments headed by Dr. Garrett FitzGerald.  The programme which has proved extremely beneficial was never meant to cease operating.  However, it has been discontinued by the Government, of which the Minister of State&rsquo;s party is part.  As a result, the development of sports grounds and community facilities has ceased or been suspended.  To put it bluntly, the Government which comprises Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party is penalising voluntary sports and community groups which rely on the funding provided under the sports capital programme.</P>
        <P>If the new Minister, Deputy Hanafin, and the Government are to be taken seriously, they must place sport and the provision of sports facilities at the top of the political agenda.  Will the Minister of State outline what happens to the money people spend on tickets for the national lottery draws held on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays?  Will she also indicate to where the money spent on national lottery scratch cards goes?  Will she further state where the money allocated to the sports capital programme has gone?  This matter has never been addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2006 the Irish Sports Council published a report entitled, Ballpark Figures, which states: &ldquo;At present, sport punches below its weight as a policy issue&rdquo;.  In conjunction with several <Col N="920"/>colleagues, I took part in the television programme &ldquo;Operation Transformation&rdquo; in an attempt to raise awareness of issues such as obesity and well-being and show that a small change in lifestyle could make a major difference.  Such changes in lifestyle can be achieved by everyone.  A change in eating habits is only one part of the programme espoused on &ldquo;Operation Transformation&rdquo;.  Taking part in sports and engaging in physical activity are also paramount, particularly as they create a new awareness of the benefits of participation.</P>
        <P>The provision of funding for sports clubs could help to move Ireland forward in alleviating problems relating to obesity and social disadvantage.  It could also be of assistance in creating sustainable communities.  Sport is an integral part of such communities.  If young people are encouraged to become involved in sport from an early age, it improves their health and welfare and has other knock-on effects.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The decision to eliminate, freeze or suspend the sports capital programme is wrong.  The money allocated could act as a stimulus for the construction industry and assist in building communities and providing employment opportunities.  In the reply to a parliamentary question he tabled on 23 March Deputy Creed was informed that no decision had been made on the programme for this year and that &euro;48 million had been provided in the Department&rsquo;s Vote in the 2010 Estimates to cover payments previously awarded to be made from the C1 subhead, out of which grants were paid for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.  Therefore, funding is available.  In such circumstances, I ask the new Minister to reopen the programme and allow sports clubs and community groups to get back to providing services.  Yesterday I attended a meeting at Ballyphehane GAA Club in Cork, at which the RAPID programme co-ordinator stated money had not been allocated.  In such circumstances, I must ask whether we really are serious about encouraging participation in sport and tackling social disadvantage.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I hope sports organisations and community groups will not be punished further by the Government.  This Administration has already assisted in eroding rural communities and placed sport on the back burner.  The former Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Mr. Martin Cullen, indicated with much fanfare &mdash; the Minister of State will be aware of this because she was present at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport and Tourism at which it was said &mdash; that the programme was under review.  On how many more occasions are Ministers going to state matters are under review?  The Government is great at carrying out reviews and issuing reports.  However, it does not take action.</P>
        <P>The national lottery was created to assist in the provision of funding for sport and other activities.  To where does the money collected by the national lottery go?  What happens to the money people spend each week on lottery tickets and scratch cards?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Either we are serious about sport or we are not.  Either we are serious about the creation and development of sustainable communities and the participation of people therein or we are not.  Why is it not possible to allocate the surplus funding provided for the Exchequer by the national lottery in 2009 to the sports capital programme?  There are sports clubs which are actively involved in fund-raising and bringing forward development plans.  Bishopstown GAA Club held an extraordinary general meeting at which we were forced to try to rezone land in order that we might, in the absence of the sports capital programme, obtain funding.  The Government stating it will collect money but not then disburse it is the wrong message to give to young people and sports clubs.  However, today in the other House <Col N="921"/>the Minister for Finance announced the provision of billions for a flawed Anglo Irish Bank.  Friends of Fianna F&aacute;il are bailed out while ordinary men and women in sports clubs and community groups cannot get a few bob from the Government.  It is extraordinary and ironic that the friends of the Government can get billions, while sports clubs receive nothing.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Hanafin, and I thank Senator Buttimer for raising this important issue.  Given the benefits associated with sporting activities, the Government regards expenditure on sport as important for the social and economic development of the country.  These benefits arise in a wide range of areas including health and well-being, social and cultural development, education, personal development, tourism and the economy.  It can play a valuable role in tackling social exclusion and this is particularly true for young people.</P>
        <P>It is heartening to see today&rsquo;s media coverage of a special Eurobarometer survey indicating that Irish people now rank among the EU&rsquo;s keenest participants in sport.  We are also among the most dedicated to volunteering to support sporting activities.  The sports capital programme, which is part funded from the proceeds of the national lottery, is the primary means of granting Government support for the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.</P>
        <P>Under the sports capital programme, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism provides funding to voluntary, sporting and community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.  More than 7,400 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to more than &euro;730 million.  The programme has, in the past ten years, transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The facilities funded range from the smallest clubs to national centres of sporting excellence.</P>
        <P>The aims and objectives of the programme are to foster an integrated and planned approach to the development of sports and physical recreation facilities throughout the country; to assist voluntary and community organisations to develop high quality, safe, well-designed, accessible and sustainable facilities in appropriate locations to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities; and to encourage the multi-purpose use of local, regional and national sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and national sporting governing bodies.</P>
        <P>The programme has supported the provision or improvement of landmark national and regional stadia such as Thomond Park, home to twice European rugby champions, Munster, and Semple Stadium, the home of hurling for many.  Such facilities provide a platform for our most talented athletes to perform, which in turn inspires new generations of young people to aspire to match the sporting prowess of their heroes.  They are also an important support to our tourism industry as they draw visitors from Britain, Europe and further afield, who come to Ireland to follow their teams in action.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators will be aware of the many benefits that derive from the programme in their localities.  They have no doubt witnessed the value of the programme in assisting local clubs in meeting the sporting needs of their areas.  In recent years, the programme has targeted clubs in areas of social disadvantage.  By doing this, the Government is supporting the provision of facilities where there may be little prospect of such facilities being provided by the communities acting alone.  These facilities provide an opportunity for participation in sport which leads to <Col N="922"/>healthier lifestyles and a reduced likelihood of younger people drifting into anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a common misconception that the programme has been discontinued.  While a new round of awards has not been approved this year, due to financial constraints, none the less the programme is in fact very active with more than 1,550 payments made last year with a total value of more than &euro;58.7 million.  This year it is again business as usual for clubs and sports bodies allocated grants in previous rounds of the programme with &euro;48 million provided in the Estimates to cover the payment of previously allocated grants.  No decision has yet been made about the timing of further rounds of the programme, which would be dependent in any event on the availability of resources.</P>
        <P>Senators will also be aware that an audit of existing sports facilities is under way.  The results of this audit will also inform our future decisions on sports capital grants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I hate to take issue with the Minister of State in her first full week in the post, and I appreciate the matter is not the responsibility of her Department, but her final two paragraphs are completely contradictory and at variance with one another.  It is not business as usual and there is no sports capital programme for 2009 or 2010.  The Minister of State stated that new rounds have not been approved but that it is business as usual.  The money announced today was allocated prior to 2009.  My question was, and still is, when the money will be sanctioned in the sports capital programme.  When will we have a review of the audit that is being conducted in perpetuity?  Where has the money from the national lottery gone?  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Like others, I wish the Minister of State well in her new position.  She has been tasked with high responsibility.  Many people are depending on the decisions made by her and the Government.</P>
        <P>The Government made a decision on the European globalisation funds.  I understand that three applications have been made to the fund, which is run by the European Union and which makes available &euro;500 million per annum for member states for assistance in retraining and upskilling redundant workers.  The three applications made by Ireland are for SR Technics, Dell and Waterford Crystal.  I am interested in Waterford Crystal and other Waterford companies.  Last week, I and my colleague, Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP for the South constituency, met more than 100 former Waterford Crystal workers.  We invited officials from the European globalisation section of the European Union Commission and we were happy that they attended in Waterford to hear first-hand the concerns of the workers.  It was very clear from the meeting that there is much confusion about the Waterford Crystal application; the entire European globalisation fund application process; and how the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Government have handled it.</P>
        <P>It has come to our attention that the redundant workers involved have not been consulted by the agency or the Department and that the agencies responsible for implementing the funds when they arrive, namely, the VECs, the county and city enterprise boards and Waterford Institute of Technology have not yet been consulted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on how it is proposed to assist the redundant workers.  It is expected the funds will arrive for the Waterford Crystal application in the coming months.  The European Union officials who attended were shocked to hear this because the clock is ticking for this application and they felt much preparatory work should already be in place and consultation and communication should have happened.</P>
        <P>I understand the main co-ordinator of the fund will be F&Aacute;S.  F&Aacute;S was invited to the same meeting and it did not even give us the courtesy of an apology for not attending.  I wonder why it did not attend.  Is there a hidden agenda?  Perhaps not, but it did not reflect well on it or on<?oasys _jy ?>the <?oasys _dc18- ?>Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that F&Aacute;S did not attend the important meeting.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P><Col N="924"/>
        <P>Several questions and concerns have been raised and I will refer to a simple example.  While a website has been set up already for the Dell application in the Limerick region on which much information and co-ordination is available, no equivalent website exists for the Waterford workers.  It appears as though little preparatory work has been done for the Waterford workers.  It also has been brought to my attention that many workers who have been made redundant have not been included in the application made by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the State on behalf of the Waterford Crystal workers.  Moreover, it was made clear by Commission officials that those who were made redundant from ancillary services that serviced Waterford Crystal would qualify for such assistance.  However, I have been informed that many such ancillary services were not included in the application.  It also has been brought to my attention that the Waterford application has not been published and is not yet in the public domain and the Minister of State should state the reason this is the case.</P>
        <P>Another matter of concern is that the application was submitted to the European Union on the last day permissible.  Normally, ten weeks are allowed after the main redundancies have been announced and the Waterford application appears to have been a rushed job which was submitted at the very last minute.  It appears to have been incomplete in many ways and was amended subsequently.  Consequently, many concerns exist regarding the management of the application, which is the responsibility of the State and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>I refer to the many other companies which have experienced large-scale redundancies that do not reach the required threshold of 500 under the EGF fund.  European Union officials have made clear that such companies can combine with similar companies in their respective sectors anywhere in Ireland to submit a combined application.  I will name four such companies, namely, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Waterford, which shortly will have more than 315 redundancies, ABB, Waterford, with more than 178 redundancies, Honeywell with 130 redundancies and Bausch &amp; Lomb with 195 redundancies.  There is nothing to prevent the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment combining these companies with others in their respective sectors to make an application to the EGF on their behalf.  That has not been done and no message has come from the Government or the Department to say it will be done.  In essence, the Government and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are failing these redundant workers.</P>
        <P>Moreover, there are hundreds of thousands in the construction sector who also could seek assistance under this fund.  They need to know what is happening.  The Government must communicate how it can assist such people and must communicate through the agencies who have heard nothing thus far.  While the Minister of State will have to hand a prepared response, I appeal to her to take this up with the Cabinet because it is not good enough that although funds are available to the Irish people, because of inaction or whatever reason, the EGF is not being fully capitalised on by the State.</P>

	<P>The Senator will be delighted to know that I have to hand a most detailed answer to his Adjournment matter.  I hope I will have time to read through it for him.  I wish to take this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has to date submitted three applications for co-financing assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGF, in 2009 towards the cost of guidance, training, entrepreneurship and education programmes for redundant workers at the Dell computer manufacturing plant in Raheen, County Limerick, the Waterford Crystal plant in Kilbarry, <Col N="925"/>County Waterford, and the SR Technics aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul facility at Dublin Airport.  While there have been significant numbers of redundancies nationally since the commencement of the global economic and financial crisis, strict eligibility criteria apply for a member state to submit an application for EGF assistance with a legitimate expectation of success.</P>
        <P>EGF support is only considered in the following scenarios.  The first is where major structural changes in world trade patterns have led to a serious economic disruption, such as a substantial increase in imports into the EU for a given sector, a rapid decline of EU market share in a given sector and delocalisation to third, that is, non-EU, countries.  The second scenario is where redundancies can be directly attributed to the current global economic and financial crisis period.  This provision only applies to the period up to the end of 2011.  Generally there must have been at least 500 redundancies over a period of four months in the case of a single enterprise and its suppliers or downstream producers or at least 500 redundancies, particularly in small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, over a period of nine months in the case of a NACE 2 economic sector.  The EU member state then has ten weeks within which to establish whether the threshold has been reached, collate the data required and submit a comprehensive application, including a rationale for EGF support.  Robust data demonstrating contractual links between main enterprise and supplier and evidence of redundancy notifications of all workers concerned must be provided by any member state applying for EGF funds.  It has been the experience of member states, including Ireland, that this is quite an onerous task that has considerable human resource and logistical implications.</P>
        <P>In this context, on 19 June 2009 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment submitted an application for co-funded assistance from the EGF towards the costs of a personalised package of occupational guidance, training, employment, entrepreneurship and educational measures for workers made redundant at the Dell plant in Raheen, County Limerick, and at ancillary enterprises.  The application encompasses almost 3,000 persons.  The application regarding the Dell redundancies was approved late last year by the EU budgetary authorities and a funds transfer of &euro;14.8 million was received earlier this month, almost nine months since the submission of the original application.  The Government is providing a matching element of &euro;8 million in funding in respect of this application.  The top quality and efficient delivery of services is of paramount importance.  It is imperative that the various measures being provided are co-ordinated in the most effective and efficient manner to meet the needs of the affected workers in Limerick and the mid-west.  To that end, F&Aacute;S has established a dedicated EGF co-ordination unit in Limerick to ensure all relevant supports across all service providers, namely, F&Aacute;S, Enterprise Ireland, county enterprise boards, vocational education committees, and third level and other institutions and colleges, are co-ordinated locally in a timely, effective and efficient manner.  The EGF co-ordination unit acts as the primary co-ordination agency for the Department in the implementation of the EGF programme for Dell worker related supports.  All other intermediate bodies and public beneficiaries liaise and report on measures to the F&Aacute;S EGF co-ordination unit as required.</P>
        <P>Details of guidance, training, educational and entrepreneurial measures available with the assistance of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for those workers made redundant at the Dell plant in County Limerick and at ancillary enterprises since January 2009 were provided at the public information event hosted at the South Court Hotel, Limerick, on 11 and 12 February 2010 by the F&Aacute;S EGF co-ordination unit.  F&Aacute;S alone received almost 600 expressions of interest in its training courses with 250 expressions in VEC-run courses.  To date, F&Aacute;S has provided guidance to approximately 1,900 former Dell workers.  The State training <Col N="926"/>agency has provided approximately 300 training courses, with double that number to be provided in 2010.  F&Aacute;S also is expanding its grant aid stream to ensure the provision of courses in private colleges where appropriate.  Work also is progressing on the development of community employment and job internship schemes which will cater for several hundred people.  The city and county enterprise boards are processing more than 200 applications for assistance to start one&rsquo;s own business in the mid-west with the support of the EGF.  In addition, hundreds of people are expected to take up tailored and accelerated further and third level education courses in the region, including at appropriately accredited private colleges.</P>
        <P>A steering committee has been established, including representatives of the former workforce, to ensure the most effective and efficient services are provided under the EGF.  This committee is to meet in Limerick in early April and will provide a useful forum for the exchange of information and ideas on the roll-out of appropriate EGF-funded measures.  As the timeframe for implementing all measures being co-financed by the EGF is 24 months from the date of submission of the EGF application, it is important to maximise the support potential within this relatively short timeframe.  In this context, the effectiveness of all EGF-funded supports will be reviewed by the Department in June 2010.  All EGF related expenditure must be strictly monitored to ensure it can traced back to an eligible occupational guidance, training, employment, entrepreneurship or educational measure, that there is a clear audit trail linking the expenditure to a single identifiable eligible beneficiary, and that all relevant EU and national accounting and auditing procedures are met by the intermediate bodies and public beneficiaries.</P>
        <P>As for the Waterford Crystal application, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment submitted a second EGF application to the European Commission on 7 August 2009 in respect of approximately 653 workers at Waterford Crystal and ancillary companies for a total amount of just under &euro;4 million.  The Waterford Crystal application is at the interservice consultation stage within the European Commission and will, upon approval, be considered by the College of Commissioners, the European Council and the European Parliament.  To date, F&Aacute;S has provided for one to one career guidance interviews with almost 500 of the workers and delivered in excess of 430 training places.  Educational measures such as a joint F&Aacute;S-Waterford Institute of Technology certificate in study skills and an RPL initiative are well under way.</P>
        <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment submitted an EGF application to the European Commission on 9 October 2009 in respect of 1,135 workers at the SR Technics plant at Dublin Airport for a total of just over &euro;13.5 million.  A request for further information was received from the Commission in mid-January owing to unforeseen circumstances arising after the submission of the application.  This request is being addressed and officials are engaged with their Brussels counterparts to ensure outstanding issues are resolved.  In the interim, the delivery of services has continued.  To date, F&Aacute;S has delivered training courses to more than 660 workers and 58 full-time third level education places have been taken up by former SR Technics workers at IT Blanchardstown and Tallaght.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have questions for the Minister of State.  It was made clear to us that the EGF money was to be additional to existing funds.  I hope it will not be used by the Government as a slush fund to prop up a discredited agency, namely, F&Aacute;S.  That is my fear and that of many workers.  Thousands of redundant workers could qualify under the fund, but no application has been made on their behalf by the Department.  Had the Minister and the Department even bothered to make an effort to put the applications together, many would have been successful.  According to the Minister of State, preparing an application is an onerous task.  Whoop de doo, if it is onerous.  Many redundant workers would love to have difficult work to do.  It is not fair to tell the House that the applications should not be made just because doing so would be difficult.  I ask the Government to apply on behalf of the many thousands of workers who have been made redundant by the companies to which I referred, including Teva, ABB, Honeywell, Bausch and Lomb, but no effort is being made to do so.  The Department and the Government seem to have adopted a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to the EGF.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State address this matter if she has genuine concerns?  I am sure her constituency contains people who have been affected.  For example, Braun is in the Carlow area; therefore, her constituency contains redundant workers who would qualify under the fund were the Department bothered to do the difficult work it has been so willing to explain in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure what the Senator&rsquo;s question is, as opposed to expressing his concern about the overall procedures used.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Government not making applications to the EGF on behalf of the thousands of workers who have been made redundant at the many companies besides the three referred to by the Minister of State?  She claimed that making an application was an onerous task, but I am not interested in that aspect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have addressed the Senator&rsquo;s point.  As I stated in my reply and as he well knows, the process is slow.  The reason for the slowness with the Waterford Crystal application could be rolled on to the other applications.  The EGF application process is complicated and encompasses three arms of the budgetary authorities, namely, the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  The successful Dell application took six months to complete from submission to final decision and it took almost nine months before there was an actual funds transfer.  Regarding the application in respect of Waterford Crystal, I am informed by the Commission that it is due in part to the change of Commissioner, of which the Senator is well aware, and a change in procedure.  Henceforth, its assessment of all EGF applications and a proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF in support of applications will form part of the same legislative procedure.  To date, there have been two distinct procedures used.  This change of approach within the Commission has taken some time to work through.  There is no suggestion of a difficulty with the Waterford Crystal application.  I hope that answers the Senator&rsquo;s question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>With due respect, redundant workers are not interested in the bureaucratic difficulties experienced by the State or the European Commission.  It is the job of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to overcome the difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>It should give the workers made redundant at other companies the same assistance it has given to workers made redundant at Dell, Waterford Crystal and SR Technics.

    <Title>Registration of Deaths.</Title>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to handle this motion, but the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is doing so instead.  He might explain why, as this has to do with amending the Civil Registration Act 2004.  However, I am delighted that he is present and I expect a positive response to this sensitive request born from the most tragic circumstances.</P>
        <P>Will the Government amend the Civil Registration Act to facilitate the registration of deaths in Ireland of Irish citizens who have died abroad?  The Minister is probably aware of the position because the two young men who died last summer were from our constituency of Galway West.  It is because of the Facebook petition by their parents and friends that I am in a position to highlight the matter.  One of the young men was Keith O&rsquo;Reilly from Merlin Park, Galway, who is buried in Leenane cemetery.  The other young man was Brian Forde from Athenry who was in America for a few days.  He was a young teacher in Loughrea.</P>
        <P>It is not the case that all citizens who die abroad have their deaths registered and recorded in Ireland.  The 2004 Act covers the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths.  Under the Act, the death of an Irish citizen who dies abroad is only recorded and registered in the Republic if he or she was on an Irish aircraft or ship, a foreign ship or aircraft that was in transit or a serving member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Defence Forces.  This is all fine, but it means that for the majority of citizens who die abroad their deaths will never be recorded or registered in their home country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was stunned to learn as a result of this campaign by the young men&rsquo;s families and friends that in 2009, 244 Irish citizens had died abroad and that their deaths had not been recorded in this country.  Can one imagine how great the number would be over time?  Is this an oversight in the Act or deliberate?  I need the Minister to explain the reason.</P>
        <P>The lack of registration at home makes life more difficult for the family members left behind.  It also means that figuring out what happened to one&rsquo;s ancestors will be extremely difficult for future generations searching through Irish documentation.  The people who have died are not statistics.  They were born and, in many cases, educated in Ireland.  They may even have worked here.  The two young men to whom I have referred were on holiday in the United States and deserve the right to be recognised by their country, even in death.  It is important that we make this change to help with the grieving process.</P>
        <P>I will provide some quotations from the families, but one of the mothers has told me that for every beginning, there has to be an end and that her son who began in this country has to be given the dignity and justice of having his death registered here.  It is also important for future families who may have to go through this awful experience.</P>
        <P>Already, 1,174 people have signed the on-line petition.  I attended the funerals of both of the young men who died in the United States.  The Minister may also have attended them.  They died ten days apart but quite separately.  Coincidentally, they had shared a flat in New York the previous summer.  One of the mothers said:</P>
        <P LI="1">They were our kids.  They were only there on holiday.  There are no records of their deaths in this country.  There should be a beginning and an end to everything.  We need closure.  Without registration of their deaths in Ireland it is unfinished business.</P><Col N="929"/>
        <P FLI="0">That mother said she might accept the situation if her son had permanently emigrated.</P>
        <P>We need to look at the cases where one might not see fit to register an Irish citizen&rsquo;s death abroad, perhaps if he or she had gained citizenship in another country.  One must live in the United States, for example, for five years before qualifying for citizenship.  I support these families&rsquo; needs.  Where a young person is on holiday or is working abroad temporarily the Government should see fit to register his or her death in his or her home country.</P>
        <P>The law in the United Kingdom changed in this regard within the last ten years.  If a visitor from the United States or the United Kingdom died in Ireland his or her death would be registered in Ireland and in his or her home country.  Perhaps we should look at how other countries do things.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Help bring them home&rdquo; petition can be seen on Facebook.  Keith O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s mother said, &ldquo;Life is just so different now.  We are just doing it for Keith because he is pushing us along to do it.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I was interested to read some of the comments placed on Facebook by the families and young friends of the two men who died.  Colm Lehane said, &ldquo;Amend the Act&rdquo;.  Sheila O&rsquo;Neill said, &ldquo;Help bring them home&rdquo;.  Dominique Mulvaney said, &ldquo;It is not right not to register someone&rsquo;s death just because they died outside Ireland&rdquo;.  Another said, &ldquo;This is a very important petition and I trust that many more people will sign it, leading to a change in this legislation&rdquo;.  Mark Quinlivan commented, &ldquo;This is a disgrace.  Get it sorted and let their deaths be registered&rdquo;.  A similar comment reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">This is the most ridiculous Act ever.  It needs to be changed.  A terrible law.  Please change the law.  Imagine if it was your son or daughter.  It would be the right way of doing things, especially because they are Irish.</P>
        <P FLI="0">How would the Minister or I feel if the person involved was our son, daughter, brother or sister?  These young people were born and educated in Ireland.  They went through primary, secondary and third level education.  Brian Ford was due back in Ireland the following Monday to do an interview for a permanent teaching post with County Galway VEC.  Keith O&rsquo;Reilly was in the United States for the summer on a J1 visa.</P>
        <P>One on-line comment reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">As an Irish citizen, I believe this is of huge importance.  Please do the right thing and amend the 2004 Act.  It is vital that this amendment is put through.  It is a basic right for parents and families who have suffered the loss of a loved one abroad who is also an Irish citizen.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Another reads, &ldquo;I am an Irish citizen living in the US and I fully support this petition&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  This issue will be brought before the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs at the end of April.  I hope the Minister&rsquo;s reply will allay their fears.</P>

Ar nd&oacute;igh, bh&iacute; na daoine c&eacute;anna i dteagmh&aacute;il liomsa faoin gceist seo.

This matter is the responsibility of my Department and that is why it will come before the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.</P><Col N="930"/>
        <P>The provisions and procedures governing the registration of deaths in Ireland are contained in Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 and these are as follows.  Where a death occurs in the State it is the duty of a qualified informant (normally a relative of the deceased) to attend at a registrar&rsquo;s office and register the death on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner.  Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner&rsquo;s certificate.</P>
        <P>In general, only deaths which occur within the State are registerable.  However, Section 39 of the Act, provides for the following exceptions: deaths of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Permanent Defence Force or of the spouse or specified members of the family of such a member outside the State while the member is serving outside the State as such member; deaths of persons on board an Irish aircraft or an Irish ship; and deaths of Irish citizens on board a foreign ship or a foreign aircraft travelling to or from a port, or an airport, as the case may be, in the State.</P>
        <P>Section 38 of the Act makes provision for the registration of a death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State in certain specific circumstances.  Where the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State occurs abroad, the death may be registered here if there was not at the time of the death a system of registration of deaths in the place where the death occurred, or such a system that applied to such a death, or it is not possible to obtain copies of or extracts from civil records of the death, i.e. a death certificate.  In other words, if the death could not be registered or if a death certificate could not be obtained, the death can be registered here.  Although the number of such cases is extremely small it is considered reasonable to make provision for them.</P>
        <P>The reasoning behind these provisions is simply to ensure that where deaths cannot be registered abroad, they can be registered here and that in all cases the relatives of the deceased have available to them a certificate of the death for personal, legal and administrative purposes.</P>
        <P>Usually, when an Irish citizen dies abroad, the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable.  This certificate, translated, if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and for these reasons alone there is no necessity for the death to be registered in the State.</P>
        <P>Any broadening of the current provisions will require careful consideration.  It will be appreciated that the number of people who live and die in other countries and who have or are entitled to have Irish citizenship is very large.  Some second or third generation descendants have rights of citizenship and, of course, anyone born in the North of Ireland is entitled to Irish citizenship.  That is why a citizenship only qualification would create grave difficulties.  It would have implications both for the registration process itself and for the vital statistics relating to deaths which are derived from registered events.</P>
        <P>The number of Irish citizens who are domiciled in Ireland and who die abroad is relatively small in the context of total deaths occurring here in any given year.  I fully accept that this was the situation in the case of the two young people mentioned by Senator Healy Eames.  The figures available in respect of some recent years are as follows: in 2007, 150 Irish citizens died abroad; in 2008 the figure was 205; in 2009 it was 243; and so far in 2010 it is 48.  My understanding is that the vast majority of these people were travelling abroad for leisure or business purposes.</P><Col N="931"/>
        <P>I am conscious of course that each figure represents a tragedy and because the deaths take place away from home it is an additional heartache for the family.  In this regard it is, I believe, appropriate for me to remind people going abroad that the same care should be taken in relation to personal safety as when at home.</P>
        <P>As I have said already, a death certificate is readily available in the overwhelming majority of these cases.  However, I do appreciate that many families of the deceased feel strongly that by registration of the death, the person&rsquo;s death is given recognition in his or her own country and also that this fact would assist during a period of considerable grief.</P>
        <P>The Department will therefore have this matter reviewed in the context of future amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  I will examine what challenges would arise if we decided to amend the Act.  The real challenge in this respect is that citizenship alone would create the possibility that people would seek a death certificate for family members who never lived in this country.  The case has been raised by people who are domiciled here and are citizens but who are living away from home for a short period.  I will examine that issue but it is in that context that I can do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I have one or two questions.  I thank the Minister for his time.  Am I to understand that he is giving a commitment to examine this matter and is open to considering a five-year rule in this respect?  I accept the measure could not be open <i>ad infinitum</i>  because that could involve a great number of people.  The Minister raised the issue of deaths that occur abroad of Irish citizens domiciled in Ireland.  To use his words, they are small in number, but such incidents are of huge importance, such as the 243 such deaths in 2009.  Is the Minister giving a commitment that he will seriously consider amending the legislation for those who died abroad who were domiciled in Ireland?  Is he open to considering a five-year rule in this respect, in other words, people domiciled in Ireland but who have lived abroad for up to five years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I have learnt over the years never to make policy on the hoof.  I said the matter will be reviewed in the context of future amendments of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  I am giving that commitment but I am not going beyond that.  One needs to examine all the implications of a decision.  In terms of the statistics given, these people were domiciled in Ireland.  In other words, they were living in Ireland at the time; it was not a matter of three or four years, they were domiciled here.  Therefore, this is not the same as what the Senator is seeking and I do not know the implications of her proposal.  There is a seanfhocail, &ldquo;look before you leap&rdquo;.  There is no point in making policy on the hoof that one might subsequently find is not practical.  It is much more practical to do what I said we would do, namely, to examine this matter in the context of any review of this Act, consider the implications of it and then make a decision.  When one makes a decision in such circumstances, one can stick by it rather than making policy on the hoof and then finding there are good&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not fully aware of, nor have I had a chance to examine, even on a cursory basis, the implications of the Senator&rsquo;s proposal.  I fully recognise how sad these situations are.  I happen to know one of the families very well.  I did not make the funeral but I visited the family.  I am more than aware of the tragedy involved.  That said, we cannot make law on the hoof.  When the law is changed for one, it is changed for all.  One must always examine the unintended consequences of decisions.  Commitments made in knowledge are much more valuable than commitments made on the hoof without exploring all the consequences.</P>
