	<P>I have received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to appoint a single agency to co-ordinate flood risk that would be responsible for managing and maintaining the River Shannon and its tributaries.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to give approval to Donegal County Council to further progress the Raphoe flood project following on from the completion of the pre-feasibility flood study.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paudie Coffey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the provision of additional funding to local authorities to assist them in respect of road maintenance, road resurfacing, road renewal and repair, following the recent damaging inclement weather.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the provision of additional funding to local authorities to assist them in respect of road maintenance, road resurfacing, road renewal and repair, following the recent damaging inclement weather.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  As Senators Coffey&rsquo;s and Buttimer&rsquo;s matters are similar I suggest they share time.</P>

	<P>I am sure Senators will join me in wishing for the best in the talks in Northern Ireland.  It is a tense and difficult situation but we all hope the efforts will be successful.  No one ever said power sharing would be easy but there is no way back for Northern Ireland to its bloody and violent past.  We all want to see progress being made in today&rsquo;s critical talks.</P>
        <P>There have been reports that hundreds of special needs assistants will finish work this Friday, leaving classrooms without help.  The children who need them will no longer have them.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Education and Science appear in the House to outline how he intends to ensure these children will survive in mainstream schools and how we will continue a policy that provides for their inclusion in classrooms if they do not have available to them, as the majority do, special needs assistants.  There is a gatekeeper-type situation where resources are not being given to young children who need the services in question if they are to survive in mainstream schools.  We need clarity on the policy being followed.  Senator Boyle may have something to say on the matter, as we were told after the renegotiation of the programme for Government that there would be a rowing back on the education cuts and that there would be protection of vulnerable children.  Two events will occur this week.  First, special needs assistants will be withdrawn from classrooms in which they are badly needed.  Second, substitute panels of teachers in disadvantaged areas will be done away with.  Once again school principals will be put under considerable pressure if substitutes are not available to replace missing teachers.  In my area of Clondalkin, for example, where this system was in place six teachers were looking after 12 schools.  The substitute panels have been done away with.  These are education cuts.  I do not know what else one could call them.  I would like the Minister to attend the House to explain how he will protect these children&rsquo;s futures if they do not have the supports they require in the classroom.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted Senator Fitzgerald has raised this issue, as it is one I have raised time and again.  It all reverts to the non-implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  The sections which deal with the matters mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald have not been commenced.  It is crucial that the Minister discusses this issue in the House.  The Act passed through the House with support from all sides.  However, we have been sold a pup in that the relevant sections have not been commenced.  Various sections could be commenced at a very low cost.  I ask that this be done.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Thursday I drew the attention of the House to the motion proposed by Senator Norris and seconded by me, which read: &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann urges the Government to introduce legislation aimed at regulating the sale of dangerous, non quality controlled and indeterminately compounded substances through so called &lsquo;Head Shops&rsquo; &rdquo;.  The Leader kindly agreed to take the motion if there was all-party support for it.  I have spoken to every party in the meantime and the motion now has the support of Senators Cassidy, Fitzgerald, Alex White and Boyle.  Therefore, I propose an amendment to the Order of Busi<Col N="145"/>ness that motion No. 21 be taken first today without debate.  It is fair to say that what we are discussing is high street drug peddling.  While &ldquo;head shops&rdquo; might not be breaking any law and are, <i>de jure</i>, legal, <i>de facto</i> they go against everything contemplated in the control of substances.  As someone who worked for many years in Irish and European anti-drugs structures, this is appalling.  In order that people will understand, we are discussing circumstances where minor changes are made to substances which are then made freely available on the high street.  There can be psychotic and damaging consequences for young and old people of all descriptions.  This not only leads to difficulties for society but also to deaths.  It is beyond belief and totally unacceptable that such substances are not controlled.  I have studied this area again during the past week.  The substances in question are far more dangerous than some of the items outlawed by legislation.  This is exactly like the development of LSD and other psychedelic substances in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s that were then named and outlawed.  There are substances now which are equally as damaging.  As well as approving the motion today, it would be very helpful for us to have a debate on the issue at an appropriate time as it pertains to all counties throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Garda drugs squad is trying to deal with drug peddlers but this creates the same human and social difficulties, although there may not be crime involved.  The issue must be dealt with, regulated and controlled immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is clearly a very serious issue in the North in the context of the ongoing talks which, it is hoped, will continue this afternoon and this evening.  It is perplexing for people to realise that on the substantive devolution of policing powers to the North, there seems to be a roadblock.  We do not want to say anything here that will in any way interfere with or make life even for a moment more difficult for the people engaging in negotiations in the North at the moment but it seems strange that if there is a strong basis for the devolution of policing powers to the North &mdash; which there is &mdash; it should be made contingent on a specific issue, albeit important for the DUP.  That is the question of the Parades Commission.</P>
        <P>Many people find it perplexing that there is a constant trade-off.  None of us is naive and we understand that negotiations often involve trade-offs.  This is an issue of historical substance regarding the devolution of policing powers.  If there is an argument and case, which many people seem to have come around to supporting, the issue should proceed and not be made contingent on the issue of the Parades Commission.  Having said that, I join Senator Fitzgerald in wishing all the parties in the North, including our Government, well in an attempt to resolve the issue.</P>
        <P>I also second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments and second the amendment to the Order of Business which she has proposed on special needs.  Will the Leader arrange, as a matter of urgency, for the Minister to come in and explain why it appears that within the next few days, the system is to lose 1,200 special needs assistants?  This has not been denied or confirmed but can we have an indication that the report is wrong?  Will Senator Boyle tell us if it is wrong as his colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was on radio no more recently than at the weekend again emphasising the importance of education to the Green Party?</P>
        <P>Will the issue be clarified to this House if it cannot be clarified on radio or to anybody else?  Special needs assistance is one of the small number of things we have achieved in the past ten or 15 years of prosperity.  It is a genuinely progressive step that has occurred in our schools.  It would be a most serious backward step for people who are genuinely needed in the system, special needs assistants, to be made redundant at the end of this week or anytime soon.  That appears to be what is contemplated by the Department.</P>
<Col N="146"/>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s evaluation paper on these matters, submitted to the Department of Finance, stated in a rather prescient manner that there is a redundancy scheme in place.  The document states:</P>
        <P LI="1">However, removal of SNAs, even on a moderate scale, is likely to result in significant rearguard action by schools.  It may result in schools refusing to continue to retain pupils with special needs and will undoubtedly attract significant adverse public and media reaction.  Previous experience in the special needs area indicates that even where criteria are not met, removal of resources can be very contentious.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a genuinely contentious issue and it should be dealt with in this House.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come in at an early opportunity so the issue can be debated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the good wishes that Senator Fitzgerald has expressed for the talks in Northern Ireland.  Everybody in this House believes the process of government and ongoing administration in Northern Ireland must be deeply embedded and the current crisis must be overcome.  We wish all participants in the talks well.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke on motion No. 21 on the Order Paper.  I hope the Leader is in a position to take it without debate in order that the House can show its collective belief as regards the need to control properly the sale and use of synthetic drugs in Ireland.  It is a topic that needs a great deal more scrutiny to ensure greater levels of control.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is no doubt education spending has to be reduced, with spending in other Departments, owing to the current economic climate.  However, the reductions made have been rolled back in several areas.  In the latest Estimates the smallest reduction is in education.  With the return to additional expenditure in education, we will see the hiring of additional teachers at primary and secondary level, with the partial implementation of the EPSOM Act<i> </i>through the hiring of a number of psychologists for the National Educational Psychological Service.  This will go some way towards remedying the situation with special needs assistants, a process that needs to be reviewed.  Even in schools where children with special needs have moved on, the special needs assistants remain and have been asked to carry out other duties.  We should have a debate on this issue, but I am sure the Leader believes we have enough to do today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We adopted legislation on NAMA in this House on 12 November, at which point I indicated that this did not mean it was a done deal in that it had to be approved by the European Commission.  I also asked the Leader if we would be kept informed in respect of the notification of the scheme to Brussels and whether it would diverge from the business plan of which the House was informed in October.  I raised the matter again on 19 December with the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, when I asked if the NAMA legislation had been notified to the Commission.  The Minister of State gave such an ambivalent answer that I had to inquire about the matter with the Commission.  At that point there had been no such notification.  It was made on 23 December and the legislation is now the subject of examination by the Commission.  I met with it yesterday in Brussels, following a submission I had made in a statement of objections to NAMA in its current form.  That submission will be presented to the Government by the Commission for its comments.  I will be submitting further information to the Commission.</P>
        <P>There are reports in the newspapers every day about valuations and changes in valuations.  There are reports today about new legislation that may be required to facilitate banks participating in the operations of NAMA.  We have made special arrangements to ensure NAMA <Col N="147"/>will make money on the properties it will acquire.  There have been reports about haircut budgets and whether the figure will be 30% or otherwise.  The Leader indicated that the House would be kept informed.  What scheme has been notified to the European Commission?  There has been total secrecy about the decision last October to give a guarantee to the banks. There has also been secrecy about the banking inquiry.  A &euro;54 billion gamble on NAMA is too important to remain a secret.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to inform the House what is happening with the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to start the week with some good news.  I know the Leader believes there have not been enough good news stories in the media.  Colleagues read the reports in last week&rsquo;s newspapers about the success of the dublinbikes project and how additional bikes were required and additional bays were being provided.  The project is making a huge contribution to easing traffic flow in the city.  It is also making a positive contribution to reducing our carbon footprint.</P>

	<P>I have subscribed to the scheme and I travel to work most mornings using dublinbikes.  It is an exhilarating way to travel and it is safe.  The bikes are sturdy and there is a bay beside Leinster House.  I recommend to the Leader and all my colleagues to leave the Mercedes at home in the apartments or hotels and to travel to Leinster House using dublinbikes from now on.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the motion I proposed on head shops has been given all-party support.  There was some misunderstanding between myself and Senator O&rsquo;Toole because I asked him to get agreement on this.  I do not like the idea that we will pass the motion without discussion.  I will not accept this and I will vote against the Order of Business unless we get a clear commitment and a firm date for this discussion.  The debate has been started in a fine way by Senator O&rsquo;Toole but there is much to be said about this matter.  Drugs are sold uncontrolled, are highly addictive and can create at least medium-term psychotic episodes.  The people selling them do not know what is in them.  They are selling highly addictive drugs, one of which is cocaine with one molecule changed.  This gets around the law.  I heard a doctor make a couple of very good points this morning.  In a restaurant everything is quality controlled and food and safety people monitor it even though the produce is only going into one&rsquo;s stomach.  These drugs go directly to people&rsquo;s brains but there is no regulation.  I must ask for a firm date on the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not.  Not unless we get a commitment.  Someone else can second it but if I did I would be contradicting what I said.</P>
<Col N="148"/>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad to see the motion on Haiti, in the name of the Government.  It is very important that we do this.  I was interested to hear an Italian earthquake expert noting that one of the difficulties is the number of groups trying to create what he called a <i>bella figura</i>.  They are performing for the world stage.  That happened tragically in Haiti before, after the typhoon or the tornado hit it.  World leaders were queueing up to promise hundreds of millions of dollars but none of that came true.  The Irish people have contributed magnificently and Hollywood has contributed an enormous amount of money.  Thank God for that but we should bear in mind what was said by those two remarkable Irish women, Dr. Louise Ivers and Ms Gena Heraghty.  I was proud to be Irish when I saw what they were doing.  This was a film shown by RTE but recorded before the typhoon struck.  They talked about the appalling conditions and the human solidarity with the suffering people.  They were cradling children in their arms and saying that every human being has the right to be protected and to be shown solidarity on the difficult journey through life.  It was only by accident that it was not them in that place.  We must examine the history.  I did not realise that after the revolution in 1804 the French crucified them for daring to throw off the yoke.  They made them pay reparations until 1949.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that part of the Oireachtas is moving out of here down to another noble institution, Trinity College.  There will be an important debate involving Members of the Oireachtas.  We have all been invited and I hope many will go.  It is an important opportunity to make our case to the public.  It could not be a more auspicious day.  As the Cathaoirleach knows, that day, 2 February, is not only the day of the historic meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in Trinity College, it is also James Joyce&rsquo;s 128th birthday.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader for a debate on the upcoming Privacy Bill and in particular the fact that many Ministers find their private lives have been intruded on in an unacceptable way.  This goes across the political divide.  I am conscious that this is a relatively new phenomenon.  It is sad that it is a British paper, <i>Daily Mail</i>, that is the worst offender.  It seems to be applying the same policy as applies in the UK.  There was serious intrusion in the UK, including the tapping of certain politicians&rsquo; mobile telephones, and large settlements have been made in the courts as a result.  Given that the <i>Daily Mail</i> employs independent stalker journalists abroad, is it reasonable that they should know the intrusive techniques they use are in breach of the law?  The information they supply could only be gained through illegal activity.  This has become a serious issue.  We cannot allow these unacceptable practices to continue but it is a pity we are forced to introduce a privacy Bill.  I am reminded of the cartoon published in the <i>Daily Mail</i> of a turkey ostensibly pretending to be an Irish pig and saying: &ldquo;Top o&rsquo; the mornin&rsquo; to yis. Begorra and bejabers...oink, oink...to be sure...&rdquo;.  In my 49 years I have never heard an Irish man or woman speak in that manner.  The <i>Irish Daily Mail</i> is the worst offender.</P>

	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  I share her hope that progress is made in the ongoing talks in the North.</P>
        <P>I hope the Leader would agree that now is an opportune time to hold a debate on waste policy, in which regard confusion has arisen between what we thought was Government policy and recent ministerial comments.  I ask how the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government proposes to annul the contract between Dublin City Council and Covanta to prevent the incinerator at Poolbeg proceeding.  There is concern in the city about it.  At a <Col N="149"/>minimum, the matter needs clarification.  Given that he represents the Government in this House, perhaps the Leader can offer his preliminary thoughts on how the construction of this incinerator can be halted.  I think we would agree we should have a debate on waste policy and I hope the Leader can arrange for Members as soon as possible to allow the Minister to make a statement to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>One hopes that the extension of time which has been granted to the Northern talks augurs well for a possible solution.  The mere fact that the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister are attending alongside representatives of the various parties is an indication of how far we have come.  We have overcome many historical and political obstacles to reach our current position.  If the current stalemate continues it will produce a very dangerous vacuum.  Political commentators have suggested that extremism is on the rise.  This morning, I heard a Unionist representative use pre-Good Friday Agreement terminology.  We need to be particularly careful in this regard.  I understand that it was a given from the St. Andrews Agreement that policing and justice would devolve to Northern Ireland.  All the spokespersons from the main parties, including the DUP, have indicated their support for the devolution of powers.  I hope the forthcoming election in the North is not casting its shadow on the issue because if we enter that election without a solution, we will see the emergence of a completely different grouping which will set us back ten or 15 years.  What a vacuum of that kind can do does not bear thinking about.  We spent years discussing this in this Chamber as did the D&aacute;il and the media.  We have heard it everywhere.  We have gone through the blackest days in the history of Ireland and anybody who would endanger the progress we have made would want to think twice of the responsibility which is on his or her shoulders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on cycling.  I join with a previous speaker who commended the dublinbikes scheme which has been a resounding success.  However, it is rather extraordinary to hear Fianna F&aacute;il members attempting to claim credit for it, given that it was the initiative of Labour Party councillors, particularly Councillor Andrew Montague on Dublin City Council&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who brought about this scheme.  It would be ridiculous for the Green Party to seek to claim credit for it, given it has no councillors on Dublin City Council.  We should commend the dublinbikes scheme and I hope we see it extended and I congratulate Dublin City Council.  It is notable that Senator Alex White and myself are the two Senators, to my knowledge, who cycle to Leinster House every day and we do not use dublinbikes but rather we use our own bicycles&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I am sure others do too.  My apologies to Senator O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
        <P>I also ask for a debate on the university sector.  In the past week some issues of great concern which deserve more thorough and comprehensive debate in this House have been raised.  I refer in particular to the announcement of the abolition of the National University of Ireland, NUI.  This is a rather extraordinary announcement and we need to hear more about the rationale behind it and the justification for it.</P>
        <P>I refer to the comments of Peter Sutherland widely reported last week that there should be fewer universities and that university heads should be paid more.  I could not agree with this view and I ask for a debate on it.  We are seeing a real undermining of the research activity in universities with the announcement by Science Foundation Ireland that it can no longer fund <Col N="150"/>on-line journal access.  This is a vital resource for academic research and teaching.  I will be writing to Science Foundation Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and the Minister asking for an answer.  Academics in Trinity College and librarians across the universities have raised this issue with all the university Senators because it is such a serious matter.  A denial of access to on-line journals will have a crippling impact on the ability to research effectively.  I am aware that librarians are in negotiation with publishers about this but we need an answer from the Minister on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senator Bacik of the one cohort of people she forget to compliment when she was talking about the success of the dublinbikes scheme.  The good people of Dublin have made the scheme a success and also visitors such as Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan who have become members of the scheme and without this support the scheme would not be the success it is.</P>
        <P>I wish to echo what Senator Bacik said about Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s comments on third level funding.  The House should use the opportunity to have a good, rigorous and honest debate about university funding.  I pay tribute also to her party colleague, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, who has a very interesting article in one of today&rsquo;s papers about the future of the Catholic Church in Irish schools.  This is another debate we should have.  I would welcome the Minister for Education and Science but I would prefer if he were to come to the House under these separate headings because they all deserve particular attention rather than the Minister coming for one audience with the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to strike a discordant note on the question of what is happening in the North but we need to think about what is happening up there.  Every time there is a crisis, the British and Irish Governments and the Taoiseach and Prime Minister go there to try and sort it out.  How are people ever going to face up to their own responsibilities as elected representatives if this continues to happen?  It exposes the inherent problems in the system of governance in the North of Ireland, the D&rsquo;Hondt system, in that it rewards people from the extremes and does not reward people who bring together communities and serve all of the people within their communities.  While we continue to prop up a dysfunctional system, frankly it will never work and there will be crisis after crisis because everyone knows the upcoming Westminster elections are foremost in the minds of politicians in that area.  In one sense it is a matter for themselves, but frankly the dual and triple mandates show how the North of Ireland is over-governed.  It is an opportunity for both Governments to consider how we need to build in a system of governance with a true Opposition because until we do, we will never have independent and successful governance in the North of Ireland.</P>

	<P>I second Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment on &ldquo;head shops&rdquo;.  I ask the Leader to outline to the House when we will have the debate on that topic, whether it will be later this week or next week.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald and previous speakers on the proposed cutbacks, in particular that involving special needs assistants.  I have personal family experience of their work.  It is a bit rich to be told by Members on the Government side that extra teachers are being hired.  That is all well and good.  While it is welcome and important, if one does not give a child who needs a special needs assistant access to such provision, one denies his or her basic right to an education.  One cannot stand over any cutback in that regard as a revenue saving measure or for any other reason.</P>
        <P>I also raise with the Leader pensions for the spouses of farmers.  I did not hear the issue raised in the House last week, although it might have been.  The Minister for Social and Family <Col N="151"/>Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, has launched what can only be described as an attack on a particularly small segment of the population, namely, farmers&rsquo; wives, for the most part, who a little more than a year and a half ago became eligible for the State pension.  Now the Minister has indicated that the pension payment will cease and that moneys paid might be taken back from those who have paid their PRSI contributions and contributed greatly to society.  They are to be hung out to dry by the Government.  Perhaps the Leader has a particular stance on the issue that he would like to disclose to the House.</P>
        <P>Media reports over the weekend indicated that locum doctors were to be brought into the PAYE system by the Revenue Commissioners.  It was indicated in some of the reports I read that back taxes going back four or five years would be sought from locum doctors who up to now have been treated as self-employed persons.  Perhaps the Leader has a view on that subject.  I consider this as a very unfair proposal.</P>

	<P>I, too, join Senators O&rsquo;Toole and John Paul Phelan in their call for No. 21 to be taken immediately without debate as the first item on the Order of Business today.  With other Senators on all sides of the House, on a number of occasions I have pointed to the dangers associated with &ldquo;head shops&rdquo; which are opening in towns and villages throughout the length and breadth of the Twenty-six Counties under various names and titles.  Given the destruction they are causing, mainly to young people, this is outrageous and a disgrace.</P>

	<P>The sooner we can do something to prevent them from selling their wares the better.  Will the Leader investigate the possibility of using the expertise within the walls of this Chamber, legal and otherwise, to formulate a group to specifically examine this topic and make recommendations to the Minister responsible in order that legislation can be implemented as soon as possible to ban these shops from the main street?  I accept it is a complex issue, one that it will be difficult to address.  As Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, one only has to change one component to allow such products to be sold legally.  It is so important that I urge the Leader to consider bringing together the expertise available in this Chamber to assist the Minister in bringing forward legislation as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Some years ago a Japanese businessman said to me that if the Japanese had a brand like St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, they would use it well.  I say this to highlight the value of a brand.  Last week Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the importance of the National University of Ireland brand which I believe must be maintained in some way.  I am sure the Minister has every intention of doing this and recognises that something must be done in this regard, even though, as we know, he is taking steps to abolish the NUI.  We must have the debate in the House because this is where it should take place, given that there is a mention of the NUI in the Constitution in regard to the number of seats allocated to it which I know the Minister will have taken into account.  I am sure he would welcome such a debate because I know his intention is not to damage something as valuable as the NUI brand.</P>
        <P>A point I often repeat concerns the giving of presumed consent for organ donation.  We discussed a Bill in the House but the debate has been adjourned.  For 12 months the Minister has been carrying out a public opinion investigation into what is the right way to proceed.  Last week the Welsh Assembly announced its intention to introduce legislation on the issue of presumed consent for organ donation.  The words used were that it was &ldquo;a scandal&rdquo; that so many people had to die while waiting for an organ donation when so many people were willing to donate their organs.  We need to have such legislation put through because there are not enough organ donations.</P>
<Col N="152"/>
        <P>The state of France has jointly developed a scheme with the Alzheimer&rsquo;s association to provide 14 hours training for family members and relatives of persons suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  It is clearly a win-win.  The matter is worthy of consideration in this country because such a scheme would reduce the cost to the State in the long term and also benefit the families involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Senators, I would welcome a debate on the issues of cycling and recycling.  Any time a Senator calls for a debate in the House on waste policy, I will absolutely support him or her because it is a crucial issue.  I very much welcome the comments of Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan on cycling.  The legacy of Se&aacute;n Kelly and Stephen Roche is certainly in danger.  Cycling is not just a matter for the Green Party, it also a matter for all parties and Members of the House.  It is a great way to get around and a great form of transport.  I, therefore, call for a debate on the topic.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on housing.  There was a very interesting discussion on the subject last night and I have also heard various discussions in recent days on ghost estates throughout the country.  Certain people have claimed that as many as 300,000 houses are empty, although the Minister has put the figure at slightly less than half that number.  I call for a debate as a matter of urgency on the issue, particularly on the danger of ghettoisation.</P>
        <P>As the father of a special needs child, I have campaigned long and hard on the issue and believe a debate on it would be welcomed in the House.  I note, as Deputy Boyle said, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 forms part of the programme for Government.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I believe it is very important legislation.  However, there is a danger in focusing purely on special needs assistants, as there is a range of issues which need to be debated, particularly those concerning occupational and speech therapists.  If we were to have a narrow party political debate, we would not be able to reach the rights-based solution required.  We need to deal with the rights of children.  That is the key issue, not those working in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Fitzgerald in calling for the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to address this House as a matter of urgency.  He is fast dismantling education such that the structure we will have in place will have no bearing compared with that which was in place five years ago.  Those who need it the most, the most vulnerable with special needs, will have no recourse to assistance under our education system.  The Green Party has cynically talked about the Education for People with Special Educational Needs Act but the Government has been equally as cynical in its implementation of that Act in terms of how it has applied it.  I would welcome a debate on this issue and I challenge the Senators opposite to bring forward such a debate.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole and other speakers and second Senator Wilson&rsquo;s proposal that we have an all-party committee on the issue of head shops, of which there are nearly 100, and which are now a front door for the selling of drugs.  The Fine Gael Party tabled a motion on the Order Paper similar to and in support of the motion on this matter before the House.  With such head shops, we have the unregulated selling of drugs by any other name.  People are seriously ill, on the edge of death, families have been destroyed and young lives have been shattered.  How long must be wait for legislation and action to be taken on this matter?  There is a crying human need for the outlawing of head shops and it should commence immediately.  A debate on this issue must take place and, on foot of it, action must be taken.</P>
        <P>I seldom agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley but I wholeheartedly agree with what she said regarding the North.  Extremism in this country can never be allowed to prosper and win.  There is a <Col N="153"/>responsibility and an obligation on us as representatives elected on behalf of the people to govern and to be part of government.  In the North today the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in and the other political parties must live up to their responsibility.  I wish the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, well in their endeavours.  Yesterday was an historic day when two Heads of Government travelled in a plane that landed in Belfast.  We all aspire to have peace, but to have peace and devolution of power, minds must change and there must be a meeting of minds in the interests of the common good, which is the benefit of the people in the North and South, and ahead of any partisan political benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in sending good wishes to all the parties involved in the Northern talks.  We have witnessed the resolution of many critical and sensitive issues during the past ten years or so.  There are now problems regarding two areas, that of the devolution of police powers and that of the parades commission.  I differ somewhat with what has been said by others in that I very much support the input of the most senior politicians and such continued determination.  We have brought this process as far as we have now come because of the input of the most senior of politicians and the determination of all involved throughout the years.  We need to continue to show such determination.  While I do not want to point a finger at any of those involved, there are two political groupings, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, where there are difficulties.  Each of us who understands the message coming from our constituencies and from our political groupings must send that message to those groupings in the North, namely, that of a determination for a resolution and for them to stay at the table and to keep at it.  We have found resolution on other issues that were far more sensitive and critical and we were able to get agreement to move the process forward.  That is the message we should clearly send to all those involved.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to an issue I raised in this House some months ago, that of my objection to the proposal to centralise the processing of medical card and GP visit card applications and reviews.  We set up the HSE to provide a service and it has now set up this centralised unit.  We received a letter from the Minister indicating that a dedicated telephone line has been provided for Oireachtas Members inquiring about these applications and reviews, and we can go back with the list that has been provided to the local general managers.  A mistake has been made in this respect.</P>

	<P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business with regard to head shops.  The matter will need to be addressed and I hope the Leader will indicate that he is prepared to have a debate on this subject next week.  The motion should not be taken without debate as is being proposed.  We will need to discuss the matter as it is of serious consequence from the point of view of health, as I said last week and as has been stated by a number of Members this afternoon.  We cannot allow the current situation to continue for much longer.  It must be addressed, whether through legislation or otherwise.</P>
        <P>The fair deal scheme for nursing homes is up and running in most parts of the country.  In Waterford, however, there is a backlog of more than 200 applications, and not one has even been examined over the past nine weeks due to a lack of staff and resources.  Many children <Col N="154"/>and relatives of people in nursing homes have been put to the pin of their collars in paying nursing home charges and are under severe financial strain.  When the Minister introduces a scheme through legislation, she must also provide the necessary back-up and resources to implement it.  This is not happening in Waterford and many are suffering as a result.  I ask the Leader to raise this with the Minister and ensure the situation is rectified as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support other Senators who have concerns about head shops.  In the last six to nine months these shops have mushroomed throughout the country.  Wherever I go, whether I am out shopping or going for a walk, I am constantly meeting parents of children as young as nine or ten and up to 16, who are worried about their sons and daughters.  They may not even be going into the shops but are hanging around outside them while their friends go in trying this and that.  As Senator Wilson rightly points out, the products sold in these shops have torn families apart and caused considerable grief and heartache.  I do not know whether the issue falls under health or some other area.</P>
        <P>One could nearly write the script for tomorrow&rsquo;s Order of Business, because tonight&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; will be doing a special on head shops, and I know that every single Senator will come into the House tomorrow morning asking that something be done.  RTE is not even advertising the show very well but one can tell from the sound of it how shocking it will be.  It is an issue that needs to be dealt with urgently.  The motion tabled by Senator Norris is No. 21 on the Order Paper today, to be taken without debate.  If that will move things on, I will certainly support it.</P>
        <P>Finally, I remind the Leader to make time for an urgent debate, for which many Senators have asked, on domestic abuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the review of the Common Fisheries Policy which is due in 2012.  The submission to the European Commission being prepared by the Irish Government in conjunction with all other member states is a timely opportunity for us to debate Ireland&rsquo;s submission and put our stamp on it.  There will be a review period over the coming months.  I ask the Leader to convene a debate on this issue and, if possible, invite the new Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs to the House to listen to the views of Senators, especially those from coastal communities given the difficulties experienced by such communities with the implementation of the previous Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
        <P>The second issue to which I wish to refer is one close to my area, namely, the stalemate in the ongoing talks in Northern Ireland.  Having lived in the North as a student and knowing many people across the Border in Derry and Fermanagh, I am aware that large-scale dissident activity is occurring nightly across the North at present, particularly in Border areas.  If the talks end in stalemate, it will only fuel the hardcore violence that these groups breed.  Therefore, I hope the parties at the coalface in the North will reach some form of agreement, rather than allowing the current situation to continue into the future.  I support fully the efforts of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and hope, in conjunction with the parties in the North, they can reach an agreement.  While both sides may have to give, the focus should be on ordinary families trying to survive there in the long run.  There is a responsibility on both sides to reach an agreement following the Good Friday Agreement, the subsequent referenda on it and the St. Andrews Agreement.</P>

	<P>I support the call for an all-party motion on the banning of &ldquo;head shops&rdquo;.  As someone who has cared for the victims of these establishments for a number of years, it is time something was done but meticulous legislation will have to be introduced because those who peddle these products are clever.  Legislation will have to cover not only <Col N="155"/>the current range of products available in these shops but also substances that are not.  In the normal course of events they are deemed legal.  Therefore, we must be careful about what we do and how we do it.  I am pleased the matter was raised.  Members will display a responsible attitude by adopting an all-party approach, as this issue is above politics.  It is about the welfare of the people.  As Members of Parliament, we have an obligation to do whatever we can to take corrective measures in that regard.</P>

We must stay extremely positive in this regard, as we have come a long way.  There is a huge responsibility on all political parties taking part in the talks.  Peace is precious.  We have achieved so much since the Good Friday Agreement, in particular, and the people were given their voice, both North and South, in a referendum.  The seriousness of the matter was highlighted when the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister arrived at the talks yesterday.  I am sure people around the world said this would not have been possible 20 years ago but, thankfully, it has been brought to the stage it is now at.  The most experienced parliamentarians are leading parties in Northern Ireland and they have given their lives to arriving at a resolution of the issues involved.  We all pray that a positive solution will be reached in the coming days.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, John Paul Phelan and Buttimer called for a debate on special educational needs, the requirements of schools relating to teacher panels and other issues.  I met the Minister for Education and Science last Thursday evening and he is prepared to come to the House not once but twice to address different issues that have been brought to my attention on the Order of Business.  I will try to agree that date in the diary and inform the House later in the week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Norris, Boyle, Wilson, Buttimer, Cummins, Feeney and Glynn referred to an all-party motion on &ldquo;head shops&rdquo;.  I will accept the motion proposed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and, in reply to Senator Norris, will do my utmost to include it in next week&rsquo;s business.  Senator Glynn and I, with the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Curran, attended the national regional drugs task force legal highs conference in the Mullingar Park Hotel this morning.  There was not even standing room available with many young people present representing organisations dealing with the challenges posed by and the scourge of drugs.  Three television crews covered the event, with numerous radio stations.  There was huge interest among the national and regional print media.  We must give the lead.  I congratulate Senator Wilson who brought the issue to my attention a few months ago following difficulties he had experienced with constituents.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State gave his full commitment to address the activities of &ldquo;head shops&rdquo; and substances presented as legal highs.  He stated his concerns about:</P>
        <P LI="1">substances represented as being legal highs and herbal highs centre on the potential health hazards arising from the use of these products and the possibility that their use may act as a gateway to the use of illicit drugs.  I also have serious concern, in the light of the banning of a number of substances and groups of substances in the UK last December, about the possibility of Ireland becoming a dumping ground now for some of these products.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will be in touch with the Minister of State later.  He has been supportive of the House and there will be time in his diary to debate this issue next week when Members on all sides will be able to give him the benefit of their experience.</P>
<Col N="156"/>
        <P>Those who have been associated with the medical profession all their lives have a huge amount to contribute.  It is a serious challenge to the Government.  I do not accept that young people can be offered these substances, even at 4 a.m., having attended night clubs and chippers late at night.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  Parents are being driven to breaking point when their young boys and girls come home at 4.30 a.m. and do not know where they are.  It is as simple and as dangerous as that.  Employers are also concerned, particularly on Monday mornings, about their workforce.  Only a minute element of the workforce are affected but we must nip this problem in the bud and legislate in the strongest terms regarding how these shops can continue under licence.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan raised issues relating to NAMA and the notification by the Government to the European Union regarding the agency on 23 December 2009.  The valuation of properties is ongoing and being discussed at all levels of government and the property market.  The Government, the banks and everyone else concerned with NAMA must be realistic.  No more than a fair price must be set to be paid by the agency which is Government funded and backed and through which we have a massive responsibility to the taxpayer as legislators.  I will do everything I can to update the House from time to time and to have a debate on how the agency is progressing.  I will have no difficulty with such requests from Senators.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Sullivan, Bacik, O&rsquo;Malley and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in congratulated Dublin City Council on the great success of the Dublinbikes campaign.  The availability of bicycles means people can make progress in tough traffic conditions.  It is an innovative scheme and everyone should be congratulated.  It has been an outstanding success and I join colleagues in offering my support.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan for highlighting the scheme in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin referred to the Privacy Bill 2009 which is on the Order Paper to be taken this session.  Last Sunday I read with keen interest the deliberations of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism last week regarding the pain and suffering he and his family had to go through.  As legislators, we have a duty to ensure this carry-on, or conduct, is not allowed to continue.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan called for a debate and an update on incineration.  I have no difficulty allowing time for such a debate and the Minister will be very forthcoming in coming to the House to update it.  Senators Bacik and O&rsquo;Malley referred to the university sector, Peter Sutherland&rsquo;s statement and concerns for university funding in the future.  I have no difficulty arranging for the Minister to come to the House to debate this issue.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan referred to pensions for farmers.  I understand his concerns in this regard but I am reliably informed that 87 people in the farming community were refused the pension about which the Senator inquired.  If the Senator needs further information, I would be only too pleased to help him in making further inquiries in this regard.  Senator John Paul Phelan also raised the issue of doctors&rsquo; payments and doctors making returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not aware of this matter but I will certainly make inquiries.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins raised the fair deal scheme, which has been well received.  It is a help to some families, although not all families will avail of it.  The middle class, in particular, will not become the new poor because a parent must be placed in a nursing home.  The care and attention people get in our nursing homes is of the highest standard.  It is something of which I am very proud when visiting nursing homes from time to time.  I do not want families to be under pressure because their applications have not been considered and decisions have not been made.  I will raise this issue with the Minister after the Order of Business with a strong reference to the situation in the Waterford area which Senator Cummins outlined to the House.</P>
<Col N="157"/>
        <P>I could not agree with Senator Quinn more in regard to the value of Ireland as a brand name.  I refer to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and Irish music and song.  Very few countries can equal the brand name of Ireland and everything for which Ireland stands.</P>
        <P>This side of the House has no intention of taking the three seats from National University of Ireland colleagues.  We will do everything we possibly can to ensure that continues to be the case.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Senator Quinn referred to organ donation.  It is hard to believe the donor card is not more commonplace.  Perhaps some of our Sunday newspapers might promote this card.  Each Sunday we receive promotional literature with our Sunday newspapers.  This is one of the most serious issues and I call on the Sunday newspapers to promote the organ donation card and to try to ensure we have enough organ donors.  When one moves on to one&rsquo;s eternal reward, anything which can be done to assist some man or woman in their fight for survival should be done.  I fully support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s call.  We should also look at the 14-hour training scheme in France for the families and relatives of Alzheimer&rsquo;s sufferers.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for a debate on housing and the challenges facing first-time buyers, in particular.  I have no difficulty arranging for the Minister with responsibility for housing to come to the House.  In fact, he already agreed to come back to update us on his work as Minister with responsibility for housing.  Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in also called for a debate on special needs, in particular those of children.  I could not agree with the Senator more and I have no difficulty arranging a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely outlined a serious issue.  Most rural Oireachtas Members from all political parties were totally opposed to the closure of medical card centres, which were in the old health board areas.  The centre is now in Dublin where one leaves a telephone message.  We have had a race to the bottom but for what?  Is it for the sake of a few cent?  It is not good enough in this day and age and the matter must be revisited.  Senator Callely, who was one of the most successful chairmen of a health board, knows what he is talking about.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to bring the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 before the Seanad and look forward to an informed and constructive debate during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through this House.  As the House knows, matters concerning dog control are governed by the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 to 1992, as amended.  These Acts have in general been working satisfactorily since their enactment but need updating in certain areas.  In the main, these relate to regulation around dog breeding establishments and the general level of the dog licence fee, which has not changed since 1998.</P>
        <P>Following some well publicised incidents of dogs apparently reared in Ireland that were being sold in a poor condition to unsuspecting purchasers, working groups were established to review the management of dog breeding establishments and make recommendations on the matter.  The working group made a number of recommendations, the majority of which I intend <Col N="160"/>to implement through this legislation.  Unfortunately, Ireland got the reputation of being the dog breeding capital of Europe for all the wrong reasons.  I am introducing this legislation to ensure proper standards of animal welfare in these establishments.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s preparation has involved a large amount of ongoing consultation with a variety of interested parties, including Departments, voluntary bodies and dog interest groups.  These have included the Hunting Association of Ireland and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  In addition, more than 650 submissions were made in connection with the report of the working group, the majority of which were in favour of regulation of dog breeding establishments.  I wish to thank all of those who participated in the consultation phase and I am confident that the Bill is stronger for their input.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware that there is a variety of opinion on any issue involving animal welfare and, in particular, on the welfare of dogs.  While most people connect with dogs as a family pet, for others the breeding of these pets is a business.  The Bill seeks to legislate for the point where the two interact.  The variety of opinion generally was reflected in the deliberations of the working group and resulted in one majority report and three minority reports being presented to the Minister.  This complicating factor in itself is part of the reason it has taken a considerable time to bring these legislative proposals before the Houses.  Further consultations were required prior to the decision to draft legislative proposals on the basis of the majority recommendations.  While the intention was to make regulations under the Control of Dogs Acts, legal advice indicated that effective regulation of dog breeding establishments or, indeed, increasing dog licence fees under the Acts was not possible.  Hence the need for revised legislation rather than regulation under the principal Act.  Unfortunately, this has added to the timeline for introducing these legislative proposals.</P>
        <P>While the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has responsibility for animal welfare, my Department has retained responsibility for dog control for the practical reason that the dog control service is operated through the local authorities.  Local authority dog wardens liaise with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&rsquo;s veterinary staff on an ongoing basis.  It is envisaged that this will continue and expand if particular animal welfare issues arise as part of the proposed registration and inspection process for dog breeding establishments.  Senators will also be aware that my colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, are preparing an animal welfare Bill that will deal comprehensively with animal welfare issues.</P>
        <P>In today&rsquo;s debate, I intend to summarise the majority recommendations of the working group on the review of dog breeding establishments and the actions I intend to take in respect of each.</P>
        <P>The basis for regulation of dog breeding establishments is as follows.  The group recommended that a State-regulated registration system for dog breeding establishments be put in place and that these regulations be enforced through the existing local authority dog control structures.  The group also recommended that the regulations should include a comprehensive set of statutorily enforceable standards for the operation of dog breeding establishments and provision for inspections by local authority officers.</P>
        <P>This recommendation comprises a number of separate issues.  We can all agree that a regulation system should be put in place, if only for simple reasons concerning dog welfare and this country&rsquo;s reputation in respect of care of dogs.  It is only proper that, in a modern caring society, legal remedies are in place to deal with a minority of breeding establishments that rear pups in appalling conditions and sell malnourished and ill pups to an unsuspecting public.  I am heartened that the Hunting Association of Ireland and the Irish Greyhound Board have both agreed with the need for such regulation.</P>
<Col N="161"/>
        <P>I concluded also that regulation should be through the local authorities, the dog control staff of which have built up a considerable level of experience in dealing with dog control issues.  They have a knowledge of existing dog breeding establishments, albeit without the powers to regulate such premises up until now.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for inspection of dog breeding establishments where necessary.  I want the Bill to form the basis of a co-operative relationship between the local authorities and well run dog breeding establishments.  Its provisions will not hold any fear for those who run their establishments well and who have established quality premises and practices in co-operation with their local veterinary practices.</P>
        <P>In terms of this relationship, local authorities will be required to inform a dog breeding establishment of the grounds on which they would refuse to register a premises.  The local authority will be statutorily obliged to pay heed to any reply from the establishment in regard to a potential refusal or conditions attached to a registration certificate.  This will encourage a co-operative relationship between the local authority and dog breeders in their administrative areas.</P>
        <P>The working group recommended that dog breeding establishments be defined based on the number of bitches with breeding potential present on the premises.  I propose that the legislation will define a dog breeding establishment as a premises at which are kept no fewer than six bitches, each of which is more than four months old and capable of being used for breeding purposes.  The limit of not fewer than six bitches will exclude the vast majority of cases where people rear dogs as pets.  While there might be instances on farms, for example, where the number of bitches might exceed six, the stipulation that they must be capable of breeding will ensure that retired animals, so long as they are sterilised, could be excluded from the count.  Bitches under four months of age would also be excluded.</P>
        <P>The group recommended that the new regulatory regime be self-financing and be funded by varying the existing general dog licence fee.  I propose that the cost of regulation and inspection of these establishments will not fall on the general population, but will be borne by the dog breeding establishments through a registration fee.  This fee will vary in accordance with the amount of breeding bitches so as to reflect the size and scale of the operation.  To that end the appropriate fee bands will be as follows.  For a dog breeding establishment at which not more than 12 bitches are kept, the fee is &euro;400; for an establishment with 13 to 25 bitches, the fee is &euro;800; for an establishment with 26 to 100 bitches, the fee is &euro;1,600; and for an establishment with 101 to 200 bitches it is &euro;3,000, with a further &euro;1,600 for every 100 bitches thereafter.</P>
        <P>The fee will be payable to the local authority and the moneys raised are intended to cover the costs of regulation and inspection.  Any balance will go towards dog control services in general which, in the current climate, are hard-pressed to keep up with the demands being placed on them.  I pay tribute to the many dog control staff who work tirelessly to rehome strays, pick up abandoned dogs and keep residential areas and farms free from uncontrolled dogs.  It can be a thankless job and should be acknowledged.  I am confident the measures in this Bill will be welcomed by the dog control service and will assist them greatly in performing their duties.</P>
        <P>I do not consider the fees to be excessive when set against the potential income stream from the number of breeding bitches.  For instance, a premises with 12 breeding bitches might conservatively be expected to produce one litter of five pups each, resulting in 60 pups in total.  At a conservative estimate of the value of a premium pup at &euro;500, the estimated income from the sale of 60 pups would be &euro;30,000.  The proposed registration fee of &euro;400 for the puppy farm of 12 bitches would equate to a cost of only &euro;6 per pup.  This is in no way unreasonable when we consider that some pedigree pups command prices of &euro;1,000 or more.</P>
<Col N="162"/>
        <P>Dog breeding establishments appear to specialise in lines of breeds commanding premium prices and like any business they try to minimise their costs and charge what the market will bear.  On the basis of the fees above I do not think their bottom line will be significantly altered.  There will also continue to be the option of adopting a dog from a shelter or charities at minimal or no cost, as at present.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to urge people to be responsible about purchasing a dog and to make sure they know the source.  They should follow the ISPCA guidelines regarding care of pets and be aware of the potential costs.  The ISPCA also advises new owners to bear in mind the financial implications of owning a dog, such as vaccinations, flea and worm treatments and veterinary expenses such as nail cutting and teeth cleaning, which mount up over a period.  The cost of boarding kennels while away on holidays should also be considered.  Of course, the costs associated with ownership and care of a dog often pale into insignificance when set beside the immeasurable benefit, joy and even health gains to be had from the companionship of a dog.</P>
        <P>The working group recommended that all dogs kept in breeding establishments, including their offspring, be electronically microchipped to ensure traceability and assist in the enforcement of the registration system.  As such, it is a requirement of the proposed legislation that each dog in a dog breeding establishment be microchipped.  This provision only builds on existing practice, whereby any dog that is registered with a dog breeders&rsquo; association or a breed association is generally microchipped for the purpose of registration and verifying bloodlines.  There are a number of companies that provide microchipping services at present.  The microchip is about the size of a grain of rice and implanted under the skin of a dog around the neck.  The microchip can be read by scanners held at veterinary offices or by dog control staff and assist in reuniting a dog with its owners.</P>
        <P>It was further recommended by the group that every dog owner and every dog breeder has a duty of care in respect of animals kept by them and that this should be enshrined in all animal welfare legislation.  As I stated previously, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is preparing an animal welfare Bill.  I am informed that the Bill will contain a duty of care provision.  I therefore do not wish to pre-empt any such general provision in that Bill.</P>
        <P>The group concluded that the new dog breeding registration system should be introduced on a phased basis using an improvement notice model to avoid the creation of a surplus of dogs caused by the closure of substandard dog breeding establishments.  This lead-in time will allow dog breeding establishments to meet the necessary standards and avoid the problem of having to dispose of a number of unwanted dogs.  Any premises, where inspectors encounter serious animal welfare issues or have no reasonable prospect of meeting the registration standards should, however, be closed immediately.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to provide for as smooth a transition as possible.  The Bill provides that a period of up to three months will be provided from the commencement of the Act for dog breeding establishments to be registered.  It shall be lawful for an existing dog breeding establishment to continue to operate for this period.  This will enable a smooth transition to full registration and will ensure against a significant number of dogs being disposed of by establishments which may choose to cease operating.</P>
        <P>The reassurance provided by the Hunting Association of Ireland and other interests in their representations to me, leads me to believe that most dog breeding establishments already operate to high-quality voluntary guidelines and standards.  It should not, therefore, be a major concern for well-run dog breeding establishments to meet any new mandatory guidelines.</P>
        <P>In line with best practice in any regulatory regime, there is an appropriate scale of regulatory actions which can be taken to gain compliance.  In this Bill, I envisage liaison between the local <Col N="163"/>authority and the dog breeding establishment.  If agreement is not reached between the local authority and the establishment, the local authority, under section 18, will be empowered to issue an improvement notice.  The notice will state the specific measures to be taken within a specified timeframe.  This is in line with the recommendations of the working group.</P>
        <P>The working group also stressed that the provisions of the Bill be meaningful, relevant and implementable.  As a logical next step to the improvement notice, the Bill provides authority to a local authority to close a premises where standards present a significant health risk.  It is envisaged that such a closure notice under section 19 of the Bill would only be used where there was a significant and immediate threat to public health.  Such a provision will provide reassurance to the public that quick action can be taken in response to any threat to public health from dog breeding establishments.</P>
        <P>Other provisions are included in the draft Bill to ensure the correct and appropriate functioning of the regulatory regime for dog breeding establishments.  It is important that provision is made for an appeals mechanism where conditions to a registration are imposed.  Each successful applicant will receive a registration certificate after submitting the appropriate fee and completing an application form.  The Bill provides that where the local authority proposes to impose conditions on the issue of a registration certificate, it shall notify the applicant of said conditions and consider the applicant&rsquo;s response.  Furthermore, the applicant will be able to appeal the decision of the local authority to the relevant District Court.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Bill allows me, as Minister, to set down mandatory criteria relating to minimum standards of dog breeding establishments by way of regulation.  In order for successful implementation and acceptance of the proposed regulations, full consultation with interested parties is essential.  The strong views of interested parties in this area are evidenced by the large number of individual submissions received by my Department at the consultation phase on the working group report.  I wish to assure the Seanad that I will only sign the proposed regulations into law after full consultation with all interested parties.</P>
        <P>A provision is necessary to require owners of establishments to co-operate, within reason, with dog wardens.  There is general need for such a provision and it is particularly important in cases where an establishment operates from the private home of the owner.  The draft Bill makes provision, in circumstances where consent of the occupier to enter a dwelling is not forthcoming, for the authorised person to apply to the District Court for a warrant to enter.</P>
        <P>The definition of authorised person has also been broadened in the draft Bill to allow others to assist the dog wardens in their duties.  For example, a dog warden may require to be accompanied by other officials from the local authority, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or veterinary experts in carrying out duties.</P>
        <P>The current dog licence fee of &euro;12.70 for a single licence and &euro;254 for a general dog licence was set down in the Control of Dogs (Amendment) Act 1992 and activated in February 1999 under the Control of Dogs (Commencement) Regulations 1998.  Licences are generally issued through An Post, which has increased its administrative charge to &euro;3.50 per licence, with the remaining &euro;9.20 accruing to the local authority.  The income from licences is required by local authorities to offset the costs of the provision and maintenance of their dog control services.  In most cases the local authority subsidises the service, in some instances to a significant degree, and this is not sustainable.  It is considered that a dog licence fee of &euro;20 would not place an undue burden on dog owners when set against the other costs of responsible dog ownership, such as veterinary costs and food.  The &euro;20 fee only reflects the rise over the years of the consumer price index to September 2009, notwithstanding the recent falls in the CPI.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will briefly run through the main provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1 to 5, inclusive, of Part 1 contain the usual provisions of a general nature dealing with such matters as Short Title, collec<Col N="164"/>tive citations and commencement, definitions, regulations, expenses of the Minister and service of documents.  The key definition is that a dog breeding establishment will be a premises at which are kept not less than six bitches, each of which is more than four months old and capable of being used for breeding purposes.  This definition reflects that recommended in the working group report.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides for fines not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment up to six months on summary conviction for certain offences, including providing false information, non-display of registration certificate or obstruction of authorised personnel.  The same penalties can be applied on summary conviction for forgery and contravening a closure order for a dog breeding establishment. Increased penalties can be applied on indictment.  Fines shall be paid to the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides that a fixed notice fine can be issued for non-display of a registration certificate for up to &euro;2,000, which will fall due within 21 days.  Moneys so raised will be payable to the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>Part 2 contains sections 8 to 21, inclusive, which deal with the regulation of dog breeding establishments.  Section 8 instructs local authorities to have a register of dog breeding establishments and requires operators of such establishments to register in the manner required and to pay an annual fee.  Section 8(3) provides that existing dog breeding establishments can continue to operate for three months after the commencement of the Act.  Under Section 8(6), a local authority shall not register a premises if the application is not in order, the applicant is in breach of the Act or if the local authority is of the opinion that the premises is not suitable for the operation of a dog breeding establishment.  Each premises which receives a registration certificate must have that certificate prominently displayed, under section 8(12).  Under section 8(18), hunt clubs, commercial boarding kennels and charitable dog operations such as mountain rescue, will be exempt from paying fees, but must register and be subject to possible inspection.  Commercial boarding kennels will also be exempt from paying registration fees.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides 14 days for applicants to make representation against a local authority&rsquo;s intention to refuse registration.  This section also provides that a local authority will notify each applicant whether it is to be registered or not.  Section 10 sets out the circumstances whereby an applicant may appeal the decision of the local authority to the relevant District Court against a refusal to register the dog breeding establishment or conditions that the local authority has set for registration.  In the case of a refusal, the District Court can order that the establishment be registered, set conditions for registration or affirm the refusal.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides for removal of dog breeding establishments from the register by order of the District Court and conditions which the District Court may impose.  Reasons for removing an establishment from the register include where the operator has been convicted of cruelty to animals, has been convicted of an offence under this Act or the Control of Dogs Act 1986, or has breached an improvement order or a court order.  A person who contravenes an order under this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
        <P>Section 12 sets out the appropriate fees for a dog breeding establishment and provides that the Minister may, by regulation, vary these charges in line with the consumer price index.  Section 13 sets the registration charges as an annual charge payable to the relevant local authority and provides that certain types of dog breeding establishments shall not have registration charges applied, including hunt clubs, charitable organisations and commercial boarding kennels.</P>
        <P>Section 14 describes, in general terms, the duties of operators in respect of the conditions in dog breeding establishments.  Records must be kept and be available for inspection.  Section <Col N="165"/>14(5) provides for the Minister to invite representations on draft guidelines, consider representations received and publish guidelines for dog breeding establishments.</P>
        <P>Section 15 provides for all dogs in a dog breeding establishment to be micro-chipped for updating of the database, and for the micro-chipping to be carried out by an authorised implanter.  Section 16 allows a local authority to appoint certain persons, including veterinary practitioners and those connected with animal welfare, to act as authorised persons to assist the local authorities in their duties under the Act.  Section 17 enumerates the powers of authorised persons, including the power to enter and inspect any premises, other than a dwelling, suspected of being a dog breeding establishment.  The authorised person can inspect and take copies of records kept on the premises and can require the owner, operator or those employed in the establishment to answer relevant questions.  Section 17(2) provides that an authorised person may be accompanied by other authorised persons or the Garda.  It will be an offence to obstruct or refuse to comply with the authorised persons under section 17.  An authorised person cannot enter a dwelling without the consent of the occupier, or failing consent, without a warrant issued by the District Court.</P>
        <P>Section 18 provides for the local authority to serve an improvement notice on the establishment if it is believed to be in breach of the Act or there is a threat to public health or animal welfare.  The improvement notice will contain details of specific measures which are required to be taken within a specified timeframe and will inform the operator of the option to appeal to the District Court.  Section 18(4) provides that notice may be appealed to the District Court.</P>
        <P>Section 19 provides for a local authority to issue a closure notice requiring a dog breeding establishment to cease breeding or keeping dogs at the establishment on the basis of stated grounds.  Provision is made for appeal to the District Court which shall affirm the notice, revoke it or give direction to the establishment.  It will be an offence to contravene a closure notice.  Section 20 makes it an offence to operate an unregistered dog breeding establishment except in specified circumstances where there is an application submitted or where it is subject to appeal.</P>
        <P>Section 21 makes it an offence to forge registration material or knowingly provide forged documentation or alter registration material with intent to defraud or deceive.</P>
        <P>Part 3 contains a number of amendments to the Control of Dogs Act 1986.  Section 22 provides for the addition of a new form of dog licence to cover the lifetime of a dog by varying the duration of the dog licence.  Section 23 sets out the new licence fees at &euro;20 for an individual dog licence, &euro;400 for a general dog licence for numerous dogs and &euro;140 for a licence for the lifetime of a dog.  This section also allows the Minister to vary fees payable in line with the consumer price index.  Section 24 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a database or databases and the information to be held therein.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Bill in respect of dog breeding establishments will be cost neutral to the Exchequer.  The provisions for increasing the dog licence fees will only reduce the current loss that local authorities incur in providing a dog control service.  The new charges for licence fees would raise an estimated &euro;4.3 million compared with the &euro;2.8 million raised in 2008.  However, the cost of the service in 2008 was &euro;5.7 million</P>
        <P>I look forward to engaging on these provisions and on Government and Opposition amendments on Committee Stage.  I am sure these will be constructive and helpful.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for enlightening us on the main provisions of the Bill and why he is bringing it before the House.  Fine Gael welcomes the opportunity to contribute to this Bill.  Fine Gael is supportive of this Bill in principle and recognises the great need to improve and regulate dog breeding establishments and the management of dog breed<Col N="166"/>ing in this country.  We have all seen disgusting images of illegal puppy farming and the appalling environment these pups are raised in.  Some people have been convicted over recent years.  I am sure the Minister agrees these instances are in the minority and that the majority of people involved in dog breeding in this country are very responsible.  Whether for commercial gain or otherwise, the reason they are breeding dogs means it is incumbent on them to care properly for dogs in the first instance.  Notwithstanding that, Fine Gael agrees that proper standards are needed in this area.  This Bill goes a long way to addressing the concerns that are raised.  However, Fine Gael has some concerns about certain elements of the Bill and will table amendments on Committee and Report Stages to address these concerns.  I hope the Minister will listen with an open ear and take our concerns on board.</P>
        <P>When we talk about regulation I can easily throw in a quip.  If regulation was working, why did it not work with the banking sector?  We can see how the economy has been destroyed because regulation did not work.  I understand the Minister has principles in regard to this area and he has good intentions that the regulations will work.  Regulations should be used to improve standards, not as a tax gathering exercise.  I hope that is not the intention.  Regulations should not be used to put responsible people out of business.  We must have regulation but we must have reasonable systems in place.  The Minister referred to systems of appeal and systems of improvement to give people a reasonable opportunity to improve their circumstances.  Regulation should not be used for the wrong reasons.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to broad consultation on this Bill taking place.  I understand a working group was established in 2005 which subsequently made recommendations to the Department.  Many of these recommendations are included in the Bill.  However, many of the stakeholders in the industry of dog rearing, dog breeding and dog use have concerns.  They feel they have been excluded from much of the consultation.  It is important that this is on the record at an early stage of the debate on the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the hunting associations.  This Bill concerns dog breeding establishments and it can be argued legitimately that those involved in field sports or the utilisation of dogs for sporting activities, whether foot harriers or hunting associations, are not breeding establishments, yet they are classified as such under this legislation.  There is a clear demarcation that should be understood by everyone.  That should be on the public record at the outset.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is also about animal welfare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, and I argue that anyone involved with working dogs or hunting dogs looks after animal welfare better than most people understand.  The Minister needs to understand this point.  The dogs are in their prime and are reared, primed, fed and cared for better than most family pets in many instances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, there should be no problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should acknowledge this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem I have is that the Minister said he consulted widely on this Bill.  From the information available to this side of the House, it does not seem to be the case.  The Minister formed a working group representing many organisations, but many organisations were missing from the group.  They would have been interested in consulting at an early stage and giving their view.  The Minister referred to not signing the Bill into law until <Col N="167"/>he has consulted.  Why did the Minister not consult these agencies and people before drafting the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister did not.  That is incorrect.  The Minister did not consult many organisations and some were told the Bill would not apply to them and that there was no need for consultation.  Subsequently, for some reason, whether the Minister was influenced by voluntary organisations or otherwise, he changed his view and shifted the goalposts.  The working group had made its recommendations by then.  I hear the Minister is proposing to meet these groups next Friday when the Bill is going through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister can clarify or confirm this in his own time.  To say that the Minister has widely consulted with stakeholders is incorrect.  He has consulted them but he has done so in a biased fashion.  That is not the way good legislation should be framed or adopted.  If the Minister requires support across all sectors, he should hold early consultation and get buy-in from all stakeholders so that they will have trust in the system imposed and he will have a good working system.  If the Minister introduces distrust and cynicism, obviously this will create barriers before he starts and that is not a good road to go down.  I say this to inform the debate because this is how we should proceed with legislation.</P>
        <P>I have a copy of a letter from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on 15 February 2008.  The Minister says that given the primary objectives of the proposed regulations are to regulate commercial dog breeding and in view of the strict standards that apply to the Hunting Association of Ireland, it is his intention that groups affiliated to the Hunting Association of Ireland be granted an exemption from the requirements of the regulations.  The Minister says they are exempt in his letter but in the Bill they are exempt from the registration fee but not from the requirements of the regulation.  Something does not fit.  The Minister said one thing in February 2008 but he is saying something different now.  There are mixed messages and for good law we need clarity.  I hope the Minister will clarify this matter for the House and for the people.  It seems to be at odds with the content of the legislation.</P>
        <P>Many organisations, such as hunting associations, already have strict policing guidelines.  The Minister acknowledged this in his speech.  They have management systems that work quite well.  We need to work with these organisations to get buy-in for new systems we hope to introduce.  We should not introduce so much legislation and regulation that we drive puppy breeding underground because then we would be left with a more ridiculous system whereby those who can afford it would be regulated, with properly run systems, but there would also be an underground system.  We must be careful to ensure this is not allowed to expand in any way.  Departmental officials should take this into account.  It is all about trying to strike a balance so that all stakeholders can work with, support and fully understand the system.  It should not be too restrictive and should not put people underground or out of business.</P>
        <P>This area is very important in respect of rural enterprise.  There is a business but I am not saying it should be at the expense of animal welfare.  Dogs should be treated properly and humanely and that is the intention of the Bill.  I am highlighting concerns that need to be addressed although the Minister may think I am being negative.  I am not; I am trying to help the Minister understand the impact this Bill will have on stakeholders.</P>
        <P>I have spoken at length on the regulation and registration side of this Bill.  It is important to keep a proper database and proper information for those in authority.  Fine Gael has some concerns and wants clarity on some parts of the Bill.</P>
<Col N="168"/>
        <P>I refer to section 16, which permits a local authority to appoint certain persons, including veterinary practitioners and persons connected with animal welfare, to act as authorised persons in assisting it in its duties under the Bill.  That definition needs clarification.  I do not have a problem with veterinary or Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food inspectors but this definition could allow anyone with a connection to animal welfare to enter an establishment.  I ask Fianna F&aacute;il Members to seek clarity on the provision.</P>
        <P>I do not object to the increase in the dog licence fee, which has not kept pace with the cost to local authorities of providing dog control systems.  The dividend to An Post has increased substantially from &euro;1.52 to &euro;3.50.  I do not know if such a large slice of the licence fee was negotiated with local authorities, which are now obliged to operate their systems with less money.  Dog licences can be purchased at any post office and from certain local authorities.  It is important that they are easily purchased.  Perhaps the Minister would consider an on-line registration system for licences to facilitate people in purchasing them.  It is obvious that thousands of dogs in this country are unlicensed.  I hope the Bill goes some way towards addressing that deficit.</P>
        <P>Local authority dog services are struggling to cope with a shortage of resources.  Standards in dog pounds and services across the country are inconsistent.  I hope the increased income from dog licences provides the resources to develop adequate facilities and proper animal welfare systems.  If local authorities lack the facilities to house abandoned and neglected dogs, who else will care for them?</P>
        <P>The dog control statistics for 2008 revealed that 34 local authorities employed 44 full-time and 26.5 part-time dog wardens to enforce dog control legislation.  It is clear that the service is not overstaffed by any means and the majority of local authorities can only employ one warden to run a skeleton or emergency service.  This Bill will increase wardens&rsquo; workload but the Minister intends to ensure the new provisions are cost neutral by means of raising sufficient funds through registration and licences.  It will be interesting to see the impact on local authorities, which are already stretched to the limit by the embargo on recruitment.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will be tabling amendments and if the Bill is to garner wide support it will be important that the Minister takes our advice.  It is disappointing that people felt excluded from the initial consultations.  I understand he has offered to meet several organisations next Friday but I do not know what such a meeting will achieve.  It would have been preferable to enter into consultations at a much earlier stage.  I referred earlier to the letter in which he referred to kennels and dog breeding establishments.  The goalposts have moved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that but nevertheless they are not exempt from the implications of this legislation.  In the interest of stakeholder buy-in, it is important the Minister addresses this concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I welcome this Bill, which is long overdue, although I also have a number of concerns about it.  I support the increase in licence fees as long as they will be used by local authorities to improve the welfare of dogs.</P>
        <P>I have read several horrific reports about puppy farms in this country and across the water.  Dogs were kept in unspeakable conditions and subjected to absolute cruelty.  I do not know how a human being could treat dogs in such a manner.  It is sadism at its worst.</P>
        <P>Dogs contribute greatly to a broad section of the community, not least as valued companions to the elderly, the handicapped, the blind and the isolated.  They provide security by alerting <Col N="169"/>their owners to intruders in the dead of night.  I am proud to own two dogs, for which I purchased licences yesterday.  I consider the fee of &euro;12.40 to be minuscule.  If we are to provide a proper dog welfare service, local authorities will need more money than that.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that members of the ISPCA and dog wardens will have the back-up of local authority officers and the Garda.  A member of my family who is involved with the ISPCA was threatened by certain people.  Senator Coffey referred to powers of entry.  I agree that privacy must be maintained but we must also consider animal welfare.  The legislation must ensure those who are charged with the welfare of dogs can gain entry to premises when necessary.  In the normal course of events privacy would have to be maintained.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey referred to the Hunting Association of Ireland.  In a communication to my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated that this association would be exempt under the requirements of the regulations.  I hope this will be the case.  The association runs a fine show and if it were otherwise, I would say so and would not apologise to anyone for so doing.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Irish Coursing Club.  I come from Killucan, a famous area for greyhound owners and breeders and coursing.  Was there consultation with the club and the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation?  From what I know of them, these associations run a very tight ship and their views would be valuable.  I refer to a letter from the Irish Coursing Club which reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">The ICC operates a register of all matings, litters born, adult greyhound names and transfer of ownerships.</P>
        <P LI="1">4. All Stud Dogs and Brood Bitches are DNA profiled.</P>
        <P LI="1">5. All greyhounds are tattooed earmarked for identification purposes.</P>
        <P LI="1">6. All litters are inspected and tattoo marked by Control Stewards jointly appointed by the ICC &amp; IGB.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I acknowledge the sincerity of the Minister and Members and welcome the comments of Senator Coffey that Fine Gael is broadly supportive of this very important Bill.  However, we must be cognisant of all its terms.  I am confident that the Minister will be open to reasoned argument pertaining to amendments and, if required, that he will bring forward Government amendments but I do not wish to pre-empt what he will do in this regard.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge this country has been known as the puppy capital of Europe.  Many of us will be aware that at least 1,000 puppies a week are exported from the Republic and that the North has proved to be a very lucrative entry point into the United Kingdom for traffickers from the Republic.  This is not something of which we should be proud.</P>
        <P>The legislation proposes that all dog breeding establishments be required to register with the relevant local authority, pay a registration fee and meet a minimum set of veterinary, welfare and other standards.  A dog breeding establishment is defined in the Bill which provides that existing establishments can continue to operate for three months after the commencement of the Bill.  The significant rise in the number of puppy farms in Ireland highlights just how lucrative a business it has become.  In order for this legislation to be taken seriously, the fines must be imposed and collected, otherwise we will not do justice to the dogs who are dumb animals and cannot speak for themselves.  As a result of submissions made to the Minister by the Hunting Association of Ireland and in recognition of the not for profit basis of its activities, an exemption has been granted in respect of the payment of its registration fees, as referred to by both Senator Coffey and me.</P>
<Col N="170"/>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the increase in the cost of individual dog licences.  I am astounded to hear that hard strapped local authorities incur costs of &euro;5.7 million in the collection of dog licence fees but that they only receive a total of &euro;2.8 million.  Many local authorities, including Westmeath County Council and Athlone Town Council, could badly do with a portion of the shortfall moneys.  This is not acceptable and I am glad the matter has been addressed in the Bill.  The increase in the licence fee will certainly help offset the cost to local authorities in providing dog control services and ensure puppy farmers will abide by the legislation.</P>
        <P>It is welcome that the Bill has been introduced following significant consultations with interested parties.  I urge that any interested party who has been overlooked be consulted prior to Committee Stage.  Once the Bill has been passed into law, regulations will be introduced setting out the detailed criteria to be met by these establishments.  Once again, the regulations will be subject to consultation with the various interest groups involved.  I urge the Minister to consider recommendations made by any other interested individual or group.  The Bill will complement the animal health and welfare Bill being prepared by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith.</P>
        <P>I ask for the indulgence of the House to digress from the subject of the Bill to refer to the welfare of horses.  The recession has led to an increase in the incidence of dumping of animals, particularly horses.  According to officers of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, they are now picking up as many horses as dogs.  Yesterday it was reported in the media that the ISPCA had been flooded with calls about abandoned and unwanted horses.  The recession and the recent bad weather conditions have led to an unprecedented number of cases of abandonment.  The number of calls relating to horses rose from a figure of 9% to 52% at the end of 2009.  This is not a very pleasant statistic.  The ISPCA equine rescue centre in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath is almost at capacity, with the problem sky-rocketing in recent months.  We are facing a crisis of abandoned, starving and neglected animals, including horses, dogs and cats.  When children ask for a dog or cat from Santa Claus at Christmastime, it should be borne in mind by the parents that they and the child must be in a position to appreciate their responsibility to look after a pet.  If one cannot look after a dog, cat, horse or pony, one should not acquire it.  It seems many animal lovers simply cannot afford to buy expensive feed for their animals.</P>
        <P>The Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 is important legislation that will improve inspection, accountability and traceability in dog breeding.  It is an important first step in bringing our laws on animal welfare into line with international standards.  This is long awaited legislation but it is never too late to do the right thing.  I am glad it has been welcomed by animal welfare groups and Members on the other side of the House.  It is hoped it will put an end to the activities of backstreet dog breeders and will instead benefit commercial breeders who do a good job, treat their animals humanely and must be supported.  This legislation must be considered as supporting those who take seriously the job of keeping, breeding and rearing animals.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides the necessary powers for the relevant authorities &mdash; I am glad this means the local authorities &mdash; and agencies to take action allowing for entry and inspection of dog breeding establishments.  Some years ago I spoke to a dog warden who had been threatened when he went to carry out his duties on behalf of the ISPCA.  This is the type of entity with which one is dealing.  The gloves will have to come off in dealing with them.  The legislation is about the welfare of dogs.  We are not concerned about the bulging purses of the backstreet breeders.  We must remember that we are talking about a consumer-driven industry.  We have seen increased demand for designer dogs in recent years.  Given the constant reports in newspapers of animal neglect, we can no longer claim ignorance of inhumane puppy farms.  The <Col N="171"/>legislation will ensure each breeding establishment prominently displays its registration certificate.  It is up to us as consumers to ensure we buy from a reputable, registered dog breeder.  It is the very same as buying something off the side of the road that has had the registration number removed.  One is supporting thieves when one buys dogs from illicit dog breeders in the back streets of our cities, towns and villages.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is important that the Minister introduces legislation in this area.  I hope he will listen to the arguments made.  Some aspects of the matter addressed by the Bill, and related areas, are quite controversial.  There is consensus in the house on puppy farms.  How horrible a concept it is and how sickening it is to see what we saw on the television.  However, there are also other forms of animal cruelty.  It is worthwhile recognising that even the best willed intention on the implementation of the legislation would not get over the difficulty the BBC had when it refused to broadcast Crufts for the simple reason that it believed that the breeding of dogs for show purposes can be as bad for the breed as anything else.  We have seen that certain breeds of dog such as King Charles spaniels suffer from weak hearts due to generations of in-breeding as lap-dogs that are not allowed to exercise.  One can do the same with almost every single breed of dog.  I do not expect the Minister to introduce legislation to deal with that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I make the case because there are issues we need to discuss.  The Minister might take exception to it, but it bothers me in terms of this issue that there is a dismantling of the culture of rural Ireland in the context of hunting and other areas.  That is unacceptable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There is something wrong when the leafy suburbs of the city begin to write and implement the laws for the meadows, mountains and stony soil of rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have put this to the Minister previously.  I welcome the fact that he has involved the local authorities but he should operate according to the philosophy of the Green Party, namely, to devolve authority down as far as possible.  Hunting and aspects of this legislation should be decided upon by local authorities.  It is not the business of Government to make such decisions.  Stag hunting or other types of hunting should be dealt with by the appropriate local authority.  Let the people decide.  We should do this within the drafting of general policy.  In a sense we are turning out the lights in rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Minister should let me give an example.  I have nothing to do with hunting but I have lived in a hunting area for the past 35 years.  I do not hunt myself.  The Minister has heard me say this previously.  In those 35 years of watching stag hunting or being aware of it happening in the vicinity, whatever number of hunts per year multiplied by 35 or 36 years, only two stags <Col N="172"/>were ever put down.  One was hit by a car and the other ran into a farmer&rsquo;s yard and he shot him.  I do not think those elderly men on broad-backed horses ever get close enough to a stag to cause him any difficulty whatever.  I do not agree with the concept of stress on the stag.  I do not believe it is an issue of such importance to divide society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This has nothing to do with stag hunting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Stags are very different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister was present I felt I should make the point.  It is the classic example of getting my reaction in first because I believe the Minister is working on something else behind the scenes.</P>
        <P>There is no question of the licence fee paying for the cost of what is proposed.  One can work it out.  I did the sums a while ago.  I worked it out according to the minimum wage and how many people one could employ in a local authority.  The dog breeders&rsquo; associations recommendation of 2004 or 2005 was that each establishment would have to present or produce certain clearances signed by a vet, which would be sent to the Department.  From the way the legislation is drafted, it seems that one could not give this additional function to dog wardens, that one has to appoint specific people.  That is nonsense because one will not be able to pay them.</P>
        <P>If the Minister wants to diminish the importance of the legislation, this Bill follows in a great line of previous legislation.  I was present approximately 20 years ago when the dog muzzling legislation was introduced by P&aacute;draig Flynn.  I was present approximately 15 years ago, as was my colleague, Senator Norris, when the then Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, introduced the wandering horses legislation.  Those Bills were never implemented.  Some parts of this Bill will not be implemented either if we do not get it right.</P>
        <P>I say with some certainty that there is no justification for not excluding the hunts and the hunt kennels from the provisions of the Bill.  It is beyond contradiction that regardless of people&rsquo;s views about hunting or shooting, there would not be a pheasant in north Dublin or east Meath without the game associations.  They look after their dogs themselves.  I have no doubt whatever about that.  In fairness, the Minister should consider that they would follow the rules of the hunt association.</P>
        <P>I detect an error in section 15 re the microchip.  &ldquo;The operator of a dog breeding establishment shall cause a microchip to be implanted in each dog kept at that establishment.&rdquo;  This is a Bill, which is mainly aimed at bitches.  I do not know what is meant by &ldquo;dog&rdquo; in this situation but I suspect it is a flaw in the Bill.  If the Minister intends bitches then he should specify that.  That is obviously what is intended.  It could lead to the Bill being ridiculed.</P>
        <P>In section 2 where the Minister has a definition of a dog breeding establishment as &ldquo;a premises at which bitches are kept, not less than 6 of which ... but shall not include a local authority dog pound&rdquo;, he should include &ldquo;or a hunt club&rdquo;.  A hunt club is then defined in the very next section.  It is just a matter of making that small change.  We need to do that.</P>
        <P>The best way to ensure the legislation will work is to get the people working in the area involved.  There is a view that people who hunt are cruel to animals.  In fact, they love their animals.  I know that is a contradiction to people who live in the city and do not understand it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

To do that, let us get all of rural Ireland, namely, hunt groups, game associations and others behind it.</P>

	<P>What are they afraid of?  What is their problem?  I do not understand it.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that they look after their dogs. They look after their dogs well; therefore, what are they worrying about?  They should be subject to every regulation, like everybody else.  If the DSPCA is subject to inspection and brought within the terms of this legislation, what is so bloody special about the hunts?  The days of the landed aristocracy are gone.</P>

	<P>Since the Senator brought up the issue of hunting and all the rest, I accept that it is a wonderful pageant.  My mother adored the hunt.  My uncle retired to Rutland, principally because he was surrounded by the Quorn, the Pytchley, the Belvoir and the Cottesmore.  I have seen it and listened to talk of the bell-mouthed hounds.  I can understand there is an argument in terms of fox hunting, perhaps, that a cull in the natural way is more decent than gassing or shooting them, that it is a tradition and so on and so forth.</P>

	<P>However, I know of no animal that stands by and takes pleasure in the destruction of another animal.  That is a pleasure reserved for human beings.  I never understood this.  I heard a Member on the Government side attempt to defend the obscenity of coursing, which is indefensible.  To see a small, poor frightened animal torn to flitters by the fangs of a dog&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I rarely agree with theologians of the Roman Catholic Church.  However, I was a great friend of the late Tony Gregory.  To his eternal credit, he introduced a Bill on hare coursing which the Government was too gutless to accept.  I fed him a quotation from St. Thomas More which read:</P>
        <P LI="1">Thou shouldst rather be moved with pity to see a silly innocent hare murdered of a dog, the weak of the stronger, the fearful of the fierce, the innocent of the cruel and unmerciful.  Therefore, all this exercise of hunting is a thing unworthy to be used of free men.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>What has this to do with the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the speaker to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Bill, I support the Minister.  I can understand there may be some confusion and have asked the Minister to explain why he appeared to give certain undertakings and then changed his mind.  It is a prerogative of anybody to change his or her mind.  Perhaps it means he or she is acting on superior information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps he was influenced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a relevant question to be asked.  I see no difficulty with the fees for the dog breeding establishments.</P>
        <P>This country is known as the puppy farm capital of Europe, of which we should be utterly ashamed.  The conditions in which the unfortunate animals are kept are appalling.  We also have dog fights taking place all over the country.</P>
        <P>I was lobbied hard on the Bill.  Given my constituency, I am, as I speak, shedding votes all over the place, but I do not give a damn.  I will say what I think and what I believe is the truth.  Greyhound establishments claim to be another special interest and are whinging.  We all know that greyhounds are badly treated and that very often, when they finish their racing lives, they are disposed of in the most callous and disgusting way.  Therefore, I very much welcome the legislation which is reasonable.  It does not deal with hunting, another day&rsquo;s work, in which regard we will have something to say.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated: &ldquo;The limit of not fewer than six bitches will exclude the vast majority of cases where people rear dogs as pets.&rdquo;  First, what kind of eccentric would want six bitches in a house?  Second, when they have more than this, they usually mistreat the dogs and often use them for breeding purposes.  I assume the word &ldquo;dog&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;bitch&rdquo;, is being used as a generic term and that it indicates the species, not the particular animal.  Some who are <Col N="175"/>unused to the ways of the countryside, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole claims to be, might find the word &ldquo;bitch&rdquo; offensive &mdash; I do not know.</P>
        <P>I want to ask about one issue.  The Bill is vague.  The real meat will be in the regulations which is where issues will really be cured.  I want to know whether the Minister will implement in the regulations the excellent recommendations of the DSPCA which deal with the provision of accommodation for dogs, the provision of sufficient space for dogs to stand, the location and construction of kennels and the partition that can be used, the amount of space for dogs to turn around and sleep, the temperature at which they should be kept, noise levels, lighting, ventilation, security, hygiene, bedding, pest control, waste disposal, dog dirt, breeding and so on.  An excellent series of recommendations have been made and I strongly hope they will be followed through on by the Minister.</P>
        <P>On a final point, a lot of other legislation is needed.  For example, we have no legislation dealing with exotic pets.  When I raised this matter, I was laughed at.  It is very unfair to allow people to keep animals which are completely unsuited to the climate of this country in an unregulated fashion.  It is also dangerous, with wild animals such as snakes and spiders escaping.  Could we consider legislation in this area also?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome the opportunity to engage in the Second Stage debate on the Bill.  As Senator Glynn said, the legislation is very welcome because it is long overdue, as most of us would accept.  Both of the Minister&rsquo;s immediate predecessors in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government had spoken about their intent to introduce legislation in this area.  I give credit to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, because he is the one who has done something.  He has acted and introduced the legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey spoke to the Minister about what constituted good law.  Good law is law that is not undermined by the creating of significant exemptions or exceptions.  It is about applying the same standards to everybody and not allowing for self-regulation where it is not appropriate to do so.  This legislation is informed by the principles of animal protection.  It puts strong provisions in place to ensure dogs, in particular dogs bred in establishments, will be treated humanely.  That is to be welcomed.  Therefore, the Bill is very good law.</P>
        <P>I am personally very happy to see the Bill introduced because in my constituency, as most people will be aware, there was a high profile case in June 2007 in which a puppy farm had been discovered in south Wicklow in which 76 dogs, many of them pups, had been kept in absolutely appalling conditions.  Some 16 of the dogs had to be put down.  The health problems found among the dogs rescued included flea and lice infestations, mange, cataracts, overgrown and diseased teeth, bone problems, ear infections, mites, mammary tumours, dietary problems and so on.  The puppies had been housed in dreadful conditions with no access to food, water or light.  The case was not an isolated one.  I know of other incidents identified in recent years in counties Down and Carlow and elsewhere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The breeding of dogs on the cheap is a grim and shameful industry.  Obviously, the objective is to produce cheap, poor quality, pure bred dogs, mass produced by the hundred, usually in cages and kept in appalling conditions.  One journalist referred to it as pet production, battery cage style, a very apt way to describe it.  The intention is to sell on the dogs as pure bred designer puppies.  In a business that is tax free these activities have made it an extremely lucrative industry that provides high profit margins for those involved in breeding dogs.  It is estimated that pups are now being sold for approximately &euro;400 and that up to 1,000 puppies a week are exported from the Republic.  Unfortunately, most farmed puppies are sold over the counter in pet shops or through advertisements on websites or in newspapers, in which only <Col N="176"/>the mobile number of the owner is given, with the result that the buyer never becomes aware of the appalling breeding conditions in which the puppy was produced.</P>
        <P>There is a clear need for licensing and inspection measures to tackle cruelty on dog breeding farms, to bring proper policing measures to these establishments and to provide the necessary powers for the relevant authorities and agencies to ensure they can take action.  This legislation is part of the process of bringing Irish animal health and welfare legislation into the 21st century.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, referred to other animal welfare legislation that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is in the process of preparing.  Major strides forward in animal health and welfare protection will be made when that legislation is introduced.</P>
        <P>The Bill gives a legislative basis for the regulation of dog breeding establishments.  As others have said, many dog breeding establishments throughout the country operate in an extremely responsible way, which must be recognised and acknowledged.  These establishments have nothing to fear from the implementation of this legislation.  I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, in drawing up legislation attempted to exempt certain organisations from any undue financial burden that might be presented to them, but this legislation is fair and provides an important legislative basis that will allow, as others have said, for subsequent regulations to be introduced in a number of key areas.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides for an increase in the dog licence fee.   This will go some way towards resourcing a system that is currently seriously under-resourced.  It is proposed to increase the licence fee from &euro;12.70 to &euro;20.  The Minister referred to the fact that An Post has increased its administrative fee to &euro;3.50.  This will leave only &euro;9.20 per licence fee collected by local authorities to provide for the funding of the dog warden service.  In 2008 the income derived from the dog licence fee for all local authorities was &euro;2.6 million, while their combined expenditure on dog-related activities was &euro;5.7 million, which left a shortfall of more than &euro;3 million.  Increasing the licence fee to &euro;20 will increase to &euro;4.1 million the income derived from the licence fee for local authorities, which will reduce the shortfall to only to &euro;1.6 million, but there will still be a shortfall.</P>
        <P>The legislation, to which the Minister did justice in his outline of it, introduces the need to register breeding establishments with the local authority.  Existing dog breeding establishments will have three months from the commencement of the Act to register or otherwise they will be in breach of it.  The legislation also requires minimum standards to be adhered to in such establishments.  Within nine months of the commencement of the Act local authorities must arrange to carry out an inspection of registered establishments which, in the meantime, can continue to operate.</P>
        <P>The legislation also requires the introduction of microchipping of all dogs, to which other speakers referred, commencing with those resident in dog breeding establishments.  To enable the making of effective regulations in these areas, this legislation was required.</P>
        <P>Some Members opposite referred to shortcomings in the consultation that occurred on the preparation of the legislation.  I have no doubt the Minister&rsquo;s response will make clear the extent of such consultation.  In drawing up the Bill and regulations, I am aware that the Minister&rsquo;s Department consulted the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the veterinary expertise available to local authorities through the City and County Managers&rsquo; Association.  The draft guidelines the Minister supports are based on advice from the Irish Society for Protection of Cruelty to Animals.  Others consulted included the Hunting Association of Ireland and Animals Need a Voice in Legislation or the ANVIL group.  In addition, the working group that was set up received numerous submissions as part of its responsibility to prepare recommendations on the management of dog breeding establishments for the Minister.</P>
<Col N="177"/>
        <P>I recommend this legislation to the House.  It is long overdue but good legislation.  This Bill provides a sound legislative basis for the regulations that need to be introduced in key areas.  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to a submission I received from the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the past week or two comprising some last minute proposals it put forward to the final draft of the legislation.  One proposal is a suggestion on the age at which dogs should be microchipped and another calls on the Minister to ensure that the guidelines on the operation of dog breeding establishments are put in place prior to or on the enactment of this Bill.  The guidelines, to which the society referred, are on the duty of care to animals, including dogs and dog breeding establishments.  I commend the passing of this legislation to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome the introduction of this legislation.  It represents a step forward in animal welfare in this country, but that is not to say I welcome all aspects of the legislation.  I have some issues about some of its provisions, with which I will deal later.  I serve notice that we may table some amendments to it on Committee Stage but, in general terms, we are very supportive of it.  The Bill&rsquo;s primary purpose is to regulate dog breeding establishments.  Councils will be required to maintain a register of dog breeding establishments and the operation of unregistered establishments will be outlawed.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of and have heard from other Senators of appalling cases involving the breeding of dogs over the years.  Hundreds of dogs are kept on some farms.  Animal welfare groups and others are rightly concerned about outbreaks of diseases such as canine brucellosis.  Recently, the chief executive of the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals commented on one farm and said it was one of Europe&rsquo;s largest mass breeding establishments.  It is estimated there could be as many as 1,000 dogs on the farm.  The operators of that farm refused to co-operate with a visit from the society and reluctantly confirmed the presence of canine brucellosis.  This is what can happen when we have an unregulated puppy farm industry.</P>
        <P>Ireland has become known as the puppy farm capital of Europe.  It is estimated that up to 1,000 puppies a week are exported from these shores.  Such breeding occurs in battery farming style.  Some establishments can contain up to 300 breeding bitches, each having two or three litters a year, and they can charge in the order of &euro;300 or &euro;400 for each pup.</P>
        <P>Thankfully, the Government acted and in 2004 set up a working group to review the management of the dog breeding establishments nationally.  The then Minister appointed Mr. Finbar Heslin, a veterinary surgeon, as chairman of the working group, which comprised representatives from bodies such as the Veterinary Council of Ireland, the Irish Greyhound Board, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities and the Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  We are all grateful for the time and effort these organisations put into the deliberations of the working group.  We see the fruits of their labour in the form of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The legislation will provide safeguards for dogs in breeding establishments and assurances to customers that pups and their mothers have been treated well in these establishments.  Each local authority will be required to have a dog register for breeding establishments and will require the operators of them to register and pay an annual fee.  Each premises will receive a registration certificate, which must be prominently displayed.  Under the terms of the Bill, a local authority will be empowered to issue a closure notice to establishments and order them to cease breeding dogs if they are not fit places for breeding purposes.  It will be a criminal offence to operate an unlicensed dog breeding establishment.  As the Minister, Deputy Gormley, said recently, this will stop backstreet dog breeders and benefit those commercial bodies which do a good job and treat their animals humanely.</P>
        <P>The operations manager of the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Ms Orla Aungier, said the regulation and licensing of dog breeding establishments would end the <Col N="178"/>practice whereby Ireland has become the puppy breeding capital of Europe because of the current lack of regulation.  She is excited about this Bill, but has pointed out that it is critical the necessary financial measures are put in place to ensure the Bill is enforced at local level.  A key requirement is the ability of the local authority to enforce the measures.  The Bill is meant to be self-financing, but I am not convinced that significant enforcement measures will be in place and will be used, based on my experience of the enforcement powers and procedures of local authorities.</P>
        <P>On a related matter, many local authorities are failing to establish measures to prevent dog fouling in their localities and are not enforcing their powers with regard to owners who allow their dogs to foul public spaces, footpaths and so on.  In County Meath our dogs are no better and no worse than anywhere else and the vast majority of owners are upstanding citizens, but there are a few who do not seem to care where their dogs foul.  My experience has been that it can be difficult to persuade local officials to enforce the law and tackle the problem.  They often fail to see it as a problem and sometimes the measures they take are inadequate or do not compare favourably with what is done in neighbouring jurisdictions.  Official guidance from the Minister&rsquo;s Department on best practice for local authorities would be a positive step in this regard.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact this Bill is before the House.  While speaking in general terms about the Bill it is useful to raise other issues regarding dogs, because we rarely get to talk about dogs in the House and it is a subject close to my heart.  One issue is the noise made by dogs in housing estates.  Many of us have received numerous complaints over the years about dogs barking throughout the day and night when their owners are away from home.  Citizens are finding it difficult to persuade local councils to enforce regulations, and there are issues with regard to the confidentiality of complainants.  It is not easy for the average Joe to make a complaint about dog noise in an estate.  Again, I ask the Minister to consider issuing guidance to local authorities to ensure our citizens do not have to be subjected to ongoing and incessant noise from dogs because their owners are unable or unwilling to silence them.</P>
        <P>I welcome the measures in this legislation with regard to the identification of stray dogs and dog traceability.  I agree that the higher cost of acquiring a dog may force potential owners to consider the implications of owning a dog and perhaps think twice before getting one.  Dog ownership is not something that should be taken on lightly.  I recognise this may cause hardship to senior citizens who are surviving on a pension, so I ask the Minister to consider providing a waiver to senior citizens and those less well off people who want the benefit of a dog for company or security.</P>
        <P>Finally, I ask the Minister for clarification of the impact of these regulations on hunting kennels.  I have been contacted by various hunting groups about this.  The Hunting Association of Ireland has publicly accused the Minister of doing a U-turn and reneging on his promise to make hunt clubs exempt from the legislation.  I believe assurances were given in the past with regard to hunt kennels and I am asking the Minister whether he has changed his mind in this regard.  Did he provide an assurance and is he now doing a U-turn?  If so, can he tell us why it is so essential for hunt kennels to be included in this legislation?  He should make the case for this.</P>
        <P>We welcome the Bill in general terms, although we reserve the right to table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill, which is long overdue.  Senator Hannigan mentioned barking dogs in estates.  We receive many complaints about this; I received one only last week.  Barking can keep people awake all night.  They wonder what <Col N="179"/>they can do about it and who can they go to.  Do they go to the Garda?  I am glad to see there is provision in the Bill for this, but more clarity is required.  I read this part of the Bill specifically because I had an interest in it.  It states that complainants must speak to their neighbours and then write to them.  However, I do not think it is always practical for people to speak to neighbours about whom they are making a complaint and, even if they do, some will tell them to get lost.  It is not practical to write to them either and then go to court.  That aspect of the Bill needs more clarity.</P>
        <P>I know of several people who keep dogs in inadequate facilities.  Some people have dogs in apartments or in houses that do not even have gardens but only small patios.  A dog needs a run.  Such conditions are not suitable for dogs and it is cruel to keep them there.  As has been mentioned, people sometimes get presents of pups at Christmas, get fed up with them and abandon them.  I have heard of cases in which people have driven 50 miles down the country, let the dog out of the car and driven off.  For that reason I welcome the provisions with regard to microchipping in the Bill.  It may help somewhat in curtailing that type of practice.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to dog fighting, which is a common practice, particularly in other parts of our island, with dogs imported from the UK.  It is a blood sport and there is much money involved, with people betting on one of two dogs in a fight to the death, sometimes with both dogs eventually dying.  This needs to be addressed by the Minister.  I do not see such a provision in the Bill, although it could be there.</P>
        <P>Another issue is that of guard dogs on building sites which are not properly looked after.  They are half-starved and out in the open with no proper kennels.  The issue of puppy farms has been adequately articulated by previous speakers and I am glad to see it has been dealt with in the Bill.</P>
        <P>There are regulations in some local authorities which provide that dogs should be on leashes when on beaches and so on.  However, this does not happen in all cases.  I have never seen anybody fined or prosecuted for not adhering to such regulations, but there have been a couple of instances in my constituency in which children were attacked, including one who suffered from severe facial disfiguration.</P>
        <P>Hunting is a dog-related issue because dogs are used for hunting.  I do not see much wrong with certain types of hunting which have been traditional in this country.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, we do not want to turn off the lights completely on rural Ireland.  One could use any excuse for banning a sport.  A stag running into a school playground is not a reason to ban hunting, just as car rallies should not be banned because somebody drives a car into a wall.</P>
        <P>It has been reported that puppies and breeding bitches are being brought here from the UK and subjected to docking, which involves cutting off the dog&rsquo;s tail with a knife.  This procedure has been illegal since 2007 and is quite cruel.  Most of these dogs are docked for cosmetic reasons, such as for dog shows.</P>
        <P>Last year about 550 dogs and cats were used for research.  What happens to them after that research is completed has not been clearly established; some people in the DSPCA believe they die.  Thus, dogs and cats are being bred to die.  This should be addressed in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I have received representations from various associations involved in the dog business, as Senator Coffey mentioned earlier.  They feel they have not been adequately consulted and that the submissions they made were not taken into account.  They felt that promises had been made to them by the Minister which were not delivered on and that the Minister had done a U-turn on some sections of the Bill, to which they have proposed amendments.  While I welcome the Bill, I hope the Minister will find time to consult them adequately prior to Committee Stage because the Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association, the Dog Breeders Association of <Col N="180"/>Ireland and the Irish Kennel Club have put a great deal of work into the submissions.  I commend them on their work and the interest they took in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I agree with most of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  All Senators agree with large chunks of the legislation and everybody concurs on the need to regulate what are termed &ldquo;puppy farms&rdquo; throughout the country.  I have been a Member for eight years and this was one the first topics raised on the Order of Business when I entered the House.  Senator Cummins was the first politician I noticed raising the issue of puppy farming and bringing to the attention of the Government the need to introduce regulation in this area.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to deal with puppy farms and I will nail my colours to the mast.  Anybody who abuses dogs and who treats them the way they have been on puppy farms that have been exposed deserves nothing other than the full rigour of the law.  Such behaviour is nothing short of despicable.  The Minister assured the House he would only sign the proposed regulation into law &ldquo;after full consultation with all interested parties&rdquo;.  It is remarkable that there was not &ldquo;full consultation with all interested parties&rdquo; before the Bill was introduced.  Hound clubs, including beagle clubs, were not consulted and perhaps other hunting organisations were not consulted but they are interested in this legislation.  The Minister stated section 16 &ldquo;allows local authorities to appoint certain persons, including vets and those connected with animal welfare to act as authorised persons&rdquo;.  Senator Coffey sought an explanation of that definition.  What does &ldquo;those connected with animal welfare&rdquo; mean?  Will the Minister address that when he replies?</P>
        <P>Even though I am from the heart of rural Ireland, I have never fired a gun and I have never hunted, fished or followed hounds in pursuit of an animal but I would defend a person&rsquo;s right to do so.  The Minister and the Government have been disingenuous regarding this legislation by speaking out of both ends of their mouths regarding commitments they gave, particularly to hunt clubs and hunting organisations.  The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, stated a number of years ago, &ldquo;Hunt clubs were not part of the problem and, therefore, they wouldn&rsquo;t be part of the solution&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The current Minister in a letter to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in February 2008 explicitly stated it was the intention that &ldquo;groups affiliated to the HAI be granted an exemption from the requirements of the legislation&rdquo;.  I acknowledge he said in his opening contribution that they would be exempt from the fees that will be applied under the legislation but they will not be exempt from the requirements of the legislation.  It is important to differentiate between puppy farms, on the one hand, and hunting clubs on the other.  Such clubs are not commercial operations.  Pups born in hunting kennels are bred to ensure the hunt pack is replaced naturally and survives into the future and they are not bred for the purpose of making money.  There is no exchange of money between hunt clubs when they swap different animals for breeding purposes.  The animals are not sold to the public.</P>
        <P>Hunt clubs are voluntary groups and, under the British legislation governing dog breeding, such clubs in Scotland and Northern Ireland are exempt from its provisions.  That is as it should be in this jurisdiction.  If the Minister is to have credibility regarding any commitment or promise he gives in the future, he should honour his statement to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 15 February 2008 that hunt clubs would be exempt from the regulations imposed by this legislation.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to consider what has happened in the meantime.  My theory on why the Minister has reversed his position was highlighted on &ldquo;The Last Word&rdquo; radio programme before the negotiations on the revised programme for Government were concluded when an <Col N="181"/>animal rights activist, who is a former Green Party member and councillor, stated his supporters who were members of the Green Party would support a revised programme for Government if certain provisions regarding animal welfare were included.  The Minister has had his arm twisted by a group of vocal members in the Green Party.  As somebody who is not involved in hunting, I share Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s view that the insidious drip drip effect being pursued by those who have no understanding of the way of life and traditions of rural Ireland means they want to destroy it.  The legislation partly reflects that and that would be a retrograde step.  I am disgusted that Fianna F&aacute;il is prepared to stand over this because, like my own political party, it has roots in rural Ireland as well as urban Ireland and I expected its members to be prepared to stand up for the interests of those in rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is amazing, as Senator Coffey mentioned, that there will be more regulations governing dog breeding by hunt clubs than banking institutions, which ran roughshod over the economy for the past number of years.  That will be one of the unfortunate consequences of this legislation, if it is not amended.</P>
        <P>I agree with much of the legislation and anybody who abuses animals, particularly dogs, should be treated harshly but hunt clubs, whose interest is in protecting dogs and ensuring they are healthy, should be exempt.  These voluntary organisations are currently subject to rigorous inspection by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  They are part of rural life and they should not be undermined in any way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome this important legislation, which will provide for a much better environment for dog breeding.  I am a former member of Galway City Council and there is one dog warden in the city, which is not sufficient to deal with the large number of dogs, including strays, in the city.  Dogs are bred for fighting, to which another Member referred earlier.  Dog fighting is illegal and unacceptable but, nevertheless, it happens.  One dog warden, therefore, cannot deal with all dog-related activities in a city the size of Galway.</P>
        <P>Sections 16 and 17 provide for authorised persons to become involved in the policing of dogs within a local authority area.  It will allow for veterinarians and people involved in animal welfare &mdash; the Galway Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Animals, in the case of Galway, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, in the case of Dublin.  That is a very welcome provision because it will allow local authorities to control the situation but not at any great cost to themselves.  It will allow people who have great knowledge in the area concerned to get involved in the policing of dogs.  That is a very important provision.</P>
        <P>We have much very good legislation but local authorities in particular find it very difficult to enforce it.  The idea that we would look outside the cost structure of the local authorities, in particular in these difficult times, and look for help from people who are only too willing to give it and give them the power and authority to work with local authorities to achieve a better outcome is very good.  I commend the Minister in that regard.</P>
        <P>Sections 18 and 19 allow for improvement and closure notices to be served on establishments, which is very good.  The local authorities will register all the local dog breeding establishments within their areas.  There is a methodology whereby they can first serve an improvement notice on an establishment and if that fails to deal with the issue of animal welfare or health and safety, a closure notice can be served.  That is important.</P>
        <P>I wish to address certain points raised by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and John Paul Phelan because they seem to be connecting this Bill to Bills on hunting.  In some strange way, Senator John Paul Phelan connected the Bill to NAMA.  I am not quite sure how this Bill relates to NAMA. <Col N="182"/> It is quite a stretch of the imagination.  Puppy farming and NAMA require quite different legislation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed.  A point being made loud and clear by Fine Gael concerns the exemption of hunt clubs.  I echo the point Senator de B&uacute;rca made that it is not good to exempt groups.  Why not exempt other dog breeding establishments?  Many people are involved in animal welfare.  It is quite clear that most establishments which breed dogs are perfectly good.  Dogs are a man&rsquo;s best friend and are loved by many people in this country.  Most dogs are bred with loving care and attention.  I am sure many of the hunts breed their dogs in a good and proper way but why should people be afraid of this legislation applying to them?</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>If this legislation works for one group of people, it should work for all groups.  Why exempt one group of people?  What is the purpose of this?  Obviously, there must be some ulterior motive.  I am not sure why Fine Gael has this ulterior motive.  I do not understand the purpose of exempting breeding premises.  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure a good standard, good welfare and good inspections of breeding premises.</P>

	<P>There is a suggestion that this will destroy the whole rural way of life for generations.  The suggestion that this Bill, which is straightforward animal welfare legislation, will destroy a way of life or a rural culture is a gross exaggeration.  I cannot understand from where this is coming.  I do not see the logic in it other that there is some ulterior motive which is not being expressed here.</P>
        <P>What would happen in practice if this amendment exempting a particular group was agreed to?  There are bad breeding practices in this country and if one group of people is exempt, what is to stop somebody setting up a puppy farm but calling it a hunt?</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>By calling a puppy farm a hunt, one would be exempt.  What is to stop people using that provision to get around the rules and the good practice set up by local authorities?</P>
        <P>This Bill is about good practice and animal welfare.  If people are afraid of that being applied to them, I suggest they have something to hide.  It is in the interests of the hunts to comply with this legislation.  That is the way forward.  I commend the Bill and do not believe the proposed amendment is welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to state my absolute love of dogs.  I welcome the broad thrust of this Bill given the horrific state some dogs who have been born in puppy farms have had to endure.  I do not mean to take issue with Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in but the confusion in regard to the Hunting Association of Ireland is that a commitment was given by the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Dick Roche, that these breeding establishments would be exempt.  I am familiar with the South Westmeath Hunt.  There is no question but they are the kindest <Col N="183"/>people to those dogs.  The bottom line is that raising puppies for a hunt is not a commercial enterprise.  The whole purpose is to replenish stocks in order to have enough dogs to commit to the hunt.  They are happy, lively and healthy dogs.  There is a huge difference between puppy farming and that commercial side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are they afraid of this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will tell the Senator when I speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know why the word &ldquo;fear&rdquo; has come into this debate.  There is red tape and bureaucracy involved and these are voluntary clubs rather than commercial entities.  There should be regulation for puppy farms which charge &euro;400 per puppy and which are breeding unhealthy animals in dreadful situations.</P>
        <P>I understand the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Dogs Trust have had several meetings with the Minister.  While I support the broad thrust of the Bill, I cannot understand why the i&rsquo;s were not dotted and the t&rsquo;s were not crossed.  The Bill goes so far but why did it not go the whole way?  Why did the Minister not listen?</P>
        <P>The definitions of &ldquo;a commercial boarding kennel&rdquo; and &ldquo;an animal shelter&rdquo; need to be clearly described in order that there is no confusion in the Bill.  There is also the issue of dog chipping.  The legislation fails to state at what age a puppy needs to be chipped or whether the puppy should be chipped before leaving the commercial centre in which it is bred, which stands to reason in order that the puppy cannot be lost in transit.  It is a crucial point.  There is no point saying we must chip dogs because if we do not do so properly, it is nonsense.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why guidelines are not published before the Bill is instigated.  That is the whole basis of the Bill.  As Senator de B&uacute;rca rightly said, we have a duty of care to animals.  Why were the recommendations and extensive consultations with these animal rights bodies not followed through to the nth degree?</P>

    <Title>Banking Sector: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Seanad on the Government decision last week to establish a framework for a comprehensive investigation into the causes of the systemic failures in the banking sector which culminated in the need for the State intervention.  The Government has taken this decision in recognition of the public expectation that there be a full examination of what went wrong in our banking system.</P>
        <P>The mistakes that were made have required the Government to introduce the bank guarantee scheme in September 2008 and to make some very significant interventions since then to ensure financial stability.  These measures include the recapitalisation of our two biggest banks, <Col N="184"/>AIB Bank and Bank of Ireland, the nationalisation and recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the recent introduction of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P>The proper functioning of the banking system is critical to the economy and therefore must be protected by the Government.  In all the steps we have taken as a Government, our overriding objective has been to maintain a functioning banking system that will ensure a flow of credit to viable businesses and households in this economy.</P>
        <P>We are all aware that the global international crisis has created extreme stress for the financial system worldwide.  The drying up of funding in international credit markets and the huge write-downs of securitised assets has generated a financial shock which has resulted in the most negative economic conditions since the Second World War.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s exposure to the sharp deterioration in international financial conditions has been significantly exacerbated by practices which failed to address unrestricted credit growth in the Irish banking system.  We know that this credit growth was facilitated by access to wholesale financial markets with no exchange rate risk and low interest rates and was both driven by and facilitated an unprecedented property boom and an unsustainable increase in property development lending.</P>
        <P>The international context provides only a partial explanation.  The State has been required to pour very significant, scarce resources into our banks arising from decisions that were made specifically by Irish banks over a number of years.  Therefore, it is essential that we learn the lessons of our recent experiences as we set about the task of re-fashioning our banking system to restore trust in that system and to enable it to perform its proper role in meeting the needs of the economy.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government&rsquo;s framework for inquiry will have two stages.  The Government will first commission two separate reports, one from the Governor of the Central Bank on the performance of the functions of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, and the second from an independent wise man or woman with relevant expertise to conduct a preliminary investigation into the recent crisis in our banking system and to inform the future management and regulation of the sector.  These reports will also consider the international, social and macroeconomic policy environment which provided the context for the recent crisis.  Both reports are to be completed by the end of May this year and laid before the Houses shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>The second stage of the inquiry will be the establishment of a statutory commission of investigation which will be chaired by a recognised expert or experts of high standing and reputation.  The terms of reference for this commission will be informed by the conclusions of the two preliminary reports.  The aim will be for the commission to complete its work by the end of this year.  Its report will then be laid before the Oireachtas for further consideration and action by an appropriate Oireachtas committee.</P>
        <P>These reviews will build on important work being done at international level.  Over recent months substantial analysis of the failures of the banking sector has been undertaken elsewhere.  The analysis to be commissioned by the Government will complement and build upon, for example, the European Commission&rsquo;s High Level Group on Cross-Border Financial Supervision, the de Larosi&egrave;re report, and the British Financial Services Authority&rsquo;s Turner report.  These reports have recommended an extensive programme of reform of financial regulation at EU and international level which is now being put in place.  These reforms will make a major contribution to underpinning the stability of the financial system both in Ireland and the EU in the future.</P>
<Col N="185"/>
        <P>The commission of investigation will examine and report on the causes of the systemic failures such as corporate strategy, governance and risk management in the Irish banking sector.  The terms of reference for the statutory inquiry will be shaped by the conclusions of the two preliminary investigations and in consultation with the Oireachtas.  There are clearly a number of broad themes that ought to be examined thoroughly and these include the performance of individual banks and bank directors where wrongdoing and lax practices have contributed considerably to the crisis; the performance and structure of the banking system generally; the performance of the regulatory and Central Bank systems; and the response of the relevant Departments and agencies, including the linkage between the banking crisis and overall economic management.  The two preliminary reviews will prepare the ground for the formal inquiry and ensure it is effective and efficient.</P>
        <P>There was extensive debate in the D&aacute;il last week on the appropriate role for the Oireachtas.  For reasons that the Government has already set out, a committee of the Oireachtas is not best equipped to conduct an inquiry or investigation of this nature.  Unlike the Committee of Public Accounts DIRT inquiry, the issues in the banking situation are significantly more complex and will require a greater range of expertise.  Indeed the PAC itself was able to draw upon a comprehensive investigation into the DIRT issue by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition, the issues involved continue to be current issues rather than issues simply of the recent and more medium-term past and Members of these Houses continue to be engaged in debate on these issues.  There could be some mitigation of these effects by confining the remit of the inquiry, but this clearly would not satisfy the need for a comprehensive investigation of all the relevant issues.  The advice the Government has received from the Attorney General is that such an investigation would also require legislation following the Supreme Court judgment relating to the Abbeylara inquiry.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, an Oireachtas committee will have a vital function in this process through assisting in the formulation of appropriate terms of reference with regard to where the inquiry goes at the conclusion of the scoping exercise and exercising its constitutional role of examining matters of public policy arising from the findings of the statutory inquiry.  Specifically, the Oireachtas will be involved at each stage of the planned inquiry process.  An appropriate Oireachtas committee will meet both the governor and the independent expert at the outset of their work to be briefed on the members&rsquo; priorities for investigation.  The two preliminary reports, when completed, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas committee will be invited to consider the findings of the reports.  The terms of reference and draft Government order to establish the statutory commission of investigation will be laid before the Oireachtas and the report of the commission of investigation will, when completed, be laid before the Oireachtas for further consideration by the committee.  It is open to the committee to hold public hearings on the report.</P>
        <P>It is important to underline a point which is relevant to the debate on the role of the Oireachtas in this inquiry.  The Governor of the Central Bank, in his appearance before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs at the end of last year, said that the banking crisis was bigger and more complicated than one that could be accommodated by an Oireachtas inquiry.  He went on to say the question would not be sufficiently answered by a judicial inquiry because it was not simply a matter of establishing the nature of what had happened and the sequence of events and that an inquiry should involve experts in economics and social science and politicians.  He continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">The crisis is not simply a question of discovering who did what and who knew what.  Uncovering the deep roots of the crisis will require expertise and broad social scientific understanding more than merely forensic skills.</P>
<Col N="186"/>
        <P FLI="0">The Government&rsquo;s agreed approach will allow for the timely completion of expert, authoritative and structured examinations of the financial crisis.  It will form a comprehensive framework of investigation into the recent crisis in the banking sector which will enable us to understand its origins and help us to learn lessons that will inform our future management of the banking sector.  The framework will involve the Oireachtas at each stage.  It will be efficient and cost effective.  Most of all, it will restore trust and confidence in the banks in order that they can play their full and proper role in promoting economic recovery.  This will allow the Government to assess how lessons can be learned to inform our future management of the sector, both in respect of institutions and their management and direction and regarding the management of risks and stability issues within the regulatory and governmental systems.</P>
        <P>I would like to add one or two other observations.  The causes of the domestic and international banking crisis and remedies to prevent or mitigate against recurrences are under serious investigation in every country affected by it and in international economic forums.  This week&rsquo;s Davos meeting is preoccupied with precisely that subject.  For example, today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> contains a heading on the meeting in Davos that reads: &ldquo;The great reckoning&rdquo;.  The global fiscal crisis demands a shift in philosophy.  The issue is too important for crude polemicisation.  What is to blame matters as much as who is to blame.  When I first entered this House in mid-2002, one of the first Bills discussed was the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2002 on foot of the McDowell report.  We did not go as far as recommended in separating completely the FSAI and the Central Bank.  I wish to quote what I said during that debate:</P>
        <P LI="1">As an observer in a previous capacity, without having been involved directly, I was always of the view that one could not separate the regulatory and consumer protection functions.  Senator Higgins said the two were at opposite poles but I am not sure that is true.  The worst prejudice to the consumer is if a financial institution collapses and he or she loses money.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I must admit that, like nearly everyone else, I was nonetheless too optimistic that the solution had been found, but it is worth recalling that the opposition to and criticism of the Bill came from the point of view that the two authorities should be completely separated instead of remaining under the umbrella of the Central Bank.  In effect, the thrust of the legislation is now likely to be reserved.</P>
        <P>I forget who, but a commentator stated today or yesterday that we could save ourselves an inquiry by reading approximately half a dozen recent books written by columnists of broadsheet newspapers.  In my contribution in the D&aacute;il last week I raised the issue of the extent to which the property supplements for which these columnists and authors wrote had played a part in fuelling the property bubble.  My argument was that they excoriated poor decision making and regulation and cronyism, real and alleged, but rarely made any reference to the relentless hype in property supplements that had fuelled what has been described elsewhere as &ldquo;irrational exuberance&rdquo; &mdash; this phrase has been picked up by Mr. Jim Power &mdash; caused many of our current problems and, in the prevailing climate, would be difficult to contain or control.  To be fair to Senator Ross, he often raised in the House the issue of what he considered the sharp practices of estate agencies in terms of guide prices, published prices and so on.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, my point was also made by Deputy Upton on behalf of the Labour Party in the D&aacute;il.  She referred to the complicity of the media in stroking the property bubble, that they had been so great an earner for newspapers that property sections were often as large as the rest of the newspaper.  They happily quoted pet economists in banks who told us that the property sector remained strong and its fundamentals were sound.  She also stated the role of <Col N="187"/>the media and others with a financial interest in encouraging or scaring people into purchasing houses at grossly inflated prices needed to be investigated.  We are good at discovering the beam in other people&rsquo;s eyes but do not look sufficiently at the mote in our own.  On this point at least, the Labour Party and I are in agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to the Chamber and thank him for his recent visit to east County Galway in an effort to address the flooding crisis that affected the area so badly.</P>
        <P>For 12 years the nation was afflicted with a hear nothing, see nothing and do nothing Government.  The nation looked to the Government, but it looked away and we had to struggle with the old enemies of peace, business and financial monopoly, speculation and reckless banking.  These enemies had begun to consider the Government as a mere appendage to their own affairs.  President Roosevelt uttered the following words more than 70 years ago:  &ldquo;We know now that government by organised money is just as dangerous as government by organised mob.&rdquo;   Last week President Obama stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">This economic crisis began as a financial crisis, when banks and financial institutions took huge, reckless risks in pursuit of quick profits and massive bonuses ... And that rescue, undertaken by the previous administration, was deeply offensive but it was a necessary thing to do ... And last week, I proposed a fee to be paid by the largest financial firms in order to recover every last dime.  Never again will the American taxpayer be held hostage by a bank that is &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In this country it is seemingly impossible for political leaders to use such firm and unequivocal language.  Contrast these words with the mealy mouthed ducking and diving engaged in by our leaders last week.  We were told that a banking inquiry was not necessary because, according to the Taoiseach, the priority for the moment had be to solve the problem and then deal with its sources.  This begs the question of how should one go about solving a problem if one does not first establish what caused it.  We need to understand the regulatory, governance, auditing and political failures that allowed the banks to swell their balance sheets unchecked.  I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, that it is a matter of finding out what is to blame, not necessarily who is to blame.</P>
        <P>Later in the week we had to endure the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, telling us that the proposed banking inquiry would not be held in secret but in private.  The only time in recent months that we heard anything close to clear and definitive language was on budget day when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, pointed to the inevitability of cutting public expenditure by &euro;4 billion.  He did exactly this.  Both the Minister and his departmental officials seem to be able to show one face in dealing with the public finances and another to the bankers and developers who contributed so significantly to their collapse.</P>
        <P>We have been told over and over again that the support provided for the banks through NAMA and recapitalisation have one predominant aim, namely, to restore the flow of credit to businesses.  Unfortunately, this lifeline to the business sector has not been restored and will not be for many months to come, if at all.  Last week the House debated the issue of unemployment when many Members opposite correctly criticised the banking sector for not playing its part in employment recovery.  The Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce, Deputy Kelleher, also called on the banks recently to provide credit for the small and medium-sized business sector as a matter of urgency.  He said the banks had received Government and taxpayer support at a very low rate through the State guarantee and that they, in turn, had an obligation to support SMEs in the economic downturn.  However, one would not be encouraged <Col N="188"/>by the utterances of Mr. Eugene Sheehy, the outgoing CEO of AIB.  He was refreshingly honest in saying clearly that NAMA would not make it any easier for individuals and companies to borrow next year.  His emphatic message was that the real function of NAMA was to create a mechanism to stabilise the banking system which might lead to further lending when the banks were out of trouble.  He said money had to be handed over to the banks and that it would be used to shore up their own reserves rather than lend to business.  He went on to say that once these reserves were bulging again, the banks would be in a position to begin lending.  This very revealing intervention by Mr. Sheehy, coupled with the fact that the NAMA process is now over two months behind schedule, should give us all serious cause for concern.</P>
        <P>The latest information to hand suggests approximately &euro;19 billion worth of loans will be transferred to NAMA next month, with the remainder to be transferred by the end of September.  At a conservative estimate, this means it could be late next year before the banks get round to lending again to small businesses, assuming that they will begin to lend again, as there is nothing in the NAMA legislation to oblige them to do so.  Unfortunately, late next year will be far too late for hundreds of businesses.  Every employers&rsquo; group, from the Small Firms Association to ISME to the Restaurants Association of Ireland, continues to point to the crisis in business lending.  The Government needs to take a firm hand with the banks to ensure credit lines are restored immediately, not in 12 or 24 months.  If this requires a Government-backed working capital guarantee scheme, it should be seriously considered.  Such a scheme is already working in other countries and could work here.  The bottom line is that we urgently need some radical thought applied to the credit crisis, as waiting another 12 or 24 months for the credit tap to be turned back on is simply not feasible.</P>
        <P>The timely update from the Edelman Trust Barometer released this morning makes for sobering reading.  It concludes that Ireland is continuing to experience a &ldquo;profound&rdquo; and continuing trust crisis.  The level of trust in government and business here is the lowest in Europe, with the level of trust in government dropping to an all-time low of 28% from 31% compared to a global average of 49%.  In Europe, Ireland was the only country surveyed that had experienced a fall in the level of trust across all four institutions &mdash; business, government, media and even NGOs.  The bedrock of economic recovery must be trust.  These figures indicate how far we have to go in this regard.</P>
        <P>What is the Government&rsquo;s response to this trust crisis?  How does it intend to build public confidence in order that we can move forward collectively with trust restored?  It proposes to hold what is probably the most important inquiry in a generation in secret or in private, if one prefers the terminology used by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.  That is how utterly detached from reality our leaders have become.  The valuable opportunity to hold what could be an open and transparent inquiry which could have a cathartic effect on public trust has been lost by our leaders.  The head of the Law Reform Commission, Ms Catherine McGuinness, is absolutely right in saying the public will have no confidence in such an inquiry.  There is a significant demand from the public for an inquiry, with 91% of respondents in the latest <i>The Irish Times</i> poll backing it.  There is no doubt that the people concerned do not want an inquiry held in secret in a manner controlled by a Government it does not trust.  The same poll also concluded that almost two thirds of the people did not believe the worst was over for the economy.  If we are to restore hope and trust, we need to hear the forceful and inspirational language used by Roosevelt and Obama.  We need to convince the people, those who elect us, that we are firmly on their side.  Immediately restoring credit to struggling businesses and announcing a full public inquiry must be the first two steps along the long road to recovery.</P>

        <P>I will refer to two issues raised by the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh.  He said that, unlike the Committee of Public Accounts DIRT inquiry, the issues in the banking sector were significantly more complex and would require a greater range of expertise.  If that is the case, provide the expertise and require that it be provided for the Committee of Public Accounts to do the work that it is well capable of doing if given the resources that it badly needs.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also referred to the advice received from the Attorney General that, following from the experience of the Abbeylara inquiry, we would also require legislation following the Supreme Court judgment.  That is certainly the case and seems to be backed up by a number of sources.  If we require legislation, we could have it in a number of weeks or months.  We were able to pass legislation to guarantee the banks literally overnight.  There is no reason similar urgency could not attach to the legislation required in this instance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Members in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I am glad to have the opportunity to make a few general points on banking.  As we have all seen in the past few years, there has been an unprecedented crisis in the sector.  The Minister of State outlined the reasons we had a property boom that fuelled the economy and a level of exuberance that has led to a great many difficulties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting as one flicks through the websites of the various financial institutions that one can see stated a business mission and ambitions which in general terms are to provide a business activity of accepting and safeguarding money owned by individuals or entities and lending that money to earn a profit.  At its simplest, that is what it is all about.  One wonders how we got so far from the basic business when one considers the derivatives and complexities of banking today.  Senator Ross and others can go into the more complex issues but I would like to keep it a bit more simple in my contribution.  It is interesting to see the mission statements of the institutions which contain words such as &ldquo;value&rdquo; and &ldquo;service&rdquo;, with phrases such as &ldquo;deliver the highest standard of service in banking&rdquo;, &ldquo;take personal responsibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;to rigorously manage our costs&rdquo; and &ldquo;to act ethically and professionally, with integrity and commitment to our customer&rdquo;.  My own nominating body, the Institute of Bankers in Ireland, the Irish Banking Federation and even the banks know these core values are expounded by many financial institutions filled with staff of the highest calibre.  We know individuals from among our families, friends and neighbourhoods who have gone about their daily business in the most responsible manner, but all of this has drifted away in the past decade, during which we saw a national and international regulatory regime which was reckless in the extreme, thus permitting the exuberance and abuse to which I referred and which led to what is not just a national crisis but a very deep international problem.</P>
        <P>I will consider the question of an inquiry, but I wanted to express a few basic thoughts of my own on the regulatory system in Ireland.  There is a concept of targeting; banks are set up in such a way that they must make a profit for shareholders or owners.  Many of us go to a bank for objective advice on the best place in which to invest, make a deposit and the type of account one should use to do this.  We may want to know what product to buy if we are to achieve A, B or C.  It is impossible to receive objective advice from the most decent and conscientious of staff members, however, if they are driven by targets.  It is impossible for them to provide objective advice, although I am not saying some do not do so.  From a regulatory perspective, we cannot nurture a regime to provide for the provision of so-called objective advice for clients when there are sales targets for the various products on offer.  As we have seen in the past few years, there is far too much of a focus on short-term rather than long-term achievements.</P>
<Col N="190"/>
        <P>This targeting issue will be extremely difficult to deal with and I do not know the precise solution but it is a good starting point.  State entities could provide such advice on whatever products are available from the various commercial banks and financial services operators.  I assume there would be a huge cost to all of this, but nevertheless it is an area that should be examined.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and some Senators from Fine Gael mentioned that Ireland&rsquo;s path to recovery has involved our State guarantee for deposits and other covered liabilities to the banking system, the recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland, AIB and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  We are set to have further capitalisation and further moneys will be put into those institutions, giving the State more ownership of them.  We have also seen the establishment of NAMA, and I join the call made on the Order of Business today that we might have a debate on NAMA and its progress so far.  Senator Regan made that call and I certainly welcome it.  He stated that he was at the European Commission yesterday to see the details of the scheme put forward by the Government to the EU.  I am sure we could all benefit from a debate of that nature in this Chamber, so I look forward to it in due course.</P>
        <P>One of the key areas is in the reform of our financial regulatory system.  We have created the Central Bank of Ireland Commission which replaces the old structure of the Central Bank the Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  The new commission has presided over the appointment of the head of financial supervision, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, who will report to the commission on the regulatory and supervisory functions of the new structure.  He was appointed in October 2009 and is not an Irish national.  We look forward to him bringing his expertise and experience to that position.  The Governor of the Central Bank will report on the performance of the Central Bank and its functions, and Mr. Patrick Honohan was appointed to this position in September, the first outsider, as it were, to be in this position.  These moves have been welcomed nationally and internationally.  Since these measures were introduced, our credibility, ratings and the perception of what we are doing have been extremely positive.</P>
        <P>The lack of a global approach to a few basic parameters on financial services worries me.  Governments should sign up to a basic set of regulations and parameters to prevent against this kind of crisis happening again.  A new regulatory agenda, stronger co-ordinated supervision and effective crisis management procedures were announced by the EU in October 2008.  In the last week, we have all seen the copy of the draft EU legislative package on reform of its financial supervisory and regulatory framework, which has been welcomed by most.  The new legislation will create the European systemic risk board, which will carry out macro-prudential supervision across the EU.  My worry is that recommendations made by the board will not be legally binding, but recipients are expected to act on a comply or explain basis.  That kind of light touch suggestion is potentially one of the things that contributed to the difficulties we have had throughout the world.  I think the recommendations should be made legally binding.</P>
        <P>The second part of this legislation will see the establishment of the European system of financial supervision, which will create three European supervisory authorities, namely, the European banking authority, the European securities and market authority and the European insurance and occupational pensions authority.  These will contribute to the development of a set of harmonised rules across Europe.  They are welcome, but any recommendations need to be legally binding.</P>
        <P>We have been cautioned not to rush this legislation, but it has been broadly welcomed by all our European counterparts, the Department of Finance, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, the Irish Bankers Federation and Financial Services Ireland.  Senators referred to plans by President Obama to crack down on US banks by banning their ability to <Col N="191"/>own, invest in or sponsor a hedge fund or private equity fund or to make bets with their own money under proprietary trading.  He also introduced a ten-year levy on banks to recoup the losses taxpayers will incur on bailed out funds.  We also have the option in the NAMA legislation for the bank surcharge.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State went into detail on the banking inquiry.  While I welcome the approach, we do not need the type of public hearing we have had with tribunals.  I am confident that the two reports being carried out by the Central Bank and by the wise man or woman yet to be named will help us to have terms of reference which will make the statutory commission much more effective than the tribunals, which have not served us well at all other than to enrich certain quarters and provide easy copy for lazy journalists.  I believe in the capability of the Oireachtas to assess those initial reports when they come, to ensure the correct terms of reference are provided, and to ensure the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service can and will hold public hearings after that statutory commission has reported.  If there are cases to answer, legally or otherwise, we will achieve our pound of flesh on behalf of the public.  There is much justified anger and we are all entitled to have answers to the questions.</P>
        <P>When the treasury select committee in Britain was trying to identify lessons to be learned from the banking crisis, it received 6,000 written questions from the public.  We should encourage that here.  Whether it is in Mr. Honohan&rsquo;s report, the report of the so-called wise person or the report of the commission itself, we should allow members of the public to put forward their questions so that they are considered.  That worked exceptionally well in the UK, and I note that the journalist who mentioned it in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Ms Elaine Byrne, has set up a website which she hopes will attract some of those questions, namely, <i>www.bankinginquiry.ie</i>.  We should welcome that.</P>
        <P>I have been pushing for quite some time for changes to the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 which will prevent against the granting of repossession of a primary family residence unless a complete analysis is done of the repayment capacity of the borrower and the original underwriting quality of that application, and that a list of alternative actions other than repossession be assessed.  These might include interest-only payments, the institution taking equity and so on.</P>
        <P>The higher interest sub-prime personal debt lenders such as Provident plc and another company in Cork are legally charging 187% APR, which is disgraceful.  We need immediate reform in this area, as 30% or less is more than enough for any institution to charge.  A collector for Provident plc admitted to me today that a formal instruction from his boss is to discourage engagement with the money advice and budgeting service, MABS.  That is scurrilous and reprehensible.  This is a licensed lender in this State.  These are the kinds of reforms I would like to see and I look forward to debates on these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to talk about the promised inquiry that is to be instigated into the banking system and related issues that have brought us to this position.  I have had the opportunity to read his speech but I did hear him deliver it, so I do not know if he spoke about whether the investigation of the commission &mdash; most people accept that the preliminary stages ought properly to be held quickly and therefore in private &mdash; should hold public hearings.  That would be a matter for the terms of reference but these should be set by the Oireachtas.  There is some suggestion that will be the case.  I invite the Minister of State to agree that it would be appropriate for the default position to be that the commission of inquiry would hold its hearings in public.  There could be circumstances in the course of its investigation that it might decide a particular hearing should be held in private but the default position should be that proceedings would be in public.</P>
<Col N="192"/>
        <P>The question of trust is at the heart of this whole controversy and debate.  The Minister of State touched on that in his speech.  One cannot restore trust by simply asking people to trust.  It does not work that way, certainly not in view of what happened in this country in the past two years.  Far too much of what has gone on has occurred behind closed doors.  People do not trust a whole range of actors, from politicians and the Government in particular to the banks and the construction industry.  People cannot be expected to trust an inquiry held predominantly in private.  People argue against this by suggesting we want a public execution in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and that we will bring on the guillotine, as if this is the only basis for calling for it to be heard in public.  I disagree with some members of the Opposition who give the impression, perhaps unwittingly, of wanting an inquiry that would be a public execution, whether of the Taoiseach or anyone else.  If the Taoiseach is to be executed politically it will be done at the time of the next general election.  I very much hope it is done but that is a matter for the general election.  That does not undermine the proposition that a commission of inquiry ought to be held in public to examine the grave issues the Minister of State touched on in his speech.  Why should there not be a presumption of hearings in public, with perhaps some allowance for the inquiry to make an <i>ad hoc</i> decision on a particular part of the inquiry to be held in private?  I will not re-engage with the differentiation between private and secret drawn on some radio programme, where the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, got himself into trouble.</P>
        <P>What is the problem for the Government?  The Minister for Finance made some reference to it costing &euro;150 million for lawyers.  I do not accept this.  If people seek to have lawyers representing them, this will be true whether the inquiry is in public or private.  If it is contemplated that there should be a cost, there is no way around the argument that if this is not held in the public eye it will not deliver the restoration of trust we all wanted to see.  This is an argument the Green Party made, unsuccessfully as it turns out.  If this is not held in public, it will not deliver the restoration of trust we all want to see.</P>
        <P>There is much talk of the Supreme Court decision on the Abbeylara case when discussing whether this should be considered by a committee of the Oireachtas.  It is well worth reading the decision to see what it says.  Much as I would like to see committees of the Oireachtas made more robust and holding public inquiries, I do not think a committee of the Oireachtas should be in a position to make findings of guilt of a criminal nature in respect of any citizen in this country.  I do not think that is our role.  I have no difficulty with that.</P>
        <P>Last week Mr. Michael Casey posed 16 questions on this topic in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Senator MacSharry mentioned Elaine Byrne&rsquo;s article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning.  She included questions she saw as appropriate and we all have our list of questions.  I read Mr. Casey&rsquo;s 16 questions but I will not detain the House unduly in this regard.  I could not find a single question that could not be dealt with by an inquiry staying away from the notion of individual culpability.  For example, Mr. Casey asked:</P>
        <P LI="1">Why did boards and senior management not worry about excessive growth of credit, especially for commercial and residential property?  What kinds of discussions took place between boards and management on portfolio diversification and &ldquo;value at risk&rdquo;?  What, if any, warnings were given by internal auditors, risk managers and credit committees?  To what extent were the bonuses and incentives geared to growing the balance-sheet at the expense of quality?  What discussions took place on the question of banks depending more on borrowed funds than on deposits?  How did banks&rsquo; internal stress tests compare with those submitted to the Financial Regulator?</P>
<Col N="193"/>
        <P FLI="0">Some 16 questions were submitted by this one commentator who was a former senior employee at the Central Bank.  We can assume he has some knowledge of this.  The public is entitled hear the answers to a range of crucial questions, as it is entitled to view and absorb the process of engaging with those questions and receiving the answers.  People are also entitled to see witnesses asked supplementary questions and cross-examined on their answers.  The Abbeylara decision does not preclude that kind of inquiry.  Of course it can and should stay away from any findings of individual culpability to the extent at issue in the Abbeylara case.  At least two of the Supreme Court judges, whose judgment I read earlier, made it clear the decision was to be confined specifically to that inquiry which concerned a tragic incident at Abbeylara and which clearly involved the possibility of findings of individual guilt or criminal guilt.  It was not appropriate for the Houses to be engaged in such an inquiry but this seems entirely different.</P>
        <P>We do not know how some elements referred to in the speech of the Minister of State will play out.  We must take some of this on trust in terms of what the Government will do when the time comes to set the terms of reference for the commission.  I was happy to hear the Minister of State saying the initial report would consider international and social issues and the macroeconomic policy environment that provided the context of the recent crisis.  The Minister of State referred to the unsustainable increase in property development lending as one of the factors that drove and facilitated an unprecedented property boom.  The property boom did not sprout like a beanstalk.  It had to be fostered, fanned and sustained by political decisions made by the Government on tax incentives or the rural renewal schemes that were valuable when set up but overextended.</P>
        <P>A self-serving attempt is being made in some quarters to reduce everything to wrongdoing by, for example, individual bankers and individual decision makers.  We have all made speeches about how horrific were some of the decisions made by some of the banks under investigation by the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda authorities, but much more is involved than individual acts of fault or wrongdoing.  I am as critical of those individuals as the next person but the story is much greater and wider than that.  It includes political decision making and the kind of culture that fostered links between different sectors of society, including a particular political party.  The question arises also in respect of regulation and its quality.  It also applies to property incentives and tax incentives for the hotel industry or the refurbishment of a luxury ship on the back of the taxpayers.  This was one of the more extraordinary episodes referred to in one of the trio of books published over Christmas.  All of these matters turn on how the political system conducted itself and, in particular, how the Government conducted itself.  This does not point to individual wrongdoing in the criminal sense but it involves people making bad calls, bad decisions and wrong decisions.  The people are entitled to have those who made bad or incorrect decisions scrutinised in public.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on lax practices in the banking industry, the performance of the regulatory system and the Central Bank and the response of the relevant Departments and agencies, although he was slightly more anodyne than I would prefer.  I am pleased that it is not proposed to overly restrict the inquiry&rsquo;s remit but I will have to wait to see precisely how much is achieved by the two initial reports.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the existence of an underlying political tension which will continue to play out in public until the next general election, whenever that may be.  However, while this will undoubtedly remain a live political issue, the Government is responsible for more than simply protecting its own position.  I do not seek to wage a direct attack on particular individuals when I advise the Government to resist the temptation to use this process to protect itself.  The people need a comprehensive, warts and all, inquiry.  I may be accused of being naive in even allowing for such a possibility but, the suggestion of an Oireachtas inquiry having been rejected, I would prefer the proposed commission of inquiry to achieve something.  We all have an <Col N="194"/>interest in encouraging people to look to the future rather than back at what has happened.  The single biggest decision the Government could make would be to deal with these matters in public.  I concur with Senator Boyle and his colleagues in this regard.  A commission of inquiry in the United Kingdom is at present publicly scrutinising former senior Ministers about their decision to go to war and thereby sacrifice people&rsquo;s lives.  If that commission can openly inquire into such a subject, there is an unanswerable case for holding our inquiry predominantly in public, with the proviso that certain matters can be heard in private for given reasons.</P>
        <P>Public confidence will not be restored simply by asking people to trust us to produce a report in a year&rsquo;s time.  At that stage, any report deliberated on by an Oireachtas committee would be a <i>fait accompli</i>.  Let us be straight with each other rather than claim something is in public when in fact it is in private.  The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service will never be able to scrutinise these matters properly because the inquiry will have concluded.  I ask that the public not be told that black is white, that public is private or that secret is open.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Order Paper, we are making statements on banking, which is an appropriately broad description given the financial sector&rsquo;s impact on our economy over the past 18 months.  In reality, however, we are speaking about the value of a banking inquiry.  Strange as it may seem in light of the contributions by certain speakers, I believe we are unanimous on the need for an inquiry.  The decision to hold an inquiry having been made, we are now quibbling over the form it should take.  It was never going to be a Star Chamber or the political points-scoring exercise some in the Opposition and many in the media wanted.  The process has to be able to establish facts in the shortest possible period and the most cost effective manner.  Two major tribunals are about to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  One examined events in 1995 and the other began its deliberations in 1997.  In light of where we stand as a country, it is important that we find a better way of answering our questions.</P>
        <P>The proposed model has much to commend it.  Many assumptions have already been made about whether the inquiry will satisfy people&rsquo;s demands for openness.  I happen to believe it will be sufficiently open and responsive but these matters have not yet been determined.  The first step in the process will be the determination by an Oireachtas committee of the terms of reference for the commission and the manner in which the committee itself will deliberate the ensuing report.  That is an open process.  The legislation which governs commissions of inquiry does not prohibit a commission meeting partially or overwhelmingly in public and the deliberations of the Oireachtas committee will be open and full.</P>
        <P>This is a time-defined process.  The opening stages will have to be completed by 31 May.  I do not think four months will be needed, however.  The commission will have to be established before 30 June and will meet for only six months.  The Oireachtas committee will be able to decide how much more time will be needed once the commission has finished its work.  This process can be completed within 15 months.</P>
        <P>The process will involve establishing facts rather than identifying particular individuals or key events.  Throughout this crisis, the leader of the Labour Party has masked paranoia with leadership in his obsession with the bank guarantee.  I have no doubt the bank guarantee and the circumstances which led to it will be investigated.  The guarantee was the correct decision, however.  The prediction that the State would lose &euro;400 million has not come true.  In fact, revenue has accrued to the Exchequer even as we regularised our financial institutions.</P>
        <P>Other political points could be scored in regard to the resources that are being invested in recapitalisation and NAMA but these decisions will also have to be investigated by the banking inquiry.  At the end of the day, we must ask ourselves whether we are serious about discovering the truth at an acceptable price for the citizen and taxpayer.  Many in the Opposition simply <Col N="195"/>want to point fingers and score points.  Questions could even be asked about the much vaunted DIRT inquiry, which did valuable work on behalf of the Oireachtas.  I question what that process changed in the banking sector and who lost his or her job or faced any kind of legal sanctions as a result.  Were many of the people criticised by the Oireachtas investigation the very same people who continued to be employed within the financial institutions and who made decisions that led us to the crisis we are now experiencing?  I argue that what we need is a process whereby we get to the truth and the truth is acted upon because that is something we as a country have been singularly unsuccessful in doing in the past.</P>
        <P>Many of the contributions from the Opposition are exaggerating, misleading and misrepresenting what is likely to occur over the next 15 months.  Given the reportage that has accompanied the recent Government decision, I suppose this is politically fair game.  However, I am confident that the process that will follow is the one that will bring us to where we need to be in terms of establishing matters of fact and learning the political and societal lessons that need to be learned from this economic catastrophe.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>What has to be the result is that we do things differently and those who were individually responsible for bringing us to where we are will be removed from having any role in how we progress our financial systems and institutions and our regulatory system.  If this is not to be the case, then many of the criticisms being made now will be valid.  For those on the other side of the House and for many in the media to have decided now that a process is invalid, without seeing how such a process will be fully constructed and operated, is a negation of democracy in itself.  If people want their circus, if they want a Star Chamber, then we will not get the truth.  The facts will not be established nor will those who individually and collectively brought us to where we are be identified.  If the political system is serious about establishing that truth and making things better for the people who live in this country, we need to agree on the processes.  I believe the first step of this process, the scoping investigation by an Oireachtas committee, is the key element of this inquiry.  How that Oireachtas committee determines how the commission operates and how the Oireachtas committee subsequently decides on the findings of fact of that commission will determine how acceptable, transparent, open and public this process is.  On those grounds I ask for a degree of honesty that is singularly lacking among Opposition politicians at the moment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I listened with great interest to Senator Boyle&rsquo;s contribution and wish to make a couple of comments on it.  The inquiry should be held in public.  This is our money.  There has been a failure and it has been at the top.  We know the people involved; we do not need to identify them and know that largely they are still there.  I am not looking for what Senator Boyle called a circus or a Star Chamber.  I know well historically how they operate.  That is not what we want in a democracy.  However, we want answers and need them in public.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not believe the Abbeylara judgment is directly relevant and I am supported in this opinion by a distinguished professor from Maynooth who specialises in this area and who made it perfectly clear to the people on television within the past week.  He made the clear point which I had already thought of myself &mdash; I was very glad to be sustained in this view by so distinguished an academic &mdash; that an Oireachtas committee was perfectly competent and responsible to take decisions in the finding of facts.  There is a difference between the finding of facts and the determining and apportioning of guilt and this is where the Abbeylara judgment is relevant.  I do not believe it would be impeded by an inquiry carefully established &mdash; not to <Col N="196"/>be a Star Chamber because that would be wrong and not a court of law because that would transgress, apart from anything else, against the separation of powers &mdash; to examine matters of fact.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about the dating of the terms of reference as we understand it.  The Government has been very clear about this.  There will be a cut-off point which will ensure we will never know because it will neither be disclosed in private nor in public exactly what threats were used by the bankers which forced the Government into taking the crisis action it took and, in particular, into the rescuing of Anglo Irish Bank which, as I said at the time, was a great mistake.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has said there was a systemic failure in the bank which could lead to a systemic failure in the banking system.  &ldquo;Systemic&rdquo; is just jargon.  I do not believe for one second that if Anglo Irish Bank had been allowed to collapse, the Irish banking system would be any worse off and that we would have incorporated the element of moral and prudential risk.  The people concerned are going to be at it again and we only need to look at America where they are at it again already.  The ethos and the profiteering still obtain but at least in America they have open inquiries, bankers are hauled up and seen by the public and the proceedings are recorded in public.  In Britain, at the Iraq inquiry, former Prime Ministers, senior Cabinet Ministers and senior advisers are giving evidence in public and seen nightly on television.  I do not understand why we cannot do this.  The Committee of Public Accounts or some other specially constituted committee would be capable of undertaking this work on our behalf.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State makes an attempt to be honest about the situation and accepts that the international context provides only a partial explanation but he frontloads it as if it was the principal explanation.  With regard to the constitution of the inquiry, he invokes the notion of a wise man or woman &mdash; I imagine it is probably more likely to be a wise man, funnily enough, which I do not find very satisfying, as we are relying on some unspecified person.  In order to have confidence, we need to know exactly who this person will be and what their qualifications are.  I do not like the idea of relying on one person selected by the Minister.</P>
        <P>With regard to the role of the Oireachtas, the Minister of State says the Committee of Public Accounts would need greater expertise than it possesses.  That was also true of the DIRT inquiry.  The committee is able to summon witnesses, bring in expert advice and witnesses.  I am worried that this is a further downgrading and bypassing of the Oireachtas in a manner that the public will see as deeply duplicitous.  This is all of a piece with the financial ethos that still prevails in this country which is worrying for ordinary citizens.</P>
        <P>Within the last week I had a communication from a constituent who had sent a round robin letter on this subject.  He signed himself as &ldquo;a voter&rdquo;.  As always when a person signs a letter as &ldquo;a voter&rdquo;, I reply by saying I do not believe he or she is a voter and that he or she should prove it.  However, I do not care because I take up issues on their merits, not whether I might get a vote or two out of it.  The person concerned wrote back and said he was a voter, that he was, in fact, a former colleague of mine, a retired member of the staff of the College of the Sacred and Undivided Trinity near Dublin.  He drew my attention to a matter which was very worrying and which impacted on this whole matter of banking.  He is raising the matter of the Flavin-Fyffes-DCC case and asks if it is all right to put the opinion of a lower court and a court inspector above that of the Supreme Court.  This is worrying.  The outcome of this calls our entire financial ethos, the financial system and regulation into considerable question.  This is a case of a gentleman.  It is no longer <i>sub judice</i> so I can talk about it.  It is a matter of historical record.  He was a director of both DCC and Fyffes.  As a director of Fyffes he came into information about the possible future value of the shares.  He unloaded a considerable quantity of shares, thus making a vast profit.  The question was whether this was insider trading.  A decision was made on the matter by the Supreme Court.  The judgment of Mr. Justice Niall Fennelly was as follows:</P>
<Col N="197"/>
        <P LI="1">It used not to be considered any sort of sin to profit financially from the use of secret, private or privileged information.  That was how fortunes were made.  Now things are different.  To trade on the use of inside information is recognised for what it is.  It is a fraud on the market.  The insider who exploits his access to the special knowledge he enjoys for the purposes of the company in his capacity as executive or director of a company commits a crime.  He may be made, additionally, to answer for the profits he has made.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The deal involved in this case concerned &euro;108 million.  The question to be considered by the court was the negative trading information that was available to Mr. Flavin by way of his being a non-executive director of Fyffes, but not available to the market.  Mr. Justice Fennellysaid:</P>
        <P LI="1">The appeal turns on the assessment of the likely price effects of a limited body of comparatively simple facts.  In large measure, as I will be saying later, they are the sort of facts upon which common sense judgments and opinions can be formed without the input of an extraordinary degree of expertise.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In other words, the information possessed by Mr. Flavin could be analysed by someone who was not expert, an ordinary man in the street.  It would be perfectly clear to an ordinary person that the shares were going to tumble in the market in the comparatively near future and it would be prudent to unload them on the basis of that information.  The shares were sold by DCC in early February 2000 and on 20 March 2000 Fyffes issued a statement to the market on its trading situation.  Over two days its share price fell by 25%.  A 10% change is considered material for insider dealing cases.  This case was two and a half times the required standard for insider dealing, yet Ms Justice Laffoy found that this event was not of evidential value.  However, the Supreme Court judges disagreed with her.</P>
        <P>Mr. Appleby applied to the High Court advising of his concerns on the matter.  He sought the appointment of an inspector and the court approved the appointment of Mr. Bill Shipsey, SC.  Mr. Flavin then resigned.  The civil action taken by Fyffes only needed to show that Mr. Flavin, its former director, had dealt while in possession of information that was price sensitive.  That was inarguable.  As a director of both companies he unquestionably had that information.  Mr. Shipsey&rsquo;s report found that Flavin&rsquo;s decision to trade while he was in possession of the negative trading information was a genuine error.  The conclusion was that he had made an honest mistake.  Mr. Shipsey stated: &ldquo;Having questioned him at great length, I have concluded that Mr. Flavin genuinely believed he was not in possession of price sensitive information&rdquo;.  I would call that a fool&rsquo;s pardon.  It is difficult to believe that anyone in Mr. Flavin&rsquo;s position would not have been possessed of the necessary acumen.  We were told by the Supreme Court that any ordinary person would be able to analyse the information.  One did not have to be a director.  We are talking about a man who traded over many years as a brilliant exploiter of the stock market, yet Mr. Shipsey thought he was not capable of coming to a conclusion on the matter.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs.</P>
        <P>The relevance to banking is given to us in an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> on last Wednesday, 20 January.  The concluding paragraph is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is a palpable sense from the testimony given to Mr. Shipsey that corporate Ireland&rsquo;s top echelons have closed ranks to protect themselves.  It is understandable; Mr. Flavin was, they say, the epitome of Irish corporate probity.  His peers cannot damn him without, in effect, damning themselves.  But [here is the nub of it] they need look no further than the wreckage of the Irish banking system to realise the extent to which low standards in high places have damned us all.</P>
        <P FLI="0">After all this, a decision was taken by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to take no further action in regard to insider trading at DCC.  That is an astonishing decision and <Col N="198"/>requires explanation.  How could it be that when the facts are established that this information was the kind contemplated by rules governing insider trading and it was in the possession of this man, nothing was done?  Nothing has been done about this by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda or the Financial Regulator despite the fact that DCC had to pay massive damages of &euro;41 million and yet that was seen as merely some kind of error of judgment, an understandable misunderstanding.</P>
        <P>That is the kind of thing that, in the same way as the banking scandals, has done immense damage to the reputation of this country in terms of the standards of corporate governance.  The phrase &ldquo;corporate governance&rdquo; is bandied about often but in the context of this case and of the corruption of the banks, the fact that so many people are still in place makes them as bad if not worse than the bishops of the Roman Catholic Church who have taken a similar stance of digging in their heels.  In this situation we were right to be concerned.  We were right to demand answers and we were right to demand them in public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this timely debate.  I note much time has been spent on the investigation into the banks, which is terribly important.  Senator Norris is correct that we must ensure our banking system is of the highest standard and has the highest standards the public will accept.  It is also important to have international standards in order to have standing internationally.</P>
        <P>At the time the banking crisis occurred the Government did the correct thing.  First, it stabilised the banks to ensure the banking system would not fail.  That was the purpose of the Government&rsquo;s stance.  It has done an important job in that regard.  We have now stabilised the banks.  We all know why we had a failure in the banking system.  Banks lent too much money.  They borrowed cheap money from Europe.  The squeeze on the banks to send that money back began when Lehman Brothers crashed.  It was very simple.  The over-borrowing from outside the State will be evident when we hold the inquiry.  The world banking crisis caused our banks to collapse because they had over-borrowed.  We must ask why the management in the banks over-borrowed.  That will be what the inquiry will set out to do.</P>
        <P>I have observed people from the banking world attend Oireachtas committees.  I do not believe some committee members are up to scratch in terms of asking the right questions.  A specialist organisation is required to carry out the scoping inquiry which will flush out all that happened behind the scenes.  That is vital.  The Government has correctly identified how that can be done.  When the information comes to light in the report, which it will do, then it can be discussed in public.  This is the whole question of credibility on which this inquiry should stand or fall.  Whatever is found will be discussed publicly in the Oireachtas, which is very important.</P>
        <P>I do not want to spend any more time on the inquiry because the banks have a more important function than that.  Our whole industry and commerce, and the life of the country, depends totally on a good banking system and how it functions.  We all know there has been a credit squeeze since the banking crisis.  All small businesses and industry have been badly strapped for cash.  Small companies which could normally have traded themselves out of difficulty, even with the world downturn, have found that, because of the short credit situation, they have had to lay off staff.  This has been particularly seen in the construction industry, which has collapsed.</P>
        <P>The construction industry played a major role in the strides we made for some ten to 12 years.  However, it must be said that developers and builders over-built with regard to the supply that was required in the market.  When something like that happens, it is because of bad business decisions.  It is important to examine both banking and the construction industry in conjunction.  When construction was doing extremely well, as we all know, anything up to &euro;25 billion in tax was coming in from that industry.  While nobody was complaining about that, <Col N="199"/>everybody had a fair idea this could not last, but nobody was prepared to shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  Now, in an example we heard last week, a lady running a small business in Wicklow who had not paid &euro;250 on her account was threatened with the closure of her business account.  We cannot allow that type of thing to happen in a banking system which the Government is supporting.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the EBS-Bloxham Stockbrokers report on mortgages.  We have a major problem in that 35,000 people are more than six months in arrears on their mortgages and a further 20,000 people are more than a year in arrears.  The Government cannot stand idly by and not ensure that proper regulations are put in place in the banking system on the basis of the EBS-Bloxham report.  There is an opportunity with the Finance Bill to legislate for sub-prime lending.  The banks we are supporting at present are going along with the regulation we have put in, although we have not put in enough regulation.  However, we need to regulate the whole banking market and there is an opportunity to do so through this inquiry to ensure a better, fairer banking system.</P>
        <P>Joe Public, who is supplying the money to keep the banks in business, must have a fair shake.  We are not suggesting for a minute that people should default on their mortgages or that mortgages should not be paid.  We are suggesting that a moratorium of at least two years be introduced to allow people to add on to the end of their mortgage.  Also, we must ensure this operates across the whole banking system, not just for these six banks, because it is mainly the other banks which are causing us problems.</P>
        <P>We must ensure that good regulations are in place in the banking system when the inquiry is finished.  We generally know how the whole situation has happened but it is important we do not make the same mistakes again, and that we put checks and balances into the system to ensure we have a more hands-on approach to the banking system.  This is an opportunity to do that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important the inquiry is carried out and it must be done in a proper, methodical way.  We have all seen what Star Chambers do.  We have had inquiries for the past 12 or 14 years but what did they do?  They made already wealthy people in the legal profession wealthier.  We need to be very careful in future to ensure we do not have a similar episode, with inquiries running for so long and costing the taxpayer close to &euro;1 billion, which could happen.  What we were doing in Dublin Castle, chasing people for &pound;100 here or &pound;500 there that they got as political donations, was crazy.  The really criminal situation, if one read the newspapers last week, was that 20 or 30 people became millionaires over and over through making inquiries into people who were getting &pound;100 or &pound;500.  That is the scandal.  Hopefully, we will ensure we do not have a continuation of that because it was the worst value for money the taxpayer ever got.  This is proved by the fact most people are saying we should close that inquiry down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need for plain speaking in regard to the discussion we are having.  The reason there will not be a public inquiry into the causes of our banking crisis is that the Taoiseach and his predecessor do not want to find themselves in a situation where they are being questioned or interrogated in public regarding their role in the creation of the current difficulty.  That is it.  The Taoiseach, who previously acted as Minister for Finance, was at the heart of the regulatory regime and the financial environment that created the difficulty our country is now dealing with.  The single reason this will not happen in public is that the Taoiseach and his party do not want it to happen in public because they do not want to find themselves in a situation where the public can see them questioned and challenged on the role they played in creating that difficulty.</P>
        <P>I have heard other colleagues refer to the Chilcot inquiry that is taking place in the UK at present into the reasons the British Government took its country to war.  If that Government can mount an investigation in public about why its country went to war, why are we as a <Col N="200"/>country not capable of delivering a process and a platform that in public will question and seek to understand the causes of the huge, historic difficulty our country now finds itself facing?</P>
        <P>If one types &ldquo;Chilcot inquiry&rdquo; into an Internet search, one can see the process taking place live.  Members of the public have a right to attend and to understand what has happened because of the war their country is in, and the loss of life the country faced which has been incurred in Iraq and elsewhere.  We have heard members of the Government offer justifications as to why the inquiry cannot be held in public.  They have said there is not the level of expertise required in the Oireachtas to do this work properly, but we are the people elected to take responsibility.  Members of this Chamber and the D&aacute;il supported the Government and passed legislation when it was needed to allow the banking system to survive, to put in place an agency to enable the banks to be kept in place and monitored.  We are the people, to whom the public look to be responsible, to lead the country and take responsibility for the national finances.  However, the Government concludes that we are not capable of carrying out an investigation into why this happened.   The Abbeylara judgment will be rolled out as a reason the investigation cannot take place in public.  Many of my colleagues have spoken about how irrelevant that argument is to this discussion.  This investigation will not be about the guilt of individuals but having an forensic understanding of the role agencies and bodies played in creating this huge mess that will have to be paid for by this and the next generation of taxpayers.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler who has considerable expertise and knowledge in this area has said we know the reasons, on which I have to completely disagree with him.  We do not know how this crisis happened.  We do not know why the Irish regulator stood by and watched the banking system put in place the seeds of its own destruction.  We do not know why there was complete regulatory failure for three, four or five years in the run-up to implementation of the banking guarantee scheme.  Furthermore, we do not know why the then Government decided to put in place a regime of tax breaks that supported one sector of the economy, despite the fact that members of my political party, to whom the Government would not listen, and organisations such as the OECD and the IMF said it was risky, not sustainable and would create trouble for the future.  This inquiry is relevant not only because of the cost with which the taxpayer will have to deal or the tens of thousands of jobs that have been lost owing to what has happened in the banking system, but also because if we do not do this work properly, we will run the risk of the country finding itself in the same situation, facing the same costs as a result of the same mistakes being made again.</P>
        <P>A recent study of the history of financial crises was published in the United States by two respected academics who titled their book, <i>This Time Is Different</i>.  It shows how governments of all persuasions, regulators, shareholders and commentators, each time a country was in the middle of a huge boom which appeared to be unsustainable, convinced themselves that this time it was different, that it was not the same as the last crash and that the boom would be sustainable.  We cannot allow that to happen anymore because the cost of economic crashes is increasing.  The cost of this crash and the effect it has had on the national finances and will have on future generations are immense.  It is simply unthinkable that this would happen again.</P>
        <P>It is also unthinkable that putting in place a process such as this will placate and satisfy taxpayers who will have to pay for it.  It appears to be easy to lose one&rsquo;s sense of outrage about what is happening.  It is easy to assume that all of this is normal, that it is just part of the new political events with which we will have to deal.  It is easy to say that what we need to do is to default back into normal political and business life and that everything will be okay.  However, at the heart of the current economic depression, most of which we inflicted on ourselves, is the political failure of the Government to challenge the decisions the institutions made, to say they were unwise or unsustainable, and to sound warning bells.</P>
<Col N="201"/>
        <P>The process that is to be put in place in private is being put in place for explicitly political reasons.  This is being done to allow the Government to avoid being subject to criticism and castigation.  However, far more worrying is the fact that we will deprive ourselves of the opportunity to learn the lessons that should be learned and participate in the process to make sure this will not happen again.  That is truly unforgivable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  Senator Donohoe was right in saying there would not be a public inquiry because those in government were afraid to be held accountable in public for a failed policy of regulation at State level, in the Central Bank, the office of the regulator, the Department of Finance, the Cabinet room and at the top in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office.  We need &mdash; to use that dreaded clich&eacute; &mdash; openness and transparency more than ever.  As Senator Donohoe said, there is an economic depression and a malaise among the people, not because they want to be depressed but because they were placed in a position where the banking system almost collapsed and they, in turn, lost everything.  I do not subscribe for one minute to the idea that there should be a witch hunt, a star chamber or anything like it because I am not interested in such an approach.  What I am interested in was touched on by Senator Quinn who spoke on the Order of Business about brand Ireland, rebranding Ireland as a country with a highly educated workforce, open for business to the world &mdash; the west and the east &mdash; and an economic tiger ready to do battle again.  Unfortunately, that will not happen. </P>
        <P>The Green Party huffed and puffed and, unfortunately, blinked.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, Senator Boyle and others spoke about the need for an open inquiry.  They went to the Cabinet and had a meeting with the Taoiseach behind the scenes but the outcome is that we will have a secret private inquiry.</P>
        <P>Bruce Arnold wrote about the impotent bank inquiry being the product of a castrated D&aacute;il.  Is he right?  He might not be far wrong.  This is not about distant individuals but about the operation of the State in not being managed properly.  The banking system in Ireland has managed to inflict significant damage to itself, as Senator Donohoe said.  It did so by abandoning the rules governing the availability of credit, borrowing and the granting of loans and it lost a sense of morality, value and respect for people.  The ordinary staff member in the Bank of Ireland in Wilton which I frequent or the TSB bank is abused and blamed because he or she is on the front line rather than their superiors.  That is unfortunate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the American banking system was in turmoil, an inquiry was immediately initiated and the people had results <i>pronto</i>.  Compare that to what has happened here; belatedly the Government has proposed an inquiry, the outcome of which will be a hodge podge of a commissioned report and a commission of investigation.  The best way to restore trust in the banking system is to have an open and transparent inquiry to delve into the system, Government economic policy and the lack of regulation, not only during the past 12 months but also in the period leading up to the recapitalisation of the banks.</P>
        <P>The current situation is predominantly the product of the Ahern era.  In the case of the Murphy report, to their credit, Archbishop Martin and Cardinal Brady asked everybody concerned to co-operate.  They told everybody to surrender documents, hand over everything that was required and co-operate fully.  What happens if our banking people decide otherwise and say they will not participate or will only co-operate partially with the inquiry?  It is incumbent upon the Minister to issue a decree that all members of banks &mdash; governors, directors, chief executive officers and those involved in staffing &mdash; are to comply fully with this investigation.  If they do not, the banking inquiry will be a wasted opportunity and will let those who need to be brought to account off the hook.</P>
        <P>The public has lost faith in the Government, the regulatory authority and the banking fraternity itself.  Deputy George Lee stated: &ldquo;The collapse of trust has led to the breakdown of the <Col N="202"/>banking system and a further deterioration in faith in the regulatory system&rdquo;.  We need to allow our banking system to gain trust and work with the people.  I doubt that what is being proposed by the Government will achieve that.  We must demand answers and we must have results from this inquiry.  If we do not have accountability, what will happen in the future?  What will happen to the ordinary person, an gn&aacute;th duine?  We have an opportunity to work with what we have.  We may not like it but it is an opportunity that must not be lost, because if it is, the noose will hang empty of those who brought this upon us.</P>
        <P>I hope this inquiry will show not just what went wrong and the bad decisions and policies, but how we can prevent it from happening again.  We must never again have a situation in which ordinary people, small and medium-sized enterprises and those who put away their life savings are left penniless.  A woman came into my office yesterday who, because of the malaise in the banking fraternity, has lost everything.  She is left with nothing because she saved money for a rainy day or for her retirement.  This inquiry must work.  I am afraid I have no faith in what has been proposed, but I hope I am wrong.  The Minister must listen to the clarion suggestions being given by the Opposition, not just here but also in the other House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this important subject.  I look forward to hearing from the Government over the next few weeks a more fleshed out presentation of what the banking inquiry will comprise.  I am at one with my colleagues in saying I hope and demand that it be as public and as transparent as possible.  In the words of the old adage, not only does justice need to be done, but it must be seen to be done.  There are many people out there who want to see hard questions asked of politicians, regulators and bankers in public so we can pin down the policy decisions that have brought us to our current state of economic chaos and by whom they were made.</P>
        <P>We are in a state of economic chaos and we can only hope that from the embers of the Celtic tiger we will be in a position to achieve growth in the economy and rebuild the country.  It will require a new type of politics and a new ethos in both public and economic life.  I will repeat what I have said here many times over the last number of years: regrettably, greed took over our society from top to bottom.  A person&rsquo;s standing in society was no longer related to the person&rsquo;s contribution to society or to their community but was based on an appalling flaunting of wealth and property.  When the new culture of celebrity took over, with the back page of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> telling us whose birthday party took place where, and became more important than real news stories about public life, investment and job creation, we went down a very sad road.  A whole new generation of people took over as the men and women to look up to, and we lost our values and sense of proportion.  It is no wonder people were under enormous pressure to borrow money they could not afford to pay back and, shockingly, banks provided funding for the sort of lifestyles that could not be sustained.</P>
        <P>When the banking inquiry concludes, the answers will not be surprising.  Too much money was given out, improperly, to too many people for projects that were dreams rather than reality.  However, we are where we are, as the clich&eacute; goes, and we must try to work our way out of here.  It is to be hoped the inquiry will at least allow the Irish public some degree of satisfaction in terms of hard questions being asked and, more importantly, answered.  From the top of our political and banking establishments to the bottom and from one regulatory body to another, there are profound questions to be asked.</P>
        <P>The problem was the loss of proportion and the political choices that were made, particularly in the period from 1998-99 to 2001-02.  In the 1977 election manifesto we probably saw the worst example of buying of votes through budgetary policy, and it was a disaster that brought the country to the verge of economic ruin.  We thought we had learned from the experience, but there was a repeat of that sort of policy in the latter years of the 1990s and the early years of the new millennium.  There are substantive political questions to be asked about the decision <Col N="203"/>making process at that time.  As Senator Donohoe said, there is a large body of evidence that in terms of our reliance on the property market, and from the points of view of taxation and job creation, we were going far down the wrong road, yet we continued with those policies.</P>
        <P>I concede, from the perspective of those who are in politics, that it is often difficult to say &ldquo;stop.&rdquo;  If money is available to carry out projects which in the short term are seen to bring in taxes and create employment, demands that an alternative course be charted are not popular.  There was not much protest from most sections of the political establishment, although a number of figures will stand out, to their eternal credit, for calling a spade a spade.  My party colleague Deputy Richard Bruton, for example, was sound in his economic assessment.</P>
        <P>The subjects of the policy decisions taken, the failure of the regulator and the broader policy on banking are worthy and demand the deepest possible level of investigation.  As one or two of my colleagues have said, we are not looking for a witch hunt.  If one reads the newspapers or listens to chat shows on the radio, there does appear to be a certain witch-hunt mentality, but that will not butter anyone&rsquo;s bread.  We need a calm, reflective, yet thorough analysis of what went wrong.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is obvious that the more public the inquiry, the better.  I concede that for the benefit of the country it may well be necessary to do work relating to sensitive economic and banking information in private, but it is important to assure the public that the investigation will be thorough and complete while ensuring as much as possible of the inquiry will be held in public.  We do not want a tribunal or committee that will take ten to 12 years to report.</P>
        <P>I was a Member of the Lower House when tribunals were set up in the late 1990s with the expectation of an early conclusion.  I saw an image of a much younger David McCullagh, the RTE political correspondent, on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; last Sunday week.  It was from the autumn of 1998 or 1999 and he was proclaiming that the Moriarty tribunal would complete its work by the following spring or summer.  He was only a decade out.  We are not seeking a tribunal of inquiry.  A mechanism is needed which is much more precise, definitive and conclusive and which will allow the questions on people&rsquo;s minds to be asked clearly and precisely and as publicly as possible.  For all our sakes, I hope the Government gets the balance right and that we learn from the political, economic and banking mistakes for which the country is paying a high price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I wish the Minister for Finance the best with his illness but I am disappointed he is not present.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe put his finger on it when he said there should be a great deal of straight talking.  One wonders about all the fuss over a banking inquiry and how sophisticated it needs to be.  I am most disappointed by the Government&rsquo;s attitude.  It is an indictment of the Government parties that an Oireachtas joint committee is unable to conduct the investigation.  When one considers the investigatory work done by D&aacute;il committees over the years, one has to wonder why the Government is taking this position.  Oireachtas Members lead the country and the Government is saying Members who are elected to run the country are not able to carry out an investigation into what went wrong in our banking system.  It is a shocking indictment of the Government parties that they would say that about themselves, given they have a majority on parliamentary committees.  The Taoiseach is saying his own colleagues in this House are not capable of carrying out an inquiry into the banking system.</P>
        <P>Such an inquiry should be simple.  Not many questions have to be answered or conclusions reached.  Government parties did not listen to what people were saying over recent years.  Many Members, during debates, referred to 100% and 120% mortgages and the Government did nothing about them.  It was crazy that people could take out a mortgage to buy and furnish their houses and to buy one or two cars.  The bankers knew what was happening and the <Col N="204"/>Government must have known as well.  It would not take much organisation to bring in the previous regulators and ask them why they did not do something about this and why, when Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s loan book went bananas during the final few years of the bubble, they did not act.  That is unbelievable and I cannot understand why the Minister of State said the Governor of the Central Bank pointed out that elected Members who run the country would not be capable of carrying out this investigation into the banking fiasco of recent years.  That is an unbelievable comment.  If I was a member of a Government party, I would take issue with these comments at a parliamentary party meeting.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government failed in its duty.  The McCarthy report clearly illustrates how Exchequer finances went out of control from 2003 onwards.  The spending gap widened and surely the Department of Finance saw this.  Officials should have done something about it but, to bridge the gap, the construction boom was fuelled by repealing section 23 tax breaks.  There were many section 23 developments in counties along the Shannon basin such as Roscommon, Leitrim and Longford which are in trouble now.  Longford featured on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; last night and the problems that have resulted were highlighted.  These developments were built in many other towns and tax breaks were provided for the building of hotels and car parks.  The Government closed off section 23 by saying builders who had planning permission had to complete their work by 31 December 2006.  There was a race to finish which put pressure on all sectors of the construction industry because workers were scarce.  This drove prices higher and fuelled the bubble.  The Department of Finance should have known this would happen.  It would not be difficult to ask officials in the Department why they abolished that tax break in 2006.  A general election was pending and the Government wanted to take in additional revenue to keep the coffers full and to ensure the gap in expenditure would not widen.  The officials involved are still in place and they know what happened.  They were culpable in all this.  They were part of the problem.</P>
        <P>These simple questions could be asked by an Oireachtas committee.  It would not take long, following the appointment of a wise man, to find out what happened.  I do not know which wise man or woman will be appointed to head up the Government inquiry but I presume if it was four or five years ago, the wise man would probably have been Se&aacute;n Fitzpatrick and the wise woman would have been Gillian Bowler.  I do not know who will be the wise man or woman on this occasion.  Many wise men were interviewed on television during the boom and they all had their own view.  The people want to know immediately what happened because they are suffering.  Bank managers are calling them up to ask them to pay their loans where they have lost their jobs.  Ordinary people, for whom I have much sympathy, are experiencing great hardship.</P>
        <P>If a simple investigative committee was put in place, it would ask plenty of questions and would, more than likely, get some of the answers in a short period of time with little cost to the Exchequer.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their considered and useful contributions to this issue.  I will attempt to respond to as many as possible of the points raised by Senators in the time available to me.</P>
        <P>As Members know, last week the Minister for Finance announced the Government&rsquo;s decision to set up two reviews and a statutory commission of inquiry to complete an expert, authoritative and structured examination of the financial crisis and its impact in Ireland to understand where the crisis in the banking system originated and assess whether lessons can be learned to inform our future management of the sector, both in regard to institutions and their management and direction and in regard to the management of risks and stability issues within the regulatory and Government systems.</P>
<Col N="205"/>
        <P>Over the coming months, a significant amount of work needs to be completed to return our banking system to health.  We need to complete the first stage of the critical transfer of assets to NAMA, we need to agree the banks&rsquo; restructuring plans and their future capital requirements and we need to progress the consolidation of the building society sector.  I remind the House that the banking system is still fragile; we are not out of the woods yet.  It is important that the work, as outlined by the Minister of State, is completed before we turn our attention to the formal inquiry we all agree must take place.  That is why the Government proposes the multi-stage investigation.  That investigation will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I wish to address the issue of holding the inquiry in public which was raised by Senators Alex White, Norris, Donohoe and others.  Providing for a commission of investigation to conduct its business in private would allow for the restructuring of the banking sector and the recapitalisation of relevant institutions to proceed in advance of a public debate by the Oireachtas committee.  Under the legislation, the commission would be able to conduct specific parts of its investigation, for example, into the affairs of individual institutions, in private.  This will minimise the risk of interfering with the ongoing Garda and Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement investigations.  Later stages of the commission&rsquo;s work dealing with the other institutions and the broader system could, subject to the agreement of the parties involved, take place in public.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas will be involved at each stage of the planned inquiry process.  An appropriate Oireachtas committee, the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which would seem to be the most relevant, will meet the governor and the independent expert at the outset of their work to be briefed on the members&rsquo; priorities for investigation.  The two preliminary reports, when completed, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas committee will be invited to consider the findings of the reports.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference and draft Government order to establish the statutory commission of investigation will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the report of the commission of investigation will, when completed, be laid before the Oireachtas for further consideration by the committee.  It is open to the committee to hold public hearings on the report.</P>
        <P>There has been some reference to the DIRT inquiry as a possible model for the inquiry into the financial crisis but investigative work in that inquiry was done by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  An Oireachtas committee cannot be a court of judgment on private individuals and cannot find on disputed issues of fact.  That is why the Government has decided to adopt the commission of inquiry mechanism and why it has chosen a framework for investigation that is most effective and efficient.</P>
        <P>For an investigation to proceed speedily and cost effectively, it must be able to conduct its business in private.  The only other alternative that allows us to investigate a matter conclusively is a tribunal of inquiry.  The D&aacute;il and, I believe, a majority in this House are unanimous in the view that a tribunal is too expensive and too protracted.  That was why the Oireachtas enacted the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the two reviews and the proposed statutory commission of investigation will provide the Government and the Oireachtas with the necessary information to identify the lessons to be learned from the crisis and to put in place the necessary systems and structures to manage more effectively banking and the financial services sector.  It will also enable banks to resume their essential role in the economy, the extension of credit to business with opportunities to invest.  This, together with the initiatives the Government is pursuing to restore competitiveness and put the public finances in order, will result in Ireland being well placed to take advantage of the economic recovery beginning to take hold around the world.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, and thank him for the kind and courteous way in which he dealt with people in Mullingar today.  I really appreciated that.</P>
        <P>I raise this matter because of a meeting held in Ballinasloe on Sunday, 17 January 2010.  The Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association convened the meeting under the chairmanship of the new president, John Bryan.  It was a very successful meeting attended by 700 people.  All of the people there had been affected by flooding.  It is hard for me to explain how awful it is for people who have not been devastated by it.  It is a most extraordinary situation which I have discussed at length with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh.</P>
        <P>The most fundamental need now is for a single agency which will take control of the maintenance of the River Shannon and its tributaries.  That is the bottom line.  The IFA said that for 70 years nothing has been done in regard to siltation in the river.  I have listed the organisations involved before but I will do so again.  The ESB, the Office of Public Works, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the fisheries board, Bord na M&oacute;na and Shannon Navigation all have vested interests.  All do very worthwhile work; I am not condemning or castigating any of the organisations.  However, when there is a crisis or when serious maintenance is needed, none will take responsibility and spend the money to look after the river.  There was an obligation on Bord na M&oacute;na to provide silting ponds, which it did.  However, who monitored it or who was responsible to ensure there was ongoing maintenance of those siltation ponds?</P>
        <P>Numerous reports have been done, including the Rydell report after the 1954 flood and the 2000 and 2001 reports, which were good reports done by the late Se&aacute;n Doherty, may he rest in peace.  We do not really need more reports. We need action, with a single agency taking responsibility and the lead.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State attended that meeting and spoke about giving more powers to the Office of Public Works.  That is welcome but it is not necessarily that it will have the authority to manage the ESB or national parks and wildlife service.  It is outrageous that a small fish can hold up the drainage of the Shannon or that siltation cannot be spread on the land because it would affect flora and fauna.  While I am as green as the next person and I aspire to protecting the environment all the time, the devastation and the loss of livelihood for those living on the banks of the Shannon is indescribable.  These people are still suffering and farmers are anxious about how they will feed their animals.  This is the third time the callows of the Shannon have flooded this year.  It is devastating for families, businesses and the midlands in general, along with Cork and the other areas that were flooded.</P>
        <P>I commend the IFA and wish the new president, Mr. John Bryan, well.  His foresight in giving Mr. Michael Silke, a responsible officer in the IFA, the lead in dealing with flooding, when he knows what it is like to be devastated by flooding, is to be welcomed.  I look forward to engaging further with the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who welcomes the opportunity to outline current and future developments in flood risk management.</P>
<Col N="207"/>
        <P>The Minister of State again extends his sympathy to all those affected by the floods of November 2009 and who may still be suffering the aftermath of that extreme weather event.  He has expressed before his deep upset at the level of damage and loss he witnessed, and his appreciation of the great work delivered locally by the emergencies services and other State agencies.</P>
        <P>In the short intervening period, the Government has provided substantial additional funding for the areas affected by the November floods.  These funds include an initial sum of &euro;10 million provided for a humanitarian aid scheme to alleviate hardship caused by the flooding, &euro;2 million allocated for a targeted fodder aid scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, &euro;14 million provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for post-flooding clean-up by local authorities and an increase to &euro;50 million in the capital allocation of the Office of Public Works&rsquo; allocation for flood risk management for 2010.</P>
        <P>At national level, the need for a proactive approach to the management of flood risk was recognised by the report of the flood policy review group.  The Government decided in September 2004 to adopt the recommendations of the review and the OPW was assigned the responsibilities of lead agency for flood risk management.  The OPW&rsquo;s strategy for the management of flood risks is based on the recommendations of the review.</P>
        <P>The main work programme to deliver on that strategy is the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme.  This programme has commenced on the River Lee and River Dodder.  The objective is to complete the programme nationally to meet the requirements set out in the EU floods directive.  That directive requires that the level of flood risk in each catchment, including the Shannon, be identified and a prioritised plan of measures be drawn up to address the areas of significant flood risk.  The OPW will take the lead co-ordinating role in carrying out these studies.</P>
        <P>Moreover, by the transposition of the EU floods directive into national law, the OPW will become the national competent authority with overall responsibility for all matters relating to the assessment and management of flood risk in the State.  The OPW will therefore be in a position to bring together the various stakeholders to develop a co-ordinated flood risk management plan for each river catchment. The OPW is committed to engaging in comprehensive consultative processes in all situations where its work programmes are likely to affect the remits of other organisations.</P>
        <P>The OPW will be commissioning the Shannon flood risk assessment and management study, which is expected to commence in mid-2010.  It will involve all the main stakeholders who have a role in the management of the Shannon being consulted, including the ESB, Waterways Ireland and relevant local authorities.  The study will look at all options for dealing with areas of significant flood risk.  The objective of this exercise is to determine relative roles and define relative responsibilities of all the main bodies involved with the Shannon with a view to ensuring all flood risk factors are identified and managed in a co-ordinated way.  This study will meet the requirements of the EU floods directive for the River Shannon catchment.  The Minister of State wishes also to emphasise that, pending completion of the study for the Shannon catchment, the OPW, through its minor works scheme, will work with the relevant local authorities to identify areas that may benefit from interim localised mitigation measures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the maintenance begin?  That was not mentioned in the reply.  I understand the OPW is responsible for maintenance but according to this reply it will be responsible for co-ordinating and liaising with all relevant bodies.  There is no work plan for maintaining and cleaning the River Shannon to stop it from flooding.  I would be grateful if that message could be passed on to the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.</P>

	<P>There were two parts to the reply.  The main part was that the expected flood risk assessment and management study will be undertaken from mid-2010 but, in the interim, through its minor works scheme, the OPW will work with the relevant local authorities to identify areas that may benefit from localised mitigation measures while that study is being conducted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>This Adjournment matter also relates to flooding, in Donegal of all places.  We are getting use to that happening, even though there are hills and mountains.  There were incidences of flooding in two particular areas and I am going to refer to Raphoe in the heart of the Finn valley where, in 2006 and 2007, there were a number of flooding events.  Following that, in conjunction with Donegal County Council and the Office of Public Works, Jacobs Consulting Engineers were appointed to carry out a comprehensive study.  They have now completed the study and have issued the final version of the flood study which has been accepted by both Donegal County Council and the OPW.</P>
        <P>The flood study began with computer modelling of the town&rsquo;s drainage system using survey data provided by the council and land survey information provided by the OPW.  Once the drainage system was modelled, the consultants recreated the flood events of 2006 and 2007 using local weather data for those days and predicted the flood depths at particular locations.  These were then compared with the actual flood depths that occurred on the ground before the model was fine-tuned.  The engineers then considered the properties in the area and estimated the monetary value of the damage to properties in Raphoe if no remedial works were undertaken by either the council or the OPW.  This assessment was based on the numbers and types of properties that would be affected.  This is the common benchmark for justification of all flood relief schemes.  The engineers found the damages would amount to &euro;4,424,000 if nothing was done.  They then assessed the environmental constraints of the Raphoe area to ensure any proposal would not adversely impact on the sites of cultural, historical and environmental significance in the area, of which there are many.</P>
        <P>Once complete, the engineers initially considered 20 flood relief options, of which 13 were structural and seven were non-structural.  Initial screening discounted eight of the options, four structural and four non-structural.  The remaining 12 options were considered in more detail.  Three of the remaining 12, one of which was structural and two of which were non-structural, were then recommended.  These broke down into public awareness, individual property flood resistance and channel maintenance.  The remaining nine options &mdash; one non-structural and eight structural &mdash; were then considered in more detail.</P>
        <P>Without going into them, the study found that no option would lead to the complete alleviation of flooding in Raphoe.  The engineers considered the value of the benefits of each option to the town of Raphoe against the cost of implementation.  This appraisal found that six options were technically and economically viable and capable of reducing the flood risk in Raphoe, namely, land use management, storage, increased conveyance, construction of defences, overland run-off and overland run-off into flood areas.  The report of the engineers found that the six options would need to be subject to feasibility studies and evaluated in more detail.  It recommended that further investigation be undertaken in Raphoe, including a survey of property thresholds etc.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the project appears to involve the council, in conjunction with and with the prior approval of the OPW, in seeking to commission a feasibility study of the potential viable options as indicated in the report.  I understand there has been communication between the council and the OPW and that the former is waiting for approval to proceed with a feasibility study which I hope will be undertaken in the short term.  While it may not be possible tonight to be given a date for approval, I want to highlight that the council has done as much work as it can and that the matter is now one for the OPW.  Were approval forthcoming, I <Col N="209"/>understand the feasibility study could commence immediately.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who wishes to thank the Senator for the opportunity to inform the House of the current position on the Raphoe pre-feasibility flood study.  The Minister of State is pleased to say the study has been completed and identified a number of possible options aimed at addressing the flood problem in Raphoe.  As the Senator knows, Donegal County Council considers Raphoe to be one of the most persistent and problematic flood areas in County Donegal.  It has flooded repeatedly in the past 30 years but most significantly in September 2006 and June 2007.  Following flash flooding on 12 June 2007, numerous homes and businesses sustained damage when the town&rsquo;s drainage system was overwhelmed by rain.  The Minister of State understands approximately 50 business and residential premises were affected.</P>
        <P>Following this event, the OPW, in conjunction with Donegal County Council, appointed consultants to carry out the pre-feasibility study of the flooding problem in Raphoe.  The study was completed in August 2009.  In parallel with this study, OPW engineers were in consultation with Donegal County Council and, as a result, a number of short-term measures to alleviate the problem were identified and implemented by the council.</P>
        <P>The objective of a pre-feasibility study is to identify the source of the flooding problem and potentially viable flood risk management measures for a given area.  In the case of Raphoe, this included the collection and examination of hydrological and hydraulic data, outline flood hazard and risk mapping and, following the identification of potentially suitable flood risk management options, a technical, economic and outline environmental assessment of these potential options.</P>
        <P>Raphoe is surrounded to the north and west by steep-sided hills and a small, predominately culverted stream flows in a southerly direction through the town.  This stream is a small tributary within the Foyle catchment, draining an area around Raphoe of approximately 2.7 sq. km.  The report found that during periods of intense rainfall, water was quickly conveyed onto the road network surrounding Raphoe.  The volume of water and the associated high velocities mean that the majority of the run-off water flows unimpeded into central Raphoe along the road network.</P>
        <P>The report has also identified a number of potentially suitable flood risk management options that require further detailed elaboration.  Towards this end, OPW officials are meeting the council on Friday, 5 February.  The next step will be the development of an outline design for the option considered to be the most technically feasible and economically viable.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State wishes to assure the House that his officials, in conjunction with the local authority, are at an advanced stage in the identification of appropriate flood relief measures that will alleviate future flooding in the Raphoe area.  Once the appropriate measures have been agreed by the OPW and the local authority, the OPW will be available to assist in ensuring these are implemented at the earliest possible date.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House to address this Adjournment matter.  Since the two previous motions also referred to flooding, it is not surprising he is answering all of them.  Obviously, my motion is more specific, in that it deals with the <Col N="210"/>impact of the recent adverse weather on the primary, secondary and local road networks.  The Minister of State will understand that many roads have disintegrated and are now in a terrible state.  The weather conditions could not have been better for breaking up roads.  First, there was flooding which was followed by a serious freeze, a thaw and then more flooding.  Water lodged under roads and disintegrated them.</P>
        <P>County Waterford, from where I come, has experienced particular problems, especially on high ground.  There was a considerable snowfall on the mountains and when the snow thawed, the water from the mountains added to the heavy volume of rainwater.  The Minister of State can imagine the serious flooding and damage this caused in the creation of potholes and channels and removal of culverts.  There have been road closures in county and city areas.  Owing to damage to the edge of roads, they have become almost impassable.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport and the Taoiseach have stated no additional funds will be provided for local authorities.  This is a disappointing stance to adopt.  If roads are allowed to disintegrate and fall below a certain standard, reinstating them will prove costly.  If we do not halt the damage &mdash; we are not yet out of winter and further freezing is predicted &mdash; reinstating roads will prove difficult.  In County Waterford we have always prided ourselves on the local authority&rsquo;s investment in road maintenance, but that work has suffered a significant setback because the roads are disintegrating and subsiding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to the Department and the Department of the Taoiseach.  The road network is vital to the farming economy and business communities and in allowing children to get to school.  If we do not invest in it following this serious damage, we will pay the cost in the future.  Since September, Waterford County Council has had applications with the Department in connection with 30 to 35 normal reconstruction and restoration schemes, but it has not received approval from the Department.  Applications in respect of the damage caused recently are adding to the backlog.  Therefore, we need adequate investment if we are to undo the damage caused to the roads.  While the Department has given approval to local authorities to use at their discretion existing funds, they would prefer it were they allowed to invest capital funds in the road network.  I ask the Minister for Transport to consider this request to enable local authorities to invest now when the money is required.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this Adjournment matter and look forward to his response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to table this motion and Senator Coffey for sharing time.  The motion is simple &mdash; additional funding is required by Cork city and county councils and all other local authorities.  The roads are in a dangerous condition, badly need to be reinstated and, as Senator Coffey stated, upgraded properly.  I call on the Government to stop failing citizens and provide the required funding as soon as possible, as it is imperative that we repair the road system to make it safe.  People should not be afraid in driving on them that they will cave in.  Dykes and culverts should not be blocked.</P>
        <P>This week I received from Cork County Council a reply to information I requested about its roads programme for 2010.  It informed me by letter that it could not make a commitment to roads resurfacing or renewal because it had not received budgetary information from the Government.</P>
        <P>We have had a period of unprecedented flooding, snow and ice, with the net result that our road system is in absolute tatters; it is in rag order.  We now find there is no plan by the Government to assist local authorities or put in place a plan to fix the roads.  It is an appalling failure and indictment of the Government.</P>
        <P>Why do we not have an additional commitment for funding?  What will we tell the people in Cork South-Central, those in the city and county?  What will we tell the people in Grange <Col N="211"/>Frankfield, Waterfall, Rochestown, Carr&rsquo;s Hill, Maryborough Hill and Carrigaline who are in gridlock every morning because they are avoiding potholes, roads that are flooded or because routes have caved in?  Are we to tell them the resurfacing and road renewal programme is on hold and although the surface has taken a battering, it will be fine?  We will have a 21st century country on one level and an 18th century road system.</P>
        <P>I have made numerous representations on behalf of the constituents of Cork city and county councils regarding non-national roads.  Estate roads are in poor condition and potholes litter roads in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency and others.  We need a plan to improve the road conditions.  Why can we not be creative and take people off dole queues?  We could give engineers and labourers work in repairing and renewing our roads system.</P>
        <P>I call on the Government, with the Minister of State as its representative, to provide additional money for cash-starved local authorities which do not have resources to fix the problem.  Otherwise we will have a major difficulty in three or four months.  As Senator Coffey noted, winter is not over yet.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, I thank the Senators for raising this important matter.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities&rsquo; own resources supplemented by State road grants paid by the Department.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</P>
        <P>When road grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, the Department does not hold a reserve allocation at central level to deal with weather contingencies.  Such an arrangement would mean a reduction across all local authorities in the road grant allocations to them at the beginning of each year.  Instead, the allocation made to local authorities is inclusive of the weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.</P>
        <P>The amount of money provided in the 2010 Estimates for funding regional and local roads is &euro;411.177 million and this year&rsquo;s allocation will be based on that amount.  The Minister hopes to announce these allocations by mid-February.  In the meantime, the Minister has issued a circular to local authorities reminding them that with regard to local and regional roads, the role of the Department is to provide grants to supplement road expenditure by them.  Some local authorities contribute as little as 5% to their total road expenditure from their own resources.  Local authorities need to prioritise increased expenditure from their own resources on their own roads this year in view of the current difficult situation.</P>
        <P>The Minister also asked in that circular that local authorities give priority to the repair of damage to regional and local roads caused by recent weather and he authorised them to incur expenditure under certain grant categories of up to 25% of the amount allocated for these categories in April 2009, pending the allocation of the 2010 grants.  The Minister has also allowed the local authorities flexibility to revise their 2010 restoration improvement programmes.</P>
        <P>The Department has asked local authorities to provide an assessment of the additional road costs incurred by them as a result of the November flooding and of the recent severe weather, over and above their normal winter maintenance expenditure, and to identify the principal components of the additional costs.  The Department has received some information on the impact of the November flooding but the collection of information on the effects of the recent cold weather is ongoing.  The Minister appreciates that it will take a while to establish precise costs as the damage is still becoming evident and being quantified on a daily basis.</P>
<Col N="212"/>
        <P>The Minister has asked all local authorities to provide information as soon as possible.  This will enable him to assess the full impact of the severe weather when deciding on the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations.  In allocating those grants the Minister will prioritise expenditure to deal with damage caused by the recent exceptional weather.  Considerable resources have been spent in recent years on both the national and regional and local road networks &mdash; some &euro;5.6 billion since 1997.  Every effort therefore must be made to safeguard this investment.</P>
        <P>Our response to recent events will have to carefully target the available resources to address the most urgently required repairs, taking account of key factors such as safety, the strategic importance of the particular road, traffic levels, etc.  For national roads, the National Roads Authority generally fully reimburses local authorities for their expenditure on winter maintenance on national primary and national secondary roads.  The Minister is aware that this expenditure has also increased substantially owing to the bad weather.  The NRA will be reviewing its expenditure priorities for 2010 in the light of the damage caused to national roads by the recent bad weather.</P>

	<P>I would like to make a quick response.  With due respect, the Minister of State has told us, more or less, what we already know.  These are unprecedented times and we have had unprecedented weather.  Everybody rightly expects an unprecedented response from the Government.  The Waterford city and county local authorities have always invested in their roads network but nobody could have forecast the damage done by the recent adverse weather conditions.</P>
        <P>Road users are paying substantial road tax and are entitled to expect some assistance from the Government.  The Minister has not answered my question.  Will the Government provide funds additional to those which have already been allocated in the roads budget?  I know the normal funds are being considered by the Department and should be expected in mid-February.  Will the Government provide additional funds because of the extra damage caused to our road network?  It is essential.</P>

	<P>I have a question.  Although this does not pertain to the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department, his reply was disappointing.  He said that the NRA generally fully reimburses local authorities for expenditure.  Will the NRA assist, through Government funding, local authorities which will now have to spend extra money on the maintenance of roads to rectify damage done by inclement weather?  I hope the Minister of State agrees that it is now necessary for the NRA, the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to devise a plan to assist local authorities.  If they do not, we will not have any roads left.</P>

	<P>I will reply briefly to the two points.  I specifically stated that the Department had engaged with the local authorities to identify the additional costs associated with the severe weather.  The Senators mentioned the NRA as normally reimbursing local authorities but my final comment was that the NRA would review its expenditure priorities for 2010 in light of the damage caused.  The important factor at this point is the new damage which is becoming evident every day.  The Department is still collating that information from local authorities and a considerable amount is still due to the Department.</P>
