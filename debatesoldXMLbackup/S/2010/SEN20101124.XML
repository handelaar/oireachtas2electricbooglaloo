	<P>I have received notice from Senator Dan Boyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport to clarify the plans, if any, she has to amend the Irish Sports Council Act 1999.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maria Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills to give an update on the application from St. Michael&rsquo;s House regarding the proposal to replace the special national schools on Grosvenor Road and in Ballinteer with a new school building for both in Ballinteer and to indicate if the application is on the priority building list.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2010 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 2.15 p.m., on which spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and all other Senators for ten minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon to reply ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate.  There will then be a sos until 4 p.m. when it is proposed to commence an open-ended debate on the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, on which spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and all other Senators for ten minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I regret that the Leader wants to do away with Private Members&rsquo; business today, during which we were to deal with an important motion.  We could have discussed that motion today as well as the four-year strategy.  While I am sure the Government side is worried about losing that vote, obviously, the most important issue today is the publication of the four-year plan.  It is welcome that we will be discussing what is of most relevance to the country.  However, it is with a heavy heart that we will read the plan, as we will see the <Col N="898"/>unravelling of 60 years of progress in this country.  We are seeing the pain laid bare that will affect every family, every community and the entire country.  Not alone is it being laid bare to this country, it is being done in the full glare of international publicity and humiliation.  The Government wrapped the State around the banks and when confronted with the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on the banks, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, said that the finding did not jump out at him.  We can see the consequences today and every man, woman and child will pay thousands of euro every year to cope with the mistakes of this Government.  What is most disturbing is that the Government is still in denial and is still not doing the right thing.  The Taoiseach is not resigning and he is not bringing forward the budget as we said he should yesterday.  He is still refusing to do what is necessary.  The Green Party can play a role if it wants to be constructive.  That party can ensure the budget and the Finance Bill are brought forward and enacted quickly.  That has been requested by every European commentator of note.  It is clearly necessary to calm the markets and provide some stability not just to Ireland but also to the eurozone.  The Government is still refusing to do what is necessary.  I ask that the Taoiseach, his Ministers and the Green Party do what is right and what is necessary for the country, what everyone is saying is necessary.  Bring the budget in now, deal with the Finance Bill now, and stop this prevarication in the next few weeks.  The situation for the banks is critical and every commentator is saying the delay is costing a fortune.  It is making it increasingly difficult to bail out this country, to save the banks and to get the economy working.  The Government should do the right thing in respect of the process of this budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>People say that we should not play the blame game but it must be played to learn from it.  The Honohan report on banking outlined the level of responsibility the Government should take.  It is not 100% and that balance needs to be reflected in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 75%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Mistakes were made and Professor Honohan has given a view on it.  It is quite clear that passing the budget on 7 December is a crucial part of the timeline of the budget and what is required in dealing with the IMF and Europe.  The Opposition parties have accepted that aspect of it.  It is also important to recognise that the IMF and our European partners do not have exactly the same level of interest in this.  The IMF has a vested interest in this country growing and coming out of this, whereas some of our European friends are competitors in the marketplace of taxation.  We need to be clear about that and I hope that the debate today, which I welcome, will focus on these issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us be clear that the budget is a Budget Statement.  It is not a Vote, a Bill or legislation.  The number of votes that take place on budget night are determined by the Government.  Excise issues must be voted on but they will not be an issue.  The finance Bill comes two months later and often there are many differences in attitude to the budget.  Constitutionally, legally or otherwise, there is no reason we could not pass the budget on 7 December and have a general election before the finance Bill.  I am not suggesting we do this but I want people to know there is the option.  It has been too easy for parties to hold positions or oppose positions.  There are other options.  After the Budget Statement is made, people adjust to it and the Government respond to that in the finance Bill.  It may be in the interest of the incoming Government to implement the finance Bill in terms of putting shape on the budget.  On the other hand, it may be against their interests and may be better for the incoming Government to have the horrible budget, the desperate Finance Bill and the extraordinary social welfare Bill passed by the outgoing Government whose fingerprints are all over them and the new Government can then start over.  These are the options and it is not a matter of black and white.  There are grey areas.  I ask that today&rsquo;s debate would be positive as well as recognising <Col N="899"/>the depth of the difficulties we are in.  There are positive matters in the economy, as Professor John FitzGerald put very well this morning.  We should develop these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by acknowledging the mass in the private dining room this morning for the deceased Members of the Oireachtas.  It was a special, thoughtful and prayerful tribute to Members of the House who have gone before us, not least those who died during this term.  It was a nice way to honour their memories and to start business in the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact we will debate the four-year plan today and agree with Senator Fitzgerald that the state in which this country finds itself is shameful.  We are an absolute disgrace internationally and the manner in which greed and avarice created a property bubble supported by Government tax incentives and initiatives means we now expect the marginalised, vulnerable, those on basic rates of social welfare, students struggling to get third level education, pensioners fearful of a reduction in income and people fighting with banks through the courts to hang on to their homes to pay for the crisis.  At the same time, we have a Government in absolute denial.  On top of the economic mess, we have political instability, which is the worst thing the country could have at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When this House was formed in 1922, it played a significant and constructive role in a dark historical era of this country.  The body politic and, in particular, Seanad &Eacute;ireann has an important role to play in how we come out of this mess.  We will come out of this mess and it is a question of where we will be when we come out of it.  This House has a significant contribution to make.  There is much cynical and anti-politics comment driven by elements of a very cynical media who want us to say we should give the keys of Leinster House to someone from Ryanair or another company in order that a businessman would run this country.  We have a parliamentary democracy for which people gave their lives.  As a result of free and fair elections, a Government is formed and administers according to the policies it brought to the people.  I hope that will happen sooner rather than later and that the manner in which it is done does not damage the credibility of Ireland further.  I find it annoying in the extreme when people bash politics.  Only politics can bring us out of this current mess and we all have a role to play in that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole made some important points about the budget.  Why has the budget not been brought forward?  What is the manner in which engagement with the Opposition parties has taken place in respect of the four-year plan, the budget and the legislative effects of the budget such as the finance Bill and the social welfare Bill?  We need open and honest Government and, in the dying days of this Administration, I appeal to the Leader to appeal to the Taoiseach to bring some leadership, even at this late stage in the game.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Today&rsquo;s debate on the national recovery plan will be very important and I welcome the fact other Senators have welcomed the holding of the debate.  I look forward to a constructive debate.  Some of the points mentioned are pertinent.  There are technical difficulties with bringing forward the budget.  As the tax receipts to the end of November must form part of a Budget Statement, at best, it could be brought forward by a couple of days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>A week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I accept the need to bring forward the finance Bill to the earliest opportunity.  Perhaps this could be before the Christmas recess, afterwards or we could have co-operation in both Houses to have a shorter Christmas recess to deal with the important issues at hand.  It is to be hoped the publication of today&rsquo;s plan is the start of a process that will reassure international sentiment.  I disagree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point about the Budget <Col N="900"/>Statement and the passing of a finance Bill.  The budget is the finance Bill and, until it passes, we cannot consider ourselves out of the woods.  The current situation is complicated by many international factors, including the state of other countries&rsquo; economies and the fact that the strengths of the economy are being ignored.  Today&rsquo;s debate will be helpful.  The comments of the leader of the main Opposition party in the other House yesterday were particularly helpful in this regard.  That is the nature of the debate we need to have.  It is about making the decisions that have to be made now; we can then turn to the issue of the future governance of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>We learn in today&rsquo;s newspapers that 10% of young people are waiting for a mental health service in the Health Service Executive west and south areas and that one in seven students are being taught maths and English poorly in primary school, with 20% of teachers unprepared.  We need to debate these two issues.  These are the young people&rsquo;s lives that matter.  All of this is happening against a background in which there is a hole in the banks that is far bigger than we ever contemplated.  Market analysts interviewed on the &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; show last night spoke about the figure being somewhere in the region of &euro;250 billion to &euro;300 billion.  Where are we going as a country?  The sum of &euro;85 billion we are seeking from the IMF and the European is to be used just to keep the banks open.  We are in serious difficulty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is estimated that we need &euro;10 billion a year just to service the debt.  We simply will not be able to afford it and we cannot.  We have reached a critical moment in the negotiations with the IMF, the European Union and the ECB and should not blow it.  If the Government does, will it, please, hand over the mantle of responsibility to someone else?  It should draw on every piece of advice available from every analyst who can help us to come up with options to get a better deal from the IMF and the European Union.  Otherwise, we will not have a hope.  The advice is that we should default.  I have never recommended this in my life, but this issue is bigger than any of us.  We need to get serious advice.  The Leader should communicate this to the Minister for Finance, that we need to get the negotiations right on the bailout or the children who have not yet been born will pay for it forever.</P>

	<P>I wish to call the Senators I should have called first whom I missed yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the comments this morning of the leaders of the main Opposition parties which were extremely responsible.  I very much welcome this.  I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on systemic change to our political system which does not cope well in a time of crisis and leads to barracking and pettiness on the part of the Opposition.</P>

	<P>What did the Green Party do on Monday?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No interruptions, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a time for calm and cool heads.  As Senators on the other side said, we are in the final days of the Government and it is important that we do not play politics such that we add to the mess in the difficult situation in which we find ourselves.  There is now clarity, but we must look forward.  We had enormous difficulties in the 1980s with which our system did not cope.  It was because of the generosity of Alan Dukes at the time that we got through that crisis.  This is also a time for generosity.  The Green Party has called for <Col N="901"/>consensus, but that request was thrown back in our faces.  We felt it was the way forward.  We could have saved ourselves much anguish if that offer had been taken up.  Nevertheless, we need to look at our political system, on which we need a proper debate.  We need to have facilities in order that in a time of crisis we can work together for the greater good.  That must happen now, although it is not the norm in our system.  In Rome, in times of crisis, a dictator was appointed to look after the system because it was considered that was the way to do things.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a new style of politics in a time of major national crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If I counted correctly, Fintan O&rsquo;Toole wanted three dictators.  It is appropriate that it would be a trinity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should ask the Leader a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Viktor Frankl, the famous and eminent concentration camp survivor, said the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">We who lived in the concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread.  They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be appreciated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>He said, &ldquo;The last of the human freedoms &mdash; to choose one&rsquo;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&rsquo;s own way.&rdquo;  It is very important to bear in mind the need that we retain freedom to choose our attitude in this time of crisis.  There is a lot of anger and negativity towards politicians and the political system.  We have to lead by example in this House.  The way the media communicate is important, as we must not have the degeneration in the quality of public debate that we have seen.  We could do with having a moratorium on heckling in this and the other House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;allowing, of course, for heckles of sufficient quality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, it is okay to say, &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; when the Senator is speaking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are taking questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we could do with communication of a higher quality&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to control the hecklers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in the way the Government parties talk to each other also because, if we are seen to be taking a dignified approach in politics, we will inspire others to adopt a similar approach to the way we deal with our problems.</P><Col N="902"/>
        <P>We are not in concentration camps, but there are people in our world who are concentrated in camps of poverty.  We all hear the advertisements for B&oacute;thar and Tr&oacute;caire.  As Helen Keogh of D&oacute;chas said recently, Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid programme is an expression of our national identity and that it had established us on the world stage.  It is in our national interest not to forget how relatively well off we are compared to many others throughout the world.  Senator Hannigan called for a debate on our overseas aid programme and the need to maintain our commitment in that regard.  He was told we would have that debate before Christmas.  I ask the Leader to ensure we will do something meaningful and have the debate before the budget.  In giving priority to this very important issue we will send a message that we can cope with our problems, while not losing sight of the very serious problems of others throughout the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Any of us who speak about how woeful the situation is must be mindful of exactly what it is we are saying, given that the international media are listening to us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure they are hanging on every word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need for balance.  It is very important that we do not give anyone more fodder unnecessarily.  </P>
        <P>Last week and the previous week I called for a debate on the strengths of the country in terms of being able to provide energy supplies for all of Europe because nothing starts or finishes without an energy supply.  There is no positivity in the media.  I urge them to be a little more balanced in picking up on some of the small snippets of positivity.  We must show leadership in this regard.  This country is an awful lot better than it was ten years ago in terms of infrastructure and many other aspects.  The more we beat ourselves, the more fodder we will give to others with which to beat us.  I thank the Leader for arranging a debate on Thursday during which we can highlight many of the issues raised.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I raise another issue I have raised previously.  During the summer when we in County Donegal, like everyone else, were enjoying sunshine, there was snow on our television screens.  As a result, all of the wonderful news was not being received in many houses in the county.  When the analogue service is switched off in 2012, we will switch to digital straightaway.  Many people do not receive an analogue service, although they are paying their television licence fee.  If they do not receive an analogue service now, they will not receive a digital service following the switchover.  I cannot get answers to the questions I am raising as to how we will have free access to services &mdash; SAORVIEW &mdash; for homes not only in County Donegal but also throughout the country.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and, if necessary, the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources should take up this matter because, whether the news is good or bad or the media are being positive or negative, it is important there is access to this information, especially when people are paying their television licence fee.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the debate on the four-year plan.  We should bring the budget and the Finance Bill forward, which we stated yesterday.  As we know, delay is the enemy.  Our currency, the euro, and our banking system are at stake.  As Commissioner Rehn stated in the context of the budget, we should get it over with and move on.  We must do so. Please God, the Government will be able to outline further details about the &euro;85 billion rescue package, loan, overdraft facility or whatever it is.  We must hope that it will prove to be the necessary firepower and that we will not need to draw much of it down.  The interest rate will also be important.  We are dealing with the health of a currency of which we are a part and that we must be prepared to defend.  It is unfortunate that clowns in the banks were left in <Col N="903"/>place.  Not all were removed as they should have been.  Whatever about mistakes and errors, we are where we are.  The minimum we must do is save our banks and currency.  Without those, we cannot live and trade.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>In the midst of rhetoric, emotion and negativity, we all seek nuggets of hope and practical intent.  Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s contribution was significant and should be considered.  He has made it clear that it is possible to acknowledge our crisis and even to apportion blame fairly, be it internal or external.  People will look to legislators to devise policies that will take us from this terrible crisis and return us to a situation, not necessarily akin to the Celtic tiger, in which we could ensure that all people would have a worthwhile quality of life.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Hannigan on his crusade on overseas aid.  The connection between these two points is that we should remember that all suffering and pressures are relative and that some people will not benefit from Ireland&rsquo;s charity and support to the same extent as they did previously.  Given that it does not usually fit in with a policy of political expediency, it is good to know that we are looking beyond our own challenges.  In the final days of this House, we should use every minute to send out support and hope to the people we claim to represent.  We were elected by them, not to cry and moan in the Chamber, but to give the leadership required of every Member.  If the words of Senator McCarthy and the crusade of Senator Hannigan received exposure and publicity, we would finally have our foot on the road to recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish I could agree with Senator Keaveney that the international media were hanging on our every word, as I doubt it.  My more modest wish is that the Irish media would occasionally pay a little attention to the House, but that is unlikely as long as we run it like the Ballymagash amateur musical and drama society.  As the named officers of the House are responsible for that, I must put the wish to one side.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Three factors should be examined: the markets, hedge funds and ratings agencies.  The markets are in turmoil and we are constantly being derated.  The attitude is that Dublin will be taken out first, then Madrid.  A great deal of attention is paid to freedom of information requests on expenses claims.  I have received another request and I am happy with it.  Let us have a bit of openness about the bondholders.  I want to know who they are.  I want to see a list of their names.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some idea of who is on it.  I want to know who are behind the hedge funds.  They are gambling against us.  I want to know who is operating in the markets.  A market is where items are bought and sold.  The future of the Irish people is being bought and sold over their heads.  It is slavery and nothing else.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We should listen to people like David McWilliams.  Yesterday, I referred to the solution, namely, a shares for equity swap in the banks.  It would wipe out &euro;120 billion.  David McWilliams was discussing it again this morning.  He was right.  We should consider doing this.  It is perfectly clear to even a two year old that one does not solve a debt crisis by miring oneself endlessly in further debt.</P>

	<P>As long as the Government refuses to listen to creative solutions, we will fall further into the mire.  It will pinch.  I honour and respect my colleagues from all sides of the House who pointed to where this will hurt.  It is not an abstract question.  It is about people losing jobs and homes.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, others and I attended the launch of the White Ribbon Campaign.  It is called &ldquo;The Other Half&rdquo; and relates to the increasing risk of violence against women.  Where there is domestic tension over budgets, paying bills and so on, violence against women will increase.  This is the price paid.</P>
        <P>The money has not gone away or evaporated.  Rather, it is going into certain little pockets and I demand to know to whom they belong.  I want to know who is in the hedge funds, who is running them and who is controlling the bond markets.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the publication of the four-year economic plan and support the multi-annual approach of addressing and running the nation&rsquo;s affairs.  As we head into the general election in early 2011 and reflect on party political election promises of previous elections, I suggest that, since the four-year plan is the first attempt to set out our stall, costed and explained to the public, all future party political proposals should be costed and explained and the strategy for their implementation clearly set out.  A mechanism should be put in place to allow all proposals to go to the Department of Finance where a senior official, be it an Assistant Secretary General or someone of similar rank, could consider and comment on them.  As we all know, political parties in years gone by made promises and did not deliver on them.  The public remain somewhat frustrated, having given votes to a particular party on a specific issue on which the party then did not deliver.  This is wrong and other countries have implemented a mechanism that works.  Will the Leader consider these mechanisms and determine whether we could take this opportunity, particularly in light of the first attempt that is the four-year plan, to set fair procedures in stone?</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a recurring issue, namely, mental health, inappropriate placements and unacceptable waiting periods for treatment.  We should debate the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A nation holds its breath.  The people are about to be given an unpalatable four-year plan.  In 13 years, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has bankrupted Ireland with its friends.  This is its legacy.  I want a debate on how to put the situation right.  It does not start with the four-year plan.  It starts with the Government, led by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance attending the House and telling the truth.  This is despite what the Green Party did last Monday in adding to the uncertainty and instability.  We all have an obligation as legislators to put the people of Ireland first.  That is our first duty.  I speak for the ordinary person, the man and woman who are struggling and who will be hammered by the Government today.  I understand that the blame game is over because Fianna F&aacute;il is indicted by the people.  I canvass and meet people up to seven days a week and they are tired and fed up of this Government and want it out, as we do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to consider Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s request that he should go to the Taoiseach and the Cabinet to ask that the budget be brought forward in order that we can have a streamlined slimmed down finance Bill to facilitate a general election, give the people a say and reinvigorate them, renew hope and give us a new start.  The people I taught in school, my nephews and nieces and the sons and daughters of Members here want a new beginning and to live in an Ireland where they can dream of a better future, not of cuts but of opportunity. A nation that has given the world playwrights, scholars, musicians, sports people and artists deserves a better tomorrow.  It can only start with a general election and a change of government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome some of the comments from the other side of the House.  Senator Healy Eames put her finger on the pulse.  We have to negotiate a much better deal with the ECB and the IMF.  We now have to get tough, hang in there and say, in effect, &ldquo;We owe you a lot of money, but you&rsquo;re not doing your job&rdquo;.  The ECB certainly has done nothing in terms of helping any of the countries in Europe in the last few years.  There was no plan, and it is important that we bear this in mind. If one looks at America or China, one sees that they are printing money, devaluing their currencies and in this manner facilitating competitiveness as regards selling their products on world markets.  The big problem with Europe is that the euro is still strong.  However, major contagion will arise from the Irish problem.  That will extend to Italy, Portugal and Spain and then the ECB will begin to act.  We should not pay a cent more than 2% in interest for the money that is coming to us.  It is vitally important, or we will put the country in penury for the next 20 years if we overpay for this particular loan.  Senator Healy Eames is totally right and I support her argument, because it is vitally important.  Even at this late stage we should ensure we send in a crack team to negotiate what our interest payments should be in the next 20 years.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I find the comments from most of the parties surreal.  There is a consensus in this House to ignore two important factors.  Very soon Fine Gael and the Labour Party will be in government.  They will have to face, as Senators Healy Eames and Butler have pointed out, not a dig-out, but a loan, a bank overdraft that has to be paid for.  If it is paid at 5% and the full facility is drawn down we shall have to find up to &euro;6 billion a year to pay it off.</P>
        <P>In spite of this knowledge all the political parties in the House conspire to agree that no matter what pain and misery is inflicted on the poor, the welfare class and everybody else, the public sector remains unaffected.  Like the dreary steeples of Tyrone and Fermanagh, the judges will still get their &euro;9,000 for the studies and the Ministers will get these incredible pensions that sometimes would take up to &euro;35,000 a week to finance in the private sector.  Still the gap between public and private sector pay remains at around 30% and 70 cent in every euro the State spends is on public sector pay and pensions.  We are not all in it together, and we are not going to get out of it together.  No matter what happens all parties agree that a golden circle is to be drawn around the public sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The media are the same way and are terrified of the public sector too.  Its members are paper buyers and have powerful unions. The political class is afraid of them and nobody will speak the truth.  By the way, I never saw the IMF wimp out in any country except Ireland.  It went to Latvia, Argentina and all over the world.  The first thing it did was to cut into public sector pay and pensions, but not in Ireland.  It is wimping around Ireland because it has been seduced, hypnotised and told, in effect, by a nod and a wink from all the political parties to do anything it wants, but not to touch the public sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader for a debate on the media.  I am very conscious that there is a misrepresentation in certain sections of the media as regards the severity of the situation in this country.  I am thinking in particular of Vincent Browne&rsquo;s programme last night, referred to earlier in the House, where a debt of &euro;300 billion plus was suggested for the banks.  There were extreme statements by people referring to bonds that were raised and assets backed by mortgages, when the reality is that 97% of mortgages are being repaid and members of the public in general are adamant that these mortgages must be repaid if people are to have a roof over their head.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To put some realism into the argument, there is a severe difficulty, but yet we need people to be responsible.  In asking the media to be responsible, it is not unfair to expect them to measure and give a realistic assessment of the situation, that they may be known for the realism of their content rather than its extremity.  While the situation is serious, the four-year plan <Col N="906"/>should see us through.  The reality is that many positive things are happening in the economy.  Exports are up, we have access to a 500 million market and Ireland is part of a single currency.  We have support from Europe, but sensational stories about a &euro;350 billion shortfall in our banks will not help anybody.  In fact it is counter-productive.  I understand that the media, like all of us, will have their particular preferences.  Unfortunately, I noticed that the Oireachtas report on three occasions in the last week only gave the Opposition viewpoint, with a contribution from one Member from the Green Party.  While I concede that the Opposition has much to say, perhaps there are others on this side of the House too who have a contribution to make.  On Tuesday, Thursday and last night only one Green Party Member was shown on the Government side and all other coverage was confined to the Opposition. I am certain the Opposition would like to see fairness in this area and I ask RTE to measure what it puts out in the Oireachtas report on the public airways.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are debating the four-year plan this evening and I advise Members beforehand to go back to their offices and watch the Vincent Browne show from last night on TV3. The debate to date on the bailout issue has been clouded in obfuscation and deceit, and for once over 45 minutes last night that cloud was lifted and we saw the first honesty and clarity from commentators who have been remarkable prescient and uncannily accurate in every prediction they have made to date on the Irish economic crisis.  Ireland, as country of 4 million people, simply cannot sustain the debt that is going to be loaded on to us, our children and grandchildren.  Senator O'Toole spoke earlier of the positive aspects of economy, both the indigenous economy and the moneys accruing from foreign direct investment.  That is very true, but it will rapidly come to a halt if we saddle our country with a debt that requires us to pay, conservatively, &euro;8 billion to &euro;10 billion per year in interest repayments.</P>
        
        <P>We need to acknowledge very quickly, however, that we are in a remarkable position of power in these negotiations.  The very future of the euro as a project is at stake and we need to realise honestly that the banking debt, which is not of our making, should not be our problem.  Pouring cash into that black hole is simply theft from the Irish taxpayer and cannot and should not be sustained.  We are now in a position of power, and we should capitalise on this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When the history of this era is written, many people who are now screaming and pointing the finger at others may in fact be in the dock.  I subscribe to much of what Senator Hanafin had to say and fully to what Senator Harris said.  The House will later debate the four-year plan, at which point Members will be able to expand further on these issues.  However, Senator Harris is correct in saying that of the order of 40% of our expenditure, 40% of which is borrowed, goes towards public service pay.  While I acknowledge that salaries will not be interfered with under the four-year plan maintaining salaries in the public service at the level at which they are at is unsustainable and will make us uncompetitive.  Public service pay will have to be addressed regardless of the Croke Park agreement.  More important, natural wastage must not be the main focus in terms of reducing numbers in the public service as this will in time only lead to an erosion of extremely capable people, as has happened in the past.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We will, as a consequence, be left with people who are not performing.  Rationalisation of the public service must take into account non-performance and the people concerned should be removed from the payroll.  Otherwise, we will end up with a dysfunctional public service, which to some degree is what has been happening during the past 20 plus years.  Our problems are in part a consequence of a lack of calibre in that regard.  I point Members who do not accept this to a Committee of Public Accounts report in regard to three highly <Col N="907"/>paid senior public servants who appeared before that committee to explain the profligacy of moneys on tribunals.  Having read that report I was so uninspired I concluded that if I had a company I would not employ any of those three people, who are among our most highly paid senior public servants.  We need to address this issue, which should be a priority of the outgoing and incoming Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Some colleagues have called for a debate on the future of the Legislature and the need for change in that regard.  There is a deeper force at play here which is beginning to manifest itself.  The people to whom I have spoken believe that it does not matter for whom they vote in the next election because the Government will not be running the country.  There is a growing volatility and a growing tendency for people to say that the only vote they want to cast is a protest vote, a vote against what is going on as opposed to a vote for a better future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned that the change we are about to go through, some of which will be crystalised this afternoon, will unleash in this country forces of political extremism that will be on a par with those with which we had to deal in terms of our challenges and difficulties in regard to Northern Ireland.  We must all face up to the possibility of this happening.  Those of us who are in the centre now have a responsibility at least to speak responsibly and honestly.  I want to pick up on two comments made in the House today, in regard to which I believe honesty was lacking.  The question was asked as to the ECB is doing for us.  The ECB is largely financing NAMA, regardless of whether people want it.  It is probably the only bank that is buying Irish Government debt.  Few others in the private market are doing so.  It was inferred earlier that Ireland should consider defaulting.  The example of Russia and Argentina as countries which have done so successfully was given.  I ask those who make that argument to quote one example of a tiny highly globalised economy, utterly dependent on outside investment, that has ever successfully done so and lived to tell the tale.</P>
        <P>Ireland cannot be at the vanguard of some experiment in which its destiny and security is at risk.  If we are asking for the centre to hold &mdash; I believe the pressures on us in this regard will never be greater &mdash; then there is a responsibility on people at least to recognise the facts and not to give credence to people on the extremes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Donohoe must not have watched &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; last night.  I agree wholeheartedly with his analysis.  I will not take my lead from the celebrity economists who vie for positions on such shows.  The tragedy of the Houses of the Oireachtas during the eight years I have been a Member has been that for far too long the agenda has been set by the media.  It was set by the media because of a void in the Houses. What I would like to hear in this afternoon's debate is not the views constituted on the airwaves but the views of Members as raised by their constituents, which is what I propose to do.  I agree wholeheartedly with my colleagues Senators Walsh and Harris that with all of the sorrow and regret at the events of this week comes that which in my opinion we have yearned for for three years, namely, the point of inflection from which we can correct the structures that have failed us over many years.  There is no question but that endemic in that must be the payment structure which presides over a &euro;22,000 per month salary for a person in the Department of Education and Skills and the &euro;10,000 and &euro;15,000 per month paid to many others.  Senator Walsh spoke about the disgrace that is the tribunals situation and the pay that has been presided over for many years in this regard.  We cannot afford to pay ourselves.  Salaries of &euro;66,000 for Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and &euro;100,000 for Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are too much.  Everybody above that threshold must take less.  I do not need the IMF to tell me that.  We have been <Col N="908"/>saying this for weeks in this House.  Let us do it now as part of the four-year plan and ensure provision in this regard is made in the budget, difficult as that may be.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Forget politics and the future of Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il, we are speaking now about the future of the people.  I do not care about the future of anything else.  People need to be paid less.  That is a fact and this needs to happen immediately.  We must now focus on the four-year plan and the budget, which for technical reasons cannot be brought forward.  As quickly as is possible after that, we should deal with the social welfare Bill, the finance Bill and the appropriation Bill.  We can then get on with the political consensus that is needed and let come what may.  In the meantime, let us begin to correct the structures that have failed us.  Top of that list is the public sector pay regime that is absolutely unsustainable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>For a generation, our political system has been one of delusion and cute hoorism which is what has brought us to where we are, namely, a broken society, a broken country and an economy on the verge of total bankruptcy.  We need to replace that system with politics of responsibility and courage.  I am glad that much of what has been said here today has been clear, concise and full of commonsense.  To put into two words the politics, project and priorities which lie ahead of us, those two words are &ldquo;saving Ireland&rdquo;.  Whatever we do in this and the other House during the course of the next few crucial weeks must be about saving Ireland.  No greater task could be placed upon our shoulders.  We will have to work together.</P>
        <P>I welcome the intervention of my party leader, Deputy Kenny, yesterday afternoon when in an act of political courage and in the national interest he appealed to the Government to bring forward the budget and finance Bill and to begin laying the foundation of recovery.  I appreciate the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment that there may be technical issues arising from Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s suggestion.  However, the proposal is worth reflecting upon.  If we do not fill the void with political debate on the four year plan, budget, finance Bill and so on, the fears, as expressed by Senator Donohoe, will come to pass, namely, wilder forces will take over.  Politics must take charge and that politics must be responsible and courageous, such as is being demonstrated in this House.  I appeal to all colleagues to recognise the need to save this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to expand on some of the remarks ventilated in the past few minutes in regard, in particular, to the role of politics.  The rush to appoint a business leader to sort us out reflects a yearning for two things &mdash; decisiveness and expertise &mdash; but should there ever be such a move, we would be throwing the baby out with the bath water because not only do we need decisiveness and expertise, we also need political acumen, judgment and skill to work our way through this crisis.  I think back, for instance, to interventions made by businessmen during the Lisbon treaty debate which, at times, were painfully crude.  I wonder how successful they would be and whether they have the skills set to do what is needed.</P>
        <P>We have to find a way to inject greater expertise into the political system.  The balance between the public service and politicians should be examined.  Politicians are elected by the people and are almost, by definition, generalists; they need a Civil Service crammed with expertise in Departments.  However, the expertise that ought to counterbalance the general representative role of politicians is not available, in particular to the Department of Finance at this critical time.  It is welcome that we have in the front row Messrs Honohan, Elderfield and Corrigan who bring expertise to the ongoing negotiations.  I dread to think what might have happened without that set of recent appointments.</P><Col N="909"/>
        <P>Another way to address this issue is through the list system, whereby the electorate would vote for parties which would then appoint experts in particular disciplines to the Houses of the Oireachtas, not individuals.  It is time to give consideration to the introduction of a list system in how we make our political choices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an onus on all of us in the House to act in the best interests of the State because there is a danger we could talk ourselves into bigger problems.  I spoke to people who were making a television programme recently for a continental station.  They had visited a working men&rsquo;s club in Dublin and then interviewed some students.  They sent the package to the Continent only for it be sent back because it was not negative enough.  The station wanted the report to be more negative.  Instead of a man saying, &ldquo;Yes, we can get out of this,&rdquo; the producers were asked if they could get him to look at a shop window and say, &ldquo;We will not have enough food for Christmas,&rdquo; because that is the story the media want.  It may well be that they are explaining to their citizens why they are giving money to Ireland and they want to paint an even worse picture.</P>
        <P>There is an onus on us to be realistic but also to be optimistic.  We have experienced problems previously.  In 1987 we had a much larger debt and greater problems, yet we were able to get out of them quickly because we began to believe in ourselves.  Let us make sure we recognise our opportunities.  Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world.  It is the second largest exporter in Europe.  Other countries ran into similar problems, for example, Finland in 1991 and Latvia two years ago.  They took tough medicine.  When one is ill, one takes tough medicine.  It is not pleasant, but one can get over problems quickly if one manages to recognise one has the solution in one&rsquo;s own hands.  To a large extent, it has been taken out of our hands, but we can solve our problems.  Let us make sure we do not hand them over to those who have solutions other than the democratic solution for which we have responsibility.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn has encapsulated what I like to think is the hope of the majority around the country, if not in the House.  It is a message of hope rather than the politics of despair.  I appreciate that there will be charge and counter charge in the House because that is the nature of politics, but, as Senator Quinn said, this is still a wealthy country and we have a great deal going for us.  In the past ten years we enjoyed unprecedented prosperity which cannot be written from the record.  It is interesting that none of the issues we are discussing featured during the election campaign in 2007.  There was no discussion of a banking crisis or about us getting out of an economic crisis.  All of the political parties attempted to present a positive message to the electorate.  In some instances, parties which will be in power in the next few months were insisting that more money should be spent and there was never a question about what would happen between 2007 and 2010.  To try to airbrush from history what this and previous Administrations did from 1997 is both incorrect and dangerous to the public psyche because it creates the impression that everything is so bad that there is no longer any hope.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the comments made by Senator Donohoe and echo those made by Senators Harris, MacSharry and Walsh.  All of us will have to make a contribution.  Unlike many Members, I have a family of five and, irrespective of other things I might do, rely almost totally on my Seanad income, but I accept that we are paid more than many, while others have no money because they have no jobs.  According to the statistics, some 40% of public expenditure is on one category and it is unrealistic that it can be left untouched.</P>

I have always respected the opinions of the Opposition parties, even though I might not necessarily agree with them, just as in fairness they should also accept that the Taoiseach and the Cabinet are working night and day to do all they can in the best interests of the nation.  We need consensus and everybody to pull together.  I nearly always agree with everything Senator Harris writes, but his comments on the public sector again today are slightly out of line with the general feeling in the House.</P>

It will continue for as long as Members are offering to speak and I invite every Member to make a contribution on this most important plan.</P>
        <P>It is 12 days to the budget.  It is a very short period of time.  We will know the exact Exchequer returns for November, which are crucial.

I look forward to having that debate in the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;whether they are in opposition or in government, agree.  I invite and encourage every Senator who is available to do so to make a contribution to tomorrow&rsquo;s debate in regard to the great opportunity available to us to do something of a positive nature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cannon mentioned the interest on our repayments.  That issue is crucial to the negotiators representing us in the Department.  We have some of the finest people who could represent any country negotiating for us.  I understand that no matter what is negotiated in the Department Members of both Houses will have an opportunity to have a say on the final outcome in terms of whether we accept or reject the proposals from the negotiators.  I could stand corrected but if we have not such a say, we should have it.  As has been said by many colleagues in the House in recent days, the issue is too serious.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy spoke about participation in parliamentary democracy and the major role for both Houses.  I fully agree that this House has an important role to play, on behalf of the taxpayer, in regard to holding everyone accountable.  Whether they are in Departments or in the D&aacute;il, this is the House that has a role in holding them all accountable.  I welcome for the second time the Senator&rsquo;s positive comments on the future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames called for a debate on education and other issues.  I invite the Senator to reiterate those this afternoon when we debate the recovery plan in the House.  A great deal of legislation will come before the House before Christmas which, along with the recovery plan and all the other issues, must be discussed.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, and also Senator Ormonde, raised the issue of overseas aid.  Ireland was never found wanting in regard to overseas aid and what we have done, and how generous the Irish people have been on very many occasions is exemplary.  I know the Government will not be found wanting in that regard and that it will do its level best to give as much as it possibly can give, even in the difficult times in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for systemic change in political systems.  I note that and will pass on his views to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney spoke about TV signalling, digital services and all of that technology in her native county of Donegal.  I will examine that issue for Private Members&rsquo; time with a view to seeing what we can do to help the Senator in highlighting that issue even further.</P><Col N="912"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Callely spoke about all-party proposals being costed by departmental officials and for them to make their views and concerns known regarding all of those proposals before final decisions are taken.  That is a worthwhile proposal and I will pass it on to the Minister.  The Senator also raised issues concerning mental health.  We fully support his call in that regard.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, has never been found wanting in coming to this House to help us in debates on mental health during his time in charge of that portfolio.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Hanafin called again for a debate on the media and raised serious concerns regarding the various issues that have been highlighted, particularly in regard to mortgage default.  As he said, a 97% success rate in that regard in these very difficult times is an achievement.  He also spoke about the media being responsible in general.  I agreed some weeks ago that we will have a further debate on the media, and I will have no difficulty in having it at the earliest possible time.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P el="10">I am pleased to present the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2010 for the consideration of this House.  This Bill is an important milestone for the postal service.  Transposing the third postal service directive represents the last step of the liberalisation process of this important market.  All mail in excess of 50 grammes is currently open to competitors and the directive now provides for the removal of the remaining area reserved to incumbent postal service providers.  Transposition of the directive will mean there are no legal or regulatory barriers to new entrants in the postal sector.</P><Col N="913"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill sets out the regulatory framework for a liberalised postal market having regard to balancing the protection of the universal service, and the development of a competitive postal sector providing high quality postal services. The objective in liberalising any market is the promotion of effective competition and the encouragement of innovation, with a view to improving choice and ensuring access to high quality, competitively priced and innovative products.  Postal services can play a key part in the development of Ireland as a smart economy, but that will require a sharper focus on innovation and satisfying the current and future needs of consumers.</P>
        
        <P>An important consideration to be taken on board is that the postal sector is now largely a means for business communications, with 90% of mail volumes either being sent by or to businesses.  It is, in essence, only one of many media that businesses use to communicate with customers.</P>
        <P>Technological developments in the communications sector and the increasing penetration of information technology in every day lives mean that the nature of how businesses can communicate with their customers is rapidly evolving.  There is a generation of people in this country who do not use landline telephony, let alone send letters.</P>
        <P>These changes will continue to have a dramatic impact on shaping the development of the postal sector.  That sector continues to undergo structural change worldwide with the move to electronic communications accelerating as the senders of mail increasingly try to reduce the cost of communicating with their consumers.  All postal operators are facing the challenge of very significant fall-off in mail volumes.  The economic downturn facing the country is only going to add impetus to this migration.</P>
        <P>An Post must adapt to this new reality.  Fighting liberalisation will not be a valid strategy and to do so would be a futile and expensive waste of time.  The Bill contains no surprises.  Indeed, the liberalisation of the postal sector has been signalled for a very long time.  Postal reform began in the EU in 1988 with a review of policy to bring the sector into line with the European Single Market.  In 1992, the Commission published its Green Paper on the subject and in 1997 the first postal directive was published.  Since then there has been a gradual and managed phasing in of competition to the sector giving all players the appropriate amount of time to adapt to the changes and implement strategies suitable for the new environment.  The final step is the transposition of this third directive which is required by 31 December 2010.  Stakeholders have been widely and comprehensively consulted on the general approach.</P>
        <P>An Post has many strengths, such as its trusted brand and its strong presence in every community in Ireland on every working day of the year, a presence that very few, if any, competitors will be in a position to replicate.  Indeed, my Department has met a number of competitors to An Post who wish to expand the range of services they offer when the market is liberalised, but none has the infrastructure to rival that of An Post and all see the need for a successful An Post.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to a strong and vibrant An Post.  I believe a commercially focused An Post, offering high quality, competitively priced services is a must for the development of the postal sector.  This was also the very strong message I received at the Department&rsquo;s forum last year.  The view was shared by all stakeholders, including competitors and potential competitors to An Post.</P>
        <P>The company and its staff must play to their strengths and ensure the company&rsquo;s resources are aligned with the needs of its users.  To do so will involve significant change.  This should be under way.  The new environment must be accepted and the company must adapt to this, re-assessing its relationships with its customers and its competitors.  The Bill provides for wholesale arrangements between An Post and its competitors to be negotiated commercially, with a role <Col N="914"/>for the regulator only where agreement cannot be reached.  An Post must explore the potential offered through competitive partnerships with rival postal service providers and ensure An Post remains the postal delivery company of choice for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An Post currently wins a significant amount of business from Departments, both for postal services and financial services delivered through the post office network.  While Government will continue to support An Post strongly, relying on Government contracts in the future is not a valid or robust strategy for An Post to take to address the challenges it faces.  It must fundamentally reinvent itself and I am confident the management and staff are capable of this.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents a sensible and pragmatic approach to the liberalisation of the sector.  It sets out the high level principles underpinning the regulatory framework, striking a balance between ensuring the provision of the universal service, enabling the development of competition and putting in place provisions around consumer protection.  At its heart, the Bill recognises the fundamental difference between An Post and other postal service providers.  As the incumbent and the largest operator, An Post will be subject to the greatest amount of regulation.  The most significant obligation imposed on An Post is that it will be designated as the universal postal service provider for a period of seven years.  The universal service, the essential element of which is the collection and delivery of mail to every address in the State on every working day, is an explicit requirement of the directive.  Designating An Post offers certainty to An Post, postal service users, the market and the EU that the universal service obligation will be met.  This designation does not, however, prevent the development of competition and ComReg is charged with the objective of enabling the development of competition in postal services.</P>
        <P>An Post has, to date, met the costs of providing the universal service from its own resources.  It is my strong preference that An Post will continue to meet this from its commercial revenues.  In line with the options permitted by the directive, however, I have included a provision in the Bill whereby any potential costs that arise in meeting this obligation which are found to be an unfair burden will be met by the postal industry through a sharing mechanism.  It is right and appropriate that those postal service providers competing with An Post within the universal service contribute where the regulator verifies that an unfair burden exists.  Other member states have also provided for sharing mechanisms.  Exchequer funding of the universal service is not an option and consequently the draft Bill does not provide for it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An Post&rsquo;s legal monopoly on the final reserved area of items weighing up to 50 grammes is being removed and the designation of An Post does not in any way preclude other postal service providers from entering the market providing postal services in competition to An Post.  ComReg will continue to have the responsibility to ensure the availability of the universal postal service.  ComReg will be required to review the designation of An Post, and provision is made for other postal service providers to be designated for universal services after the seven-year period has expired, or for no designation to be made, as the case may be.</P>
        <P>Another central theme of the directive and the Bill is the protection of the interests of users.  As well as ensuring the universal postal service throughout the country, the Bill also provides for complaints procedures to apply to all postal service providers.  The imposition of a price cap will also afford protection against significant price increases for those users who do not have the bargaining power to negotiate a better deal for their postal services, these being individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains no new legal or regulatory principles and is not attempting to break new legal ground.  The framework being put in place has many similarities to that for the communications sector and other regulated sectors.  The detail of the regulation will be the responsibility <Col N="915"/>of the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation.  The regulator has all the resources and powers necessary to do so and I am confident the many lessons learned in the regulation of that sector will be put to good use when regulating the postal sector.</P>
        <P>Key to the development of the postal sector and the knowledge society will be the introduction of a location-based code throughout the country.  The Bill contains a basic provision to enable the State to establish a national postcode system.  Deputies will be aware that in October 2009, I announced my intention to implement such a postcode system with a target implementation date of December 2011.  This system will be based on the baseline design recommendation of the national postcode project board with the added capability of being further refined into a location-based code.  It will be developed, implemented and maintained by a supplier which will fulfil the role of the postcode management licence holder.  This supplier will be procured during 2011.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Bill is divided into three Parts.  Part 1 contains standard preliminary provisions and amendments to other enactments.  The main part of the Bill, the regulation of postal services, is set out in Part 2.  This part addresses ComReg&rsquo;s role and powers.  It defines a universal postal service and provides for the designation of a universal postal service provider, price regulation, authorisation procedures and conditions, and the regulation of the terms and conditions around the provision of free postage to electoral candidates.  It also addresses enforcement and offences in relation to postal services.  Part 3 provides that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources may establish, maintain and operate a national postcode system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill, when enacted, will be included in the collective citation &ldquo;Communications Regulation Acts 2002 to 2010&rdquo;, and be read together as one Act.  The intention is for the Bill to come into operation on 1 January 2011, with the exception of section 43 which relates to the referral of postal packets to the Revenue Commissioners and Part 3 which provides for postcodes.</P>
        <P>Some key postal legislation has been updated by this Bill in order that it is compatible with a liberalised market.  Some of this legislation dates back to before the founding of the State and repeals and revocations are provided for in Part 1.</P>
        <P>Part 2 is the essence of the directive.  ComReg is designated as the national regulatory authority for the directive and its functions, objectives and powers as set out in the principal Act of 2002 are amended accordingly.  ComReg is charged with ensuring the provision of the universal postal service, promoting competition and innovation, and ensuring compliance by postal service providers with their obligations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 2 addresses ComReg&rsquo;s enforcement and information gathering powers in relation to postal operators, mainly in chapters 1, 2, 3, 9 and some of chapter 10.  The design of the enforcement element of the postal framework must be proportionate.  In this regard, the power to summon witnesses and examine them under oath, which represents a very strong enforcement option, is not appropriate for the postal sector at this time.  Similarly, I am confident the enforcement powers available to ComReg for pricing and access will allow it to discharge its competition functions without extending co-competition powers to the postal sector.</P>
      
        <P>ComReg&rsquo;s enforcement powers will result in improved services and more choice for the consumer, safeguard the provision of the universal postal service and provide regulatory certainty to encourage more players to enter the market.  The individual consumer, the business sector and the wider economy will benefit from increased competition and a broader range of services, which is the ultimate aim of this important Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The essential element of the universal postal service is the collection and delivery of mail to every home and premises in every corner of the State on every working day.  This is enshrined <Col N="916"/>in chapter 3.  Chapter 4 designates An Post as the universal postal service provider for a period of seven years.  ComReg is to review this designation before the end of the period and may designate An Post again, designate another postal service provider or decide that no such designation is required.  ComReg is also required to ensure the reasonable needs of users are met and will specify by regulations the services to be provided by a universal postal service provider.</P>
        <P>Chapter 4 also provides for oversight by ComReg of a universal postal service provider&rsquo;s terms and conditions.  This replaces An Post&rsquo;s power to set out its terms and conditions in schemes under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, under which it was established.  This is more appropriate in a liberalised market.</P>
        <P>ComReg will also have a role in price regulation.  In the interests of protecting consumers in those products or market segments in which An Post, as the dominant postal service provider, is not likely to face competition at least in the immediate term, the Bill enables ComReg to impose a price cap, providing certainty to both An Post and its customers.</P>
        <P>A central theme of the directive is the protection of the interests of users.  In this regard, the Bill sets out in section 23 the tariff principles with which the services of a universal service provider must comply, including affordability and cost orientation.</P>
        <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I am slightly concerned about the vote in the D&aacute;il.  I have two pages left and I am unsure about the procedure to be followed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case I will happily finish.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his reassurance.  I was thinking that as soon as the bell stopped I would have to run.</P>
        <P>Section 27 provides for the setting and monitoring by ComReg of quality of service targets for the designated universal service providers, while section 37 provides that prior notice be given to users where a postal service provider intends to withdraw a postal service that is within the scope of the universal postal service.  In addition, under section 38, every postal service provider is required to draw up and implement a code of practice for dealing with complaints from postal service users.  ComReg will resolve disputes that remain unresolved after the procedures in the code of practice have been followed.</P>
        <P>Chapter 6 sets out the obligations with which postal service providers must comply, distinguishing, as does the directive, between postal service providers depending on whether they offer services within or outside the scope of the universal service.  All postal service providers are required to register with ComReg, and section 32 is fundamental to the regulation of postal services in that ComReg is required to publish guidelines to enable providers to declare whether the postal services they supply are within or outside the scope of universal service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 40 extends protection for whistleblowers who disclose appropriate information regarding the postal sector to ComReg.  Chapter 7 contains a series of technical provisions associated with the provision of postal services, while chapter 10 provides for offences, including the opening of postal packets and mail bags, the sending of certain items by mail, the obstruction of a universal postal service provider, malicious interference with post boxes, and the secretion of postal packets.  Chapter 11 amends the regulation of the provision of free postage to electoral candidates, although this is not a requirement of the directive.  In keeping with the spirit of electoral legislation, the principle of free postage for electoral candidates remains unaltered.  The provisions in the Bill reflect the fact that An Post will no longer make statutory schemes under which its terms and conditions in this regard are set, and provision is <Col N="917"/>made for the Minister for Finance to designate An Post or another postal service provider to provide free election post.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 3 provides that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources may establish, maintain and operate a national postcodes system.  This provision, as I said, will be commenced during 2011.</P>
        <P>In addition to these provisions, I will be introducing a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  These amendments are being examined in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and will provide for an appeals mechanism for affected persons to appeal decisions made by ComReg, as well as enabling the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to issue directions to all postal service providers for the purpose of provisions under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.</P>
        <P>As Members know, the directive has a transposition deadline of 31 December 2010.  I look forward to hearing the views of the Members of this House on this important Bill and their assistance in facilitating its early passage into law.  I commend the Bill to the House and I am pleased to be able to bring it first to the Seanad where we have successfully debated a number of Bills in recent years to good effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and acknowledge the fact that he has initiated a number of Bills in the House and has engaged fully with the House on all occasions.</P>
        <P>As we are debating the postal services Bill, it is worth acknowledging the current success of An Post in terms of delivery speed.  The recent ComReg report is heartening in that respect.  A total of 87% of mail is delivered throughout the State within one working day while the equivalent proportion in Dublin is 86%.  The delivery service is excellent.  In addition, An Post is operating based on postage costs.  It is not being subsidised by the State.  It is self-financing in that regard, which is a major achievement.  Acknowledging that success is a good backdrop to our discussion of the legislation.  The Bill seeks to transpose Directive 2008/6/EC, the third postal directive, which provides for the final phase of opening the postal services market through the removal of the reserved area, that is, the delivery of letters weighing less than 50g.</P>
        <P>The first issue that merits discussion in the House, now and on Committee Stage, is the universal service obligation, which is vital.  No one in this House is more acutely aware of its implications and social importance than I am because of the area I am from.  It is a vital service.  I will not labour the point other than to say that all citizens of the State are equal under the Constitution.  They must receive equal service and they must get their deliveries.  It is critical.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the legislation, An Post will be the sole universal provider for seven years.  What is disturbing is that after seven years, ComReg is not obliged to appoint another universal service provider.  It may do so and it may appoint any company, but it is not legislatively obliged to do so.  In an Irish context, that is disturbing.  I am not convinced we will be in a position to dispense with a universal service provider in seven years.  This is something we need to keep an eye on.  We have removed many aspects of rural living and affected the lives of those beyond the Pale, in all senses of the word, it is vital we do not remove from these people the last vestige of dignity, which is access to postal services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">ComReg has the power to designate different postal service providers to provide different aspects of the universal service obligation.  For example, An Post could be responsible for Dublin, while some other company could be responsible for Cork and yet another responsible for the region around Athlone or Galway, where my colleagues present come from.  In that case, what would happen in the border regions between these areas?  Would there be different standards of delivery within each?  What about the cost?  It could be a nightmare scenario.  I <Col N="918"/>am not happy that this is dealt with sufficiently.  My basic contention is that we should observe European law which essentially I accept.  We will not vote against the Bill as it is a legislative imperative that we follow the directive, but my fundamental contention is that we should do so to the minimum possible degree, with the greatest focus on the needs of the country, and that we should use our discretion in its implementation to the benefit of the people.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about different standards in different areas.  It could prove difficult for some postal operators to deliver the service in the proper way.  We run a real risk of having deregulation in the most obscene sense to the extent of having an uneven standard of service and problems in Border areas.  There could well be different prices in different areas, different delivery times and an entirely different approach which ultimately would be a nightmare.  I am not saying benign administrations in the future would wish to do so, but we should build in legislative constraints to prevent anyone getting this wrong.</P>
        <P>An objective empirical study of European postal services established that Ireland was not able to accommodate two national providers of postal services as we did not have the critical mass or a sufficiently developed economy to withstand that level of competition.  This is a disturbing finding.  We need to be concerned about this if we want to maintain nationwide delivery.  If the universal service obligation is abolished, studies, including the one by PricewaterhouseCoopers, suggest Ireland will not be a Mecca for competition in that major private operators are not likely to want to come and operate throughout the entire country, but they may want to cherry-pick, wherein lies the difficulty.  We must protect consumers in that scenario.  A number of objective consultancy studies have been carried out in that regard.</P>
        <P>There is an issue with prices, which are reasonable.  The great mantra in opening up competition is that costs will be reduced.  We all accept that to increase trade and employment, we need to reduce costs.  However, the cost reductions to be realised here will benefit large industries and services; in other words, small and medium-sized enterprises, ordinary consumers and those at the lower end of the service face increased costs and will almost be providing a compensatory mechanism.  SMEs, individual consumers and small organisations, including local NGOs and voluntary organisations, will be subventing large corporations.  This is a very sinister aspect.</P>
        <P>Most of us, particularly those of us who come from rural areas, will have attended public meetings about the closure of a local post office &mdash; I have sat through such meetings for hours.  They are disturbing and traumatic events because a postmaster, postmistress, his or her family and other local people might be losing work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>A community is losing another vital service following the amalgamation of schools and the closure of the Garda station, which is all very depressing and brings back memories of the 1950s.  There is a risk that this legislation will lead to the closure of small local postal outlets as a consequence of opening up to competition.  While this is happening already to an extent, at least there is control and a democratic input.  I am very concerned about that prospect.  The Minister should consider introducing amendments on Committee State to offer protection in the legislation.  In Germany 21,000 full-time jobs and 12,000 part-time jobs were lost following the introduction of competition, while 11,000 jobs were lost in Japan.  This means we will suffer job losses at possibly the worst time.  All of us would gladly spend every waking hour trying to encourage job creation and the risk to jobs represents another difficulty with the legislation.  While we have no alternative but to accept the directive, we need to build in as many safeguards as we can and &mdash; to use that awful expression &mdash; have <Col N="919"/>something of an Irish solution to the problem.  If we do not, we run the risk of losing small post offices and jobs and increasing the cost of postal services.</P>
        <P>Through a levy, private operators will, rightly, subvent the universal service provider.  I ask the Minister to clarify if European law precludes State subvention at all times.  If it does not prevent us availing of the option of State subsidisation, we should not rule it out.  If the levy does not suffice and there is a risk posed to a good quality universal service, we should have that option, even though it is the last thing we would want to avail of.  Just as we frequently talk about job creation and cost competitiveness, we also talk about the need to reduce the cost of public services.  Subvention would be the last option, but I would not be opposed to providing for such an option in the legislation.</P>
        <P>The legislation will give the green light to the introduction of postal codes, to which I have no objection.  While modern reasoning suggests they are more efficient, I would like to be assured that they will in no way diminish, confuse or make it difficult to deliver post efficiently.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding postal codes, I am concerned about the complexities of addresses and local idioms in isolated rural areas that might prevent the efficient delivery of post.  Some years ago we used to complain about the speed of An Post deliveries.  However, An Post has upped its game and been an unqualified success.  The great work it has done in increasing the speed of delivery and ensuring next day delivery should be acknowledged.  I am concerned, however, that its success could be damaged in certain areas by the introduction of postal codes.  I would like the Minister to outline his Department&rsquo;s approach to the issue.  I could spend the last three minutes of my time by asking how complex addresses, including Gaelic versions, local idioms and distinctions, will be dealt with.  I am concerned that issues such as holiday homes could turn into an administrative nightmare.  I hope we can return to these points on Committee Stage when we will discuss any amendments the Government or we will table in keeping with our role in Parliament.  First, I am concerned about the universal service provision, that it will be maintained evenly across the country and at no extra cost to consumers.  It should not place a burden on the ordinary consumer and on small and medium enterprise as a result of cherry-picking and so forth.  Second, I am concerned that we do not lose local postal outlets through their random closure as a consequence of this.  There is a risk of unevenness of service in certain areas and a disparity between regions due to different service providers in different regions.  I am anxious to maintain evenness in that regard.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about jobs.  All the empirical findings from Germany, Japan and other states show that no state has achieved this objective without a loss of jobs.  That is horrendous, frightening and a great concern.  There is also the issue of the general quality of service and its cost.  While I acknowledge there has been a move to information technology, there is still a core number of people who use the traditional way of communicating by letter or parcel.  They have that right, regardless of where they live, their means or their level of education.  If we can protect that, I have no difficulty with the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  There are some key issues which I wish to discuss with regard to this Bill.  They include the reliability of the service and job losses.  There is also the connection with people in rural areas who are disabled and whose only contact with others for much of the time is the postman or postwoman.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An Post is the last national postal operator.  It receives no subvention from the Government.  If one posts a letter to Donegal or Enniskillen from Dublin, it costs 55 cent.  The service is delivered to any part of the country for the price of a stamp.  What does liberalisation mean?  To liberate something means one gives it its freedom, and to liberate a market simply means that one makes it a free market.  A free market is one in which anybody can compete to provide services, with products and prices determined by what the market will pay.  I am concerned, <Col N="920"/>like Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, that where there is a free market, like in transport and other areas, competition is sometimes not on a level playing pitch.  Operators cherry-pick the best areas and do not bother with rural areas where the service is vital.  I was born in a rural area and I remember that the postman would bring a pound of butter and other messages from the shop for people living alone.  The postman was the only person they might meet for a week.  That is very important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What have been the effects of liberalisation in other countries?  As Members were briefed on this issue I will not go through all the statistics.  The effects were a decline in the quality of service and very significant job losses.  New jobs were created, of course, but at low pay.  In other words, the companies got rid of people and brought in others on lower wages.  We do not want that to happen here, particularly in our current situation.  An Post employs 10,000 people.  If it were liberalised under the route we are taking now, it would mean very significant job losses, not just for postmen, postwomen and sorters but also for clerical staff, and fewer promotional outlets.  It would demotivate people and morale in the service would drop to an all-time low.</P>
        <P>The Communications Workers Union, CWU, of which I was a member, and our MEPs are seeking a moratorium on this.  In other words, they want it put on ice for a while until there is a further study to evaluate the effects it will have on the Irish postal market and on other issues, such as jobs and so forth.  The viability of the universal service obligation in a liberalised market is another serious issue.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to this.  Consider the experience with the Royal Mail in the UK, which I have studied.  One can see how important it is to get downstream access right.  If this is handled badly, it could spell the end of An Post and the 10,000 jobs.  Access to the An Post network must be on a commercial basis, not based on a price imposed on it by the regulator.  In addition, access to the network must not be below the mail centre level as this would render useless much of the investment An Post has made in technology in recent years.  It would require the entire delivery network to be reconfigured, which is another issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Reilly spoke briefly about cherry-picking, a commonly used word.  What does it mean?  It describes the process where competitors of An Post will, after liberalisation, enter the Irish market and pick only the postal routes which they believe will generate significant profits, that is, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other cities.  They will provide postal services in these areas and extract a profit.  However, this is the profit that An Post currently uses to fulfil its USO on rural routes, which are not profitable, and subsidise them.  Removing this revenue from An Post in the form of profit taking by other operators would present a significant and grave threat to the postal service currently provided in this country.  Furthermore, this approach also does nothing to guarantee the social benefits the postal services currently yield, which are particularly important in Ireland&rsquo;s dispersed rural community.</P>
        <P>Overall, we should consider this carefully for the reasons I have outlined.  Many unions and MEPs across Europe, as well as concerned citizens&rsquo; representative groups, are calling for a moratorium on the liberalisation of postal services.  Why are they demanding this?  Such a moratorium would simply pause the process where it stands at present, not stop it, and provide the necessary time to evaluate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister appears to be getting fond of us as he has been visiting the Seanad quite regularly, although this is the first time he has come to discuss this topic.  He is welcome.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill.  I was chairman of An Bord Poist for four years and chairman of An Post for six years and I made it my policy when I became a Member of the <Col N="921"/>Seanad not to speak on postal matters.  One does a job and one steps out of it and it did not appear right to come back to it afterwards.  To a certain extent, after all these years I am breaking that promise I made myself.  I recall when we came up with the name of An Post, the then Minister responsible at its launch said, &ldquo;And in English it will be known as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;.  I had to run over to him to explain it does not need a translation.  &ldquo;Post&rdquo; is the term in both languages; tourists, for example, would understand it immediately.  The name has worked very well on that basis.</P>
        <P>Back in the 1980s I was impressed with the workforce&rsquo;s talent in the postal service and their concentration and dedication to service.  This was a talent that was to a certain extent strangled when the service was run as a Department.  When the service was given its freedom, it was a joy to see this talent emerge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The then Department of Posts and Telegraphs was divided between An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom.  There was a bit of competition between myself and Michael Smurfit, chairman of the latter.  It seemed to have plenty of money, taking four-minute radio advertisements, while An Bord Poist had no money to launch An Post.  I remember inviting half a dozen top marketing people to dinner one night to see how we could handle a launch without the money.  The idea came up to charge only for a one penny stamp for all handwritten letters on the day of An Post&rsquo;s launch on 1 January 1984.  The handwritten letter clause was to avoid banks and commercial companies using it and resulting in a drop of income.  The campaign went very well.  It was assumed at the time that it would cost us money.  One in four who received a penny letter felt obliged to reply and four days later there was a huge boost in business with the full postage cost being paid.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have great memories of the people in An Post and their enthusiasm.  I am concerned as to how we will hold on to that same measure of enthusiasm.  I accept that nothing stays the same in any business.  Like many other forms of retailing, the postal service is a high volume, low margin business.  In 1983, I first saw a fax machine which I thought would threaten An Post&rsquo;s future.  We do not see any of them now.  The Internet and e-mail had yet to be invented.  In the 1980s we referred to the public users of the postal service.  Only when we changed to referring to &ldquo;customers&rdquo;, were we able to make changes. Mail volumes have fallen a massive 16% since the start of 2009, with each 1% drop accounting for a loss of &euro;5 million, as traditional letter writing dies out and consumers turn to e-billing.  An Post has indicated it will have to cut staff numbers by more than 400 by the end of the year.</P>
        
        <P>The postal service is not just any business that is being knocked to one side because of the Internet.  It is a public good.  Post offices unite communities and the postal service connects remote regions to the centre.  In the context of the future Common Agricultural Policy and stimulating rural areas, it is necessary to increase the attractiveness of rural areas by ensuring access to different public services and infrastructure, such as education, health, broadband Internet, transport and postal services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, one of the constant problems in the background in this country is that of dispersal in rural areas which results in increased costs in many areas such as energy, transportation, etc.  I visit France regularly.  There I have noted in some towns and villages the post is no longer delivered to one&rsquo;s door.  Instead post boxes are located at the front of estates and so on.  This idea must apply in so many other ways such that the concept of bungalow blight does not make sense.</P>
        <P>Expanding on this point, with physical addresses changing so quickly, very often an e-mail address remains the only constant.  SendSocial, a start-up company in the UK, has seized upon this idea and allows consumers to send packages to people even if they do not have their postal address by providing an e-mail address, for instance.</P><Col N="922"/>
        <P>SmartPost is a similar new innovation from Estonia.  Given that the postal service there is poor with no nationwide courier services, SmartPost has developed a system of lockers and tied them together with sophisticated software.  Online and catalogue shoppers can have goods delivered to one of 36 locations.  To open the lockers, the firm sends users a text message with a code.  The concept means the collection points are near to where people are, meaning mostly in supermarkets.  The French postal service has a similar locker system with lockers on avenues or major transport hubs.  It could be near home, office, holiday location or train station.  For the sender, it is very simple &mdash; one address, one e-mail.  The recipient stays in control of where the item goes and they do not have to be there to wait for the package to be delivered.</P>
        <P>These types of systems would seem to make sense in Ireland with its dispersed population.  Can post vans in rural areas do more than deliver letters?  In Scotland, they act as minibuses too.  Does An Post consider buying minibuses instead of vans for this purpose?  Surely, they would not be much more expensive than a van.  We experimented with this in the 1980s in An Post.  It is a business idea worth examining.</P>
        <P>As we look at falling demand for postal services, should we be scared of private operators coming into the market?  The unions in An Post have some concerns about this.  There is the argument that private sector companies will be purely in it for profit.  Some postal service experts, however, believe that private postal operators are, by and large, better positioned to cope with falling demand than State-owned operators.</P>
        <P>For example, Deutsche Post and the Netherlands TNT Post, both privatised, have diversified into parcels and express deliveries and are as efficient as postal services get.  Deutsche Post, TNT Post and Belgian Post have invested for the long term.  Deutsche Post has invested in acquisitions at home and abroad, TNT in foreign expansion and Belgian Post in automation.  Since Sweden&rsquo;s Posten AB was privatised in 1993, prices for business customers have fallen by around 30%, although they have risen for consumers.  I recall when working with An Post any suggestion of different prices for different customer types was almost a heresy.  If we could get a postman delivering six letters to the door rather than one, then more business, and accordingly profit, could be developed at a lower price.  In other words, one would bring the price of a stamp down.  Direct marketing had not been used until then and was in its infancy.  At the time 500 letters <i>per capita</i> per year were posted in the United States; the figure in Britain was 200.  In Ireland, however, it was only 100 because we had traditionally charged a high price.  In the budget the price would go up again to see if more money could be taken in.  In those days it was not a business but a service that was being run by the State.  Being able to generate far more business and make more profit from it at a lower price is called price elasticity, but it would only work if customers responded to it.  In those days customers were not &mdash; they still are not &mdash; the ones receiving mail.  Nowadays I see a lot of &ldquo;No junk mail&rdquo; signs outside houses.  We did not call it junk mail at the time, rather we called it direct marketing, although the recipients are often not so polite about it.</P>
        <P>Maintaining services in rural areas is going to be difficult, but we must strive to do so.  In addition, we should not necessarily have undue fear at the thought of private companies entering the market.  As has been seen in neighbouring European countries, they often provide an even more efficient service.  I welcome this debate, therefore, as one which is aiming towards achieving a better deal for customers.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to see the changes taking place, not just in the postal service but also in every aspect of our lives.  The postal service is one that has certainly changed dramatically in the last 20 years because of new technology.  We must ensure we retain the ability, talent and dedication of individuals in An Post.  I remember being in the post office in Ballinasloe when, after clean<Col N="923"/>ing up after the day&rsquo;s work, it was discovered that one letter had been left behind.  It would have killed the postmen to think they had not delivered it.  They remembered that there was someone next door who lived close to the addressee and the letter was delivered that night.  It will not be easy to maintain such dedication.</P>
        <P>On the very first day An Post introduced the one penny stamp.  In order to achieve this, we issued a load of stamps to every post office in the country.  One postmaster told me that we were moving in the wrong direction.  People had no idea we were going to issue stamps for one penny to mark the start of An Post, of which I was chairman.  One postmaster, whom I know, ran out of stamps.  However, he showed initiative by cutting two penny stamps diagonally to create a one penny stamp.  I gather the few hundred stamps he cut are now highly valuable for collectors.</P>
        <P>I could recount many more such stories from the time An Post began and it is sad to see the tradition changing.  It is one that dates back to the Royal Mail&rsquo;s penny post in 1840.  However, things change and the developments envisaged under the Bill are the right way to go.  Can we take these steps, while at the same time holding onto the dedication customers enjoyed in the past, and still remain profitable?</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on the legislation, although some of it has been foisted on him by European and other international rules.  However, we do not have a choice.  It is the correct way to go for customers who are citizens of Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious that we have one universal provider of postal services in the country.  There are dangers inherent in the changes that take place in implementing an EU directive and these should be flagged.  An Post&rsquo;s services have been profitable and successful.  It has a 90% next-day delivery rate and provides banking and bill payment services.  We must ensure such services will continue to be provided, as An Post is an integral part of the community.  Members of the House are grateful for the postal service provided, particularly at Christmas time when there is a large volume of mail each day.  It requires extra effort to handle such volumes and it is always made.</P>
        <P>We should recognise the social aspect of the service provided by An Post.  We all know our local postman.  An Post has become an integral part of the lives of older people in particular in that postmen maintain social interaction through mail delivery, while local post office staff provide various services.  At a time of insecurity such as the current banking crisis people may be worried when listening to the media but they know An Post provides a safe haven.</P>
        <P>The main focus of An Post is on the provision of postal services.  If it is to have a universal service obligation, there must be a level playing field for any other company which wants to enter the market.  Such a company might not want to deliver in certain areas such as remote rural parts, while cherry-picking profitable services in urban areas.  That is one concern I have.  Post offices should be fully paid for the volume of work they will undertake, including the handling and sorting of mail, as well as delivery services.</P>
        <P>We are making decisions now that will affect us in the future.  In other European countries new providers are paying low wages while in competition with others which are offering very good terms and conditions of employment.  The matter is in our own hands, on the basis of EU regulations.  I am conscious of the EU directive &ldquo;Recycle 16&rdquo; which places an obligation on new providers to grant proper terms and conditions of employment.  Given that we have a social economy, one of those terms and conditions should place emphasis on workers becoming members of a trade union to protect their interests.  In that way we could avoid the practice that prevails in other countries in which union membership is frowned upon.</P><Col N="924"/>
        <P>There should be no job losses as a result of this legislation.  The opening up of the sector should not be at the expense of existing postal services.  It should mark an improvement in services, while ensuring current service levels are maintained.  This can only be done by maintaining jobs.  In providing a universal postal system during the years An Post has managed to remain profitable.  However, its profit amounts to less than 1% of turnover.</P>
        <P>We may lose two things as a result of these changes: first, the universal provision of services, and, second, a profitable service.  In addition, stamps are cheap to buy.  How, therefore, will the Minister maintain these if we do not impose a strong levy on any non-universal service provider establishing in this country?  It is well known that there will be cherry-picking, but this should not be encouraged.  It is of no benefit to the State to have low paid jobs, while profits are being removed from the country and a proper social service is not being provided.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for attending this debate.  I support liberalisation only on the basis that the same rules that apply to An Post will apply to all new providers.  The main rule is the universal service obligation.  Otherwise, something intended to bring more competition into the market will be blatantly uncompetitive if there is not a level playing field for all providers.  The universal service obligation means that An Post delivers the same item of mail at the same cost to rural customers, which is less attractive to providers who wish to cherry-pick the best business, as to urban areas that are more profitable.  The same rules must apply to all providers.</P>
        <P>I have met many of the workers at An Post and they are quite happy to open up the service on that basis.  Otherwise, the legislation will be blatantly unfair.  That is the main amendment that must be included in the Bill.  If there is to be liberalisation of the postal service, the same rules must apply to all providers.  Currently, a letter delivered to Clifden, County Galway costs 55 cent, the same price as a letter delivered in Dublin city or Galway city.  Politicians sometimes use publicity mail.  I have not used it but I have checked prices.  I can get 1,000 leaflets delivered in Galway city for &euro;50 but in rural areas it will cost &euro;90.  Why should An Post have to meet the universal service obligation and lose money and jobs if other providers are allowed to cherry pick with downstream access to the An Post network?  It is blatantly unfair.  The purpose of this Bill is to bring about more competition and a better deal for the consumer but it could be a far worse deal for the consumer.</P>
        <P>The great thing about our friendly postman or postwoman is that we know them.  They are safe and secure and they have a badge with which we identify.  Many people right across Ireland leave their homes open, irrespective of whether it is recommended.  I have done it.  The postman will open the door and drop in the post.  I know my postman but if we open it up to every type of provider, while they might have the right to provide a service, we will not have the same security in our homes.  There can be a downside to this in other ways and we must examine the social impact.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the universal service obligation is not to be imposed on all providers, the legislation must find a way to provide State aid in a worst case scenario in order that An Post can afford to deliver in the areas no one else wants.  The only way to open up the market and fund the universal service obligation is to impose the same obligation on all operators to deliver everywhere at the same price as An Post does.  This is what has happened in Finland and it is the <Col N="925"/>only place it is working.  The legislation must oppose cherry picking and adopt the Finnish<?oasys _jy ?>model.</P>
        <P>Downstream access is a key point.  Competitors may compete for customers posting at a lower rate than An Post and then insert it into the An Post network for delivery.  The downside is that An Post could end up receiving mail at the delivery office level, having lost out at the postage level and be forced to operate at a loss.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  The legislation must prevent downstream access below mail centre level.  Otherwise there will be no remuneration to An Post.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has great experience of regulators and that will be an issue here.  The legislation gives ComReg unfettered powers to decide on almost every matter regardless of social implications.  Experience shows regulators have facilitated competition by curbing the previous monopoly providers&rsquo; market share, by allowing cherry-picking and downstream access and price caps.  Let us consider the experience in the UK.  Royal Mail is in great trouble because this is what happened.  The UK example shows that regulatory policy has been a contributory factor in this precarious situation and, in the Hooper report of September 2010, the UK Government is considering how to address it.  The legislation should ensure the regulator is answerable to the Minister and the Oireachtas on key matters such as the universal service obligation, which has national implications.  The role of the regulator in regard to electricity supply is worrying.  The price has been kept up to attract competition but we should bear in mind what happened to the consumer.  The Minister understands this point.</P>
        <P>Employment is not to be scoffed at.  An Post has hired 10,000 people nationally and 500 people in the constituency in which I live, Galway West.  They are good people and committed to the universal service obligation.  They understand the social implications and the duties of it.  The legislation should look to protect jobs.  I thank the Minister for listening.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his insightful speech.  I am a little breathless because I ran in all the way from the gate.  I appreciate that the Minister&rsquo;s intentions are worthwhile and Fine Gael does not oppose Second Stage of the Bill.  However, I have serious concerns, as my colleagues have stated, in regard to jobs, sounding the death knell for rural post offices and what this might mean for rural areas.  As Senator Brady said, the postman is the only person an older person will see in some rural areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The universal service obligation must be considered in terms of An Post.  Other speakers mentioned cherry-picking.  Profitable routes in urban areas heretofore subsidised remote rural areas.  We cannot lose the value these people bring to the rural areas.  That 87% of post is delivered on time is phenomenal.  We take this for granted.  A price of 55 cent is extremely good value and is one of the lowest prices in Europe.  Why are we breaking something that is not broken?</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have serious concerns about ComReg.  This has nothing to do with the regulator but our experience of regulators in this country has been shabby.  The Minister should be ultimately responsible and should have control.  He should be able to see where things are going wrong and put a stop to it.  Quangos such as the HSE and the NRA are very bad in this country.  I refer to the Recycle 16 directive, which provides for social protection.  I ask the Minister to ensure this is included in the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn referred to Germany but he did not mention the massive number of people who lost their jobs.  Some 21,000 full-time jobs were lost and 12,000 part-time jobs were lost.  I come from Athlone, that has one of the four main postal centres.  It provides the best service <Col N="926"/>and they are amazing people.  I do not want to lose any jobs in the Athlone area.  In Athlone we had our very own Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Paddy Cooney.  At that time he was in control.  He ensured the service was run efficiently.  More people were using the service then.  The art of letter writing will come back.  Times have changed.  Children will start to write letters again.  We must keep a connection with people throughout the country.  I urge the Minister to bear the role of the regulator in mind.  The Minister should keep control and ensure we do not give power to a regulator who is not caring or who is asleep, as has happened.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I still have them but I do not collect them any longer.  I remember when I got my first Penny Black.  It was a major event to get my hands on the first stamp in the world.  It was extraordinary to see it.  I also collected Penny Reds and other British stamps.  The first Irish stamps were overprints.  It is quite interesting that instead of printing our own stamps we put an overprint on British stamps.  Times have moved on.  The favourite television programme of one of my children, and perhaps mine as well, is &ldquo;Postman Pat&rdquo;.  The notion of it being changed to &ldquo;Special Delivery Service Man Pat&rdquo; makes it clear that times are moving on.  It is quite extraordinary that in the British Empire one could literally get a letter delivered to London the next day by the great British postal system.  The logistics of that are extraordinary when one considers the times that were in it.  We can knock the British all we like but the reality is some of the things they did in their great days of empire were extraordinary.  The postal service was one of them.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator McFadden spoke about the postal service in Athlone.  The reality is we very much copied the British system.  We must recognise that over the years we have had a great postal service in this country.  As Senator Quinn said, we must recognise that times are changing.  A 16% drop in the volume of post is significant.  There is a change in the way people communicate.  People can communicate instantly by telephone or computer.  For example, within seconds of the events happening last night in South Korea, someone could capture an image on a mobile telephone and send it to me as I was sitting in the Seanad Chamber.  A postal system based on letters cannot keep up with that kind of thing.  I accept that letters were not used in that way but it was impossible to do that in the past.  The level of communication we have now is extraordinary.  I refer, for example, to Twitter and various text services, e-mail and the electronic transfer of funds.  People use electronic banking now to a much greater extent.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, there is a need for a postal service.  Internet shopping is an interesting development.  People buy goods from other countries on the Internet that are delivered by the postal service instead of going to shops as was previously the case.  It is not simply the case that there is a diminution in the need for postal deliveries to one&rsquo;s door.  There is an increase in demand in some areas.  The Minister is taking on a rapidly changing situation.  He is trying to improve it enormously.</P>
        <P>The introduction of postcodes is very important.  I lived in London for a number of years.  People referred to the area where I lived, Wimbledon, as SW19.  The postcode was written on <Col N="927"/>the names of the roads in the area.  It is quite extraordinary that people very much identified with their postcode.  That is still the case in the United Kingdom.  Postcodes are very handy because they speed up the delivery of post and provide for a more modern postal service.  I understand they can speed up the sorting time within the postal service.  If we are going to maintain what Senator McFadden referred to as a proper postal service in this country, we need to modernise it to the maximum extent to ensure we can save jobs which are under enormous pressure.</P>
        <P>A number of speakers rightly made the point about the universal service obligation.  I do not know how we are going to protect the rural postal service to the extent we would all like.  I have seen the closure of post offices throughout the country.  However, it is not as simple as that.  Senator Quinn rightly pointed out that in many parts of France people must collect their post from a central location.  I would not like to see that system introduced here.  At present, farmhouses up long country lanes get personal deliveries to their door.  That is obviously very inefficient but we must consider whether we expect old people to walk or drive perhaps up to 20 miles in some cases to pick up their post.  One can ask whether that is what we want or whether it is economically sustainable that for the sake of the delivery of one letter to a person&rsquo;s door, a postman in a van must travel 20 miles.  I do not know whether it is realistic for that to be sustained.  We need to be imaginative and to ensure we do the best we can.</P>
        <P>It is true that while the liberalisation of the postal system is important, it will work much better in cities than in rural areas.  It will work perfectly well in cities but it will be difficult in rural areas.  I urge the Minister to examine what has happened to the deregulation of the waste system in this country.  The privatisation of waste collection has worked in some areas but the reality is that large areas of this country have no waste collection service.  I have spoken to people on Galway County Council which now has no waste collection service of its own.  It relies purely on private operators.  Many people do not get their waste collected at all.  Some people bury waste while others burn it.  That has led to enormous problems in parts of the country.</P>
        <P>I am a member of the same party as the Minister who is trying to cope with this issue.  I accept there is a downside to such matters.  The reality is that if we do not have the postman coming to the door every day, as Senator McFadden rightly pointed out, there is a social effect.  The issue is not purely to do with the efficiency of the postal service.  The postal service is part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  Unfortunately, we are not living in the days of Postman Pat, his lovely black and white cat, Mrs. Goggins, and their lovely cakes and tea.  Perhaps that is a reality in some parts of the country but those days are numbered.  Significant challenges face the Minister and future Ministers in terms of the postal service because of the enormous pressure from electronic mail and other methods of communication.  The reality is that the art of letter writing has somewhat died away.  It was prevalent in the early years of the 20th century.  It provided a considerable record of what went on around the time of the foundation of the State.  The sad thing about electronic mail is that while it may be recorded currently, it disappears.  Recently, I was told that the cost of data storage in terms of energy emissions has surpassed the cost of motor vehicles.  This is extraordinary.  Data storage on Internet sites like Facebook is unsustainable, in that we cannot keep using massive amounts of energy to store these volumes of information indefinitely.  We have seen what happens with housing bubbles and an Internet bubble might be building.</P>
        <P>The integrity of the postal system is important and considerable challenges face us.  That the Minister is examining the matter creatively is important and necessary.  As various Senators mentioned, the manner of the Bill&rsquo;s implementation is as important as the Bill itself.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and his officials to our Second Stage debate.  I thank the departmental officials who offered advice and a briefing on the legislation.  It is a helpful service, although it is not provided universally.  As people are under time pressures, I appreciate their help.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The debate on rural areas and their service providers is not always a question of economics.  I have made this point in respect of the closure of rural creameries and of the role rural pubs play in terms of rural isolation, community and how people congregate, socialise and interact.  The local primary school also plays a significant role in this regard.  From this point of view, we must be careful not to scale back what is on offer in rural Ireland on a purely economic basis.  For various reasons, it has been under considerable pressure in recent years, and we must preserve what fibre is left of it.  Recently, I had this argument with someone who claimed a particular creamery should be closed.  Having visited the creamery and given my understanding of the interaction that takes place, I know the creamery issue was about more than just the buying and selling of goods.  It is a place where people meet and interact.  This is somewhat like the rural transport initiative.  Were one to apply an economic or accounting argument to the creamery, one would have got rid of it long ago.  However, it is not just a question of economics, given factors such as significant social interaction in rural areas, combating rural isolation and preserving the remaining social fabric.  I hope we never take an axe to that type of service.</P>
        <P>I understand that the universal service obligation, USO, addresses my concerns.  I acknowledge the lobbying done by people throughout the country, particularly those in my area, who have a vested interest in post offices.  I also acknowledge the worthwhile and detailed information sent to us by the Communications Workers Union, CWU.  We are discussing the delivery of letters to rural and urban areas.  Historically, the provision of postal services has been based on the USO and the same-price-goes-anywhere principle.  This was supported by a monopoly or a reserved area wherein An Post was the only operator that could carry out the delivery and collection of mail below a certain weight.  This enabled An Post to cross-subsidise by utilising profitable urban routes to carry the burden of loss-making in rural areas.  This is an important point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Healy Eames discussed cherry-picking or cream-skimming, therefore, I will only touch on the issue briefly, as I might be repetitious.  Competitors will enter the market and undercut An Post on the profitable routes.  The delivery of telephone books has been taken out of the hands of An Post by private commercial interests.  I am making an observation, not a criticism.  One enters an estate or passes a street where there is clearly a derelict house or a house that is no longer in use but in front of which a telephone book wrapped in plastic has been thrown.  This constitutes littering, but there is also an issue about the quality and delivery of service.  How sure are we that the service being provided is of the same standard as that of An Post?  This is not entirely the case.</P>
        <P>Competitors will not compete in loss-making routes, but An Post will still be required to service those routes under the USO.  If it loses market share on profitable routes, it cannot cross-subsidise and, in a short time, will go to the wall.  The only way to open up the market and fund the USO is to impose the same obligation on all operators to deliver everywhere at the same price as An Post.  This would maintain the <i>status quo</i> following the entry of private operators.  This occurred in Finland and in countries with similar urban and rural population dispersal patterns.  Our population is no different from those of the countries in which this has been done successfully.</P>
        <P>Our legislation must be clear.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, is amiable and has been good in amending legislation where he has agreed with points made by the Opposition.  We should <Col N="929"/>examine the Finnish model as a means of opposing cherrypicking.  I hope the Minister can understand my point about maintaining the <i>status quo</i> and adopting the Finnish model.</P>
        <P>In the current climate, the word &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; has various connotations that depend on the context.  We complain about a lack of regulation in our banking system and over-regulation in other areas, but we must be clear where ComReg&rsquo;s role is concerned.  For example, in what respect has the Taxi Regulator been successful and why has it not been successful in other respects?  We must ensure that we not over-regulate the industry.  The service being received by the customer, Joe and Mary Soap, must be of the same standard.  We must examine the matter from this aspect and not purely in terms of the administration of regulation.</P>
        <P>The Minister might have experience in this regard, but he certainly knows better than I do that, in recent years, there has been a proliferation of regulators.  We need to ensure the regulator is responsible to the Minister, irrespective of who the Minister is and whether there has been a change of Government.  There must be accountability and transparency.  As public representatives, we all offer ourselves to the electorate from time to time.  It is right that we are held accountable and thoroughly scrutinised.  I do not like the new tier of administration, be it in the form of a quango or another body set up by the Government to administer a particular service and from which there is no accountability or transparency.  When discharging our functions as public representatives, it is good to know with whom one is dealing and the level of interaction allowable by the organisation.  Accountability is paramount in the delivery of a service.  I urge the Minister to ensure the regulator is answerable not only to him, but also to the Oireachtas on key issues like the USO, which has national implications.  It is important that we reserve our right to bring someone before an Oireachtas committee for questioning on key issues.</P>
        <P>A strong employment issue is attached to the legislation.  I do not need to explain to anyone how important the preservation of jobs in rural areas is.  Sadly, jobs are the only game in town because of the lack of them.  We must prevent the further loss of jobs in rural Ireland.  West County Cork has lost jobs in the construction, manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries, for example, in the company for which I worked before becoming a full-time public representative, Schering-Plough in Innishannon, which had a significant workforce in a rural area.  We must be mindful that the preservation of jobs in rural areas is paramount.  As I have often stated in the House, each lost job costs the State approximately &euro;20,000 in lost taxation and social welfare payments.  We do not need to spend too much time on these figures to know we are much better off maintaining as many jobs as possible.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in broached the matter of postal codes.  He stated that he lived in SW19 in Wimbledon.  I lived in SW14 in west Kensington, then the less popular address of NW2 in Willesden.  I would be mindful of introducing postal codes.  I have particular views on any initiative in this regard, but whatever we do must be efficient and effective and provide good value for money.  A number of years ago, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE allocated approximately &euro;1.9 million for a family resource centre for Dunmanway in west County Cork, but it never went ahead for a number of reasons.  Planning was one possible reason, as was, perhaps, the location of the proposed building.  In recent times, however, Teagasc was rationalised and put its building on the market.  The HSE purchased it for &euro;180,000 to locate the family resource centre in it, effectively at less than a tenth of the price it was willing to pay during the boom.  We must be very mindful of value for money.  Whatever scheme the Department proposes to introduce or whatever change it makes, we need to be clear that value for money is at the heart of it, the taxpayer is getting a good deal and the service to be provided is good, effective and efficient.</P><Col N="930"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is essential that employment standards are protected.  I refer in particular to some of the information provided for us on the European postal directive which states that social considerations should be taken into account when preparing the opening up of the postal market.  That goes back to my earlier contribution and we need to be very clear about this.  The actual service being provided is never down to economics, audits or finance.  We must be mindful of social considerations.  To give another example, in recent times the TUPE provision was removed from a contract for a ferry service for Cape Clear Island off the west Cork coast.  The idea of the TUPE clause, involving a transfer of undertakings, was to protect the rights, conditions and employment standards of the people moving from one employer to another.  Not only are there employment standards, there are also social considerations to be considered.  We need to be sure about that and if we do not do it this time, we can guess what will happen next time.  It happened in the case to which I referred.</P>
        <P>There are many more points I wish to make, but some of them have been discussed in detail by Senator Healy Eames who obviously used some of the same lobbying information as I have.  I wish to make this point in terms of An Post.  It has never needed State aid or taxpayers&rsquo; support.  The price of the stamp funds the universal service obligation which ensures delivery to every single door.  With the removal of the postal monopoly from An Post, it is unclear how the universal service obligation will fare.  I ask the Minister to be especially mindful of that.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the support and help offered by the Minister&rsquo;s officials.  I hope the Minister will carry forward the same degree of flexibility he has shown in other legislation he has steered through this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One other concern is downstream access.  Senator Healy Eames also referred to this issue.  I will not be in the Chamber for the Minister&rsquo;s reply but I will listen to it on the monitor.  I hope he takes these points on board because they were meant to be taken in a constructive fashion, and that we will see our way towards amending the legislation on later Stages, assuming we are still here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for listening to our contributions on what I believe to be a very important issue.  The first indication I got about this legislation was from some of the union representatives who wanted it stopped at any cost.  On investigation, I informed the people who contacted me that the legislation would provide whatever protection it could and that it was effectively the roll-out of a directive which had been in existence for a number of years and only now seemed to be causing concern as it sought to deal with the common envelope postage size, to which it attached relevance.  I made the point to those who were concerned about the protection of the social service as well as the excellent door-to-door service we enjoy that if we did not legislate, full liberalisation would be introduced in January 2011.  Therefore, the fact we are enacting legislation is very significant.  It is important Ireland recognises the value of the unique situation it enjoys while bearing in mind the changes taking place within postal delivery services nationally and internationally.</P>
        <P>Incidentally, the people who contacted me used e-mail, not post, and that leads one to ask why they used this form of communication.  Was it for reasons of cost or speed or did they believe their overtures would be taken more seriously?  That comes back to one of the points in the Minister&rsquo;s speech, which surprised me, namely, that 90% of postal mail is devoted to business delivery.  I had not realised everything else only amounted to 10%.  Some of the people contacting me would not consider it business, perhaps, and would view politics as being different as well.</P>
        <P>It is important to find the balance between having a very efficient service, as we have, and being able to liberalise and have competition, given what Members have said in this debate. <Col N="931"/> As representatives of the people, we are not immune from the situation around us.  My region is the size of County Louth with a population equivalent to County Leitrim.  My colleague, Senator Mooney, will be able to vouch for the fact that some counties have very few big towns.  In my area, with 32,000 people, there is one town of about 4,500 and two with about 1,500 in each.  Everything else is rural.  I could name the postmen in the area because we all know them.  We know the postmen for the different regions.  When one is looking for someone it is normal to find the postman and he will tell one where everyone is.  Normally he is the only point of contact for the elderly.  I know that is not a good enough reason to keep the postal service, but it is something we must bear in mind.  Postal staff are able to keep a handle on what is going on socially in the countryside, and in some instances they alone are in a position to get help, when needed, for someone in a particular region who may not have an alternative source of contact.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of anywhere where people have to drive 20 miles to deliver a letter, but in much of my area one might drive that distance and come across only a handful of people.  No on drives 20 miles just for the sake of it.  We have fought the battle for the retention of post offices.  This was an issue for a number of years, with post offices closing because they could not compete with the banks.  It is ironic that we now have campaigns aimed at getting people to use their post offices while it is the banks that are causing the most grief.</P>
        <P>I thank all those involved in installing computers and new facilities in post offices which have enabled them to increase the services they can provide.  The campaign for retaining post offices was very particular about emphasising the need for people to use the service.  In some respects, I would use the same argument now to those using e-mail or texting rather than sending a hand-written letter.  There is an onus on people to use a service if they want to maintain it.  A popular bone of contention for us is when a bus service ceases and one receives 50 letters of complaint.  One contacts the bus company only to be told that no more than three of those who signed the letters actually used the bus to prevent the service from being suspended.  There is a circular argument about the use of the services that may be in place at a particular time.</P>
        <P>I want to highlight my complete abhorrence of the attacks that have taken place on post offices, such as the one in Carrigans.  There has been a long story to that.  The post mistress was taken out of her job there and, while I will not go into the details, I am sure the Minster is aware of the case.  It is deplorable, however, that people can attack our post offices which represent such a vibrant part of our communities and which we have fought hard to maintain.  We have given the post offices extra services and responsibilities and they are regarded as an integral part of our communities, especially along the Border.  Now those working in the service believe themselves to be the target for opportunistic criminals from across the Border.</P>
        <P>The issue of integrity of the post is something I want to touch on as well.  Many people talk about the postal code they might have had in London.  I lived in Nigeria for a while and in terms of the communal post boxes there, one could be guaranteed one would never get any money or valuables that might have been sent to one.  The integrity of the postal system is of the utmost importance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have raised the issue of the phone book with the Minister before.  There was consultation and I am interested to hear what evolved.  I took three telephone books in three years and the font size in the directories has become increasingly small, so small now as to be actually wrapping around into where the book folds.  There were certain numbers I looked up from year to year, but it has got to the stage now that even I, with relatively good sight courtesy of laser treatment, cannot read the number.  Telephone books are mostly used by elderly people who may not know how to obtain a number from a website or how to use the directory exchange facility.</P><Col N="932"/>
        <P>As stated by Senator McCarthy there are oceans of books lying around apartment complexes.  I would prefer if An Post printed half the amount of telephone books it prints and that in those printed a reasonable sized font which people can read was used.  Also, rather than deliver telephone books people could collect them from a designated place in a town or village.  If owing to cost and the need to reduce the amount of paper used a smaller font is being used I suggest it would be better for An Post to print half the amount of telephone books it currently prints and for it to be more careful in terms of distribution.  I made a contribution on this matter to the public consultation forum.  It is an important matter to groups such as Age Action Ireland and so on.  We are inhibiting people from using services.  It is important we try to minimise the negative and maximise the positive.</P>
        <P>To return to the issues outlined in regard to the unions, the universal services obligation and the legislation needing to make provision for what will happen in a worse case scenario, I am concerned about the possibility of cherry picking of what is profitable.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This links into what I term the social advantage.  The employment issues speak for themselves.  As far as I am aware, everybody currently employed in the postal service is engaged in the delivery of mail.  I do not believe there is anybody hiding in a hedge waiting for time to pass.  All the postmen I know are out from early morning until late at night delivering mail because of the increase in volume at this time.  This and the fact that everybody wants to stop and talk to the postman results in delays.</P>
        <P>This legislation should ensure that the regulator is answerable to the Minister and the Oireachtas on key matters such as the USO, which has national implications.  Other legislation has been enacted which provides for outside interference or ministerial control.  The National Roads Authority and Health Service Executive are not answerable to anybody and despite our having regulation of the credit union sector, credit unions are unable to appeal decisions to anybody.  It is important we maintain some control in this area, even it is by way of committee scrutiny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  However, I do not welcome this legislation.  These are utilities which should provide maximise service to the public. I do not believe this will happen under this legislation.  We have had the example of Eircom in respect of which we had forelock-tugging to abstract notions of privatisation and of competition.  Where has competition got us in that context?  Eircom was flung onto the market and taken over by one of the moguls, was asset stripped and thrown back like a herring bone picked clean.  We have the lowest investment in broadband thanks to the competition to which we are paying such marked attention here.  I do not believe in it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are talking about services to the community.  Competition in this area will weaken rural services.  There is no provision to protect people against the cherry picking that will take place.  There is often no Garda presence in rural areas.  There may be in a local town a button one can push to speak to a machine.  This legislation will result in a weakening of the personal contact which many people in isolated rural areas depend on in terms of the social fabric.  I do not like that aspect of the legislation.  I disregard the references in the Minister&rsquo;s speech to effective competition.  I do not bow down to these shibboleths, rather I look underneath them to see if they serve the people.  In my opinion, most of the time they do not.  The same is true of the markets and other notions to which we have allowed people to give absurd deference.</P><Col N="933"/>
        <P>I accept there is a shifting pattern and that people use electronic communication.  It may well be that the Minister has a point when he says the postal service needs to reassess itself.  I am glad that it has been given some degree of security for seven years.  I will not be supporting this Bill unless it is substantially amended.  I welcome that at least the Minister has provided that there will be Exchequer support if an unfair burden is created on An Post.  However, this indicates to me that the Minister knows well that there will be an unfair burden on it.  We all know that.  I do not accept that this legislation should be supported or that it is necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not aware of what other speakers said as I was attending a meeting.  The historical base of our postal service under the universal service obligation is important in that it obliges the State services to deliver and collect mail for the same price, regardless of location.  This is akin to the provision of social bus services in the country.  The USO was supported and ensured An Post had exclusive rights to anything under 50 grammes.  I do not believe it is good to abolish this and will be opposing this aspect of the legislation.  It is important that we continue to regard this country as composed of a society of people and not as a market with competition and so on.  I will be strongly supporting the principle of universal service obligation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keaveney referred to cherry-picking.  We all know this is what is going to happen.  This is what happens in a commercial market.  A company would be wrong not to do so.  That is the ethos, not of An Post, but of commercial firms.  They will take the profitable routes and undercut An Post, which will be hamstrung because it will have to try to continue the unprofitable routes.  This is unfair competition.  If An Post loses its market share, it will be in serious financial trouble. If one is to open up the market and fund the universal service obligation one has to impose on all operators the same obligation to deliver everywhere at the same price and in the same way.  In other words, we must have market equalisation.  Let us have a fair playing field as between An Post and these possible new entrants.  These new entrants will also have downstream access whereby they can enter at a lower rate than An Post.  The implications of this, in terms of employment, are stark.  Royal Mail in Britain is losing money because it is delivering mail for competitors at a rate set by the regulator.  It was the regulator that insisted on increases in gas and electricity, which was directly against the interest of the public and utility companies.  The regulator has facilitated cherry-picking.  Some 21,000 full time and 12,000 part time jobs have been lost in Germany.  I could go on and give more figures but I am sure other Members have already done so.</P>
        
        <P>I am deeply suspicious of this legislation.  I will be seeking to amend it.  If it survives unamended, I will be opposing it.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in terms of the concerns expressed by the CWO.   There are one or two other issues I would like to raise.  Instinctively, I am in favour of competition.  Competition has been good for us.  The European Single Market has been particularly good for Ireland.  In these troubled times, our exports are booming and our low corporation tax rate <Col N="934"/>has helped not only multinationals but also indigenous companies and this indicates we are doing well in that regard.  I have no difficulty with this measure from an ideological point of view.  However, we should look across the pond at our neighbours in the UK.  Our postal service was originally set up as part of the British and Irish postal service in the 1840s and the similarities, therefore, are stark, much more so than they are with continental Europe.  There are many question marks about the effectiveness and fairness of liberalisation in bus and rail transport on the Continent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What impact will this legislation have on local post offices?  In the past few months, I have received representations from the post office in my home area and from other postmen because of the rationalisation that has been carried out in the name of efficiency by An Post, which has impacted not only on delivery of services and also on delivery times.  I come from a small town of 800 people with a hinterland comprising 1,500 people in a county with a population of only 28,000 that stretches along the north-west coast.  Liberalisation will have a particularly dramatic effect, as reflected by my colleague and friend, Senator Keaveney, regarding Inishowen.  The representations I received relate to a reorganisation of the postal service.  This has not impacted adversely so far but I understand it has resulted in a loss of employment.  The loss of even one or two jobs in my area is equivalent to the loss of several dozen in an urban environment.  What impact will liberalisation have on my local post office?  The postmaster currently has a contract with An Post for the delivery of services.  If there is competition in my area, what impact will this have on the existence of the post office and the services it provides?  Does this mean the post office will be taken over by a competitor?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mr. John Tansey and the CWU have raised the issue of the same price goes anywhere concept that has been developed and established by An Post whereby a letter posted in the GPO for 55 cent and delivered in Ballsbridge makes money but a letter posted in the GPO and delivered in Clifden or Drumshanbo loses money.  What will happen in that context?  Does this raise the spectre of cherry-picking, which has been referred to by all sides of the House, whereby competitors could decide they will only compete for services in large urban areas and ComReg could permit this?  There is a clear rural-urban divide and I am not confident that, because we have inevitably to transpose this directive, the proposals in the Bill give reassurance to rural Ireland that the efficient postal service to which we have become accustomed will continue.  I am sure with the entrance of competitors to the sector it will be efficient because it will be much more money driven than to date.  I do not reflect adversely on An Post, which is an efficient organisation and which has rationalised drastically over the past few decades since liberalisation was first introduced.  The bottom line for competitors entering the market will be profit and the question about cherry picking remains.  I do not want to over elaborate but I wish to emphasise there is concern at local level.</P>
        <P>The CWU referred to the Finnish model.  I have not had the opportunity to look into the model in detail but it is relevant because Finland has a similar urban-rural divide to Ireland.  It is working there and I would be grateful if the Minister of State referred in his reply to whether consideration has been given to adapting that model to Ireland.</P>

While it is idealistically admirable that we should seek to replicate laws throughout the EU and that has many positives, the transposition of this directive in different countries has proven one size does not suit all.  I hope that with this among the few Bills that remain to be enacted in the lifetime of the Government, given the announcement of an imminent election following the budget, instead of the normal set piece scenario, the Mini<Col N="935"/>ster will take on board the legitimate cross-party concerns mentioned throughout the debate relating to the universal service obligation, cherry-picking or cream skimming of services and downstream access.  All these issues have to be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mooney and others mentioned the Finnish model and how it has managed to secure the protection of jobs while, at the same time, providing a universal service and ensuring the same price is applied to send mail to all parts of the country.  Cherry-picking should not be encouraged and, for that reason, I am hopeful the Minister will ensure amendments are made to be the Bill to protect the public by ensuring services are maintained or improved with the same professionalism as is currently the case and ensuring the many jobs in the postal service are also protected.  It is possible to make improvements to the current system and I am sure the legislation will seek to do that but many legitimate issues have been raised about ensuring companies cannot come in and cherry pick post offices and delivery routes in order that for example, they can choose the Ballsbridge run because it is easy while ignoring routes in which Senator Mooney and I would have an interest in counties Sligo and Leitrim.  I hope the Minister will take on board these concerns between now and Committee Stage when the meat of the Bill will be debated and will focus on the fact that one size does not fit all.  It is appropriate to examine this legislation in an Irish context.  The mistakes made in transposing the directive in Germany and the UK resulted in significant unemployment in the postal sector.  We must learn from that while also recognising the many benefits that accrued from the implementation of the Finnish model. I hope that can be done. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Despite the fact that the media choose to ignore this House on a consistent basis, as referred to on the Order of Business earlier, many postal workers are looking at this debate live on the Internet.  I thank them for doing so and I hope their concerns, as reflected by us, will be embraced and the directive will be transposed in a uniquely Irish context, which protects jobs while improving service, and which does not provide an opportunity for cherry picking and the other dangers experienced in other countries.</P>

	<P>I will not delay in order to facilitate all my colleagues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to discuss this important legislation.  It has been well flagged to Members through the representations we have received from postmen throughout the country.  I appreciate their concern as this new departure in postal regulation takes place.  We need to transpose a European directive into Irish law but we must do that with caution.  We must reflect on the fact that the postal service we have enjoyed for more than a century has been one of the mainstays of the social and economic development of the country.  The Irish postman and postwoman has a unique presence in the community, especially in rural parishes and smaller villages.  For many people the only knock on the door they will hear every second or third day is the postman&rsquo;s knock.  That is something we must try to preserve in so far as it is possible.</P><Col N="936"/>
        <P Just="Left">We must recognise that economic changes in Ireland and Europe bring about a new sense of policy direction and policy directive but in the changing Ireland, we do not have to throw out the baby with the bath water.  We must proceed with a degree of caution.  The universal service obligation which applies to An Post has created a unique, effective service for every household in this country.  When this regulation is transposed into law we must ensure, in so far as is possible, certainty of service to every citizen. The universal service obligation is at the core of the legislation. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not an expert on the full content of the Bill.  I am sure we will tease it out in greater detail on Committee Stage but I listened to what our colleagues said about the need to ensure fair and balanced competition and the need to avoid cherry-picking.  That is the consensus on both sides of the House and I hope the Minister, Deputy Ryan, will take that on board.</P>
        <P>In this changing world our postal service is unique.  It has been efficient and cost effective and we must try to maintain it in so far as is possible.  The liberalisation of services and the introduction of competition has been the mantra of most of us, and that has worked well in most areas of life, but we must have a degree of balance between the market side and the social service side of that philosophy.  The objective in this legislation will be to create that balance.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the more substantive Committee Stage debate but I want to record my admiration for all those men and women down the generations who delivered either on foot or by bike, van or car tens of millions of items of postal correspondence to the citizens of this country.  We live in a changed world but that ethos and that service must survive, and we must try to do whatever possible to ensure it does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bradford for sharing time.  This legislation has been well flagged and we have received a great deal of correspondence on it.  We have had genuine concerns expressed to us by the postal workers but it is important we proceed with care and are clear on what we are doing.  We must not in any circumstances undermine the postal service and its employees.  They do a great job.  This Bill will reshape our postal system.  It will change the way our postal service is run and will create different employment conditions for our postal workers.  We must not do anything to undermine them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We had a postman in Bishopstown, Vincent O&rsquo;Brien, who was the epitome of a good postman.  It was not just about the collection and delivery of mail but, as Senator Bradford said, the interaction with the people and the delivery of the post with a smile.  I am concerned that with increased competition will come cherry-picking and a threat to the services in rural Ireland.  The Government has done a great deal of damage to rural life and it is important we examine that.  Equally, it is important the regulator is held accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There must be protection of what is in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Why is this legislation necessary?  An Post is not broken.  It is working well.  We have the eighth lowest postage cost in the eurozone, which is extraordinary.  We must not do anything to undermine what we have already.  We must protect and enhance the service, and I am not afraid of competition.  We have all received e-mails from the Communications Workers Union and while I will not detail what they say, it is important the issues concerning the universal service obligation and cherry-picking are addressed by the Government on Committee Stage.  All of us as legislators have a duty to look after the delivery of the service.</P>
        <P>I was canvassing in Donegal at the weekend and, apart from the person delivering the post, we were the only people some residents had met.  It is important we debate this Bill on Committee Stage, address the concerns expressed, bring it back to this House and make it a better Bill that will address the genuine concerns raised.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="937"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Bradford and Senator Buttimer for sharing their time.  I want to highlight some points about this legislation.  In the past ten years we have seen a decimation in many rural areas of the service provided by rural post offices because many of them have closed.  I know that from personal experience.  My cousins ran the local post office, Phelan&rsquo;s post office in Tullogher, County Kilkenny, which has been closed for four or five years.  Sadly, many of those post offices have closed with the changes that have taken place in the past ten years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As previous speakers mentioned, the role of An Post and of the postman, particularly in isolated rural communities, is significant and should not be underestimated.  In whatever changes that must be implemented as a result of the European directive, and we acknowledge the directive is inoperative in Ireland and we must transpose it into Irish law, we must protect the provision of the service for every house in the State.</P>
        <P>I note with interest the comments of Senator MacSharry and others about the Finnish proposals introduced some years ago where they managed to succeed in keeping that universal delivery service operative in Finland.  I do not understand the reason we cannot ensure, in any changes we make under this legislation, that universal coverage would be continued.  Before the Bill is passed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad I hope we will have guaranteed that the universal coverage that operates currently will be safeguarded into the future.  I will conclude as I do not want to repeat what other speakers have said.  I thank the Senators for sharing their time with me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share two minutes of my time with my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, and one minute of my time with Senator Burke.  I regret we do not have more time for this debate but I will be brief.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  I am sorry they are leaving Government because the Minister has been excellent, as has the Minister of State although he has been only recently appointed.</P>
        <P>As a former Minister of State in the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1982 I have a great deal of experience in this particular field.  It was a marvellous Department in which to work.  We were in charge of postal and telecommunications services.  At that time Feargal Quinn, now Senator Quinn, was appointed chairman of the interim board for posts, An Bord Poist.  There is a great deal of experience in this House which will be shared during the debate on the Bill.</P>
        <P>I have been approached by Jim Higgins of the Communications Workers Union in Roscommon, John Tansey of the CWU national executive, and Pat Compton of the CWU in Roscommon who put important points to most Members of the Oireachtas which I intend to present to the top officials from the Department who are present, although I will not outline the details.  The most important point concerns the universal service obligation, USO.  They state that the funding of the USO in a liberalised market is a major issue which has not been resolved in this Bill.  They state that the legislation suggests a compensation fund which licensed operators will pay into to fund the USO.  They state further that it has not worked in any other country.  It has also caused many redundancies in other countries.  We are transposing a European directive but we have been too active in following the directives to the letter where other countries are far more relaxed in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fact that An Post has been designated as the universal service provider for the next seven years and ComReg as the national regulatory authority for postal services in chapters 4 and 3, respectively, is welcome.  When the Commissioner was in Ireland some weeks ago, I made that point to him.  He is from a rural area in Germany and is well aware of the position. <Col N="938"/> We must have the same postal services in Dublin 4 and the Aran Islands, with a five-day working week and daily deliveries.  There should be a universal service.  That is vital.</P>
      
        <P>I commend all those who work for An Post.  They do a wonderful job in all weather conditions in delivering the post throughout the country.  I was privileged to work with them in the Department and helped and supported them in various developments in my period of office.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The Bill is necessary because it stems from European legislation.  I hope on Committee Stage the Minister will listen to the concerns of the CWU which represents workers in the postal service and that we will solve any problems.  An Post must be protected at all costs, particularly during these difficult times in employment.  We must ensure we maintain the maximum number of jobs in An Post to give people every encouragement and support and not to allow vultures to come into the country to cream off services in Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Limerick, while leaving rural areas isolated.  That is vital and as a former Minister, I will fight for this on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will ensure the Bill will be a monument to his work in the Department, not a millstone around his neck in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with everything Senator Leyden said.  The concerns of the union have been well articulated on both sides of the House.  The figure about which I am most concerned is the one which indicates liberalisation in Germany led to the loss of 21,000 full-time and 12,000 part-time jobs.  Something similar happened in Holland.  We are now in an environment where jobs are critical if we are ever to escape the economic crisis.</P>
        <P>The cherry-picking argument has been well made.  We can all see how convenient it is to post letters to Dublin 4 but not so easy to post them to Knocknagoshel, County Kerry and that the profit levels for the two are totally different.  There must be a mix.  No one opposes liberalisation; it sounds like a free word in a free republic, but who is being liberalised?  Those who have given service in An Post throughout the years feel their jobs are on the line and are concerned.  Work remains to be done on this issue and we will all make our voices heard on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>As previous speakers said, this process will cost jobs and lead to extra delivery costs.  Even if we are to provide for competition, there is no way to bring down costs.  The country has a population per square kilometre of 58, while the EU average is 178.2.  If we are to provide the same service across the country as in the main population centres, there will be a cost in jobs, postage charges and post office numbers.  This will lead to the closure of post offices and a diminution in services.</P>
        <P>The Royal Mail in Britain is losing money because it delivers mail for competitors at a cost set by the regulator.  Where does the Minister stand on this issue?  If the Royal Mail is delivering for competitors brought on board at a cost set by the regulator, it makes no sense.  There is a lot of work to be done here.  I hope we will have more time to go into the matter in detail on Committee Stage because the last paragraph on page 8 of the article of associations sums it up.  There will be cost increases and a diminution of services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions and welcome the opportunity to respond to their comments and observations.  I echo the sentiments and expressions of thanks to postmen and women around the country who go all out to ensure post arrives every day.  I grew up in a rural part of south County Dublin and our house was the last on a rural mail route.  I remember the postman arriving in all weather conditions by foot, bicycle, car and, <Col N="939"/>occasionally, horse.  In Manhattan the main New York City post office has an inscription that &ldquo;neither snow, nor rain, nor heat nor gloom of night shall stay these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds&rdquo;.  That is the unofficial motto of the US Postal Service.  We do not need such a motto; we simply pay tribute to the postmen and women who work tirelessly to deliver mail in all weather conditions.</P>
        <P>The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill marks an important milestone for the postal sector.  As my colleague outlined, it represents a pragmatic approach to the liberalisation of the sector, a process that began 20 years ago.  It sets out the high level principles underpinning the regulatory framework and strikes a balance between ensuring the provision of the universal service, enabling the development of competition and putting in place provisions around consumer protection.  That the sector is facing challenges can be acknowledged and all operators will need to focus on consumers&rsquo; needs to remain relevant and be the service provider of choice for the future.  The aim is for the individual consumer, the business sector and the wider economy to benefit from increased competition and a broader range of services.</P>
        <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions and the many interesting points made.  The Bill aims to balance continuity of basic postal services with new and innovative services.  Universal service will continue if An Post can demonstrate to the regulator that it represents a cost, but the Bill provides for a funding dimension.  It sets out first principles; detailed implementation is the job of the regulator.  In doing its job ComReg is accountable to the Oireachtas and the Bill will provide for an appeals mechanism for those affected by ComReg&rsquo;s decisions.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to employment protection; there is already a significant body of legislation protecting employment rights.  The uniform tariff will remain, but if it is to be changed, the consent of the relevant Minister must be obtained.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not deal with the post office network.  Under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, An Post is obliged to provide nationwide counter services and that will continue.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators Quinn and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, among others, for the points made on the Bill and the issue of competition.  Competition and liberalisation have been long signalled and the Bill puts in place the framework to manage the final step in the process to ensure competition emerges in a controlled and fair manner.  The emergence of competition can bring monetary benefits, among many others, and increases the focus on innovation and meeting the needs of all users.  At its centre, the Bill envisages and provides for a strong and vibrant An Post that will play a central role in the development of the sector.  The designation of An Post recognises its important role and ensures, side by side with competition, universal service in both urban and rural areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Postcodes will play an important role in developing the sector, not just in developing postal services but also in developing and providing for the improvement of many other services.  One day last summer, I spent three quarters of an hour on a side road in Kerry awaiting the arrival of an ambulance for a small child.  In order to provide certainty in such a situation, the neighbours must be sent out on the road to make sure the ambulance can find the house, and much other information must be provided to make sure the emergency services arrive.  Postcodes bring benefits not only for the postal service but also for the emergency services.  I experienced that at first hand last summer.  This will assist Ireland in developing an information-based society.  It is happening; private operators of GPS systems have already provided postcodes, and it makes sense to continue their development.  This ties into many other aspects of special infrastructure that will be established by the end of next year.  In practical terms, it will enable us to encode CSO data to provide far more meaningful statistical information at a local level.</P><Col N="940"/>
        <P>The prior information notice has been issued by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and I assure Senator McCarthy that value for money is at the centre of all procurement processes.  As for the accountability of the independent regulator, the directive provides that all member states designate a regulator independent of postal operators.  The Communications Regulation Act 2002 provides that ComReg is accountable to the Oireachtas, and this will continue into the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senators for their contributions and their interest in the Bill.  I note that many Senators brought to the debate their first-hand experience of the great work the existing postal service does and will continue to do.  I welcome the support of the House for the Bill and look forward to its early consideration on Committee and Report Stages with the overall objective of placing it on the Statute Book as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am presenting to the House the Government&rsquo;s four-year national recovery plan.  This is a period of considerable difficulty for the country and the plan provides a framework for economic recovery.  It sets out the measures that will be taken to restore order to the public finances.  It identifies the areas of economic activity which will provide growth and employment in the recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State&rsquo;s script available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.  I hope it will be circulated shortly.  I apologise, but Members will appreciate that the plan was only launched two hours ago.  It specifies the reforms the Government will implement to accelerate growth in the key sectors.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The four-year plan has been in preparation for some time and has taken on considerably greater significance in view of the application to our European partners for assistance.  It sets out the Government&rsquo;s three-strand approach to resolving our current difficulties: restoring order to the public finances; restructuring the banking sector; and structural reforms affecting both the public and private sectors to encourage renewed growth.</P>
        <P>Since the downturn started in 2008 we have made fiscal adjustments through taxation and expenditure of &euro;14.6 billion.  These succeeded in stabilising the underlying budget deficit this year below 12% of GDP; if no action had been taken, the deficit would have reached 20% of GDP, which excludes the impact of the promissory notes on the 2010 general Government deficit.  This stabilisation in the public finances has been accompanied by an improving economy which is emerging from recession.  GDP will record a very small increase this year based on strong export growth.  Exports are expected to grow by approximately 6% in real terms this year, driven by improvements in competitiveness and a strengthening of international markets.  Conditions in the labour market are also beginning to stabilise.  However, domestic demand remains weak as households and businesses continue to save and pay down debt.</P><Col N="941"/>
        <P>Despite these positives, we still have a considerable amount of ground to make up.  There is a gap between what we receive as a country in tax receipts and what we spend.  The gap is currently &euro;18.5 billion which is unsustainable and currently filled by borrowing.  If we do not reduce the rate of borrowing, debt service costs will absorb a rapidly increasing proportion of tax revenue.  Moving towards a balanced budget is a prerequisite for future economic growth.  The plan will achieve the target of reducing the general Government deficit to less than 3% of GDP by 2014 through a combination of expenditure reductions, tax increases, a renewed focus on growth and competitiveness, structural reform and public service transformation.</P>
        <P>As Members are aware, the fiscal adjustment will amount to &euro;15 billion over the four years.  The Government will make the biggest adjustment, &euro;6 billion, next year.  This will encourage confidence at home and abroad in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to make the necessary adjustment.  The plan provides clarity and certainty about what will be done and will help in restoring consumer confidence which will be important for our overall recovery.</P>
        <P>We are all aware that the economy went though a period of unprecedented growth from the mid-1990s through to 2007.  The benefits of this growth were felt across every section of the population, with increases in social welfare payment rates, higher public sector pay and falling taxes.  However, in our current circumstances these expenditure and taxation measures have proved to be unsustainable.  We, therefore, need to restore balance.</P>
        <P>Although we are making a significant budgetary adjustment, the economic outlook is favourable.  The conditions for resumed export-led growth are in place.  Our transport infrastructure has been transformed; our workforce, as we often point out, is one of the best educated in the world; and our tax system supports enterprise and innovation.  The macroeconomic outlook for the plan is positive.  Real GDP will grow by an average of 2.75% from 2010 to 2014, with lower growth in the earlier years and increasing thereafter.  Unemployment will fall from 13.5% in 2010 to 10% in 2014.  The balance of payments is expected to return to surplus in 2011 and will increase steadily in the following three years.  This means that the economy is no longer borrowing from the rest of the world.  This positive view of prospects is reflected by other commentators; the recent OECD Economic Outlook also contains a favourable economic outlook for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The critical aspect of the plan is the fiscal adjustment.  The budgetary adjustment will be &euro;15 billion over four years, with the biggest adjustment of &euro;6 billion to be made in 2011.  Two thirds of this adjustment will be achieved through expenditure savings, while one third, &euro;5 billion, will come from revenue raising measures.  These measures will bring the general Government deficit below 10% of GDP in 2011 and 3% by 2014.  The debt to GDP ratio is expected to peak at 105% of GDP by 2013 and improve thereafter, falling to 101% by 2014.</P>
        <P>Of the overall expenditure reduction of &euro;10 billion, current expenditure will contribute &euro;7 billion, while capital expenditure will provide &euro;3 billion.  An expenditure reduction of this magnitude requires a focus on the major areas of expenditure &mdash; public service pay and pensions, social welfare, public services, including student supports, publicly provided medical care and treatment, and public investment.</P>
        <P>One third of the total adjustment &mdash; &euro;5 billion &mdash; will come from taxation measures.  Some 40% of these measures will be introduced in 2011, with substantial reform of the income tax system.  Of course, one element of our tax system that will not change is corporation tax.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the 12.5% rate means it will not change.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment includes that of the two main Opposition parties.  The changes to income tax will include base broadening measures to bring more taxpayers into the net, while a range of tax exemptions and reliefs will be abolished or curtailed.  These changes will return income tax revenue to 2006 levels.  A new local services contribution will also be introduced.  There will be <Col N="942"/>changes to indirect taxes, capital taxes and other charges, and tax expenditures.  The details of these changes are contained in the plan and Members will, no doubt, become familiar with them.</P>
        <P>The plan, however, includes measures aimed at supporting growth and to achieve public service transformation.  In the case of the private sector, our approach is to support it by removing potential impediments to competitiveness and employment and by adopting sectoral policies to encourage export growth and a recovery of domestic demand.  I will focus on some of the more fundamental reforms contained in the plan.  These may receive less attention but they are critical to our longer term prospects.</P>
        <P>Getting people back to work is a central plank of the recovery plan.  We need to create the conditions for job creation and retention   in a real and meaningful way.  At a minimum, this requires flexibility and agility of the workforce and a move away from the rigidities that have characterised the labour market in recent years.  The cost of labour has impacted on our competitiveness in the provision of domestic services and that of exporting firms.  The challenge now is regain the lost competitiveness achieved in the 1990s and early 2000s and set the labour market on a firm footing for recovery.  The movement back to an agile and competitive labour market is difficult but essential and decisive action is required.  This will be achieved through a combination of measures &mdash; reform of the minimum wage and activation of the unemployed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of the national minimum wage has remained unchanged while GNP has fallen in value terms by 19% since 2007.  This has been accompanied by reductions in rates of pay across the economy.  The national minimum wage is the second highest in the European Union in absolute terms and the OECD has recommended a reduction to remove a barrier to job creation for younger and less skilled workers.  The reduction of &euro;1 to &euro;7.65 will still leave it above the UK rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is absolutely critical to our economic recovery that unemployed people are equipped with relevant skills and kept closer to the labour market in order that when jobs become available, they can move quickly into the workforce as our economic recovery takes hold.  For that reason, we are providing for a further focus on the provision of structured pathways to employment for unemployed people.</P>
        <P>We will promote rigorous competition in the professions.  There will be measures to reduce waste and energy costs to business.  The availability of technology infrastructure will be enhanced, with an emphasis on next generation broadband.  There will be renewed action to reduce rents for both the private and public sectors.  In addition, there will be an emphasis on increasing the efficiency of public administration to reduce costs for the private sector.</P>
        <P>The plan sets out sector specific policies to increase exports and improve domestic demand.  There will be a continued emphasis on innovation through the innovation fund and the enterprise supports in the tax system.  This will include implementation of a number of the goals set by the innovation task force.  These reforms and other measures will lead to a more stable macroeconomic environment.</P>
        <P>The plan outlines a considerable number of reforms for the public sector to enable it to operate more flexibly, efficiently and effectively with a substantially reduced number of staff and financial resources.  The resulting reduced costs and improved service will support the measures to boost growth in the private sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have just come from launching a tourism guide, I wish to mention some of the measures that relate to tourism.  Obviously, it is just one sector but an important one.  The revaluation exercise which has reduced the rates bill for hotels, guesthouses and so forth in the Dublin area will be accelerated across the country.  What I have said on the subject of the national <Col N="943"/>minimum wage will have particular implications for the hospitality sector.  It is not just of benefit to employers in the industry, it is equally of benefit to those seeking employment in the industry, in which employment has tended to dry up.  While there will be some limited economies, expenditure on tourism promotion in key markets and on tourism product, in some of which the Office of Public Works has an interest, will be broadly maintained.</P>
        <P>As Members are aware, we are in discussions with the European Union and the IMF on a programme to provide fiscal support for Ireland in the coming years.  The plan sets out a considerable range of measures to achieve the objectives of that programme.  They are measures that can be justified in their own right.  The plan will restore order to the public finances.  It will also stimulate broadly based export-led growth, bringing sustainable employment creation which will support the recovery of the domestic economy.</P>
        <P>It is evident that we have taken some very difficult but necessary decisions.  Deferring action will only increase the difficulty of the adjustment.  All of these steps are being taken to secure the future for the country in order that we can stabilise the economy, return to sustainable levels of growth and, in turn, reduce the level of unemployment.  That is the key objective of the Government.  A total of 90,000 net new jobs are expected to be created in the period 2012-14, while unemployment will fall below 10% by 2014.  The economy is recovering, but we still have a long way to go, particularly for the public finances.  The plan provides a platform on which to build a better and more sustainable future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The plan runs to 140 pages and contains a great deal of detail.  Obviously, if I were to delve into the details at length, I could easily speak for an hour or so which I do not wish to do.  I want to allow others to contribute.  All I have been able to give is a brief outline of the thrust of the document.  There is a great deal to be chewed over sectorally.  We must also bear in mind it is still a fortnight to the budget when the specific decisions not contained in this document will be announced.  I look forward to hearing what can probably be only preliminary reactions from the House.</P>

	<P>On a point of information, the Minister of State has chivalrously reduced his speaking time in order that he can hear other Members.  Will this debate be rolled over from today?</P>

	<P>It is an open-ended debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a certain amount of detail in this report and, like most Members, I have only had the opportunity to go through it briefly.  The report also contains a significant amount of waffle and postponement of the rainy day.  It pushes certain matters forward to a time when the Government will be a bad memory for the majority of the people.  According to Ministers this afternoon, this report received an enthusiastic response in Frankfurt and Brussels.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s thinking when he publishes reports.  Since he first spoke on the banking crisis in September 2008, he has been spoofing, guessing and telling half-truths.  I am not allowed to accuse anyone of lying in this House.  The Government&rsquo;s various spoof responses, which reached a crescendo last weekend, would have made a pathological liar blush.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This report is supposed to set the economy in train for the next four years.  Will the Minister of State point out the references in the report to the banking crisis, the very reason we are told the IMF is in the country.  The report was supposed to outline the 40% front-loading of cuts, yet it does not provide the detail we would have liked.</P><Col N="944"/>
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael agrees with the broad parameters of this recovery plan.  The European Commission, however, will allow a new government to reserve the right to renegotiate the specifics of the plan between Ireland, the EU and the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  Accordingly, if the Government collapses, most of the targets in this report can essentially be renegotiated.  I suspect much of it will remain but it can still be renegotiated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s responsibility was to give confidence back to the people which it has not achieved with this report.  If one is going to bring in the European Central Bank, ECB, and IMF into the country, then the report should have been a little more forceful.</P>
        <P>I was told by colleagues that on the Order of Business that the Green Party was getting wishy-washy about its intentions.  The little hissy fit its Members threw during the week now seem to be nothing more than a ploy to renegotiate another programme for Government in the new year.  Does this kind of behaviour instil confidence in the people during the middle of this crisis?  The people and the EU &ndash; God help the Government if the IMF insists on it &ndash; want a budget passed and stable government to get the country out of this crisis.  Nothing we have seen so far, however, can give us any sort of confidence.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach loves using the euphemism &ldquo;We are where we are&rdquo;.  I will tell the Minister of State where we are.  The Government has been completely abandoned by international investors.  It has lost the people&rsquo;s confidence and its instability is a serious threat to the economic future of the country as well as being considered a significant threat to the European Union.  One would not think any of this from the Government&rsquo;s public responses, however.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Commissioner, Olli Rehn, visited Dublin two weeks ago not to sample the nightlife but to put some sense into the Government, which clearly has not happened.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to the forthcoming budget shows how out of touch it has become.  It has no problem taking a four-week holiday for Christmas when the country is in such a crisis.  We should be taking no holidays but giving confidence to the people by bringing forward the Budget Statement and the finance Bill. Most people do not understand the Budget Statement is not the endgame but the opening chapter of the finance Bill.  If the finance Bill falls in the second half of January or February, the whole budget falls and, in turn, the Government which would leave us in exactly the same position we are in now.  That is why the Government has been asked to bring forward the budgetary process as quickly a possible.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The national recovery plan may be important, but fast-tracking the budgetary process must be the number one priority.  The Minister&rsquo;s excuse for not doing so is that he does not have all revenue information to hand.  Most tax payments due from the self-employed are in since the beginning of last week so that claim is unacceptable.  Two weeks ago when I was coming into Leinster House, a motorcyclist was thrown off his bike by a car.  As a doctor, I naturally responded to the accident.  If I had used the Minister&rsquo;s logic, I would have just stood there waiting for the ambulance.  Similarly, in an economic crisis, one moves quickly and works as best as possible with what is at hand.  One does not sit around waiting for the whole economy to go pear-shaped and then respond.  All the Government has done so far is sit around, publish a report and do everything in its own good time, like the Bulmer&rsquo;s advert slogan.  This report will not instil confidence or be enthusiastically received with rapturous applause in Frankfurt and Brussels.  In fact, our European partners will be laughing at it because they expect some sort of leadership from Ireland that it is getting its finances under control.  The Minister needs to take this issue seriously.  We need to bring forward the budget and the finance Bill and get them out of the way.  Then we need to have a general election early in the new year because this outline plan will be implemented over the course of four years.  Many of the main recommendations have been pushed back until 2012, 2013 and 2014.  Some of the easier tax increases <Col N="945"/>were announced today but it does not contain the detail we hoped for.  There are many words and much talk about reducing red tape, tackling waste and dealing with bureaucracy but no timeframes are involved and there is no coherence on what we will do.  </P><P Just="Left">The Croke Park agreement is a massive project for the Civil Service and the public service and it is not being implemented at the speed necessary to make it a realistic proposition for the public finances.  On a number of occasions I have asked the Minister of State to point out what is being done with the Croke Park agreement, the transformation programmes and the changes in work practices.  Most people can understand this example.  We were told that the working day in the health service would be 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and that all staff in the health sector would have an average working day of 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  How far has this got?  It has gone nowhere.  This is what has gone wrong.  I am sure the Minister of State will expand on some of the points during the course of the budget but overall the plan will not be received with much enthusiasm.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Student fees have increased and water metering and property taxes will be introduced but this does not include the strong stuff we need to know about.  These are big issues, with student fees increasing to &euro;2,000 a year.  The introduction of a property tax has been postponed until 2012.  More was expected of the report to show that the Government is serious about reducing the size of the Government, increasing the efficiency of Government and the services provided by it and reducing the cost of these services.  There is no detail in the plan, just a few points about cutting the minimum wage, reducing public service numbers and increasing costs on a few core issues.  The Minister of State should have provided more detail to give us the confidence we need in this report.  Sadly, that is lacking and it will not relieve the concerns of the public about the Government and the state of the economy.  In fact, it may add to the concerns of the public, about which I am disappointed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join others in welcoming the Minister of State to the House for what seems like his fortnightly visits.  I welcome the publication of the four-year plan, the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  There is no question but there are positive points in it.  Notwithstanding that, it is unlikely to receive accolades from the vested interest groups.  In any economic context no one would try to introduce the measures included here.  In recent weeks when contributing in the Chamber, I have reflected on the past 30 years.  One line in the report reads: &ldquo;We have eroded the income tax base to an unsustainable level&rdquo;.  That says it all.  From the mid-1970s, consecutive Governments from all sides of the House have presided over a redefinition of entitlement to its current meaning, which is completely unsustainable.  I welcome the measures included in the report that seek to replace some element of local service contributions.</P>
        <P>I refer to the abolition of domestic rates in 1977, which were unfairly calculated.  They often penalised those with big houses and who had raised big families.  When the children were gone, they had to pay higher contributions.  That was unjust.  To create at the time a surreal environment that led people to believe in the lack of contribution, which is not the case in most other countries, was wrong and unsustainable.  It ravaged regional capabilities to develop on their own steam and underlined the unfair reality that one depended on the proximity of a Minister to bank a capital project.  In that context, I welcome underpinning contributions to local services through a property tax.  Although it is &euro;100 in the first year, it is envisaged to be approximately &euro;200 by 2014.  By 2013, a suitable valuation mechanism will be set up.  That is good and it will serve future generations, unpalatable as it may be in that it marks a change that none of us has had to face since the mid-1970s.  That is positive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also welcome the widening of the tax base.  In recent years we have taken too many people out of the tax net.  Painful as it is and given where we have come from in the relative prosperity <Col N="946"/>of recent years, it seems draconian to ask people on incomes as low as &euro;15,300 to make a contribution, but it is essential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also appropriate that those in receipt of generous State pensions take a reduction.  It is not sustainable for them to continue on the levels they were at in line with incomes before.  In many other areas, savings must be made.  The reduction in the national minimum wage was mentioned recently in these Houses.  It was one of the highest in Europe at &euro;8.65.  Times have changed and we must change with them.  The joint labour council agreements for the agricultural, catering and construction sectors and the various contributions made by NERA in enforcing the laws served in their day to give adequate protection to workers.  Unfortunately, they have increased activity in the black economy and have been an impediment to employment creation in recent times.  I welcome these measures.  Obviously I do not expect the trade union movement to welcome them.  I watched Mr. Jack O&rsquo;Connor of SIPTU say these measures will contribute to a loss of jobs.  I do not accept his analysis.  This change will enhance the prospects of younger people to get employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the plan was published only a few hours ago, it is difficult for us to get through the detail.  Several debates in the next few weeks will facilitate us teasing out the detail.  Social welfare will be cut by &euro;2.8 billion.  Very few of us will agree where &euro;2.8 billion can be cut but there is no question that people have opted for a lifestyle dependency on social welfare.  I spoke to a cr&egrave;che owner involved in the State scheme for children under four years of age.  Having gone through an expansion and attracted more children, there was scope for three additional child care workers.  Having advertised in the media, the owner could not secure three adequate people to take those jobs because she kept coming across people who said they would only work for three days.  They were suited to the lifestyle whereby they could claim for two days and work for three days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot solve that problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>That was wrong.  I hope the measures and reductions envisaged are targeted to ensure we will protect those genuinely dependent on social welfare and encourage those who have opted to remain on it for lifestyle dependency reasons to return to the workforce to the extent that employment is available.  I am not saying it is endemic among all those who are unemployed, but there is some scope for change.</P>
        <P>While we are to maintain capital expenditure at levels among the highest in Europe as a percentage of GDP, it is regrettable that the reductions are necessary.  The Construction Industry Federation has commented that they will have an undue impact on that sector.  The plan indicates that &euro;500 million from the National Pensions Reserve Fund will be committed to such areas as public private partnerships and State capital projects.  Perhaps more of the fund should be made available for that purpose.  While various Departments, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, have announced and are implementing schemes aimed at work activation and promoting enterprise through the enterprise fund, as I have said previously, I would like to see approximately &euro;4 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund invested directly in the SME sector, not by way of grant aid but by means of the State taking an equity stake in the sector.  That would provide a much needed stimulus and represent a good investment over time for the people&rsquo;s money in the fund.  SMEs could be given an opportunity within a time limit to buy back the equity stake when the success of the business permitted.  I would like to see such a measure such introduced.</P>
        <P>We are pleased that the 12.5% corporation tax rate is to be maintained.  It is the cornerstone of our enterprise policy.  I also welcome the broadening of the tax base.  It is important that <Col N="947"/>everyone make some contribution.  There is no getting away from the pain the plan will cause, but we must return to the pre-1977 era when the word &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; meant one was entitled to get out of bed in the morning and do a day&rsquo;s work and if one could not do so, the Government stepped in and tried to help.  Equally, people should make a contribution in line with their means, albeit a small one in the case of those who have least or earn the least amount.</P>
        <P>Bringing third level registration fees up to &euro;2,000 will be difficult for some.  Equally, the fact that 75% of the education budget of approximately &euro;9 billion goes on pay should be tackled.  The recent analysis by <i>The Irish Times</i> showed the monthly income of the highest paid individual in the Department of Education and Skills was &euro;22,000.  While I am sure they are well worth the generous salary for their expertise and what they bring to the party, I am sure they could survive on substantially less.  This is a national emergency.</P>
        <P>I appreciate we have the Croke Park agreement, but the delay in implementation of some of its recommendations is reprehensible.  It contains some very good measures, but if it were a business plan, it would be decided today and implemented tomorrow morning.  It is now nine months since it was agreed.  There are many reasons for the failure to implement the plan but no excuses.  While Senator O&rsquo;Toole has been nodding in agreement heretofore, from now on he will disagree with what I have to say.  As I said on the Order of Business both this morning and for many months, everyone above a certain threshold in the public sector, perhaps &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000 or a little less, should take a percentage reduction in income.  That threshold could be decided in partnership with the unions.  I accept we will all pay more in taxes as a result of the new taxation measures, but those of us above a certain threshold are paid too much.  There is scope not to renegotiate or tear up the Croke Park agreement but to adjust it to make it even better, fairer and more penetrative in what it can contribute to the reform of the structures of the nation which we are all agreed is badly needed, given the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  While it is clear that it is not now the intention of the Government, I hope in the short time left before the budget that we will see there is scope and that those earning &euro;22,000 a month could accept &euro;18,000, while those earning &euro;15,000 could accept &euro;14,000 and so on.  That would make for a much fairer country and those rates would be much more realistic.  Ultimately, we may need to benchmark the entire workforce in the public service against the workforce in the public service in other countries because, inevitably, in the private sector, if circumstances change, the commercial realities quickly change payroll figures and pensions, whereas in the public sector benefits are defined and not subject to change or agile enough to be able to be adapted to changed circumstances.  The agility, innovation and ability to change immediately which the private sector, of necessity, has to display need to be replicated in the public sector.  While that is envisaged in some of the positive elements of the Croke Park agreement, unfortunately, our inability to introduce changes for almost an entire year underlines the fact that serious action needs to be taken to remedy the pedestrian nature of the system within which we operate.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey mentioned that the plan contains some waffle.  Aspects of it lead one to wonder who wrote it.  Measures are outlined on page 50 to assist the retail sector.  The intention is to make roads better in order that delivery times can be improved.  Later in the plan there is a reference to adding 1% to the VAT rate in 2013 and 2014 which will do nothing for my part of the country, the north west, where cross-Border shopping is a major issue.  A little more thought is required on some aspects of the plan.  It is clear, however, that it contains some good measures.  The most important point is that we are to redefine our cost and income base, which needs to be done.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been the senior party in government for most of the past 30 or 40 years, but we can all share in the blame for the erosion of the income base and a redefining of the word &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; to the point where it is unsustainable and not one over which we can stand.</P><Col N="948"/>
        <P>On environmental issues, water will be the new oil before we are too much older.  In that context, water metering is just.  In implementing other measures it is important that those who can pay do pay.</P>
        <P>I referred briefly to third level education fees, the increase in which will be painful for the student population.  We should inject more money into education but, equally, we should not have free third level education for the children of persons earning &euro;150,000 or &euro;200,000 a year.  Instead, those who can should pay to ensure the children of those who genuinely cannot afford to go to college &mdash; at a cost of approximately &euro;9,000 a year in Dublin &mdash; can access a fund to ensure they are adequately looked after.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister of State, I could probably speak for an hour or more on the issues involved.  Perhaps in the coming fortnight during preparations for the budget we can add to our initial thoughts on the document.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important document at which we must look in a level-headed way and to which we should try to take a balanced approach.  I congratulate the Minister of State for what he said, that he wanted to hear from Members and that extra time had been provided for a response.  I have no doubt he will return to this later.</P>
        <P>After we finish discussing this, it is important we have another day&rsquo;s debate on the possible ways to create growth.  Even though the plan contains specifics, to which I will refer shortly, about various aspects, generalities, economic indicators and requisite economic changes, we must examine the kinds of initiative that we want this and the incoming Governments to take in hand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will address Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s point about the Croke Park agreement. As I have been the agreement&rsquo;s greatest critic and greatest supporter in the House, so I will acknowledge a few points.  For public servants, it was important that the Minister for Finance acknowledged the public service&rsquo;s contribution.  He clearly stated that the contribution was made without crowds taking to the streets, strikes or interference with the operation of the apparatus of the State.  The savings contributed by public servants in recent times amount to &euro;1.8 billion per year.  I want to put this in context.  Like the Cathaoirleach, I must sit in the Chamber and listen to a great deal during the course of the Order of Business.  Often, I would prefer to be speaking last rather than first.  What does the figure of &euro;1.8 billion mean?  As figures like that mean nothing to anyone anymore, I will put it simply &mdash; it amounts to benchmarking twice.  This contribution was made before the Croke Park agreement.  Whenever anyone mentions benchmarking in the lounge, at a meeting or in the Chamber, the Cathaoirleach might interrupt to explain that it has been repaid twice over.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Twomey and MacSharry made a point about the slow implementation of the Croke Park agreement.  While I agree with them concerning the areas of flexibility that must be pursued, it is not all bad news.  Since the agreement&rsquo;s commencement, the number of jobs that have been saved, not filled or extinguished is 14,000.  For two or three months, I have stated how the agreement should bring with it savings derived from 25,000 jobs of at least &euro;1 billion.  As I received many queries at the time, I am glad to see the Government has put figures on those savings in this document.  It must have been listening to me, because it has called for a reduction of 25,000 jobs, which I believed was a possibility, and savings of &euro;1.2 billion per year.  This means that the public service, having repaid &euro;1.8 billion to date and given the &euro;1.2 billion to be saved under the Croke Park agreement, will be returning &euro;3 billion per year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Anyone running a business knows that the bottom line in terms of pay is the bottom line in terms of pay.  It can be dealt with in two ways, although they both achieve the same result.  One <Col N="949"/>can cut pay across the board or cut numbers.  Under the Croke Park agreement, the result is to be achieved via numbers.  Let us consider what we are trying to save &mdash; &euro;1.2 billion per year under the agreement.  This is the benchmark that we must find.  Next week, we will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, how much of that amount has been saved so far.  We know there will be so many thousand jobs involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not all bad news, but I agree with Senator MacSharry that the flexibilities, which are equally important, are not occurring quickly enough.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and I know this, as we have sung from this hymn sheet together many times.  For the public service and the Civil Service to survive, they must show themselves to be the model of best practice in Europe.  It can be done, given the intellectual investment in the Civil Service and public service.  I agree with the Senator in that there should be no delays.  We should see progress month by month.  He might have been OTT in asking for it all to have been done yesterday.  The plan should have been put in place yesterday, but the implementation must be done over time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The points I am making are important to the people on the ground.  Public servants believe they are being hammered in all sorts of ways by every commentator.  When debating the health service, people discuss the significant administrative burden.  Senator MacSharry is a good example and I tend to agree with him.  However, every time someone makes that point, he or she should also consider education.  Instead of saying that the education budget goes on payroll, he or she should say that education is brilliant for its lack of administrative costs.  For example, the entire primary school sector is run without an administrative sector&rsquo;s costs.  Teachers, principals, boards of management and locals sit down and administer their schools.  The only administration is in the Department of Education and Skills.  This is a model of good practice, one that would be attractive were it to be migrated into the health service.  I do not want people to believe they can do it every way.  If one does without administration, it means that front line payroll costs and education feature.</P>

	<P>I could speak about special needs assistants, school secretaries and so on.  They are important, but no one would deny that school secretarial and caretaker staff give bang for their buck.</P>
        <P>I wish to make two more points about education.  I am sorry about the reduction in the capitation grant for primary schools, although I can see from where it is coming.  The amount is not being taken from the schools.  Instead, it is costing the local community, as locals will need to find the extra money.  It is an additional cost.</P>
        <P>I welcome another measure.  I listened to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, as he made a clear point today, one that will be welcomed.  We have given the Green Party a great deal of hassle, but we must be fair and admit it has taken a leading role during the past year in opposing a reduction in primary school class sizes.  In the middle of all of this, it is an important vote of confidence in the system.</P>
        <P>I am not sure where the local services money will go.  The Minister of State might clarify whether it is going to local authorities, which would be positive.  I am sure that is the intention, but I cannot see where it has been clearly outlined.  If the money is going into the central funds, the measure defeats the purpose of what we are trying to achieve.  For politics to be re-estab<Col N="950"/>lished with the trust and confidence of the ordinary people, it must begin at local authority level.  This means local authorities must have a budget for which they are responsible.  For example, people in Sligo should be able to see what Sligo Town Council or Sligo County Council is spending their money on and argue on that basis instead of believing the money is coming from Dublin, which they would not view as being their money at all.  People would feel no ownership over &ldquo;Dublin money&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I welcome water metering.  I am unsure about the infrastructural costs involved, although they are mentioned.  Siemens Ireland has offered to save the Government &euro;1.1 billion by putting the water meters into every home.  The company would be repaid through water charges.  The Government is shell shocked and will take no further risks, but it should take a decision on this matter as well as others to which I will refer.  The Government should enter into a public private partnership with Siemens Ireland, which has been with us since 1927.  It built the Shannon scheme and various other projects.  The Green Party would acknowledge that Siemens, above all other international companies, has a feel for renewable resources and so on, having produced information and research that is second to none.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome something outlined on page 33 of the report, although I have a conflict of interest.  I am vice president of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  I am delighted to see a reference to the good work that is being done by us.  The PIAB&rsquo;s board, executive and staff are fantastic.  They take their responsibility for reducing costs for industry, claimants and everyone else involved in insurance seriously. It is a success story and people will be delighted that it is referenced there.  The chief executive, the chairman of the board as well as the executive and staff will be delighted with that.  I would like the Minister of State to convey my appreciation to the Department and the board that this has been done.</P>
      
        
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Another great conundrum in this is the issue of the national minimum wage.  I have not heard a convincing argument for reducing it.  If we want to make it more attractive to work and less attractive for people to be on welfare, then to reduce both by the same amount will just keep the same gap in place.  It surely makes sense to me to keep the minimum wage as it is, and if welfare has to be reduced, in the event, that at least opens the gap.  Very clearly, we have conceded a point to IBEC while the case has not been made.  I shall back this up.  I have read the report from cover to cover and the most important single fact in it is that in the last year no other country in Europe has improved its competitiveness except Ireland.  Every other country in Europe has seen its competitiveness disimprove.  If we take our improvement as compared to the European average, we see we have improved our competitiveness by 6.75%, against the average.  While we have improved our competitiveness we have increased our output and workers should be rewarded for that.  It is a vote of no confidence in them and an unnecessary step to reduce the minimum wage.  We could certainly have held it and it saddens me above all other issues.  I could speak at length about pensions, the public service etc., but the thing that bothers me most is that.  I am saying this in terms of growth and I do not want my comments to be written off as just a whinge from the Independent benches.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The other thing I do not believe is a good idea is the increase in VAT to more than 23% over two years, which is regressive.  It will impact on growth and I do not believe it will incentivise.  Reducing the national minimum wage is a disincentive, as is increasing VAT.  These measures are both disincentives to growth.  I am sure the Minister of State can give me the reasoning behind all of that, but I cannot welcome those two initiatives.  I am trying to keep away from the things about which we shall hear plenty more, the sad stories, as I want to deal with the top-line issues.</P><Col N="951"/>
        <P Just="Left">I do not have a problem with the &euro;200 site tax on a house, although I believe it should be called something else, as it is somewhat unfair to somebody who is struggling to pay for a site he or she will never build a house on, to be charged for it.  That is an unfair and unnecessary burden, and there should be some element of potential relief for people struggling to pay a mortgage, in certain cases.  It is all right for people such as me who took out a mortgage 30 or 40 years ago and do not have to worry about it.  There is no problem about hitting people such as us, but it is a problem for others.</P>
        <P>In that regard, I would like to hear more from the Minister of State in his response in terms of the 2.75% projected growth in the economy in each of the years covered.  I did not pick up exactly how we got to that.  I welcome the abolition of the various tax exemptions, but I should like to hear an impact report on what this will do to pensions, because I do not want a situation whereby having taken away the pension inducement or incentive, people will fall back on the State from here on in.  This will leave a great many people poorer.  I have tried to work out what it is going to cost on average.  It is a great deal of money and people will be hit hard by <?oasys _jy ?>it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have to support it as it goes along, although as I mentioned, it contains issues with which I disagree.  However, I do not see that I have a choice at this point until we have more details and can, perhaps, nuance some of these things in a particular way.  In the meantime I wish the Government well, and the next one even better.  It is hugely important that we climb our way out and I think we have.  I conclude by asking for a debate next week or the week after on the initiatives.  I want Members to stand here and say what can be done.  I will have a list of things, and we can take it from there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">At a cursory glance by the media, with them giving the contents even the most superficial treatment, it has to be expected that the four-year plan will be reacted to in a most negative light.  The contents are truly horrible.  We are experiencing a vista that none of us in public life ever could have imagined given the circumstances we enjoyed at the height of the Celtic tiger.  That said, the adjustments are being made to a period when we enjoyed levels of wealth that even now are in excess of many of our European partners and in a global index rate us very high in the scheme of things.</P>
        <P>To have to make decisions as regards reducing the income and wealth levels of any member of society is something any public representative would wish to avoid.  None of the content in this particular plan is indicative of decisions anyone wants to make, but they must be made nonetheless given the circumstances.  Because of that we must think long and hard as regards the consequences of those decisions.</P>
        <P>There is legitimate debate as to how the plan is to be achieved, as between expenditure and taxation, and between the different levels of expenditure.  Whichever Government has to make the ultimate decisions in 2012-14 may be engaged in elements of tweaking that could make this a slightly more palatable package, but we need to show consensus as regards where we are internationally given that these headline figures cannot be avoided.  We have to adjust our budgets accordingly to ensure that come 2014 we come as close as possible to the figures indicated in this plan.  In the event, we shall have achieved a remarkable feat as a country.</P>
        <P>We are capable of achieving such a feat, because we have shown in the relatively short period of the Celtic tiger economy that we can grow fast and deep and achieve significant levels of growth.  We need to learn, however, that we can never envisage a situation where we throw money around with such largesse and lack of direction, without accountability, which is the real failure of the last seven years in particular.</P><Col N="952"/>
        <P Just="Left">Policy decisions were made in the period from the start of this decade, which have been expounded upon as regards how we reacted to their effect in the second half of this decade, which have made things far more difficult than they needed to be.  While we are dealing with the effects of such wrong decisions, we need to factor in that although a large part of what we are addressing may be put down to political failure, a significant part too has been fomented by international circumstances.  If we are to face the reality of the new international economy and assess the country&rsquo;s position as regards competitiveness, we must make difficult decisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole has pointed to two areas about which he is unhappy.  Even in expressing his unhappiness, he understands the wider context of where we are.  At the very least, we need to be positive as regards some aspects of this plan.  A particularly positive aspect of it is the decision to protect education and enterprise.  If we are to achieve improvement and to get out of this situation as quickly as possible, we will need to prime the engines that will allow us do this.  Education and enterprise are the two areas that are so primed to allow us do this.</P>
        <P>The downside of where we are is that income will be adjusted among the sectors that have least in our society.  There will be impacts in terms of social welfare and the lower paid.  This must be counteracted by an equal and greater adjustment by those in our society who have more.  I heard Senator MacSharry make this point on the Order of Business today.  There is a need to cap and reduce higher level salaries and for the political system in particular to adjust in ways that are not alone equal but greater in terms of what we are asking of particular sectors of society.  The message must go out from whoever is in government as we move towards the specifics of budgets 2011-14 that a greater loss is being asked of those in our society who have more than is being asked of those who will be affected by adjustments in social welfare and the minimum wage.  We have a responsibility as a political class to show the way in our sector.</P>
        <P>I would be particularly disappointed if come budget day we do not see a reduction not alone in the cost of politics but in salaries paid.  I will not listen to any argument in regard to the Croke Park agreement and relativities in this sector because I believe they will adjust accordingly.  We must as a political class put in place measures that show that we are prepared to take a greater loss in terms of income than are those we identify in this plan.  If we do not do so, we will have failed the country.</P>
        <P>In terms of the public sector, which is a wider debate regularly aired in this House, there are many caveats in regard to our being well served by our public sector which is often asked to meet needs that would not otherwise be met by the cost to which we expose it on a daily basis.  Three heavy spending Departments in the form of Health and Children, Education and Skills and Social Protection account for 80% of our expenditure.  A further analysis of expenditure by the State in any given year illustrates that 50% &mdash; this figure was quoted earlier as being 70% &mdash; of expenditure goes on the public sector, 26% in the form of direct salaries and 24% in the form of provision for future pensions or the payment of existing pensions.  If we believe that this is in any sense sustainable into the future while meeting the needs of everyone in society, we are deluding ourselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The biggest change needed in the course of the life of this plan that will adjust our public finances and will accordingly, I hope, inspire international confidence, will be a more appropriate balance in terms of the cost of our public sector and how we spend elsewhere in terms of public expenditure.  On social protection, there is an obvious difficulty in that there are 450,000 people on the live register, 280,000 of whom are directly unemployed with the remainder being in part-time employment, which accounts for a significant part of &euro;21 billion budget in this area.  The biggest challenge we face during this four year period will be significantly reducing those numbers.  The more they are reduced the more our costs will decrease.  The <Col N="953"/>more people who return to full or part-time employment the more tax we will take in, thus the more the equation in terms of what we take into the Exchequer and what we pay out in terms of social protection becomes more easy to manage.  While this sounds simple in theory, the imbalance between where we are as a society and where we need to get to is colossal.  All of us in public life must concentrate on the challenges we face and must provide concrete responses to the people in regard to how we can make up this difference.</P>
        <P>On taxation, Commissioner Olli Rehn when visiting Dublin recently spoke about Ireland being a low tax economy.  This was taken as code in regard to our corporation tax.  The reality is that if we are to improve as an economy, we need incentives to encourage further foreign investment and further export led growth.  There is consensus on this issue.  It is hoped we can have an ongoing agreement with our partners in the European Commission and European Central Bank in this regard.  It is true that as a percentage of gross domestic product we pay less in tax in terms of our overall wealth than do other countries.  We must ensure that during this four year period higher income earners and everyone in general, by way of a wider and deeper taxation system, pays more tax so that we can avoid this type of situation in the future.  It was the pretence that there was a mythical future ahead of us that we could increase public expenditure and pay less tax that got us into this problem in the first instance.  The more consensus on these issues and the more honest we are with the Irish people, the quicker we will get out of the morass in which we find ourselves, regardless of the circumstances and the individuals who brought us to where we are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the plan published by the Government this afternoon.  This plan is in many ways the bill for economic failure.  Regrettably, it is a bill that must be paid over a period of some years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having listened to Senator Boyle, I have a real sense that he is finding his voice on some issues and that he may be, in terms of some of the things he said, feeling a sense of political liberation.  I agree with much of what he had to say.  There is a sense that people have been codding politicians, and not perhaps only Government politicians, and that they may have been unwitting participants in the illusion that we can fund and have the type of public services to which we aspire and should have for our citizens and children, and that these can be sustained and managed at a particular level of taxation.  A stark statement on page 91 of the plan, with which no one could disagree, states: &ldquo;We have eroded the income tax base to an unsustainable level&rdquo;.  This is manifestly true.  However, I do not believe income tax is the only element we need to examine in the context of from where we raise taxes.  I agree with Senator MacSharry and others who said that it is necessary that we not confine ourselves to only looking at income tax.  We do not wish to raise taxes for the hell of it but so that we can look towards having a sustainable economy and public service in respect of which there is certainty in terms of funding into the future.  We must never again think we can pin everything on the type of transitional taxation we had during the so-called boom.</P>
        <P>I recall sitting beside a politician on a radio programme prior to the last general election.  She was a supporter of the then Government and is not now a Member of the Houses.  I recall her seeking to sustain the argument over many minutes on that radio programme that it was possible to reduce taxes and improve public services.  I do not understand how it would have been possible then or since to do this.  The extent to which any of us was party to such an illusion was a mistake but the principal responsibility must lie with the Government regarding these matters.  Opposition politicians can from time to time be criticised for calling for this and that.  It is sometimes legitimate to engage in such criticism but it is greatly dwarfed by the legitimate criticism that one can level at a government that has failed to carry out the policies it ought to have implemented.</P><Col N="954"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The document, regrettably and sadly, is a bill and it is not particularly detailed.  It has detailed aspects and although it purports to contain a growth strategy and a jobs strategy, it does not.  There is nothing new in the narrative on these areas.  There is a great deal of generalised, aspirational material, with which it would be impossible to disagree, but there is little relating to a jobs strategy.  The IMF is constantly being invoked but its officials are in the House and, in an interim report published earlier this week, they rightly identified the urgent necessity for a growth strategy and to put in place serious measures to get people back to work.  That is what we need.</P>
        <P>Somebody said to me earlier that when I debated the document, I would criticise it, but that I should start by outlining a number of aspects with which I agree.  I must ask myself, therefore, what is acceptable or unavoidable.  I very much welcome the Government&rsquo;s conversion regarding tax expenditures and reliefs.  The Minister of State will acknowledge that the Labour Party has repeatedly raised this issue year after year during the budget debate in the context of the pensions system and other tax expenditures.  They have been addressed in the plan, with some being front-loaded.  However, there has been more front-loading of the income tax measures than of other taxation measures.  It is a pity that there is selective front-loading.  It would be wrong of me not to welcome the Government&rsquo;s attempt to address these matters, although some members of the Government have been content in public to be dismissive of them and say they are not as crucial as the Government has belatedly recognised them to be.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that the capital programme has to take a hit.  It is unavoidable but any government would be faced with that reality and it simply has to be done.</P>
        <P>It is good that the Government has said that water charges will be introduced on a metered basis.  That is an essential element of the plan and it is right that the Government parties have taken that view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of elements of the plan are quite curious.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others referred to the reduction in the national minimum wage.  We know all the anecdotal augments.  We are all politicians and we all talk to employers who tell us the minimum wage is too high.  I have great respect for those who employ people but I have met few of them who would not welcome the opportunity to reduce pay as a percentage of their costs.  We should not rely on employers saying that they would rather the minimum wage be lower but on evidence-based analysis as to whether it has a negative effect on unemployment, as is suggested.  I would prefer if that were done.  This measure will not affect the bottom line of the &euro;15 billion adjustment.  It was suggested earlier that it is being implemented on an ideological basis to tick a box or to touch a particular nerve to gain a welcome in particular quarters.  Is that why it is being done?  I would prefer to tackle the minimum wage on the basis of rigorous analysis and evidence rather than anecdotes.</P>
        <P>I do not have a difficulty with a review of registered employment agreements and the regime of employment regulation orders.  If there is to be a review, let there be a review but reference is made to a review within three months and, because it will happen so quickly, that means it is anticipating change.  There seem to be changes in mind.  The orders and agreements are described in the plan as another form of labour market rigidity by preventing the adjustment of wage levels.  That is a blunt description of a regime of setting pay for, by and large, low paid workers, which has been in place for 60 years and which has served the economy well.  There is a bipartite mechanism to set pay levels through the Labour Court and legislation is in place.  Nobody is picking numbers out of the sky; there is a tested process by which these wage levels are reached.  I remind the House that they generally apply to low paid workers in the services sector.  By all means have a review but let us not jump quickly to the conclusion that our problems can be solved by reducing pay.</P><Col N="955"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out there is evidence in the report of a dramatic reduction in the past year of unit labour costs in the economy.  People constantly rail in certain quarters about competitiveness and wages being too high but wages have taken a significant tumble in the past 12 months.  There has been an enormous adjustment.  Let us not get carried away and think cutting wage levels in low paid sectors is the answer.  I do not have a difficulty with issues such as Sunday working being examined but I do not commit my party to necessarily saying that should be changed.  If it can be demonstrated that, for example, business owners  cannot open on Sundays because it would not be worth their while, then the issue should be examined.  The Leader said he is aware of this being the case.  If so, it should not be difficult to put together evidence in this regard.  If there is inflexibility in the agreements for adjusting pay levels, it should be relatively easy to address.  I do not know what is meant by a lack of flexibility.  Given my knowledge of the Labour Court processes, they are not unwieldy and people can go there if there is a proposal to vary an agreement.  If the Government believes it is worthy of examination, nobody could object to this.</P>
        <P>I refer to the reductions in public service pensions.  The Government is right to address this area, as it is impossible to avoid it in the context of equity and fairness.  However, I query the reduction on pensions of between &euro;12,000 and &euro;24,000.  That is a relatively modest pension and the issue of the threshold for implementing various reductions also arose when the income and pension levies were implemented.   It is quite likely that people on a pension of between &euro;12,000 and &euro;24,000 have no other income.  It is at least conceivable that some people on high public service pensions have other incomes.  It is not just that it is conceivable.  It is manifestly true that people on very high public service pensions can have another source of income.  That is not a criticism of them but it is simply saying by way of equity and on the basis of what Senator Boyle rightly said about spreading the pain and the burden that it is not unreasonable that it would be addressed.</P>
        <P>I mentioned that I welcomed the conversion regarding the tax expenditures.  They are even listed on page 96 of the plan and that list looks very familiar to the list the Labour Party prepared at least in last year&rsquo;s budget if not the one before that and which has been repeated frequently by myself in this House and by other colleagues.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal in the plan to consider and read.  Unfortunately, it is the price of failure.  It does not purport to be a document that deals with the banking crisis, which is the great concern, if that is not an understatement, for all of us in terms of the way it will be addressed.  It is important we look at planning our budgetary strategy over a longer term and not have this mad rush in the lead-up to a budget, especially in areas such as public expenditure.  It is crazy that our system seems only to address these areas for a few weeks, even though we seem to have been talking about them since the summer of this year.  As I said previously, there should be an ongoing review of public expenditure, as they have in Canada, rather than seeing what we can cut.  It should be possible to have a continuing process of review and consideration of what we want and what is important.  We should almost start again in regard to all areas of public expenditure.  We should shake all the trees and examine them all, not just for the purpose of cutting but for the purpose of working out in a positive way what it is that we want to cherish and keep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Taoiseach said today at the launch of the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, it is about being optimistic for the future of our country.  Wearing my business hat, unless we are optimistic about the future of our country, it will remain stagnant.  Currently, the media and the Opposition are doing everything in their power to make us out to be a country with no hope, which is having a seriously detrimental effect on businesses, companies, families and children.  As a business person I am and always will be optimistic.  I believe our <Col N="956"/>standard of living will not escalate in the way it did in the past ten years.  It will remain static and may regress but in about three years time it will begin to grow again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2000, our costs in Ireland were the same as those in Germany but by 2008 our costs had increased by an angle of 45 degrees, so to speak.  We lost our competitiveness.  There are many policies and decisions in this plan that should have been implemented in the past ten years.  I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, on the introduction of the national minimum wage in 2000 and congratulated her.  I met her and told her it was a very good idea to have a minimum wage but it increased on six occasions over the years.  It is not that the minimum wage itself is high but other people up the scale financially wanted to get a higher increase in wages, which added to the increase in labour costs.  Other people saw it increasing and said they wanted more.  That is what it caused.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not agree with Senator Alex White&rsquo;s view that we have to agree the plan and examine it more carefully.  It was good to have the national minimum wage but it acted against people taking on lesser skilled people and giving them work experience.  Employers ended up paying &euro;10 an hour.  Paying &euro;10 an hour to someone who has no experience is crazy because one must teach the person how to do the work.  It was a failure of the Government that it did not re-examine the policy it had introduced.  That is the main difference between business and politics.  I find it fascinating.  One must examine every decision one makes.  One must re-examine it, refine it and make it work in a strategic manner but the Government carved policies in stone and then the whole process crumbled.</P>
        <P>The same applies to water charges.  The Government should have brought in water charges a long time ago.  There was a political failure to do that.  I spoke at a local authority conference in Castlebar five years ago and the theme of my presentation was that there should be an introduction of water charges.  Water is a scarce and valuable commodity, but the Government did not have the guts to make those decisions.</P>
        <P>I read in the newspaper, and therefore I presume it is correct, that the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport will consider reducing the departure tax on people exiting the country.  If she did that, thousands more visitors would come here.  Why did the Government not do that a year ago?  A person&rsquo;s business will not survive if they do not innovate.  They must refine their policy and innovation strategy, come up with new products and improve others.  The disappointing aspect of politics for me is that policies are carved in stone and they then fail because they do not re-examine and refine them.</P>
        <P>My area of immediate interest is the strategy for improving our competitiveness, growth and employment because it is all about reassuring the people that there are jobs for themselves and their children and that they are not terrified.  I am aware from doing business that one cannot grow a business in a small open economy with a population of 4.4 million.  One must export.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, may recall me speaking about that.  I find it frustrating.  The country does not earn any money unless it exports goods and services or attracts people into the country to give us their foreign exchange.  It was running out of sync with an efficient economy.  If we look at the contrast with the German economy, they were able to keep their costs in line from 2000.  They did not allow them increase.  They were realistic, and we have lessons to learn in that regard.</P>
        <P>I am delighted with this plan.  I believe it will be a source of optimism as it is spelled out, but we have to monitor it and ensure there is delivery on it.  I am particularly interested in the agrifood area.  It is our indigenous industry.  It employs 150,000 people directly and another 100,000 indirectly.  I do not know where we would be today if we did not have our multinational <Col N="957"/>companies which came here for the high level of education of our young people and our 12.5% corporation tax rate.</P>
        <P>I have been listening to a great deal of rubbish on the radio and reading in the newspapers about whether the corporation tax will be abolished.  I cannot understand the stupidity of it.  That tax is carved in stone until every member of the European Union does not agree with it.  We will never agree with it being abolished and therefore it can never be changed.  Someone made an interesting point to me the other day.  Her daughter, who is about 16 years old, stated: &ldquo;Mum, our corporation tax is like our monarchy; nobody can touch it.&rdquo;  I thought it was a fascinating remark.  This is our tax and all the criticism we have been getting in the international media recently has a lot to do with jealousy that we have this 12.5% corporation tax.</P>
        <P>The agrifood industry needs young leadership in the productive and the farming sector.  We must reward them and encourage innovation in the food sector and among the food processing people and the people making food products for export.  Lir Chocolates, which employs 250 people in Navan, innovates with 30 new products a year.  One does not hold on to one&rsquo;s market unless one innovates.  I am worried by the increase in VAT from 21% to 22% in 2013, with a further increase to 23% in 2014.  As Senator MacSharry said earlier, that is negative for the Border counties and business and jobs in the Border counties should also be cherished.  In addition, VAT affects the poorest, it is frightening the effect it has instead of taxing income.</P>
        <P>I wish the Taoiseach well.  I believe he is the right man to lead us through this.  He knows what he is up against.  I predict people will begin to see clearly his excellent qualities and that all he must do is appear on television once a week to take the people along with him.  He takes us along with him, he took us along with him last night.  It is all our futures, on both sides of the House, and the Irish people are relying on the result of this and everyone getting behind it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I welcome the publication of a plan such as this because one of the great failings in the budgetary process is that it is done on a year-to-year basis.  This plan will put in place a framework for a number of years, laying out budgetary targets while recognising the fact that a new Government will have the discretion to decide to achieve the targets in a different way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the atmosphere, I want to make some positive comments about the plan, how it can be implemented and how it can be improved.  The publication of today&rsquo;s report will bring clarity for people about the effect the plan will have on their standard of living.  I saw some of the RTE coverage of the plan and a tax expert made the point that the average family on &euro;50,000 per year, as a result of the tax changes across the next five years, will see a loss of &euro;2,500 per year.  I do not want to see that sort of change taking place when people should be spending more, which is what we need.  Nevertheless, the fear and uncertainty leads many families to anticipate that their income will be affected by many multiples of that.  There are people who are assuming the worst for the standard and higher rates of tax.  Too many families assume that they will have no disposable income to save or to invest at the end of this process.  I hope this plan will provide clarity through balanced discussion in the coming days.  We will be able to spell out the likely effect on our standard of living in the coming years.  That will give people and businesses the confidence to plan and organise their lives and investments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also important because there has been what has been called &ldquo;the great deceit&rdquo; perpetrated on people in recent years.  That deceit is that there is a simple, cost-free, fair plan to address the difficulties the country faces but it cannot be implemented because the Government and Opposition are too stupid to see it.  This plan lays out that there are no cost-free choices for anyone, be they for this Government or a new Government.  If any Administration wants to do something under this framework, there will be something else it will not be able to do.  That is a welcome improvement in politics, where there has been a belief that it is possible to <Col N="958"/>increase public expenditure while decreasing taxation.  There was a belief we could do everything to satisfy all of the needs placed upon us by those we represent.  This plan, and the fact that the two main Opposition parties have signed up to the objectives of the plan, will provide a framework for more honesty in the discussions that must take place on the future.</P>
        <P>The table on page 92 of the document should be noted by everyone.  It lays out that since 2004 until the present, 45% of income earners have been exempt from any income tax.  Fixing that will be painful but it must be done.  Fairness is about everyone making a contribution depending on the means they have.  Fairness is also about everyone making a contribution, except those who have next to nothing and finding a way to do that fairly will make a huge contribution to fixing the deficit.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  He has always been generous in the time he has given to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I was interested in listening to Senator Mary White and the practical comments she made, which obviously come from her business background.  She made a lot of sense, and made the point that she was frustrated reading through the document that so many issues in it had not already been addressed; I felt the same.  It is frustrating to see so many structural reforms that have not been made.  Her party, however, has been in power for 13 years and had the opportunity to address many of these structural issues but did not and, in that sense, wasted the boom.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Donohoe when he says this is a framework for a more honest discussion, a new politics about the choices we must make.  Fine Gael will publish a response to the document that will outline our approach, and we do not consider we are tied to the detail of the plan.  Clearly, a new Government will not be tied to the individual policy choices in the plan; the targets are fixed, but the means to arrive at them are not.  We accept, however, the broad parameters of the report, remaining committed to the target of reducing the deficit to 3%.</P>
        <P>There is much in the document that makes sense.  The initiatives in the tourism section are welcome.  We have the infrastructure, the hotels and roads, but we do not have the tourists and we need to see initiatives in that area.  There are many other practical suggestions about what needs to happen.</P>
        <P>If we are to bring about these changes, we must display the political will to make the structural reforms necessary.  There must be a Government with the will to do what is necessary to reform our approach to public services and the political system.  That is what Fine Gael has and what we have outlined in our policies in recent months.</P>
        <P>There is no reference in the document to the banking issue.  We do not know what the impact the issue will have on jobs and the budget crisis, given the amounts we still might have to pay into the banks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is so much to say about this.  On the subject of the cut in the national minimum wage, the interaction with the social welfare system will have to be examined, because we do not want people to be caught in the poverty trap and feel it is not worth their while to work.  Such interaction and the poverty traps that people can easily find themselves in are key issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Families, as Senator Donohoe said, had hoped for certainty from this plan.  They were concerned about whether the plan would make clear the reality that is facing us.  It does to some degree, but if one is on social welfare, which is facing &euro;2 billion in cutbacks, it does not.  How much of this will be obtained from waste reduction and efficiencies, and how much will be obtained from changes that need to be made to systems, such as rent supplement, that we know <Col N="959"/>are not working effectively?  Families dependent on social welfare face uncertainty; they do not know where the &euro;2 billion in cuts will be made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is also the case for the reductions in the health budget.  What will be the impact of the &euro;444 million of reductions in procurement and demand-led schemes on people who really need their medicines every week?  Will they still be able to afford them?  More than &euro;746 million per year is being taken out of the health system.</P>
        <P>One of my concerns is about the effect of the plan on young people.  The plan seems to assume that many will emigrate.  They will be charged more for third level fees and funding to third level institutions will be reduced.  What impact will this have on young people from disadvantaged families who wish to access third level education?  There are cutbacks in the school completion programme.  Where is the hope for young people and the ambition for their generation?  I am concerned about this.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the plan will result in growth in the economy.  Some of the assumptions in the document about the level of growth may unfortunately turn out not to be correct.  There is much more I would like to say about the document, but we will have another opportunity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The necessity of the national recovery plan is self-evident.  We have the lowest tax wedge within the EU and 45% of our people pay no tax at all.  While we would all love to see this continue, in the current climate change is unavoidable.  Over the last two years, there has been an 8% decrease in the cost of living; in real terms, even though there might be a small tax increase for people, in terms of their purchasing power they will be no worse off.  That is significant.  The same applies to those on fixed-income pensions and in paid employment.  Our first concern must always be for those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves unemployed.  One of the main tenets of the national recovery plan is that it provides hope.  It points out that although GNP fell by 7.5% last year, there will be a modest increase this year.  That increase of around 0.5% means that within one year there will have been an 8% swing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is the third most globalised economy in the world.  In fact, if we discount the city state of Singapore and the special administrative region of Hong Kong, Ireland as a nation is the most globalised economy in the world.  As the world economy grows by 4% or 4.5% this year and next year, we will share disproportionately in that growth.  Our corporation tax receipts are up in 2010 and our exports are already marching ahead.  This will continue, and it will have knock-on effects throughout the economy.  The retention of our 12.5% corporation tax rate, which is an essential advantage for us, with our people and high standard of education, is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>In recognising the positives, we must also recognise that there is a need for cuts, because the revenue stream has become significantly smaller.  The gap must be bridged and we are doing this by facing our choices in the best possible way.  The correction will consist of two thirds cuts and one third taxation.  The cuts have been spread as evenly and fairly as possible.  People on pensions will receive a cut, which is unavoidable, and those on State pensions will feel the brunt.  However, we must recognise that over nine years the level of pay in the public service went up by four or five times the rate of inflation, and people are still significantly better off than they were in 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What did we hope for from today&rsquo;s announcement?  We hoped for a clear, balanced view that we would achieve sustainable targets.  We are obliged, by our membership of the euro and <Col N="960"/>the European Economic and Monetary Union, to reduce the deficit to less than 3% of GDP, and I believe we will achieve this by 2014.  We are front-loading the fiscal corrections despite whatever public concerns there may be and any resulting unpopularity.  Despite the protestations of those who feel otherwise, the Government is taking tough decisions and it is taking them now.  The first concern of this Government must be to restore the public finances and restore public trust.  This is a major step in that direction.</P>
        <P>I have always believed we would come through the recession, and I have always believed in the bigger plan.  We are part of the eurozone, with a population of 500 million consumers who can buy our products, and we are part of a strong currency.  I have no doubt there are those who wished, for whatever selfish reason, to prevent the success of the euro, and some of this perhaps stems from old prejudices.  However, as we discussed in this Chamber before with Pat Cox, the euro is part of the light of the European Union.  It is a wonderful experiment which should not fail, and we must ensure it does not.</P>
        <P>We will start paying more in tax, as a percentage of our income, to meet the interest repayments on our loans, but that will fall by 2014.  Although we will be paying more tax and taking on an extra burden, it will be for the short term.  That extra burden of taxation stems from a situation in which we had one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios not only in Europe but in the world.  At one stage, our net fiscal position was a 14% debt-to-GDP ratio.  After this year&rsquo;s adjustments we will be at 90%, and by the end of 2014 we will be at 100%.  There are many European countries that would love to be in that position.  Many of them, before this recession ever took place, had a 100% debt-to-GDP ratio &mdash; that was in 2006-07.  Even though we have faced considerable difficulties in our banking sector, our national finances were in good shape and we had the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>
        <P>Do I believe the national recovery plan will help?  The Opposition is engaging constructively with the Government on the plan, although if there were a change of Government it would alter certain aspects of it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The fundamentals of this plan will not change and the amounts will not change.  This nation has had a single focus in the past, particularly towards the difficulties in the North of Ireland, which appeared totally intractable and impossible.  The saying was: &ldquo;If you had the solution, you didn&rsquo;t understand the question.&rdquo;  I know the Minister of State who is present played a leading role in bringing peace to the country and by doing so solved what was regarded as an intractable problem.  We will get through our difficulties.  While I am loath to use the phrase &ldquo;The fundamentals are solid&rdquo;, the people are still well educated, willing to work and committed, and we have social cohesion.</P>
        <P>We would do well to recognise that the unions may be protesting in Portugal &mdash; I hope it does not go further then that but the Portuguese Opposition has rowed in with support for the budgetary strategy there.  It would be useful if it were to happen here in order that we can get on the road to the recovery that every party in this House wishes to achieve.</P>

	<P>At times such as this, we all must try to play a constructive, not a destructive, role and try not to be overly critical of what is happening and what has happened.  In a serious crisis, it is not helpful to come in and kick at an open goal, at a Government or Department of Finance which are both a kind of beaten docket at this stage anyway.  I will try not in any way to play the blame game in my contribution because there is no point.  That is for another day and, by God, there will be plenty of time to do that in the budget debate, and the Opposition will have plenty of time to do that during the general election campaign.  The situation we are facing today is critical and very fluid and we all have a duty to try to make constructive suggestions in the hope that some of them may be at least listened to.</P><Col N="961"/>
        <P>I thank the Leader of the House for organising this important and useful debate about a plan which will change a great deal in the four years to come.  It is just a blueprint and there will be such substantial changes in the years ahead that it will become unrecognisable.  Nevertheless it is useful to get an idea of the Government&rsquo;s thinking, even if it is somewhat in a vacuum and in a situation that may not be the same tomorrow or the day after.  I do not believe this is the Government&rsquo;s document.  I was just on a radio programme and the message came through that it had been approved by Olli Rehn.  No one was quite sure whether it had been approved by Europe, but it has.  If it has received Europe&rsquo;s approval, in the present changed circumstances it means it is Europe&rsquo;s document.  Europe has approved the plan&rsquo;s parameters and so has the IMF.  That is something with which we must live in the next few years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To my mind, the plan is a compromise between the public service unions and Europe.  I am surprised the Croke Park agreement has been set in stone and that the Government is living in the same straitjacket in which we have lived for so long.  If one can be critical of the document, one of my principal criticisms is that it is very unimaginative and written along the same lines as conventional budgets have been since time immemorial.  I would have thought this was the time to make radical departures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to ask the Minister of State a few questions to explain things I do not understand.  If Members of the Opposition have raised these already, I apologise.  How can the Government possibly have a credible four year plan without mention of the banking crisis?  It makes it pretty well irrelevant because the banking crisis is the most important economic factor and the biggest hole in the economy.  Despite this, we have a four year plan that does not mention it, at least not in the overview and summary, which are all I have read.  I have no doubt in his reply the Minister of State will say we are in the middle of negotiations because of which he is probably not willing to indicate the cost of the money we will borrow.  The interest rate to be paid will be will be an enormous factor.  Even if the plan had included an optimistic and pessimistic scenario &mdash; a best and worst case &mdash; it would have been acceptable because at least we would have been able to have a look at it.  The arithmetic of budgets for the next four years will be completely and utterly controlled by this very important factor.  Neither I nor anyone else knows whether this &euro;85 billion, if not more, we are about to borrow will be borrowed at a rate of 7%, 5% or 4%.  It may be lower or higher, but probably not higher.  That is such a material factor that the budget arithmetic would be greatly changed by it, yet it is not mentioned in the plan.  All the cuts in social welfare and public service pensions will be dwarfed by the figure that comes out from the loans to the banks and the interest rates.  What are we supposed to make of these figures if they are irrelevant in terms of the big figure?  Could the Minister of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, but it is irrelevant if we do not have the biggest figure for what we will be paying annually to someone else.  That will be far more important than these other cuts.  The difference between 4% and 7% is enormous.  The Minister of State should not shake his head.  It is enormous in this context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have to balance our own books, as the Senator should know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not agree more, but sovereign debt and bank debt are the same thing, as the Minister of State knows perfectly well.  If the Government is servicing the bank debt, it will come out of the taxpayers&rsquo; pockets.  It is the same thing in the end.  The Minister of State is just playing semantics and talking technical nonsense.  At the end of the day, it will come out of our pockets and will be part of the budget arithmetic.  If the Minister of State <Col N="962"/>wants to separate them, it is up to him, but at the end of the day the same source of funds will pay for it and we need that figure in the plan.</P>
        <P>I find it difficult to find any basis for the plan&rsquo;s growth projections.  It is difficult to believe we will have an average growth rate of 2.85% over three years, which seems to be based on the 6% rise in exports this year.  For some reason the Government believes that will balloon while the rest of the economy stays steady.  Why does the Minister of State believe we can grow at the rapid rate predicted in the plan in years when we are cutting public expenditure and increasing taxes?  There may well be some reason for believing that, but normally if there is less money to spend, growth will not be encouraged.  There must be some exceptional reason for projecting that the economy will be able to grow at a high rate despite the fact that we are taking money out of people&rsquo;s pockets and reducing public expenditure, with social welfare and other cuts.  It does not make sense initially and to rely on the export argument is very<?oasys _jy ?>tenuous.</P>
        <P>I do not know why the Minister did not do something else.  Why have we so successfully defended the 12.5% corporation tax?  We defended it not so much because we wanted the revenue from it but because of the incredible boost it gives to the economy.  I congratulate the Minister on defending it successfully.  I believe there was some pressure to raise it, but there has always been such pressure, although I suspect it was exaggerated in order the Government could tell us it had saved it.  However, why did the Minister not think differently?  Given that the argument for it is so strong, why did he not suggest cutting it?  The 12.5% rate is the most important anchor of our economic growth and exports.  It attracts the multinationals which are the vibrant part of the economy.  US multinationals provide 112,000 jobs, something which must be encouraged.  What is the best way of doing so?  The Minister should tell the European Commission that we are reducing it to 9.5%.  Why did he not do this?  It would be the way to increase exports, employment and investment.  There would be a short-term loss of tax but this could be made up elsewhere.  God knows, the Minister has been brutal enough elsewhere.</P>

	<P>It could be made up in many other places.  The Minister of State knows where it has been done.  He will have time to answer the question which is a fair one.</P>
        <P>Why, in the name of God, does the plan not have a programme for a sale of State assets?  If we are in such an appalling situation economically and given that the ESB is worth &euro;8 billion and Aer Rianta, &euro;1 billion, why did the Government not list the State&rsquo;s assets and declare that it would sell them in a particular order?  This is an emergency, not a time to sit back and say: &ldquo;We have these in our back pocket but we better not sell them.&rdquo;  Why is there no programme for the sale of State assets to raise the money that it is necessary to raise?  This is an emergency, not a time for sitting on assets, a lot of which are monopolies which are losing money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the national recovery plan which sets out the direction the country will take in the next four years.  It is a first because we usually consider budgets on an annual basis.  However, the plan shows how we will do our housekeeping and keep our finances in check, which is most important.  We have been spending far too much money and getting little or no return for it.  We have not been effective in curbing expenditure on the public service, but this document clearly sets out how we will do this and make up the difference between what we borrow and spend.  That is both good and vital.</P>
        <P>The red line we defended, the 12.5% corporation tax rate, is an important feature of the plan.  If there is to be growth in the economy, it must be generated by inward investment and export-led companies.  That is where growth is anticipated in the plan.  However, how will we <Col N="963"/>negotiate the loan in the context of the plan and the budget?  It is extremely important that we get the right balance in what the ECB and the IMF will charge us in interest.  As I said this morning in the House, unless we secure favourable rates, the savings to be made under this welcome plan and in the forthcoming budget which aim to balance the budget will end up being paid out in interest.  That will not create jobs, only negativity in the economy.  It is important, therefore, that we beef up our negotiating team in order that it can explain that if people want their money back, the economy must grow.  We must be even more ruthless.  A total of &euro;90 billion is owed to the ECB.  We must tell it that we could default on that debt if we cannot afford to meet the repayments.  Therefore, I believe a rate of 2.5% or 3%, not 5%, is the ball line we should seek.  Remember, every percentage point represents a sum of &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that the document does not include one of our growth areas, the green economy.  There is nothing in it to grow the green economy.  The energy industry is probably one of the most important we could develop at this time.  Why?  First, it will employ people.  It will also provide us with an export industry.  It will help us to save on imports; over ten years it would save us &euro;60 billion.  It is important to look at where there is growth in the economy and this is one area in which there is growth.  We have the greatest sources of wealth in Europe in terms of energy resources.  Some strides have been made in harnessing some of this energy with our wind farms.  However, we now have an opportunity to install storage facilities to store this energy, instead of ploughing it into the grid when the wind is blowing and there is no spare backup.  We could harness this energy and sell it at a vast profit.</P>
        <P>The Spirit of Ireland group gave us an update a week ago on its current position.  It has a &euro;3.5 billion investment ready to go.  It is important that the Government has a policy on energy and the upgrading of the grid which will be vital for us in the next few years, especially when we will be paying high interest payments.  It is also important for the European Union which is supporting the bailout.  A contagion from our problem could spread to the rest of the Union which could make matters far worse.</P>
        <P>The ECB which appears to be run by the German Government because it wants to keep its bonds at a valuable rate and very much in demand has not done much to deal with our exporting position.  The euro has changed very little in value against the dollar, but the Americans are printing more money.  They are making the dollar less valuable in order that they can export more cheaply.  Who else is doing this?  The Chinese are and making their exports cheaper.  They are also cutting their costs.  That is what this plan is about and I strongly support it.  I wish to see everything in it being implemented.</P>
        <P>The plan will change politics in this country for the first time.  In the next election campaign no one will be able to promise anymore than what is contained in the plan.  It will be the document for the next election.  Whatever Government is elected will be able to tweak things here and there, but the 3% target to reduce our borrowing is sacrosanct and vital.</P>
        <P>The problems in banking are serious and could undermine the recovery plan unless they are dealt with.  They can only be dealt with by the ECB as they are too large for Ireland to handle on its own.  It is important to show the European Union that we are serious about the budgetary plan.  We have done so with the &euro;6 billion in cuts to be front-loaded and by ensuring the balance of payments will be corrected.  However, all this will be for naught if we do not get a good loan deal from the European Union.  Greece was able to borrow at the reasonable rate of 4.4%; Ireland must be offered a similar rate.</P>
        <P>Alternative energy production is one area in the domestic economy we can develop.  Five wind power generating stations on the west coast could make us virtually self-sufficient in energy supply, save us &euro;60 billion on imported fuel in the next ten years and even give us up <Col N="964"/>to &euro;10 billion in energy exports.  This is what we need to hone in on to ensure the economy will recover.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This debate on the publication of a four-year budgetary plan is a waste of time, as those delivering it have no credibility whatsoever.  We cannot believe a word they say because every intervention and projection they have made in the past two years has proved to be disastrous.  Several of the statements made show how incompetent the Government has been.</P>
        <P>In January 2009 the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated in the D&aacute;il that both Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks were &ldquo;fundamentally sound and solvent institutions.&rdquo;  Eight months later he said NAMA would:</P>
        <P LI="1">... ensure credit flows again to viable businesses and households by cleansing the balance sheets of Irish banks.  It will ensure we avoid the Japanese outcome of zombie banks that are just ticking over and not making a vibrant contribution to economic growth.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Last September he said he was &ldquo;bringing closure&rdquo; to the banking nightmare the people had had to live with since September 2008.  However, there has been no closure.  Not only is the nightmare set to continue, but it is to be of historic proportions, with Ireland, the economy of which represents a tiny 1.7% of the EU economy, now owing 20% of the European Union&rsquo;s banking debt.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Green Party has belatedly recognised its Government partners&rsquo; incompetence and effectively fired them this week.  If the financial controller of a bankrupt company was to be fired for incompetence, would he or she demand he or she had a right deliver a four-year strategy for that company on his or her way out the door?  Most certainly not.  If the members of the Government had even a modicum of shame or patriotism left, they would have left the stage a long time ago.  Their very presence in government is a major factor in our continuing downfall.</P>
        <P>Last night on TV3 some of us witnessed a defining moment in public service broadcasting when the clouds of obfuscation and deceit surrounding the bailout were swept away and the real facts surrounding the proposed IMF-ECB loan scheme emerged.

        <P>It is time to stop the IMF negotiations in their tracks, call an immediate general election and let the people decide if they want to burden future generations with this debt.  We must also realise that when the negotiations recommence, Ireland will be in a very powerful position and have the upper hand.  The ECB is petrified of a contagion; it simply cannot allow the Irish bushfire to escalate into an EU forest fire.  It must be told we will do a deal but on our terms alone.</P>
        <P>It is time Members in both Houses who claim to have the best interests of the people at heart followed the advice of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who said today that European politicians needed the courage to make private investors share the risk in future debt crises in the eurozone and show the financial markets who was in charge.  She asked a valid question: do politicians have the courage to make those who earn money share in the risk or is dealing in government debt the only business in the world economy that involves no risk?  In her statement I hear echoes of Joseph Stiglitz&rsquo;s statement several months ago when he questioned the wisdom and, most certainly, the morality of privatising the gains and socialising the losses associated with the banking system.  I will not support the imposition of the banking burden on the backs of the people without first giving them the full unvarnished truth and the option to decide their destiny.  That is what democracy is about.  It is most certainly not about prostituting our children&rsquo;s future at the feet of a bunch of misguided and irresponsible financiers who are not willing to live with the consequences of their actions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I wish to put the recovery plan in context.  The report states: </P>
        <P LI="1">From the late 1990s, the benefits of our booming economy were felt across every section of the population.  Working-age social welfare rates are now more than twice their rate in 2000.  [They increased by 300% between 2000 and 2009 at a time when the rate of inflation was 16%.]  Public service pay also increased well ahead of inflation.  From 2000 to 2009 average public service salaries increased by 59%.  At the same time, taxation was reduced.  During the period after 2000, the entry point to income tax increased from &euro;7,238 to &euro;18,300 for PAYE earners and since 2000, bands have widened by 105% for the single person and married two earners.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The statistics contained in the recovery plan put the matter in context.  The downside is the effect of the property boom which swelled VAT and other receipts.  The report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In 2007, capital taxes and stamp duty yielded &euro;6.7 billion.  This year, that figure is expected to fall to as low as &euro;1.6 billion.  In these dramatically changed circumstances, it is clear the State can no longer afford the current levels of social provision and personal taxation.</P><Col N="966"/>
        <P FLI="0">It seems there has been historical revisionism in recent weeks.  If I have a criticism, it is that the extension of the tax schemes for the construction industry, specifically private housing rather than corporate construction, from 2004 onwards should have been stopped earlier.  Such was the pressure exerted by all sectors of society, not least by the construction industry which was creating an enormous number of jobs, the Government did not respond adequately.  As I pointed out on the Order of Business, despite the wonderful hindsight shown by critics of the Government, none of these issues was under discussion in the 2007 general election campaign.  There was no reference to a flawed banking system, an impending banking crisis or the implosion of Government receipts.  The Fine Gael and Labour Party manifestoes called for increased expenditure, while the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto called for restraint.  That is a fact of life many in the toxic atmosphere outside that is so anti-Fianna F&aacute;il and anti-Government have chosen not to remember.  Perhaps they are ignorant enough not to look at the facts.</P>
        <P>The report states capital spending must be reduced, but the reduction must be considered in the context of the substantial investment made in the past decade which has transformed the road network, the public transport system, education institutions and cultural, sports and tourism facilities.  These are real gains for the country and represent a legacy for future generations.  They were not magicked out of the air but were made because the Government prudently spent the money accruing in ever increasing amounts in the period 2000 to 2010.  Such is the scale of historical revisionism, the gains made by successive Fianna F&aacute;il Administrations have been forgotten.  They are permanent and show a benefit in terms of the economic impact on the country.  As a result, there are lower transport costs and easier access.  The country is still an attractive location for foreign direct investment, despite the gainsayers.</P>
        <P>I have never taken the approach that the glass is half empty.  I accept that the making of a political charge and counter charge is in the nature of politics.  However, we must provide hope for and give confidence to the people.  I applaud the Taoiseach for the manner in which he opened proceedings today, followed by the Minister for Finance and the leader of the Green Party, Deputy Gormley.  The message was one of hope and confidence rather than we had a beaten Government.  That was not the rhetoric of a Government in its last weeks.  It provided a beacon of hope for the people, that this is a national recovery plan.  Society as a whole can combine to bring the country to a better environment.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that 45% of taxpayers will pay no income tax in 2010.  This is an extraordinary figure when one considers that in the United States of America everyone pays tax.  This issue will be specifically addressed in the budget.  The economy enjoyed sustained, balanced and export-led growth as recently as the 1990s.  The point made in the report is that we can get back to that point.  Between 1993 and 2000 exports expanded by almost 18% per annum, driving an average annual GDP growth rate of 9%, a cumulative increase of 500,000 people in employment, a cumulative rise in living standards of about 80%, all in the context of maintaining a healthy balance of payments position and achieving a substantial Government budget surplus.  I give credit to the rainbow coalition which was in government between 1994 and 1997.  What happened subsequently was in a different context.  The reason it is included in the report is that the formula for achieving balanced, sustainable growth appropriate to a small, open economy is not elusive.  We discovered and applied the formula for export-led growth in the 1990s and can do so again.  It has been shown in the figures compiled in the past 12 months.  Exports are improving on an ongoing basis and we will have a balance of payments surplus next year.  We will export more than we will import, which is unique among the countries under attack in the eurozone, including Portugal, Spain and Italy.</P><Col N="967"/>
        <P>The report reflects the fact that a number of sectors will experience growth.  Exports in the agrifood industry amounted to approximately &euro;7 billion in 2009, representing half of all exports by indigenously-owned firms.  During the first five months of this year the value of exports was more than 8% higher than one year earlier, at almost &euro;3 billion.  The rate of recovery has accelerated as the year has progressed.  Exports grew by 14% in the third quarter.  The prospects for the major agrifood product categories in 2010 are generally positive, as better market prices and a more stable economic picture across Ireland&rsquo;s key markets underpin trade.  Was it not a joy to see potato farmers loading Irish potatoes onto three ships at Drogheda Port last week?  They came from various parts of the country but primarily from the major potato growing areas in County Meath and on the east coast.  The surplus of 50,000 potatoes on the Irish market will be sold for export.  These are being sold on the Russian market.  The people there specifically wanted Irish potatoes because they were free of a particular disease strain endemic elsewhere.  This is a wonderful tribute.</P>
        <P>The tourism marketing budget of &euro;44 million will maintain Ireland&rsquo;s visibility in overseas markets.  This is welcome.  Capital funding for the tourism sector will be focused on completing the upgrade of major tourist attractions and developing a number of key iconic attractions.  In this regard, I thank the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht affairs, Deputy Carey, who hosted a tourist initiative in Ballyshannon last Saturday.  I pay tribute to Mr. Paul McLoone, general manager of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the north west, with whom I worked in the years I was chairman, for developing three major iconic attractions in the region &mdash; Glencar Waterfall in County Leitrim which is known to the followers of Yeats&rsquo;s beautiful poetry; Ben Bulbin of Queen Maeve fame; and Slieve League Cliffs, much more impressive natural cliffs than the famous Cliffs of Moher.  I pay tribute to the three local authorities in counties Leitrim, Donegal and Sligo which are putting in money to improve access and infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Like others, I raised previously in the House and with the Minister for Finance the question of whether the ten year period for the solidarity bond issued last year was acting as a disincentive, in particular to those who were at or near retirement age and had significant, although not large, sums of money to invest to help the State.  They asked me and others if the time limit could be reduced because they considered ten years was a long time.  I am pleased to say that in the national recovery plan it is stated that it is intended to launch a new four year solidarity bond shortly with a similar structure to the ten year bond.  It will pay a coupon each year and a bonus to those who hold it to maturity.  I applaud the initiative taken and thank the Minister for Finance for responding so effectively in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  As acknowledged on all sides of the House, we have never been at such a crossroads in our political and economic history.  We have only managed to have a cursory look at the plan and while there are many aspects of which we are critical &mdash; no doubt, some speakers have been and more will follow me who perhaps will be even more critical &mdash; but we wish it well.  We do not wish to knock it, despite our valid criticisms.</P>
        <P>No one wishes to cut anyone&rsquo;s standard of living, salary or wage, but we also realise that we must cut our cloth according to our measure.  The State has a deficit of &euro;18.5 billion between what it receives in tax receipts and what it pays out in running the services provided.  Clearly, that is not sustainable.  On page 91 of the plan the Government admits the error of its ways in regard to the unsustainability of the income tax base.  Reference is made to the base broadening measures now required as a result.  The situation we have allowed to develop is serious and must be corrected.  We may have different ways of broadening the base and closing the gap.  That is natural.  However, we subscribe to the figure of &euro;15 billion and the plan to reduce the general Government deficit to 3% by 2014.  We only argue about the detail.  The devil is often, <Col N="968"/>if not always, in the detail.  We subscribe to the need to restore order to the public finances.  We want to provide for extra growth and the creation of employment in the recovery process.  It is proposed that the economy will grow by 2.75% on average between 2011 and 2014.  I would like to know a little of the detail on which that estimation is based.  Perhaps the Minister of State might refer to this.  It must be based on projections from some source.  We would also like to know more about the reforms the Government will implement to accelerate growth in certain key areas.</P>
        <P>I support what Senator Mooney said about tourism and our iconic tourist attractions.  While he did not refer to the travel tax, I welcome the hint that perhaps the Minister might be prepared to drop it as it is not bringing in sufficient revenue.  The Minister has put it up to the airline operators to show how they would bring in extra numbers of tourists if it was removed.  That approach must be pursued.  We heard the chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland speak on the matter on radio this morning.  Those of us who come from prime tourism areas know how much the tax has hindered and obstructed us in the achievement of our goals.  I invite the Minister of State to say more on the subject also.  I agree with the goal in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State recently visited my part of the country and is aware of our iconic attractions.  I will mention just two &mdash; Muckross House and Killarney House which is a wonderful attraction.  Lord Castlerosse and members of the Kenmare family lived there between 1913 and 1953, but the house is now being allowed to fall into rack and ruin.  Sadly, while there is limited expenditure to strengthen the foundations, much more could be done to preserve this wonderful and historic house that is part of our heritage in the south west.  It is situated both in the town of Killarney and the national park.</P>
        <P>The &euro;85 billion package has often been referred to as a bailout, but it is not a dig-out in the sense that we properly understand these terms.  It has not been totally finalised.  The Minister of State might comment further on this.  We would like to know whether the loan or, as I heard it described earlier today, an overdraft facility will have to be drawn down in its entirety.  We hope that will not be the case.  I would like to know if there is an outline of how much of it is intended for the provision of Government services, the ongoing running of the various Departments and how much &mdash; I presume by far the larger part &mdash; is for our banks which are in such difficulty.  We have been hearing on a daily basis about the continuous withdrawal of large-scale deposits &mdash; &euro;12 billion since June &mdash; and despite all the assurances and the guarantee in place, some people have shifted their money from banks to elsewhere.  What proportion is earmarked for the banks?  That may change because moving from a 7% or 8% tier one capital requirement to 12% will result in a huge imposition.  We wish to know, therefore, the rate at which the facility will be made available.  We have heard much from the Government to the effect that this will be a back-stop and the firepower to settle and calm matters which we all desire so much but which sadly is not happening.  I would like to hear more about this aspect of the &euro;85 billion being given to us, which amount may not be exact.</P>
        <P>The Leader is aware that I have often referred to the frightful mistakes made with the banks.  I did not disagree with the giving of the guarantee because it was absolutely necessary.  However, mistakes were made with Anglo Irish Bank.  Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland are the two institutions of most systemic importance, with branches in practically every town.  They were providing the lifeblood of business.  However, we know how tight things have become and how difficult it is to have an overdraft or loan facility sanctioned.  Even if one had such a facility beforehand, cuts are being imposed when the matter comes up for review.  Life is difficult, but, as a country, we cannot live or trade without a functioning banking system.  Despite our criticisms, we should plan well.</P><Col N="969"/>
        <P>We have been told that we will move towards 99.9% ownership of Allied Irish Banks, which is probably true.  I am sure it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to keep the stock market listing to give hope to the small shareholders who have lost so much.  In the past day or two the frightful news has been that we will move from a figure of 36% or 38% to 78% or 80% ownership of Bank of Ireland.  That would represent a significant jump in State involvement.  With what moral authority did the Minister and the Department allow the clowns at the top of these banks &mdash; I am not referring to genuine branch workers &mdash; who sanctioned the sizable exposure in the property sector during the years and who have contributed to the mess we are in to stay on?  I hope the Government takes a firm hand and removes those at board or senior management level who do not deserve to be there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share three minutes of my time with Senator Walsh.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s initiative in introducing a four year national recovery plan.  Those of us who have been in the House a long time remember what happened in the 1980s when the situation was even more difficult.  Some 900,000 people were unemployed compared with a figure of more than 1.7 million in employment today.  According to the Minister, our exports have grown by 6% this year in what has been one of the most difficult trading years globally.  There is, therefore, a considerable number of positives on which we must work.</P>
        <P>I compliment and agree with Senator Coghlan who stated we must have a functioning banking system.  This poses a difficulty because the public sector accounts for 20% of those in employment; the private sector, including small and medium-sized enterprises, is responsible for 80%.  I am anxious to make that point as I would like to see further Government initiatives to promote economic growth and job creation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Hanafin, on the &euro;44 million to be invested in tourism next year.  As we all know, more than 300,000 people work in that sector, nearly as many as those who work in the public service.  The Minister stated she would work hard to ensure tourists from everywhere would be helped to access visas and so forth.  Some of us have had the opportunity to visit China, India, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and so on.  They are all places with substantial wealth, large populations and considerable potential to assist our tourism sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent budgets and the four year plan the removal of tax incentives, particularly for the hotel sector in which I have a vested interest, has proved difficult, given the package the Government offered ten years ago to prompt people to invest in the industry.  The Government is now rewriting the rules.  It is almost as if it is retrospectively removing the undertakings given at the time.  This makes it difficult for employers, investors, innovators and entrepreneurs to further invest in the tourism business.  The National Asset Management Agency has mentioned that it will have a large number of hotels on its books because of the factors I have cited.  There should be a note of caution in the sector which has considerable potential in terms of job creation and maintenance.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon referred to a television show he watched last night.  I could be wrong, but the figures quoted might not be correct.  There might have been some double counting.  Since a significant element of any package agreed with the IMF and the European Union would be sovereign debt, there has been significant double counting and as such, the figures should be checked.  The Minister for Finance has referred to the facility as being firepower for the banks.  If the economy becomes buoyant again, some of the money might not need to be drawn down.  The figure for the sum needed for recapitalisation of the banks, to raise the capital ratio from <Col N="970"/>8% to 12%, is speculative.  As we know, because of the money invested in the economy, particularly in the retail trade as we near Christmas, short-term loans can often be turned around twice in a single year if the loans are taken out for four-month or six-month periods.  There could be double counting in this respect also.  A figure of &euro;300 billion has been cited, but I understood the Department&rsquo;s working estimate was approximately &euro;150 billion or &euro;160 billion.  While that is a large amount, it is manageable compared with a figure of &euro;300 billion.</P>
        <P>I am happy that the 12.5% corporation tax rate has been retained.  Thanks to Donogh O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s decision, the education system has helped to transform the country in the past 50 years.  Likewise, the corporation tax rate has given our island nation an opportunity.  Some 90% of everything manufactured on the island is exported.  I congratulate the Government and everyone involved in the negotiating team for retaining the 12.5% rate.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Butler on the urgent need to develop the energy sector, be it wind power or wave power.  We must eliminate the &euro;60 billion paid out over ten years on oil imports.  We could become a significant exporter; the excess energy supply generated on the island could be used to create a considerable revenue stream for the Exchequer every year.</P>
        <P>I look forward to more debates on the urgent and pressing challenges facing the people and the Government.  I support every initiative the Government is trying to take and thank the Opposition for its support in seeking to reduce the debt ratio to 3% of GDP by 2014.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  Having listened to the debate, there have been some singularly constructive contributions from the Opposition.  This is welcome, given our position.  I listened to today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, on which a socialist member of the Portuguese Government acknowledged that Portugal&rsquo;s Opposition was abstaining on the fiscal and taxation measures being introduced.  When the RTE correspondent noted how strange that was and asked why the country&rsquo;s Opposition would do such a thing, the member said it was a sign of Portugal&rsquo;s political maturity.  I am glad the same is starting to dawn on certain people within our Opposition.  It is just a pity that we did not have it for the past two years.  It would have been helpful and we might have made more advances.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the plan.  It is courageous and tackles in a responsible way those areas that require tackling.  I was particularly impressed by the contributions by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance at the news conference and subsequently on the news.  They were reassuring.  It is obvious that they have a grasp, a vision, but above all they have the courage as politicians facing into an election where they know they are going to be unpopular, to put the country first.  That is something the Taoiseach told the parliamentary party more than two years ago, and I very much welcome the fact that he has continued on that path despite much of the personalised vilification from sections of the media, and others as well, perhaps.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact the minimum wage is being tackled, and I had hoped it might have been done before this.  I just wonder whether it is a significant reduction, but at least it is a start in the right direction.  It is becoming a wedge and I know of people moving into the black economy as a consequence.  Employers cannot get people to work.  However, I would strongly welcome if the joint labour committee, JLC, agreements which are totally unsustainable in today&rsquo;s climate, were addressed.  They are totally unsustainable in today&rsquo;s climate, with people here being paid &euro;2 to &euro;4 more than they would get in Germany, the strongest economy in Europe.  It is not sustainable and the JLCs should be suspended as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>I believe the &euro;15 billion figure is correct, although I wonder whether it will be sufficient.  I note it will comprise &euro;5 billion in taxation and expenditure cuts of &euro;10 billion, but I would have liked to have seen that varied.  The &euro;10 billion in expenditure cuts should have been exclusively <Col N="971"/>in the current expenditure area, and the &euro;5 billion in taxation is too much.  It should have been &euro;3 billion in taxation and &euro;2 billion in capital expenditure.  Perhaps we might be able to move in that direction.  I have some concerns about the projections being predicated on 2.75% growth in GDP.  Ireland is a very open economy, and given what has happened in the US and the EU my view is that we may not see more than half that level of growth achieved during the period of the plan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have mentioned public service pay and the professions here before.  I am glad there is focus on the professions in this, but we really need strong action to back the words towards having a rigorous promotion of competition within the system.  I would like to see the Competition Authority&rsquo;s 2006 report on legal and professional fees, which has not been acted upon, being implemented.  It is unconscionable that we are still paying people &euro;2,500 a day in the tribunals and in the Four Courts, and I do not believe we can stand over the fact that people on low incomes are paying taxes in order that those people may get these types of increases. Pay and the numbers employed in the public service need to be tackled far more strenuously than we have done to date.  I believe the figure of 24,500 is too low, and unless the Croke Park agreement yields enormous savings, which I do not anticipate given the make-up of the implementation body, we shall have to return to adjust this, probably within the next 12 months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is very welcome and I thank him for being here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have the four-year plan, and while I welcome it, it is a four-year Government plan, not a cross-party one.  It has some strengths, however, and I am delighted that corporation tax has not been touched because this is critical for the 150,000 FDI jobs.  What this initiative lacks, however, is a job creation plan.  Neither is there a stimulus plan and that is something we believe to be essential.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State knows, Fine Gael is committed to reducing the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014 and this is the target.  With ever changing figures as regards the national debt, unfortunately this appears to be short on detail.  What we really have in the plan are just the figures on how we are going to reach our targets in 2011.  We do not have the specifics for 2012-14, and that leaves much to the imagination.</P>
        <P>I shall deal specifically with two areas, education and health.  I speak on education because I am the Fine Gael spokesperson in the Seanad for this area.  We all know education is the driver of growth.  The OECD has said that the three crucial areas for growth are education, trade and reform, in terms of leaner government, so that the State may work more efficiently.  We therefore have to look carefully at how education is being handled, and what I see is less restructuring than cutting.  I would have liked better use of resources to bring about improved and better results.  Only today we heard that one in seven children is not being adequately taught maths and English at primary school level, and 20% of our teachers are unprepared.  What could this plan have done to make this situation better?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This plan needs to invest in leadership in schools and in principals who can give better guidance to teachers in order that they may have more of a role in supervision, to ensure learning outcomes are achieved.  I am somewhat shocked that the plan <Col N="972"/>talks about reducing teacher numbers by a combination of measures, with &euro;24 million in savings in 2011.  If the average teacher is on &euro;50,000, which a teacher starting would not be on, it means we will lose 500 teachers from the system this year.  We are talking about incredible teacher unemployment.  Of the 400 graduates who came out of St. Patrick&rsquo;s College this year only 30 have permanent posts.  We have a crisis in teacher unemployment, even as regards getting a few months teaching where they could do their probation.</P>
        <P>Some 54 young teachers came to me in Galway about a month ago.  They could get jobs abroad, but they needed to be probated here because if they come back in more than three years, they will be outside the probation period.  There used to be a five-year window in which to be probated, but the Minister has just reduced it to three.  This is a bad idea when there are no jobs.  I took it up with the Minister who told me she did not have the inspectors.  However, if one does not have enough inspectors one leaves it at five years.  Otherwise one only creates a further crisis by cutting it to three years.  With the stroke of a pen the Minister can make a difference in that area which would not cost money.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Despite the impression given by the Taoiseach, the Green Party leader and the Minister for Finance, students in the education system look as if they will be hit hard by this plan.  I acknowledge the Green Party has done its best to protect education, but third level students face a significant increase in their registration costs.  Registration fees are set to rise from &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000, not including the separate costs being added on by some third level institutions.  This is a tax on families as well as on young people. Members will know of parents with two or three children in third level; therefore, this is quite a crippling cost.  Somebody has to bear this cost.  Does it matter that young people are taking the brunt of it?  I believe it does, because the OECD has clearly indicated that while we do well in the middle range, our elite students, or the top 10%, are underperforming.  We need the top 10% to do better in maths and the sciences, in order that we may keep the Intel jobs and attract the Google jobs here, instead of such companies having to locate abroad.</P>
        
        <P>Equally, we have a problem at the bottom end with 16% or 17%, one in six of our students, performing poorly.  When I met the OECD recently, that was the advice I got.  Those are the areas we need to touch on, and this is going to hit hard because the Government is talking too about putting a &euro;200 new charge on post-leaving certificate students.  They are 17 and 18 year olds who obviously did not get the leaving certificate results they needed or they would be attending college.  The Government proposes to force the youth of this country to pay for the chance to make something of their lives.  These students are obviously not happy with their results and are seeking a direction.  I am concerned that instead of staying in school, they will decide to go on the dole, which is no future for young people.  On top of this, there is also a suggested 5% cut in all capitation grants.  I presume this relates to primary and second level.  Again, the advice from the OECD is that there should be no cuts at preschool, primary or secondary level.  This 5% cut will include adult literacy, community education, school completion programmes and Youthreach.  Who are the people involved?  They are the people school did not suit.  They are the people who dropped out early, the one in six we are advised to protect.  This is in absolute contrast to the advice of the OECD.  A total of 16% of students are leaving the school system early.  This cut will do nothing to reduce that number and will only exacerbate their problems in terms of literacy and life chances.  All this comes in the wake of today&rsquo;s report on students doing poorly in English and mathematics.  Implementation of these new measures in the plan will amount to the narrowing of options for students who form the generation we are hoping will work in the future to pay for our pensions.</P>
        <P>An interesting report in one of yesterday&rsquo;s daily newspapers states that we are driving 100,000 young people from the campus to the dole.  This figure does not include those leaving <Col N="973"/>the country.  We must be careful about how we handle education, which we are all agreed is the driver of growth.  If we truly believe that, let us not makes cuts to education.  In this regard, I am not talking about cutting inefficiencies or about standing over poor performance because I agree these must be rooted out.  I am, however, talking about cutting the opportunity for growth for young people in the education system.  In this regard, we need only look to the Finish experience.  It was through education that Finland made its country a success, improved the living standards of its people and grew its economy.  This plan is more about cutting than restructuring or doing things in a new and improved way.  I suggest we should be investing in leaders and school principals, which would be cost neutral in the long run and would go a long way to counteracting the poor performances we find in the system.</P>
        <P>I would like to touch on the area of health care.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The national recovery plan is short on specifics in the area of health.  Although it claims to protect front-line services, it suggests more staff cuts in the planned services sector.  We learned today that 10% of our youth are failing to avail of mental health services in the HSE west and HSE south regions, which is very serious.  A young person requiring mental health services is in trouble.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will say if there will be a cut in mental health funding.  The plan contains no specifics on health.  It does not guide us.  The plan merely sets out the Vote in this area.  This is an area that should not be touched.</P>
        <P>There is concern that funding for the community addiction clinic at Merlin Park University Hospital in Galway will be cut.  The clinic has lost one addiction counsellor owing to retirement and is now getting referrals from general practitioners for alcohol counselling and treatment, which are simply being stamped and put in a pile.  It will take six to nine months to deal with these referrals.  What is the benefit in not replacing one addiction counsellor on the front line?  These patients will end up in our emergency rooms, costing the State much more than the amount saved in not employing one addiction counsellor.</P>

	<P>The people expect fairness.  I welcome the broadening of the tax base because I believe it is important that everyone contributes, even if it is only &euro;5 a week.  I am concerned, however, that this plan will force the youth of our country to choose between education and financial hardship or welfare.  I do not believe welfare is the future for anyone.  I am concerned that this plan also asks those on the front line in our health system to do the impossible, which is downright dangerous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate on the national recovery plan.  Its title is similar to the original plan for recovery in 1987 which, in fairness, led to a genuine degree of economic recovery at that time.  In this much more difficult and financially disastrous time for the economy, it is vital that this plan or a variation thereof is equally successful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been much talk about this plan during recent weeks.  It was billed in strong lighting.  I always had reservations, not about the final document but about the amount of credibility anyone could expect from such a document.  In fairness, and this is not a party political point, economics is a moving boat at present in that we cannot determine with any great certainty the markets, international growth rates, the banking problem and so on.  This plan is based on growth figures, some of which are deemed to be overly optimistic.  Let us hope they prove <Col N="974"/>slightly pessimistic and that growth does increase significantly, which would be of major assistance in turning around the future of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The basis for the national recovery plan, even though flagged some months ago, stems from the fact that the Government was aware, even though we did not have any final announcements until last week, that there may well be a need for outside intervention by the IMF, the ECB and so on and that such intervention could only come about with the production by Government of a substantial plan for the next three to four years.  That intervention by outside agencies has come to pass.  Negotiations between the IMF, the ECB, other agencies and the Government are ongoing, the fruits of which we will see soon.  A plan was necessary and I wish the Government well with it.  Regardless of what party presented the plan, I do not believe it does or could provide all the answers.  Its whole basis is the projections for growth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have not undertaken detailed scrutiny of the plan but have heard various media, party political and brief summaries on it.  I have also read the leaflet accompanying the plan.  I was disappointed to read about the adjustment figures which, as outlined by my colleague, Senator Healy Eames, will pose further challenges in terms of cuts in resources.  The adjustment figure portrayed in this plan comprises two thirds cuts or spending restraint and one third taxation.  I am not an economic expert but then who is?  Most experts have got it wrong.  There is substantial international advice, economically and historically, that such a proportion is not the best way to deal with adjustments, rather such adjustment should be higher on the savings side and lower on the taxation side.  There is a substantial body of evidence to show that where an adjustment goes too heavily on the taxation side, it is a barrier to job growth and creation.  What this country desperately needs next week, next month and next year, apart from the obvious political change, is a job creation strategy, which will be difficult to put in place when this plan proposes substantial increases in tax and VAT.  My first note of caution is that the balance of spending cuts and taxation is wrong.  Further spending cuts would challenge the numbers working in the public service.  That would cause its own difficulties, as outlined effectively by Senator Healy Eames, but that is a debate for another day.</P>
        <P>I refer to a number of specifics that jumped off the page.  I am concerned about the proposed increase in VAT.  When the Value Added Tax Consolidation Bill was before the House last week, the Minister of State pointed out that one third of the tax take was accounted for by VAT.  There is room to add money to the State&rsquo;s coffers by increasing VAT rates, but it would come at the cost of jobs and not stimulating the economy.  Therefore, this proposal needs further reflection.</P>
        <P>I refer to the move towards property taxation.  Ireland is unique in not having property or local taxes.  During the reign of the next Government there will have to be a huge overhaul of the taxation system.  We would be living in cloud-cuckoo-land if we did not acknowledge that such an overhaul would result in the introduction of local or property taxes or a combination of both.</P>
        <P>This leads, in turn, to the reform of politics.  Local government is as broken as national government and in need of urgent reform.  When reference is made to growth, stimulus plans and the future, we must consider political reform and leadership.  Perhaps the demand was not on the Government to address political reform, but if we are to reform the country economically, we have to reform it politically.  That is not a party political point.  We need a renewed local government structure with real powers, responsibilities and revenue raising and spending opportunities.  That would transform local government.  Many officials are trying to do so much with so little within the structures of local government, including through enterprise boards and ADM, Leader and partnership groups.  Presumably, they do valuable work, but all of that work should be the function of elected local authority members.  A medium-term strategy for <Col N="975"/>structural and economic reform must involve local government and genuine political reform.  The Minister of State who has a broad interest in politics will have read the Fine Gael document, Reinventing Government.  If I was commenting on his party&rsquo;s proposals, I would say they were not perfect and I am sure he will say ours are not perfect, but, sadly, that is how politics works.  There is a significant body of reform proposals in the document authored by Deputy Bruton that would transform this society and economy in a relatively short time.  I hope the next Government will take on board much of what is contained in the document.  A significant element of the economic crisis stems from a lack of political leadership at Government level, a lack of political debate at Oireachtas level and a lack of political responsibility among us all.  That must change, but as I have said on numerous occasions, it cannot change within the confines of the current electoral system which puts a premium on potholes over policies.  While recommendations along these lines need not necessarily be part of this plan, any reform programme for the economy, society and priorities will have to have a substantial chapter on political reform.  That is missing from the plan.</P>
        <P>With regard to taxation, I am sketchy on specifics, but reference is made to broadening the tax base which, presumably, will result in people currently outside the tax net being brought into the taxation system to pay tax.  That will be difficult to accept for those affected, but we must adopt the principle that everybody should pay some tax.  In tha regard, the broadening of the tax net is welcome.  However, we must be cautious that we do not go down the easy to travel road of the late 1970s and early 1980s of piling tax increase upon tax increase, which was disastrous economically.  That would generate a short-term fiscal dividend for the Minister for Finance, but it would cause economic chaos.  This is not an ideological perspective.  We must continue with a policy of low taxation and making it attractive for people to create and take up work.  That issue is addressed somewhat in the plan through reductions in social welfare payments and the national minimum wage.</P>
        <P>I am not disappointed with what has been produced because nobody could expect a new economic-social-political bible to emerge following a few months&rsquo; work.  This is necessary, presumably, to send a signal to the international markets and I hope our short-term economic masters, the ECB and the IMF, that we have a plan.  I look forward to further debate on this issue.  This is the beginning of a new book of political and economic reform, but it is only the first of what will have to be many chapters.  Reform has to be at the core of everything the Oireachtas and society engages in in the next few years.  There must be reform of our economic structures, thinking, politics and practice.  We can blame the banks, markets and every other external factor, but, as politicians, we are responsible for taking wrong decisions and not taking others.  We cannot remove ourselves from this.  We need to create political space for debate, decision-making and new political structures in the years ahead.  If we do, we will help to rebuild and regenerate the economy.</P>
        <P>I wish the Government well with the plan.  Its days are numbered, but, for the sake of the country, I hope we will see the beginning of the plan&rsquo;s implementation and, in conjunction with publication of the budget, we will create certainty for the markets and provide hope and optimism for the people.  We are short of money, but, more than this, we are short of hope and confidence.  The debate on the plan should, at least, lead to optimism and hope and a point where we will, at least, begin to speak politically about a new beginning.  The next Government which I hope will be led by Fine Gael will have to take charge of the programme of national recovery.  We will have new ideas, politics and policies to bring on board, but there is much in the document with which we agree and some which we will change, but I hope all of us can work together to rebuild and save the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a changing of the guard.  I welcome my old friend from &ldquo;Operation Transformation&rdquo; and bid a sad farewell to my friend, the Green Party Minister of State.  It does not matter much who is sitting in for the Government because this is not a terribly serious debate.  I asked at the beginning whether it would be rolled over to another day and I was assured it would.  I was on my way home only to be told it would not and since this is one of the critical moments in the history of the country, I considered it was important that I should say something, but it is just a marker.  That is true for a few other Members because I listened to one or two contributions and they were rambling.  There was inevitably a lack of focus because there has not been time to digest or examine the document in detail.  There is a certain lack of seriousness.  We are just a decoration, and that is part of the problem.  There has been very little accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas in financial matters.  All the big decisions have been taken outside the parliamentary scrutiny system to a very large extent and not just Seanad &Eacute;ireann but D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is just a rubber stamp.  We are not given responsibility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On this subject, it is extraordinary, in the light of the way this country&rsquo;s finances have been mishandled, that constitutionally this House is not trusted with even sufficient money to print an advertisement.  Time and again Members on all sides of this House have had significant amendments ruled out of order because they would create a charge on the Exchequer.  In the light of the colossal sums involved in our current difficult situation, that is laughable.</P>
        <P>I want to make a few comments on the national recovery plan.  I have glanced through it, and it is full of the usual graphs, tables and rhetoric.  How do we know it will work?  We could not even get things right up to this point.  This goes back a long way.  I recall raising the fact statistics from the Department of Finance were routinely way off the mark.  I recall asking what qualifications there were and how the figures were arrived at, and I did that partly because people outside this House were concerned.  They asked me if I could find out the reason the forecasts were so often wide of the mark.  Now we have seen situations where &euro;7 billion becomes &euro;15 billion inside a week or two.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the problems, and it may not be a problem the Minister of State and his colleagues will have to deal with for very much longer &mdash; that may come as a relief &mdash; is a lack of confidence, a lack of belief.  There is a psychological atmosphere in the country that is poisoned by fear, anxiety and uncertainty.  I hope when this plan is fleshed out in a finance Bill it will give some degree of certainty.  That is what is needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to examine some of the elements.  First, there is the question of the markets.  We are in danger of missing an opportunity to take a radical philosophical look at the basis of the western economic structure, not just in Ireland but throughout the West.  I believe this is a systemic failure.  It is not just bad behaviour.  The system does not meet the situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recall being told in this House on several occasions that we could not do this or that.  We could not let Anglo Irish Bank collapse, which I recommended from the very beginning, because it was of systemic importance.  Many people around the House referred to systemic.  That word was repeated like some kind of a mantra but we must look underneath that to see what it means.  It means that the system is more important than the welfare of the people.  This is a moment when we should say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  We should say that, collectively, as a responsible political class, as a Parliament and as a people, we are putting the rights and welfare of our citizens above the purported claims of the system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the market, I predict confidently that these catastrophic events will occur in closer conjunction, in more rapid succession and in more extreme form.  This is not the end of it.  We may just manage to get the sticking plaster on it in time to get us over this particular difficulty but it will recur unless we examine the entire system.</P><Col N="977"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P Just="Left">It is the same with climate change and the two are inter-related.  There is not time, unfortunately, to go into that philosophically but it is perfectly obvious that western capitalism is based on a fairly crude interpretation of the market.  It is based on the infinitely expanding market idea which meets a wall very quickly these days in terms of the finite resources of the planet.  Therefore, it is a contradiction.  That will eventually have to be faced and we will have to revise the whole thing.</P>
        <P>We have market sentiment and market confidence.  How is confidence generated?  How is confidence undermined?  I would say much of what is going on is nothing other than a gigantic confidence trick.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us look at the banks.  Basically, they are bust.  We have shoved immeasurable quantities of money into them that are beyond the imagination of simple people like myself.  We then went on and borrowed more money and shovelled it into the banks by the bucket load.  Today we are told that because of German concerns about the rate of corporation tax the Government is prepared to introduce a levy on the banks.  Perhaps the Minister of State can tell me what they intend to levy.  Where is this levy coming from?  It seems absurd.</P>
        <P>It is rather like the little story that was going around about the American tourist who came into a little village hotel, plonked a &euro;100 note on the counter and said he would like to inspect the rooms and he was leaving that money as a deposit.  The owner of the hotel was delighted with that because he could pay his bill in the pub.  The pub owner was knocking off the local tart and he was able to pay her.  I am short-circuiting the story slightly.  She was able to pay her room in the hotel.  The American fellow then came back and took the &euro;100.</P>
        <P>It is very difficult to understand where the flaw in the logic is; it is just that money seems to go round.  Nothing is actually paid but it circulates.  The difficulty is that one person did not provide the service.  That is the missing link in the chain, but that is the confidence trick and that is what has been going on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us consider the ratings agencies because they are part of this whole set-up.  Why do we not start rating the ratings agencies &mdash; Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, Fitch and Moody&rsquo;s?  They are the ones who got it wrong with Enron.  They are the people who got it spectacularly wrong with Iceland to which they gave a three star rating a week before it went down the drain, so to speak.  They are the very ones who are giving us a triple star rating when we were doing all the sort of things for which we are now being criminalised and criticised for.  Why did they give us three stars?  As they did not spot it why should we believe them now?  Goldman Sachs and the rest of them were all up to their ears in helping the Greek Government to massage its figures and landed us in these waters.  What are these ratings agencies which have been seen to be so incompetent and criminally corrupt with their involvement in sub-prime mortgages, and in helping to conceal the toxic elements in those bundles and then validating them?  I used to teach in a university.  The students would be thrilled to pieces if they believed they could buy their ratings, and that is what happened.  Did they ever hear of a conflict of interest?  Ratings agencies were being paid by the people they were rating.  We should get rid of all this froth.  Let us start rating the ratings agencies.  That should be part of our price.  I have been saying for two years that we in Europe should stand up to the ratings agencies and establish a fully independent trustworthy ratings agency and get rid of these people who have lost all credibility.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">What about the hedge funds?  These are the nice people who gamble against currencies in the hope they will collapse.  They seem to have no feeling for the ordinary people on the ground.  We should know a little bit more about them.  I would like to know more about them.  I have another requirement about which I am delighted.  Let the people know what I am paid, <Col N="978"/>what I do for my pay, the number of times I am in the place and so on.  I am delighted because I believe my record will be pretty good, and it is all in the name of letting the people know.</P>
       <P Just="Left">How about letting the people know the names of the senior bondholders?  Who are they?  We have been asked to write a blank cheque for people we do not know with money we have not even borrowed yet.  I would like to know who they are.  Who are the people in the share funds?  These are the people who are gambling against us.  We should have their names.  We should know who they are in order that we can rate them as well because it is an extraordinary position and people are entitled to that kind of information.</P>
        <P>With regard to the banks, they showed a complete contempt for the small people who are their savers.  The very least we expect from these documents is a reassurance for the ordinary people that their savings are intact.  I said a long time ago in this House that the principal banks should be amalgamated and nationalised in one clean sweep, and Anglo Irish Bank let sink.  I wish we had done that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is one way out of this, and perhaps the Minister of State will comment on this.  We must punish those who gambled, those who got a higher rate of interest because of the risk involved.  When that risk arrived, we insured them against it, indemnifying them in order that they suffered not a jot.  Why not do what David McWilliams has suggested and have a share for equity exchange and let them take the pain?  That would get us off the hook; it would save &euro;160 billion.  The figures are unbelievable and I hope something of that sort will be tried.  This is a moment when we should stand up to these financial institutions and ensure it is not just the little people once again who take the pain and that some of the big interests are forced to take the pain.</P>
        <P>What has happened to moral hazard?  Why are the rules of the market suspended in favour of the biggest financial interests?  This is intolerable and unjustifiable.  We can sell a measure of fairness and clarity to the people but cannot and should not sell muddle and unfairness, which seem to still rest at the heart of the financial system.  I look forward to reviewing this when we have an opportunity to look at some of the details.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of those details illustrates the difficulty we face: the &euro;1 reduction in the national minimum wage.  That will hurt people, but this is precisely what was lobbied for by the restaurant industry, which needs it because it is in a bad situation.  As often, it is a judgment call and at least something has been done.  It will be difficult to defend against the mob.</P>
        <P>I find it extraordinary that every second person in this country is now an economist.  It took me a long time to get my head around any of these figures, and I do not understand some of them, but every second person knows the situation, knows the figures and can give a lecture on the circumstances.  That is because there is no confidence; people are not leaving it to their &ldquo;betters&rdquo; to work these things out and it is a sad day to have to say that.  I hope and trust we will get out of this situation.  We will get out of it because of our creativity and imagination and without much help from the international banking system.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the fact we are having this debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, which is important and timely.  Unlike Senator Norris, I think this is a serious debate because it is about a four-year plan that has failed to deliver.  Senator Norris was totally correct, however, that one of the <Col N="979"/>biggest mistakes of Fianna F&aacute;il under Deputy Bertie Ahern was to take away parliamentary scrutiny, particularly with regard to social partnership.  I was a strong advocate of social partnership but the Houses of the Oireachtas should have been a pillar of that process.</P>

	<P>Deputy Bertie Ahern and his cabal could not wait to bring everyone in and to dole out the goods.  They forgot about the rainy day.  This is a circle.</P>
        <P>I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, that the people must punish the political party that presided over all of this &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il.  The party must be punished electorally for all eternity.  Fianna F&aacute;il deserves never to be elected to any House ever again because the party has no interest beyond its own interest.  Fianna F&aacute;il has no interest in the people whatsoever.  The party has no respect for anything beyond getting elected.  The example of that lies on page 91 of the document, which states that the income tax base has been eroded to an unsustainable level and that this must be rectified if revenue raising capacity and fairness are to be<?oasys _jy ?>restored.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Today, on national television, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, refused to accept any responsibility or acknowledge that Fianna F&aacute;il had got it wrong.  He and his Cabinet colleagues sat for 13 years around the Cabinet table and presided over budget after budget which brought us to the mess we are in.  The Government forgot about regulation, let the banks run ragged and now the gn&aacute;thduine, the ordinary person, must pay.</P>
        <P>That is the reality.  Fianna F&aacute;il has bankrupted the country.  The Government was handed an economy in surplus in 1997.  In 13 years, Fianna F&aacute;il has done what no other Government has done, it has bankrupted the country.  On page 37 of the document, on social welfare, the plan states that the jobseeker rate of social welfare payment almost doubled between 2001 and 2009 before being reduced in the budget last year.  If that is not an indictment of Government policy, and its failure to place value on work, I do not know what it is.</P>
        <P>We have heard all about education and the smart economy from Ministers in this House.  The Government, however, has completely removed the opportunities for people to be upskilled or to enter education.  It is targeting people following courses in literacy, community education and Youthreach, the most vulnerable in our society.  The college graduates in medicine and engineering will always be with us, they will always prosper.  In my previous role as an adult education lecturer, however, I saw the difference in adults who went back to education and the number of young people who stayed in school because of Youthreach or the leaving certificate applied.  Those people have been dealt a severe blow tonight.</P>
        <P>What does the plan mean where it states that teachers and academic staff will work an additional one hour per week to provide for a wide range of needs in various institutions?  Where are the specifics?  On policing and defence, the document states that a more effective garda rostering system will ensure there are enough garda&iacute; to meet priority policing demands.  It was Fianna F&aacute;il that said there would be zero tolerance.  Is Fianna F&aacute;il now saying the plan to increase the number of garda&iacute; was wrong?  It beggars belief.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Page 118 of the plan deals with community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs.  It contains measures that target the most vulnerable.  We all accept there is no easy way but this is not a roadmap, it is a fudge.  The Minister for Finance has been wrong in every figure he has given.  I am no economist and I am no genius, but I listen and watch.  It is one thing to perform in front of a television camera as if one is in a court of law, but we are talking about ordinary people. <Col N="980"/> Everything has changed.  The budget and the finance Bill should be taken early and we must have a general election because the people want the Government out.  They have no confidence or belief in the Government and they do not trust it.  They see this plan and think it is another tale.  It is like a fairy tale but it is actually reality, because when they look in their pockets next month there will be little money there.  How can we believe the Government?</P>
        <P>This morning we woke up to talk of &euro;85 billion from the ECB.  Will that be enough?  There has been a run on the banks this week.  Senator MacSharry has probably had telephone calls, as I have, from people asking whether their money is safe.  These are ordinary people who trust, or did trust, the Government.  I met people in Donegal last weekend who asked me what they should do with their money.  Are we to tell them to take it out and dig it into a trench in the back garden or put it in an English bank or some other bank?  I have great respect for the Minister of State as a person, but the Government has led the people up to the hill and, unlike the Duke of York, it has just pushed them off.  It has bankrupted our country in 13 years through populism at its worst.  Its members have some nerve to stand before the people, but we live in a democracy and I am a democrat.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is a different model.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said on radio that any alternative plan was rubbish.  I cannot see any Green Party Members.  The Government party Members were talking about consensus for months.  In this House it was like the seventh decade of the rosary.  They said we must have consensus.  They did not listen when it came to the banks or the last two budgets, and they did not listen when they were preparing the four year plan, yet they want consensus.  The Government wants Fine Gael to vote for the budget next week, and then its backbenchers will go off to the four corners of the country and say they stood by the people, they did not cut the old age pension, but Fine Gael did.  The Minister for Finance changed all that with his comments.  He said that any alternative plan was rubbish.  This is from the man who has got it wrong so often.  He has not got one figure right.  I would love to see all the opinion writers who said he was the best Minister for Finance since the foundation of the State.  There was an avalanche.  He spoke in B&eacute;al na Bl&aacute;th.  He could nearly walk on water.  He has been wrong, wrong and wrong.</P>

	<P Just="Left">That shows what a great party we are.  We are not afraid.  Ours is a forward-looking party.  We have hope for the people and a vision for the future.  We have people who will govern and tell the people the truth.  They will not tell lies on a Sunday, attend a Cabinet meeting on a Tuesday and, when asked what happened, refuse to say because the markets are sensitive.  Does the Government really expect the people to tell it to carry on as normal?  It has been like a &ldquo;Carry On&rdquo; film.  Where is the renewal of Government?  Where is the job creation stimulus plan?  Where is the real reform of the public sector?  There is none.  It is penalising the people.  The markets and the people want certainty and confidence, but none has been given today or by the Government in the past 13 years. It is important we have certainty and confidence, but it is more important we have a Government that can govern with authority and that has a mandate.  Sadly, the current one is not giving us that.  We need a Government from this side of the House and I hope we will get one pretty soon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  My Adjournment matter relates to whether the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport intends to amend the Irish Sports Council Act 1999.  I wish to ascertain the criteria for defining what is and is not a sport.  I can fully understand that the Minister does not does not want to get directly involved in making such an adjudication, but I believe the legislation is deficient in its present form.  Some principles should be inserted into an amendment of the legislation to allow the Irish Sports Council to better define what is and is not a sport.  As of now there is too much emphasis on whether there is a physical aspect, whether it is an Olympic sport, and whether there is almost a televisual aspect to it.  When compared with how sports are defined elsewhere, this is a very narrow definition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">First, the legislation should specify that among the criteria the Irish Sports Council should use in deciding whether an activity should be defined as a sport is the question of participation and whether it is an activity in which many people take part and from which many get enjoyment.  Second is the question of agility and ability.  In most sporting activities this is taken to be physical agility and ability.  I argue that there are other aspects of the human character relating to a more rounded nature of who we are as people, and certainly mental agility and ability have as much reason to be considered as physical ability.  Third is the question of spin-off effects and other benefits from defining an activity as a sports activity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">By way of example I will cite what is defined in this country as a pastime but in other countries as a sport, which is chess.  Obviously it is not a physical activity but it requires a great deal of mental agility.  Of the 27 European Union member countries, 23 already define chess as a sports activity and two other European countries that are not part of the European Union, Norway and Iceland, could be added to that number.  It is an activity in which thousands of people take part.  It is not a televisual sport or an Olympic activity, although organised chess competitions are known as Olympiads.  Among the spin-off effects is that it fosters within young people in particular an ability that can be taken up in key subjects in our curriculum, subjects in which we are trying to improve the knowledge and ability of young people through our education system and in which if we had greater skills it would benefit the economy.  I am thinking mainly about maths and science subjects.  The way the activity is regarded in other countries is quite different from how we see it here.  If we had the type of recognition provided in other European countries, those who promote the activity in this country, the Irish Chess Union in particular, could encourage people to visit Ireland to take part in competitions to promote Ireland as a tourist destination.  We could get many benefits from just simply changing how we define something as a pastime or a sport. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">On these grounds the criteria used by the Irish Sports Council under the present legislation are far too narrow.  Giving the council almost total ability to decide the criteria for defining sports is not appropriate and the Minister, far from interfering in a process, could help in how we define other activities, not only chess, as sports by amending the legislation and allowing the criteria to be formed under certain identifiable characteristics.  If this were done, we would have a more effective Irish Sports Council and the Minister could fulfil her brief more appropriately, not only in the sports aspect of her Department, but also in terms of tourism, artistic expression and the cultural aspect.  Doing this would allow the Irish Sports Council to play a <Col N="982"/>more rounded role in promoting not only physical sports activities and those at the highest levels in those physical activities, but also what should be the real concept of sports activity, which is maximising participation and using that participation to give positive spin-off effects for the type of society in which we live.  On those grounds, I hope the Department and the Minister might be more open to amending the Irish Sports Council Act 1999.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Hanafin.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Sport plays a unique role in people's lives and never more so than in today's hectic environment.  Everywhere we go, we see thousands of people involved in playing, coaching and administering the demanding and often complex area of sport.  Active participation in sport and physical recreation contributes enormously to the physical and mental well-being of the individual and, by extension, of the entire community. Its value to the nation simply cannot be over-emphasised in raising our health levels, helping to give us a sense of ourselves and boosting our morale.  Sedentary lifestyles are widespread in Ireland and throughout the world.  The challenge now and for the foreseeable future is to extend people&rsquo;s health expectancy or years of life free from illness or disability.  There is a strong belief that sport has the potential to enrich the lives of all people and no one should feel that he or she could not benefit from physical activity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Physical activity can have important benefits, not just for the individual but also for society.  Sport can be promoted as an alternative to anti-social behaviour, but more than that, it develops the personal skills of individuals.  Values such as tolerance, self-discipline, team spirit and strength of character are demanded, practised and promoted.  In this way, sport serves as an indispensable educational tool in schools and colleges and in the wider community. Given the benefits associated with sports activities, the Government regards expenditure on sport as important for the social and economic development of the country.  As mentioned, these benefits arise in a wide range of areas, including health and well-being, social and cultural development, education, personal development, tourism and the economy.  It can also play a valuable role in tackling social exclusion, and this is particularly true for young people.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Sports Council has a statutory role in the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport.  The council is funded by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport and has received more than &euro;366 million in funding since it was set up in July 1999.  The allocation in 2010 is almost &euro;50 million.  The council was established on a statutory basis on 1 July 1999 and its functions are outlined in section 6 of the Irish Sports Council Act 1999.  The key functions are encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport; developing strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and co-ordinating their implementation by all Irish bodies involved in promoting recreational sport and providing recreational sport facilities; facilitating good standards of conduct and fair play in both competitive and recreational sport; combating doping in sport; initiating and encouraging research concerning competitive or recreational sport; and facilitating research and disseminating information concerning competitive or recreational sport.</P>
        <P>The two primary functions are the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive and recreational sport.  Section 6(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Irish Sports Council Act 1999 provides that one of the functions of the council is &ldquo;to encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport&rdquo;.  Section 6(1)(<i>b</i>) provides that the council has responsibility for developing &ldquo;strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and to co-ordinate their implementation by all bodies (including <Col N="983"/>public authorities and publicly funded bodies) involved in promoting recreational sport and providing recreational facilities&rdquo;.  In that regard, the Irish Sports Council has been central to developing sporting ability leading to high performance, while at the same time driving participation levels in conjunction with the national governing bodies of sport, local sports partnerships, the Irish Institute of Sport, Coaching Ireland and the Olympic and Paralympic Councils.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Specific elements of the participation strategy of which Senators may be aware which continue to be implemented by the Irish Sports Council include the development and implementation of the code of ethics and code of practice for children&rsquo;s sport in Ireland; the Bunt&uacute;s programme; the support of the national governing bodies of sport, including the three major field sports, the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU; the women in sport initiative; sports inclusion development officers and the go for life programme.  On the high performance front, the council initiatives include high performance funding and performance planning; the international carding scheme; the Team Ireland Golf Trust and the Irish Institute of Sport.</P>
        <P>The Minister informs me there are no plans to amend the legislation, but I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s comments to her attention for her consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The nature of the matter I raised was general because the Minister has no specific responsibility in deciding what is or is not a sports activity.  Given that the Minister of State has cited section 6(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) in terms of competitive and recreational activity, the content of my contribution refers to consideration of the need to be more specific in the Irish Sports Council Act and to allow the Irish Sports Council to define as sport activity in other countries which is defined as sport.  Perhaps he will bring this to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter, the proposed new special national school for St. Michael&rsquo;s House in south Dublin.  The special national school is located in two buildings, one on Grosvenor Road in Rathgar and the second in a couple of prefab units adjacent to Our Lady&rsquo;s national school in Ballinteer.  Both buildings provide a much needed service which is deeply appreciated by the parents of the children.  All of the parents to whom I have spoken have very positive regard for the opportunities the school provides for their children.  However, the buildings are old and their condition has deteriorated.  There is a genuine desire to bring both sets of pupils together and provide a more integrated, inclusive school.  The site for the proposed new school is the site in Ballinteer where the two prefabs are located.  The new school would be adjacent to Our Lady&rsquo;s national school which would give the special national school the advantage of being located alongside a mainstream school.  This would provide many opportunities for the pupils of both schools.</P>
        <P>The application was initially made to the Department in 2001 but the formal application was received and placed on the priority building list in 2006.  Perhaps the Minister of State could give an update on whether the project remains on the priority building list and the estimated timeframe for it to proceed.  Obviously, when work starts on the site in Ballinteer, it will be necessary for the schools to be relocated elsewhere during that period.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for the assistance the Department has provided for St. Michael&rsquo;s House so far.  It has agreed to provide funding to rent an alternative purpose built premises in Leopardstown, into which the pupils on Grosvenor Road and in Ballinteer will be able to move shortly, with the Department&rsquo;s agreement, and in which the school will be able to commence providing the education service.  This will provide an opportunity to start building the new <Col N="984"/>school in Ballinteer as the site will be vacated when the schools move into the new premises in Leopardstown.  I would appreciate an update from the Minister of State on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan, who, unfortunately, cannot be here today.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position on St. Michael&rsquo;s House special school.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, all applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity and so forth, leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where there is none currently but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.</P>
        <P>Each band rating has a number of subcategories which more specifically describe the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.  The application from St. Michael&rsquo;s House special school has been assigned a band 1.2 rating.  This band rating reflects the nature of the project, providing accommodation for children with special educational needs.  As such, the project was prioritised for progression in 2010.</P>
        <P>The Senator will be aware that the project was one of the school building projects announced by the then Minister for Education and Science in February to begin the design process and proceed to appoint a design team for a new school in the last quarter of the year.  In this regard, officials from the Department met representatives of the school authority at the proposed site for the new school recently.  The site is considered generally suitable for the proposed development.  The representatives were informed that the next step in the process would be the appointment of a design team and that the Department would be in contact with it in this context in due course.</P>
        <P>The Senator will appreciate that the extent of the demand on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget is enormous providing, as it does, accommodation for new communities and modernising existing schools.  However, huge inroads have been made into addressing these needs.  I again thank the Senator for raising the matter and assure her the T&aacute;naiste is committed to meeting the needs of St. Michael&rsquo;s House special school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his positive response.  I welcome the fact that the next step in the process will be the appointment of a design team.  The Minister of State did not say exactly when that will happen, but he did say it will take place before the end of the year.</P>
