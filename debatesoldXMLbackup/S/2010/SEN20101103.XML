    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I announce the Order of Business, on my own behalf and that of the House, I extend deepest sympathy to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, and his wife, Mary, on the tragic loss of their daughter.  It is a very sad time for them and their family.</P>
        <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the current overcrowding levels in Irish prisons, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 2 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for eight minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from leaders or spokespersons; No. 2, Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) (Amendment) Bill 2008 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 but not before 3.15 p.m. and conclude not later than 5 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for eight minutes and all other Senators for five minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon to reply ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate; and No. 32, Private Members&rsquo; business, motion No. 17 on Seanad reform, to be taken at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.  The business of the House will be interrupted between 2 p.m. and 3.15 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Leader in extending our sympathy and condolences to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, and his wife on the devastating loss of their young daughter.  I know the Cathaoirleach attended the funeral yesterday and no words of ours could offer comfort or capture the grief the family must be feeling.  They are in our thoughts at this very difficult time for them.</P>
        <P>I would like to raise two issues.  The first is the date of the budget.  I understood from the Deputy Leader of the House yesterday there was a possibility the budget would be moved forward.  Yesterday the Taoiseach talked about 7 December again.  It is important there is clarity about this because many people are very concerned about the impact this budget will have on their lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the education cuts discussed today on the pages of <i>The Irish Times</i> and elsewhere where we read that cuts to special needs staff are being proposed and several hundred of the 10,000 special needs posts are under threat, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills to attend the House today to discuss the impact of the budget on the education sector.  It is critical, as Senator MacSharry stated previously, that we discuss in this House, by sector and by Department, the choices and tough decisions that will have to be made.  It is also critical that we discuss the impact of these cuts.  There is discussion about class size and about the pupil-teacher ratio being increased again.  There is discussion about cutbacks to special needs and about college registration fees.  There was research yesterday showing that families are finding it very difficult to pay college registration fees as they stand.  It is essential that we discuss these issues in this House and that the views of every Senator are heard on this critical issue of education.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If cutbacks to education, especially early education, have a devastating impact, not only on individuals but on the economy, and if we are talking about a smart <Col N="405"/>economy and ensuring people will be able to take up opportunities when they arise, we need to be very careful about the kind of decisions that are made in the lead-up to and in the budget.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills to come into the House today to begin this discussion by sector on the budget decisions that will be taken in the next few weeks which will have such a key impact on individuals and families and on the health of the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my two colleagues about extending our sympathy to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, but it is a little awkward to deal with it for the following reason, and I am not saying this in a political manner.  I am sure we all share that viewpoint, but can we take it that in situations such as this, the Leader would speak on our behalf to some extent so that everyone can be part of that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Otherwise, it seems as if some Members refer to it and others do not.  I would appreciate it.  I am aware of the genuine feelings of Members on it but I just want to make that point.</P>
        <P>The amendment to the Order of Business which has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is something that the Leader should take seriously, and not just on the basis of the issue in question.  I have been saying in the House over recent months that we need in the community clarity of objectives and certainties on which we can depend.  If we know what it is we are trying to achieve, we can all find a way to do that.  It is not necessary for the Opposition to agree cravenly with the Government&rsquo;s views on it but, as has been stated on both sides of the House, there is no point in the Government side asking Labour, Fine Gael, the Independents and others to outline their views if the Government does not create the opportunity to do it.  This is the opportunity to do it.  We all are clear on the overall objective of cuts and perhaps we can be clear on job savings as well.  Let us now look at where our priorities should be within each section.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The importance of this is not merely for the issues of clarity and certainties which I mentioned, but also in order that we can assess what is working.  On the question of old age pensions, for example, pensions have saved people from poverty and, to that extent, the system works very well and any movement towards reducing pensions should be made in that context of what we want as a society.  It is similar with education.  This is a positive, progressive and helpful proposal by Senator Fitzgerald.  I urge the Leader to take it on board in order that we can deal with these and with every sector in the same way, not in any great discussion about what the Government has done for the past ten years but simply to state the objective, what we are trying to achieve in this Department, the budget in the Department for next year and how the Government proposes to deal with it.  It could be helpful to the Government as well as to the rest of us.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will finish up on an issue which I have raised in the House on three or four occasions and which Members on both sides and in all parties of the House have raised, namely the question of the 116000 telephone number for missing children.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has been dealing with this over three different meetings.  We still do not know Government policy on this.  We were told today that the Garda does not have any strong view that we need such a number.  We are being told by the Department of Health and Children that there is a better use of resources than to put it into a missing child helpline.  If that is the case, we have been misled in this House.  We were under the impression the Government was in favour of the establishment of that number but that at this stage it was not able to put it in place for want of resources or otherwise.  We are also aware that the ISPCC <Col N="406"/>and One Child International have offered to operate this number for free if the Government supports them in bringing to every house in Ireland the outline of how to recognise child abuse and to guard against it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I also express my deepest sympathies to the Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and his family on the very sad death of his daughter at the weekend.</P>
        <P>In the United States yesterday, as we have seen overnight on the news, there has been another change election.  From my perspective, I am sorry to see that there would appear to have been a sharp shift to the right in American politics on foot of this election.  Much of what we have seen happening in the United States in recent weeks has some resonance in this country because there are many candidates in those elections who appear to think that the way forward for a modern democracy and modern economy is to cut, slash and emasculate the state and cut the heart out of public services.  That has been elevated almost into a political mantra in the United States.  It is not as if it is something new, but certainly it has come back very much as a major agenda item in that country.</P>
        <P>It has resonance in this country.  Unfortunately, there are many people in the debate in our country who seem to think that all we must do is to cut the heart out of the State and out of public services, and have the kind of effect on public services and public entitlements to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred a moment ago, for example, those who hold pensions.</P>
        <P>There is a genuine concern, shared by me and my party, about areas of waste in public services.  We must look at that and consider it carefully.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposal also, very much in the spirit of what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said.  Can we begin to have a debate on public services about what we want to have in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;not what we want to cut?  I refer to this indiscriminate slashing of the knife for two or three weeks in public before a budget.  Can we sit down and work out what we cherish, what we want to have and what is worth keeping, rather than taking the debate from the other perspective?  That would be a useful exercise for us to undertake here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the areas that we should consider as part of that debate is education.  I have made the point in this House previously that we all have areas that we will say in the debate that we want to see preserved.  It must be the case - I believe this to be the position of the Green Party - that education at all levels is an area which should be preserved, nurtured and fostered; it would be a terrible pity if the Green Party was to abandon its previously stated position, for example, on third level fees or the introduction of third level fees by stealth through a hugely increased registration fee.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is easy enough to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It happened in last year&rsquo;s budget.</P>

	<P>Another one is coming.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="407"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is easy enough to say about education that there are many who can afford a higher registration fee and perhaps it is the case that most Members in this Chamber could afford a higher registration fee for their children.  That is not the point.  The point is that higher education should not be the preserve of the well-off.  We have made a commitment to higher education and education at all levels, that it is not a commodity to be parcelled up and sold off to the highest bidder and that it is something we believe all children and all young people should have access to irrespective of the wealth of their parents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is an interesting debate on whether we have the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills in here to discuss what cannot be cut and in some respects I agree with Senator Alex White that we need a debate on what we cannot afford not to have.  Between the two positions, of what cannot be cut and what we cannot afford not to cut, is what can we afford.  Therefore, in any debate we have with any Minister we have to be able to state that while we do not want one particular cut something else can be cut.  We cannot object to every cut while at the same time state we have to save money.  We cannot be pro the Croke Park agreement and state there cannot be change.  It seems to be very easy to fight both sides of a particular fence, depending on what day or hour of the day it is, and a debate that is honest about what we cannot do without&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  Bang on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and how we achieve it and how we can afford it is a much more important debate that we need to have.</P>
        <P>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to examine an issue which I raised last year.  It is sensible that when people fill out forms for going to college they would fill out forms for grant applications at the same time so all of their administration happens together and they can then focus on academic matters.  This happened a bit and I would like it to continue.  It would ease the pressure on VECs, local authorities and everyone else processing these applications at present.  By next year we should not have a situation whereby grants are processed but then sit for a month prior to a batch of grants being given out, as is happening at present.  Issues in administration need to be dealt with to ease the situation for students.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have had conversations with a number of people in my constituency about how out of touch politicians are with people on the ground.  I noted that when Mr. Cameron took power in the UK he immediately got rid of the state cars for Ministers living in the London area.  I know that of the &euro;15 billion we have to find it would be a small drop in the ocean but it would be a symbol and it is vital that we show solidarity and leadership and give example to the people we expect to have to deal with the most austere cuts on 7 December, if that is when it will happen.</P>
        <P>A lady commented to me that the on their way to the meeting in Farmleigh the Ministers barely opened the car windows two inches to speak through their teeth to reporters.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I call for a debate on the way the media report the various numbers and figures we throw out here and which are being thrown out generally.  At the weekend, one particular newspaper reported that the State owed a quarter of a trillion, no less &mdash; that is &mdash; &euro;260 billion to the European Central Bank.  In many cases, the figures being thrown out are utterly irresponsible and there seems to be a race to the bottom to show bigger and bigger figures and that the country is in debt.  Many of those figures are secured on the other side of the balance sheet but this is never mentioned.  I hear from many people that they are getting fed up with all of the numbers because they cannot understand what the hell they are all about and they are not adequately explained in the media.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>They will understand them for generations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope they do.</P>
        <P>Many irresponsible figures are tossed out here.  I seemed to have heard Senator McFadden state that &euro;15 billion is not a large figure.  I certainly think &euro;15 billion is a large figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.  I stated the symbolic gesture of getting rid of the cars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to be careful how it is reported because so many people are turning off at this stage from all the figures that are thrown out.  It is absolutely irresponsible to state this nation is in a state of chaos when, in fact, exports have reached a record high.  It is possible for us to get out of the situation we are in but we have to be careful and prudent about the figures which we throw out.  Therefore, it is important that we have a debate on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to point out, as most Members are aware, a very large march on Leinster House will take place today with perhaps 20,000 or 25,000 students.  I know all politicians are coming under pressure about special pleading at present, particularly on education, hospitals and every particular area.  There is a tendency when we talk about expenditure on education to look on it as current expenditure and to look at an increase in fees, which is the intention, as current expenditure.  This is a fairly refined distinction which suits people and suits a certain agenda.  Education is a matter, to a large extent, of capital expenditure.  It is an investment in the future of Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We should note one thing, and it is not necessarily palatable to Members of the House, but much of what we have left in this economy &mdash; the engine of this economy &mdash; is down to multinationals.  The energy in this economy at present is down to multinationals as is much of the hope in the economy.  They will seek two things: the retention or reduction of the rate of corporate tax and an educated workforce.  If they see the message go out from here today that we will increase fees and make it impossible for people who do not have enough money to get an education they will state that Ireland does not offer the same assets, opportunities and talented young people and they will not come here.  This is the light in which <Col N="409"/>we should look at the proposed increases in fees or registration fees.  If we increase them and reduce the talent pool on offer &mdash; I do not mean only to multinationals but also to entrepreneurs &mdash; to those who are here or those who are proven to be doing the economy good we will see less of them coming and we will see one of the great hopes of recovery being removed.  It is in that light, and not just as a pressure group, that we should see the protest today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposal made yesterday by Senator James Carroll for a reduction in VAT on energy-saving domestic and commercial development.  At present, 6,500 people are employed in this sector.  I would also like to see double glazed windows included in the proposal for upgrading houses.  A total of 1 million houses need to be done and there is &euro;10 billion for developing this.  By reducing VAT and including double glazed windows we could increase our workforce by another 6,500 people.  This is a huge amount of people to take off the unemployment register.  We should do so in the budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to all Members to attend a meeting to be held on Wednesday, 10 November, with the Spirit of Ireland Group.  Approximately &euro;6 billion worth of oil and gas exports leave the country each year and we do not guarantee this.  This company is now ready to introduce a new system and secure our hydro and wind energy systems, create many needed jobs and make us more competitive.  This is the type of company which we want to support over the coming years.  We need these developments to move away from our dependence on gas and oil. We could also ensure that we are an energy exporting country.</P>

       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s timely motion on the need for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House before the budget.  Senator Ross also spelled it out.  Yesterday I attended an OECD meeting about education being fundamental to enhancing growth in our economies.  The clear message was that education should not be cut, that neither preschool, primary nor secondary should be touched and if third level education is to be touched, loans must be facilitated.  We need to cop on in this country and in this House but particularly the Government needs to cop on.  The problem is that we do not know what the priorities for growth should be.  We do not educate for the sake of education; we educate for economic and social progress.  The facts show that everywhere economies grow, they are linked with high learning outcomes.  We need a second debate on how well we are doing with regard to learning outcomes because we are doing poorly at the top and poorly at the bottom and we are pretty good in the middle.  This is the reason we are averaging out.  However, we do not have the top graduates for the big posts which is why Google has to employ people from abroad, and we have 17% falling off the wagon by leaving school early.  Above all, the message from the OECD was that we need to set our objectives as a nation beyond budgets and beyond elections.  We need to know what is good for our country and for our nation in order to save our people.</P>

It is imperative that the Minister comes to the House.

	<P Just="Left">I assure Senator Healy Eames that this Government and the Greens within it certainly appreciate the importance of education and the need for it to be at the heart of any economic recovery and the need to keep the cost of entry into third level education as low as is humanly possible.  There is no doubt that the registration fee increases have made it difficult for some and that further increases will make it more difficult.  Therefore, they need to be kept as low as is humanly possible.  The non-introduction of tuition fees is part of the programme for Government.  Everybody understands this cannot be cast aside willy-nilly.  I agree with Senator Ross that in large part, this is an investment in human capital and could be considered as capital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, to the House to talk about the essential area of support for people in receipt of the addiction services around the country.  This issue is very close to my heart and one which the Minister and myself have worked on in a collegial manner.  I know he understands how vulnerable people in addiction are and therefore how the front line services provided efficiently by the community and voluntary sector ought to be protected.  I would welcome the opportunity for the Minister to come to the House to speak about the provision of resourcing to the community and voluntary sector in the area of addiction counselling and addiction services generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>As we face a budget, none of us is in any doubt about how difficult it will be.  One thing also not in question is that the categories of people who will suffer most will be students, pensioners and the unemployed.  I am not an economist but we all know that by abolishing the Christmas bonus last year, the Minister contributed to a reduction in domestic demand which is killing the lifeblood of rural economies.  The money in the Christmas bonus would have been spent in local economies throughout the country, particularly in rural economies.  The loss of the bonus was a retrograde step because that money was not being put into a biscuit tin or being saved in a bank but rather it was being spent in local economies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader why it is taking so long for the Government to ensure that prosecutions will follow those who, in the view of most reasonable people, are responsible for the near collapse of our economy.  As the budget draws near and as Senator Ross correctly pointed out, we will see thousands of students demonstrating outside this House today about the proposal that registration fees will increase from &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,500.  This might not seem like a lot of money to some people around here but &euro;1,000 is a hell of a lot of money for a person depending on welfare or a student trying to become a graduate who will then be working and paying tax at a higher level.  This money is reinvested.  I speak as a member of the party whose Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, abolished third level fees.  This was a significant decision which allowed thousands of people from less well-off backgrounds to go to college.</P>
        <P>In submitting a list of assets and liabilities to the High Court this week, an individual whom I will not name but who is known to everybody and particularly known to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, forgot to mention that he had a pension pot of &euro;28 million.  The same individual has assets of &euro;13 million.  In this context the Government is proposing to take more money off old-age <Col N="411"/>pensioners, to take more money off people who are looking for non-existent jobs and who are depending on a welfare rate of &euro;190 a week.  When will we see people in jail to pay for the criminality in which they engaged and which has brought the country to its knees?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad Senator Ross raised the issue of the student demonstration today.  I remind the House that in 1997 when Tony Blair was campaigning to become Prime Minister, he said his government had three priorities: education, education and education.  Yesterday I had the privilege of attending my daughter&rsquo;s graduation ceremony at DCU, along with over 1,000 students, bright, happy and confident, as youth invariably expresses itself.  The ceremony was aided by an inspiring speech by the president of DCU, Brian McGrath, in which he spoke about the glass being half full rather than half empty.  He outlined the job opportunities for DCU students and the fact that it is one of the top universities in Europe and one of the top universities in Ireland for job creation.  I could not help but contrast that speech with the fact that 25,000 students will be on the streets today protesting, as students have the right to do and have traditionally done over decades, about the cost of education.  I could not help but reflect that the Croke Park deal is protecting the income of 370,000 workers, including teachers, over the next four years and that one of those teaching unions has remained outside that process while, at the same time, students are protesting, rightly so, about what they regard as an increase.</P>
        <P>Three of my children have gone on to third level education, of whom two are still there, one is job-seeking and a fourth child will be going to third level in the next two years.  As a parent rather than as a politician, I do not need any lectures from people about the cost of third level education but we will bear that burden, as every other parent has borne it and will continue to bear it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">However, if 85% of the education budget is going on staff wages, that leaves 15% annually, irrespective of what Government is in power, and this will be the reality to be faced.  It may be time that teachers started thinking about making some sacrifices instead of crying crocodile tears about holding onto their special posts of responsibility, of refusing to give up an hour at the end of the day.  If I am a little emotional about the attitude of teachers, it is because I am a parent and I know the reality of it.  I ask the Leader to embrace what has been said here and invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House to outline her priorities for education in the future.</P>

	<P>I congratulate my colleague, Senator Pearse Doherty, who I understand has won his action and that this will precipitate a by-election.  I hope it also precipitates a general election which this country needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Mooney that there will be 15,000 to 20,000 young people outside the gates of the House today and I congratulate them on their organisation.  I believe in a free universally accessible education system just as I believe in a free universally accessible health system.  However, my heart goes out to the young people I heard on radio this morning who are motivated to go to university but whose parents had never been and are not well paid.  Now they realise they will not get there.  I feel bad for them because they will now be caught in a pincer movement being deprived of a third level education at a time when the jobs market is contracting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is much dishonesty in this House.  Free fees is an ugly, stupid phrase and it is an oxymoron.  It was a cruel and cynical political deception and it never existed.  One either pays fees or gets a free education.  One cannot have it both ways.  That might be an unpalatable <Col N="412"/>truth but I have had regular meetings over the past five to ten years with student leaders and I have told them this because I knew where the real battle was.  The real battle will be to concentrate resources on young people like the ones I heard on radio this morning.</P>
        <P>Currently, it costs &euro;1,500 to register.  Is that a fee or not?  It is certainly paid and it will go up to &euro;3,000.  The Green Party has moderated its position and apparently will accept &euro;2,500.  I met the students in UCD where it costs &euro;4,500 for student accommodation for those coming from the country.  They must also pay for subsistence and books.  One is then very quickly reaching &euro;12,000 or &euro;15,000.  How will people with one parent working or parents out of work be able to pay?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share the concern of others about our smart economy and educated young people.  I spoke at the Institute of European Affairs last week.  There was a young woman there who was in a class of 200 two years ago which is down to 12 this year.  That is what is happening to our education system.</P>

	<P>The Leader has ordered the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) (Amendment) Bill 2008 from 3.15 p.m. to 5 p.m.  Is it his intention to roll over this debate on the basis that he told us the week before last that there were so many speakers, it could not be dealt with that day?  What is his intention in regard to Second Stage today?</P>
        <P>The Government is now prepared to make more focused forecasts and sharpen the range of figures available to the Opposition in regard to the budgetary situation and the four year plan.  We all appreciate we must close the gap between what we spend and take in.  When that information is made available, it would be helpful if this House could debate the economy.  We must be calm and dispassionate.  This House is perhaps more capable of being reflective and it could maybe minimise the differences.  We all know what we must achieve but how we do so is the difficulty.  It would be helpful if we could have such a debate when the information is made available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Alex White in calling for a debate on the role of Government.  The mid-term elections in America indicated a very clear feeling among people, which I believe would be replicated here, that they want a debate on what it wants Government to do and on its role.</P>
        <P>Cutting expenditure must not be the sole job of Government.  We must have a debate on what Government should do, the services it provides and the people it must look after.  The Leader should remember there are people who cannot look after themselves and who require the State to do so.  That is why we must have a debate on what the Government does.  I am very much in favour of the elimination of waste and creating efficiencies but we must remember our job is, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, to look after people when they cannot do so themselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like Senator Fitzgerald, I call for a debate on education.  If we are to become immersed in the smart economy, then cuts to education at any level are wrong.  If we are to make education the launch pad from which to rebuild Ireland, the Government must be honest with the people in regard to it.</P>
        <P>I totally disagree with Senator Mooney&rsquo;s comments on teachers.  Thousands of teachers do not leave school until well into the evening and give their time voluntarily and look after their <Col N="413"/>students.  It is wrong to pigeon-hole teachers in the way he did.  Senator Mooney also paraphrased Tony Blair.  Will the Leader comment on the mantra of Fianna F&aacute;il which is to remain in power?</P>
      <P>The bottom line is that we need a general election and Senator Doherty&rsquo;s High Court action result is an indication that there has been an unreasonable delay in holding the by-election.  The Irish people are not waiting in the long grass or in the short grass but they are waiting for the Government.</P>

	<P>Yesterday the Deputy Leader told us we would have plenty of opportunity to debate the budget and the economy over the next few weeks.  All the talk is that the budget will be so severe that everything will be on the table.  Will the Leader make a particular effort to ensure we look at high earners versus low earners?  There is a huge difference in the day-to-day life of somebody earning &euro;30,000 and giving up 10% of it and somebody earning &euro;300,000 and giving up 10% of it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a group of workers in this State earning very generous salaries and protected by the Constitution.  I was disappointed to learn that not all have stepped up to the mark and offered a voluntary contribution.  Can we debate that particular group, which I will not name?

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>We should have a detailed debate on education today.  Education is the one vehicle to create equality of opportunity and to achieve economic recovery.  The proposal to double or almost double the registration fee is very dangerous and is not the right place to look for money.  It will act has a huge barrier to access to education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many families with whom we deal on a day-to-day basis are in extraordinarily tight positions and will simply not be able to meet a doubling of the registration fee.  It will mean that education will return to the situation which obtained when we were children, when it was the preserve of a certain class and group of people. There are two things wrong with that.  The first is the inequality and injustice of it and the second is the great resource which will be missing when we seek to recover and grow our economy into the future.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Many other areas could be looked at in terms of the administration of the university system.  There have even been notable and well-documented cases of excessive salaries at the top of the university pyramid.  We can look at many areas but not at preventing access to university by our brightest and best.  With the collapse of the building industry and many other sectors, the only inheritance and empowerment parents throughout the country can pass on to their children, despite the level of unemployment, is an education to give them dignity and fulfilment as a person and to equip them to avail of future economic opportunities.  We need to have a debate on education and to knock on the head immediately the notion that a barrier to entry to college may be put in place.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join colleagues who have called for a debate on education.  Some 15,000 to 20,000 students will demonstrate outside these Houses today and they are welcome to do so.  As a nation, we do not pay water charges or domestic rates, we pay registration fees but we do not pay university fees and we pay child care benefits and State pensions to the super wealthy.  This is unsustainable.  Far from trying to prevent those who are less well off from securing a university education, it is essential that we begin to charge university fees for those who can pay, not to eliminate the possibility of such an education for those who cannot afford to go to university but to ensure resources are available to give equal opportunities to those people who heretofore could not afford to compete with the super wealthy and pay the &euro;9,000 per year to go to university.  It is time that people who can afford to pay a contribution towards this did so.  It is unsustainable that we continue to support the super wealthy and upper middle classes by offering levels of entitlement that are completely unsustainable.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I want to raise a subject that has not been touched on so far: that of the recent European Council meeting at which the Taoiseach and leaders of other countries met and at which agreement was forged regarding a new way in which nations need to conduct their finances and economic policies.  The famous Stability and Growth Pact, which was shown to be nothing of the sort, is now being strengthened.  There will now be new conditions upon which countries can make decisions and new rules they will have to obey.  I welcome such constraints and that kind of environment but it will have a major effect on how countries such as ours conduct their affairs in the future.  It seems odd that decisions of that magnitude have been met by silence within our political system.  They merit debate.</P>
        <P>The point made about the future funding of third level education is a principle that must be obeyed.  In terms of taxation, the principle is age old that people must be asked to pay according to their means.  If they do not have the means, they should not be asked to pay.  That is a simple principle of we cannot lose sight in these times.</P>
        <P>I refer to the mid-term elections in the United States on which some of my colleagues touched.  What we saw happen in the United States last night is what we saw happen in 1982, 1992 and 2002.  I take a far more positive message from it than many others, that vast unbridled wealth, combined with a sinister agenda, does not always buy one success in politics.  We saw that happen in some electoral races in the United States.  It must give hope to many people of more modest means who are represented in this House.</P>

	<P>This time last year thousands of people protested outside Leinster against the possibility of reducing State pensions.  I speak again in defence of older people and those in receipt of State pensions.  The State pension is a fundamental cornerstone of our <Col N="415"/>society on which we should all be able to rely.  We all contribute towards this basic lifeline not only through PRSI and income tax but through the essential roles we play in our society, communities and families.  Today&rsquo;s older people not only supported their parents&rsquo; generation but also provided for the education and health needs of those of our people working today.  Older people continue to contribute in volunteering, caring for partners and grandchildren and running local community organisations and groups.  These contributions, though unpaid, have enormous value.  If they were not voluntarily made, they would cost the State millions of euro.</P>
         <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The Government should beware of grey power.  Last year 15,000 people marched outside the gates of Leinster House to protest against the political blunder of the removal of the medical card.  This generation of older people, as I said yesterday morning, are more self-confident, more ambitious and more conscious of their rights.  The Government, at its peril, will touch the State pension.  It keeps 84% of people over the age of 65 out of poverty.  Most people over the age of 65 are dependent on State pensions and transfers for their welfare.</P>

	<P>This House has won considerable kudos in recent weeks, particularly on the Order of Business which has been dominated by the economic situation and the forthcoming budget.  The debate here is exceptionally balanced and good.  As is inevitable at a time like this, various interests will rise to the top.  This morning the issue seems to be education.  Another morning it was health, another day it will be social welfare and so on.  That is understandable but it also poses the question of how we balance all those interests.  That is a challenge we face.  If the Government decides on a single theme in the forthcoming budget, namely, that those who can pay should pay and that those who need assistance should be focused on, that is the only hope we have of creating unity in this country at present.</P>
        <P>I have been observing what has been happening in Greece, as have many other Members.  We see people on the sidelines who are waiting for opportunities to create chaos and anarchy.  The only hope we have is for people in this House and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to work together in manner that I now see emerging.  I have listened especially to contributions made by those in the Fine Gael Party in recent weeks and I have heard several good speeches, which clearly indicate that we have achieved a good deal through the debates in this House.  Matters may not be necessarily be clear at this stage but they will be clear on budget day.  It is not a matter of &ldquo;if&rdquo; or &ldquo;or&rdquo; but of having a single theme, which is that we should help the vulnerable and that those who can pay should be generous and forthcoming and it should be legislated for in the provisions of the forthcoming budget in December that who can pay should pay.</P>

As she indicated, the State pension is a lifeline for older persons whose participation in voluntary organisations and groups in their retirement years is crucial.

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad to have the opportunity to address the Seanad on this important topic.  How we deal with offending behaviour in all its guises and protect the public is a test of us as a society.  Protecting victims, encouraging change in offenders and ultimately increasing public safety is a key role for me as Minister.  At a time of increased pressure on resources and staffing we must strive to look at ways of increasing efficiency and ensuring that as far as possible we continue to provide offenders with opportunities within the prison system to look at their individual road to offending, to help them change through meaningful offence-focused work and to prepare them for release back to the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are all familiar with the issue of overcrowding in our prisons and the effect that has on the prison system, for prisoners themselves and for prison management and staff.  There is no easy solution as to how we manage our increasing prisoner population.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For my part as Minister I am determined, within the budgetary constraints upon us all, that we will take all reasonable steps to deal with these issues.  As I have said before, my first concern as Minister for Justice and Law Reform is public safety.  In that regard, the fact that the number of serious criminals behind bars serving two years imprisonment or more increased by over 600 between 2007 and 2009 is a cause for commendation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whose vigilance and dedication to duty has resulted in the arrest and successful prosecution of these offenders.  This trend has continued in 2010.  I am heartened by the recent crime statistics published last week by the Central Statistics Office which show a continuation of the positive trends in the second quarter and reflect the Government&rsquo;s initiatives for tackling crime and the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I said then, the Commissioner and I are determined that this work will continue.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have acknowledged on many occasions that our prisoner numbers have increased quite significantly in more recent years.  Indeed, this situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 437.  This represents an 11% increase in the numbers in custody.  This increase can be traced back to a number of factors including increased Garda activity due to the large increase in Garda numbers in the last four or five years, increased courts sittings and an element of longer custodial sentences.  To put it another way, it can be traced to the efforts of the Government to give garda&iacute; and the courts the tools to do their job: strong legislative measures on the one hand and more resources on the other.</P>
        <P>It is, of course, accepted that the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the courts.  They cannot put up a No Vacancies sign.  There is no option of refusing committals.  As of 2 November 2010, there were 4,416 beds available in the prison system.  On the same date there were 4,408 prisoners in custody.  This represents an occupancy total of 100%.  Despite the significant increase in prison spaces we are operating at our bed capacity at this time.  Let me put this in context.  In 2005, the average number in custody was 3,151, but by 2009 this had increased to 3,881.</P>
      
        <P>All sides of the House will accept that this has put a lot of strain on the prison system.  That is why I am determined to push ahead with a twin-track approach by continuing to add high quality prison spaces to the prison estate and to look at innovative ways to expand the use of non-custodial options.  More than 80% of the sentenced prisoner population in custody are serving sentences of 12 months or more.  In Mountjoy Prison alone, only 5% of prisoners, to my recollection, are serving sentences of less than 12 months.  It would, therefore, be grossly <Col N="419"/>misleading to suggest prison overcrowding is caused by the imprisonment of minor offenders or that the problems can be solved overnight by the greater use of alternatives to custody.  We must be realistic and acknowledge that the imprisonment option, based on the seriousness of the offence, must always be seen as a key plank of our overall criminal justice policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let me turn to the issue of prison overcrowding.  To begin with, the issue is not unique to this jurisdiction; rather, it is an international issue that has been widely acknowledged, including by the Inspector of Prisons.  As Members will know, Ireland traditionally has had a low rate of imprisonment.  The Council of Europe annual penal statistics measure imprisonment rates by prison population per 100,000 inhabitants and the European average is approximately 109 prisoners per 100,000 inhabitants.  In 2008, the latest year for which full statistics are available, Ireland had a rate of 84.8, well below the average figure.  The United Kingdom, for example, had a rate of 152.8, well above the average figure.  Based on these data, we are below most western European countries other than the Scandinavian countries.  The latest Council of Europe penal statistics show that Belgium &mdash; 125%, France &mdash; 131%, Italy &mdash; 130%, and Spain &mdash; 141%, all have more severe levels of overcrowding than Ireland.  The imprisonment rate in the USA is around 700 per 100,000 inhabitants.  However, it is also true to state that as our prison numbers increase, so too will our position on the table change, a point of which I am very conscious.</P>
        <P>As I have said before, there is no doubting the fact that the extensive investment in the criminal justice system, with extra garda&iacute;, the number of whom has risen from 12,000 four or five years ago to an all-time high of 14,600 today, has had a huge effect on the increase in the numbers going to prison.  There is also the targeting of criminal gangs, the appointment of additional judges and the creation of more court venues.  All of these developments have led to a significant growth in the numbers of offenders coming into the prison system.</P>
        <P>I return to the earlier statistic which is worth keeping in our minds, namely, that approximately 80% of the prison population are serving sentences of 12 months or more.  We may ask what this stark statistic tells us.  It clearly shows that the vast bulk of the prison population is made up of offenders who have been convicted of more serious offences.  The courts which are independent in their functions deal with each case on the facts and the sentence imposed in any case, following a finding of guilt, is entirely a matter for the Judiciary.  For my part, releasing serious offenders onto the streets is not an option.  Public protection and safety must be paramount.  Some say there are many in prison who should not be there.  The statistic of 80% of the prison population serving sentences of 12 months or more clearly indicates the vast majority of those in prison are serious offenders.  I repeat public protection and safety must be paramount.</P>
        <P>The track record on capital investment shows there was a lack of investment in the prison estate for many years.  I am glad we have put much needed funds into improving our prisons.  The Government has committed significant resources to an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  I can only speak for the time I have been in government as a Minister.  Since 1997, when I first became a Minister, close to 1,920 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system, which is in stark contrast with the fact that no prison spaces were provided by the preceding Government.  That indicates its priorities at the time.  While the two main parties opposite will criticise us for the overcrowding in prisons today, the record speaks for itself.  The Governments of which I have been a member have invested heavily in the provision of new prison spaces.  While we have been criticised for closing some prisons, they were closed for good reasons because they were not fit for purpose; they were Dickensian.  We have provided 1,920 new prison spaces since 1997, whereas, I repeat, the Government in office prior to 1997 did not build even one prison cell.</P><Col N="420"/>
        <P Just="Left">The new prisons we have built include the Midlands and Cloverhill prisons and the D&oacute;chas Centre.  We have also provided new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise and Castlerea prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  Only three weeks ago I had the pleasure of opening a new cell block in Wheatfield Prison to provide an additional 176 new cells, with the potential to accommodate in excess of 200 prisoners.  Anyone who visits that prison, including a member of a prison visiting committee or a Member of the Oireachtas, will be proud of the investment made in it by the taxpayer.  It is state-of-the-art and, unlike the prisons in place during the years, has not been amended and changed.  It is a credit to all those involved.  The new accommodation block will allow the prison to accommodate 650 prisoners.  By any stretch of the imagination, particularly in these difficult economic times, this is a significant investment to improve and modernise our prisons.  It is also an indication, if one was needed, of the Government&rsquo;s determination to meet the challenges faced.  When I was in Italy some time back, I had the opportunity to visit a similar prison and it gave me great pride to see that our prisons compared favourably, particularly in regard to the training, educational and medical facilities available to prisoners, even in some of the more normally mentioned prisons such as Mountjoy Prison.  We have tremendous educational and occupational training facilities available to prisoners which compare favourably with anything I have seen in prisons I have visited abroad since.</P>
        <P>I recognise that we must continue to invest in our prisons.  That is why work is scheduled to commence later this year on a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise-Midlands Prison complex which will have the potential to provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term.  Work is also due to commence on converting an administrative building on the D&oacute;chas site into a new accommodation block which will provide 70 spaces in the short term.  In addition, 14 refurbished cells in the female wing of Limerick Prison are complete and due to be occupied later this month.  The Government remains committed to the programme of investment.  To this end, I can confirm that I have recently approved the creation of 150 additional spaces at Castlerea Prison and Shelton Abbey, with tenders to be issued shortly for both projects.  The accommodation at Shelton Abbey will increase by 50 spaces, while in Castlerea Prison we will be providing an additional 100 spaces in a setting which will provide regime incentives for prisoners while remaining within the secure perimeter of the prison.  Again, I have asked my officials to proceed with the provision of a number of these additional spaces in Castlerea Prison, Shelton Abbey and the Portlaoise-Midlands Prison complex, despite the fact that the capital budget is under pressure in the current economic environment.</P>
        <P>This is a clear illustration of the priority the Government accords to providing extra prison spaces, not just in the longer term, as in the case of Thornton Hall, but also in the short and medium terms.  The short-term provisions include extra places in Castlerea Prison, Shelton Abbey, the D&oacute;chas Centre, and the medium-term provisions include extra places at the Midlands Prison.</P>
        <P>I am on record several times as having outlined the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin.  Thornton Hall, which will replace the outmoded and Dickensian Mountjoy complex, will be a campus development with approximately 1,400 cells on a 130-acre site.  It will be designed to meet the highest international standards with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners in a range of security settings.  Work is already under way on the construction of a dedicated access route.  I understand the work is nearing completion.  The Irish Prison Service hopes to award the contract for the installation of the off-site services to serve the prison development in the coming weeks.  The procurement process for the design and construction of the perimeter wall is also in progress and construction is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2011.  The next <Col N="421"/>phase of the work will see the procurement of the first prison accommodation blocks and related support facilities commencing in the new year.  This phase will provide an initial 400 cells capable of accommodating up to 700 prisoners.</P>
        <P>The development of a new prison facility at Kilworth, County Cork, to serve the Munster region is a key element of the prisons modernisation programme.  It is anticipated that the capacity of the new prison will be in the region of 450 and will also include accommodation for male and female prisoners.</P>
        <P>It is important that we again illustrate that the priority of this Government and its predecessors since 1997 has been a clear indication of movement in respect of prison spaces in the short, medium and longer terms.  Despite the constrained economic circumstances, we are prioritising expenditure on prison places.  I contrast this approach with the priorities of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government between 1994 and 1997.  It decided it would not build any new prison accommodation at all and that it had other priorities.  I will not accept any criticism from the other side of the House.  All we need do is look at the record&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;have done since 1997 regarding the building of prison places.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has introduced a range of enhanced security measures in all closed prisons to prevent the flow of and assist in the capture of contraband such as illicit drugs and mobile phones.  These include advanced security screening for all visitors and staff, the establishment of a drug detection dog service, the establishment of operational support units to search and gather intelligence, the introduction of body orifice security scanner, BOSS, chairs for the searching of prisoners, and the erection of netting over exercise yards to counteract drugs being thrown over prison walls.</P>
        <P>Other preventative measures include cell and area searches, which take place in all prisons on a daily basis.  These include random targeted and intelligence-led searches.  These measures have had considerable success to date.  I am determined to support prison management in taking all reasonable steps to stem the flow of contraband, including drugs, weapons and mobile phones, into our prisons.  I leave it entirely up to the experts in this area to determine security requirements in our prisons.  It is entirely a matter for management to install whatever security <Col N="422"/>measures it deems necessary within the resources provided by the Oireachtas to ensure contraband does not get into the prisons.</P>
        <P>I accept that good accommodation must be accompanied by a diverse range of facilities for prisoners.  The Irish Prison Service places very strong emphasis on the provision of education and vocational training activities for prisoners.  Training activities are chosen to give as much employment as possible in prison and to give opportunities to acquire skills that help secure employment on release.  A wide range of training workshops operates within the institutions.  There are classes available covering printing, computers, braille, woodwork, metalwork, construction, industrial contract cleaning, craft, horticulture and electronics.  Training in catering and laundry services is also available.</P>
        <P>During 2009, new workshops and activities were developed in a number of prisons and a refurbishment and equipment replacement programme continued in others.  Over 800 prisoners, or 21% of the daily average population, participated in work training activities on a daily sessional basis during the year.  A constant emphasis on quality assurance and care standards in work and training services and programmes was reflected again in 2009, with one prison winning a national award for hygiene for its catering operations.  Arbour Hill Prison won the Excellence Ireland Quality Association Emerald award for hygiene in the public service.  External accreditation of certified training is also available for a number of courses run within the institutions.  Members, on visiting any of our prisons, will be very surprised by and delighted with the investment in training and educational facilities.</P>
        <P>There have been significant developments in health care service provision in our prisons.  The health care focus has been on improved quality of care, made possible through a number of initiatives, including the implementation of the recommendations in Irish Prison Service Healthcare Standards, the introduction of nurse managers and of nurse-led initiatives such as health screening, diabetic and vaccination clinics, the further development of in-reach services, the establishment of clinical multidisciplinary teams and the provision of enhanced through-care processes in respect of community services.</P>
        <P>There has been much adverse comment about slopping out in our prison system, and I do not for one moment seek to minimise the fact that in some of our older prisons this practice still exists.  That said, it must be acknowledged that our newer prison accommodation is dealing with this issue to a significant extent.  At present, 72% of our accommodation has in-cell sanitation.  As Minister, I want to ensure that percentage is increased as much as possible.  This can only be done through the building of new, modern state-of-the-art prison cells.  In this regard, I must make what one may call a political point, but a very important one nevertheless: one cannot just build a prison or prison cell overnight.  Two or three decades ago, there was a certain prison design according to which prisons were built.  I am thankful there is now a greater opportunity to build purpose-built infrastructure on prison sites.  The Irish Prison Service has learned a considerable amount recently on foot of the rapid increase in the number of cell facilities in prisons.  While the issue of procurement has been the subject of investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts, the Irish Prison Service must put cells in place as quickly as possible.  It has done so to the best of its ability and has done a marvellous job.  It must achieve value for money for the taxpayer and, to the best of my knowledge, has done so.</P>
        <P>I will not accept any criticism of the staff of the Irish Prison Service regarding the way they have reacted to a situation which has come about as a result of further investment aimed at increasing Garda numbers.  The latter has led to a rapid rise in the number of people being processed through and sentenced in the courts.</P><Col N="423"/>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of the current building programme, with the development of new prison spaces at Castlerea and Portlaoise and the proposed extension at the Midlands Prison which is due to open in 2012, the proportion of prisoners with access to full sanitation facilities will rise to more than 80% of the total prison population.  The final elimination of the remaining outdated accommodation &mdash; mainly at Mountjoy and Cork prisons and, to a lesser extent, at Portlaoise and Limerick prisons &mdash; is dependent on the progress of the Thornton Hall and Kilworth prison projects.</P>
        <P>Despite the constrained economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, we are proceeding, full steam ahead, in respect of Thornton Hall.  The access road is almost complete, a number of on-site services will have to be put in place before development takes place and the building of the perimeter wall will commence in the new year.  The construction of the first of three phases, which will comprise 400 cells, will then take place.  I am confident that, in the context of the difficult Estimates process relating to next year and succeeding years, the Department of Justice and Law Reform and the Irish Prison Service will have adequate resources at their disposal to enable the development at Thornton Hall to proceed as quickly as possible.  I am also confident that resources will be made available to allow construction on phase 1 to proceed in the not too distant future.</P>
        <P>I am informed that a new camping-style toilet, which will assist in improving hygiene, is currently being tested on a trial basis at Cork, Limerick and Mountjoy prisons.  The initial feedback from the prisoners is positive.  The aim behind using toilets of this type is to try to address the situation which obtains at Mountjoy and a number of other prisons in respect of slopping out.  I completely accept that the latter issue must be dealt with.  As a society, we must try to ensure, to the greatest degree possible, that proper in-cell sanitation is available in our prisons.  The ultimate answer in this regard is to build new prison accommodation as quickly as possible, particularly at Thornton Hall, which will provide up to 2,200 prison spaces in the future.  This will be of assistance in dealing with the long-term issue of an increasing prison population.</P>
        <P>Significant efforts are being made to ensure that an effective, multidisciplinary approach is taken to the management of offenders.  The Irish Prison Service is developing and rolling out an integrated sentence management, ISM, system to ensure there will be a prisoner-centred approach to how inmates are assisted during their sentences.  ISM was piloted at Arbour Hill and Wheatfield prisons in 2008, extended in 2009 and by the end of this year all newly-sentenced committed prisoners serving one year or more will be participating in the system across the entire prison estate.</P>
        <P>When debating penal policy, it is important to remember that non-custodial or alternative sanctions offer an important menu of additional disposals to the courts.  In that context, we are always considering measures to keep minor offenders out of prison.  I have heard it said on many occasions that I do not possess a strategy.  That is not the case.  My strategy is to modernise our prison estate while ensuring that people who heretofore were sent to prison in respect of the non-payment of minor fines or civil debts should not be incarcerated.  I again place my record on the line in that regard.  I have taken a number of legislative initiatives to ensure that what I have outlined will no longer happen.  My Department, along with various criminal justice agencies, has been examining alternatives to custody.  Community service is one such option which offers a real alternative.</P>
        <P>As Senators will be aware, the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983 provides that a court may make a community service order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a person over the age of 16 years who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who consents to such an order being made.  A community service order requires an offender to <Col N="424"/>perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months of sentencing.</P>
        <P>The community service scheme provides a very useful disposal option for the courts.  A value for money report showed that it could be used much more widely.  Based on this, and other recommendations contained in the review, the probation service of my Department is leading the drive to substantially increase the number of persons that could potentially be placed on community service.  Initial indications from the Dublin area show a marked uptake in the scheme.  This new model of community service will be rolled out nationwide in the coming months.  Having regard to the independence of the Judiciary, I am confident that the work of the probation service to encourage greater use of the community service option by the courts will result in greater numbers being placed on the scheme.</P>
        <P>I have checked the position with the probation service, which has indicated a willingness to take greater numbers of people onto the community service scheme.  I was assured, during preparations and discussions relating to what has become the Fines Act, that the probation service has additional capacity and will be in a position to cope with the placing of extra people on community service.  I have also indicated that I will be making an additional legislative change with regard to sentencing policy in order to make provision in respect of community service.</P>
        <P>The Legislature has set out a range of sentencing options in respect of offences, including fines, the Probation of Offenders Act, community service orders and the ultimate sanction of imprisonment.  I am of the view that there is scope for greater use of community service orders in respect of relatively minor offences and I have prepared legislative proposals in this regard.  Senators may recall my comment to the effect that, under the 1983 Act, the courts may make community service orders.  In the next week or so I will be bringing before the Cabinet a short Bill which is designed to ensure that, subject to certain conditions, judges will be required to examine community service as an option when they are considering imposing sentences up to a certain level of severity.</P>
        <P>The legislative change to which I refer will be introduced in the near future and will require courts to consider imposing community service orders in cases where they envisage imposing prison sentences of six months or less.  Until now, it has been entirely a matter for judges &mdash; under the provisions of the 1983 Act &mdash; to consider whether community service orders should be imposed.  In the future, there will be a mandatory requirement on judges who are considering imposing prison sentences of six months or less to examine the option of making community service orders.  It is obvious that not all those who appear before the courts would be suitable to have community service orders handed down to them.  Judges will, therefore, be obliged to establish whether people will be suitable candidates and also whether there will be places for them.</P>
        <P>I again suggest that Senators peruse the probation service&rsquo;s annual report, which clearly outlines the type of work done by those who are placed on community service.  I am sure those on all sides of the House will agree that it would be far more preferable to have certain individuals do some service to the community rather than having them committed to prison at further expense to taxpayers.  I am not in any way suggesting that people should be let off scot free.  If, in lieu of a prison sentence, a person is directed to carry out community service for whatever number of hours and if he or she does not comply with the terms of the relevant order, he or she would then be obliged to serve time in prison.</P>
        <P>In the Criminal Justice Act 2006 it is provided that a court may suspend any portion of a sentence, or full sentence, on condition that the offender complies with probation supervision <Col N="425"/>and any other specific conditions which are intended to reduce the likelihood of re-offending.  The courts frequently use pre-sentence assessment reports from the probation service in order to inform themselves of the suitability of the defendant for such an order and the conditions that might usefully be attached to supervision rather than imprisonment.  In 2009 the courts imposed 528 part-suspended sentence supervision orders and requested over 6,000 pre-sanction reports from the probation service in order to inform sentencing.</P>
        <P>I wish to draw attention to the published discussion document No. 2, entitled Criminal Sanctions, in the White Paper on Crime series, which includes an examination of the use of non-custodial sanctions generally.  I am not sure whether Senators know that we are currently in a very extensive consultation process on a White Paper on crime.  Submissions to the discussions on the preparation of the document regarding criminal sanctions were invited and in August 2010 my Department published reports on the submissions received and the consultation seminar held in Dublin Castle on 28 May 2010.  The opinions received will feed into the development of future policy in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the House will know, the Fines Act 2010 was signed into law at the end of May this year.  It provides for an innovative, balanced and more humane approach to the determination and collection of fines.  Capacity to pay, equality of impact and payment by instalments are the key features of this legislation.  The Act addresses the issue of capacity to pay by requiring the court to examine the financial circumstances of a person before determining the amount of the fine.  The person on whom the fine has been imposed will be entitled to make an application to the court to pay it by instalment.  The Act also provides for alternatives to imprisonment in the event of non-payment of a fine.  In such circumstances a recovery order can be activated and a receiver will be entitled to recover the fine or seize and sell property from the person and recover the fine from the proceeds.  A community service order is also an option.  Imprisonment in the event of default will be a last resort.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Act was passed some time back and I have to commence it.  The reason for the delay in its commencement is that most of the amendments to the process of collecting fines were made at the very end of the passing of the legislation in the Oireachtas.  I spent a lot of time with my officials, using my experience from the time when I practised as a solicitor, to go through the types of process whereby a person who is fined by a court ends up in Mountjoy Prison or another remand centre.  There is a ludicrous situation that when people have not paid for a television licence or dog licence, as has happened in my constituency, bench warrants are being executed by the Garda and people are being brought to prison who have never been near a prison or in court in their lives.  I am trying to stop that from occurring as much as possible.  Of course we all accept that a person deserves to go to prison if he or she continuously thumbs his or her nose at the authorities and refuses to pay even though he or she has the ability to pay, but there are people who do not have the capacity to pay.  A lot of time was spent going through many of the amendments to the Fines Act relating to the sequencing of what happens when a fine is imposed and what hurdles must be jumped before the ultimate sanction of imprisonment.  These were only finalised shortly before the Act was finally passed by the Oireachtas.  It behoves the Courts Service to set up a system to deal with the logistics and practical issues in the District Court.  To my recollection, the District Court system handles about 800,000 cases in any one year and obviously needs a lead-in time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope to commence the sections of the Act by 1 January.  We have to set up the receiver system and that will take time.  There is a tendering process in that respect which the Courts Service must complete.  From 1 January the Fines Act will clearly stop a lot of cases in which judges impose fines and say &ldquo;three months in default&rdquo;, which means people who do not pay the fine will get three months&rsquo; imprisonment.  The Fines Act will contain a sequence whereby people can pay by instalments.  If they do not pay within the due date, a receiver will be <Col N="426"/>appointed.  The court receivers will go out to a person&rsquo;s premises and seize goods and sell them in lieu of the fine.  If they cannot get any goods from the person the courts can impose a community service order if the person is fit, and if after all that the person does not pay the fine, there has to be the ultimate sanction of prison.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We changed the law some time back on civil debt and now, to the best of my knowledge, there are no people in prison for a civil debt.  One will find very few people in prison for owing fines or civil debts.  If they are, it is because they have the ability to pay but refuse to pay for whatever reason.  It is to be hoped that will do away with the myth.  On any given day only 0.2% of the prison population, which is one of the highest proportions in recent times, is in prison for non-payment of a fine.  There is a myth that there are a lot of people in prison because they have not paid a fine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are also testing the use of electronic monitoring technology on a small group of about 20 prisoners.  The test phase will run until Christmas and will then be evaluated to see how it may feature as a management tool for offenders, having regard to cost and the overall findings of the evaluation.  The issue of electronic monitoring, while it seems simple and I would support it, is not simple in practice.  We have looked at the experience across the water, elsewhere in Europe and in the US and if we are spending taxpayers&rsquo; money on it, we want it to work properly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the systems in use abroad are not fit for purpose and there are extreme difficulties with some of the systems that are held up as examples of what could be used.  In the pilot phase we are using the latest technology and GPS rather than a fixed line model which is used in the UK and less than satisfactory.  When the pilot scheme is finished and evaluated, we will then decide whether we can roll it out further.  Value for money from the taxpayers&rsquo; point of view will be examined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On oversight of prisons, it would be remiss of me not to mention the important role prison visiting committees and the Inspector of Prisons play in the performance of valuable functions in the oversight of our prison regime.  We need to welcome the reports which are received from the Inspector of Prisons and prison visiting committees.  In some commentary people decry prison visiting committees.  I am a fan of them.  In recent times when budgets were constrained I examined the possibility of abolishing them because we now have a dedicated Inspector of Prisons who is doing an excellent job, which I very much welcome.   He can arrive at prisons without notice and inspect prisoners and is independent of his functions as a District Court judge.  I considered the possibility of abolishing prison visiting committees to save money but under an Act of 1925, I understand, any member of a prison visiting committee can knock on the door of the prison to which the committee of which he or she is a member is attached and demand to see the prison.  When I became aware of that fact I said prison visiting committees have an important role to play because they comprise Joe and Mary Citizen with no particular experience of prisons.  They are entitled to go into prisons and they do a very valid job.  They do not pull back from any criticism of what may or may not be going on in a prison.  Between them, the Inspector of Prisons and prison visiting committees fulfil an important function.  Recently there was a parliamentary question on prison visiting committees which, if my memory serves me correctly, cost approximately &euro;250,000 to run.  The cost has dropped from approximately &euro;700,000 in recent years as there has been a dramatic saving in areas such as the payment of expenses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On prison staff, when we mention the emergency services such as the ambulance service, the Garda, the fire service and staff in accident and emergency departments, we tend to forget that staff in the Irish Prison Service work on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week basis.  Working in a prison environment is not easy.  It requires a mix of skills to support in a humane way the <Col N="427"/>day-to-day prison regime while being mindful of the ethos of the Irish Prison Service to keep offenders in safe custody.  I express my appreciation of the work carried out in the prison system.  I have witnessed at first hand the work staff do and have been incredibly impressed by the way in which they interact with prisoners and particularly, as I stated, the way in which training and vocational facilities are made available to prisoners.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik welcomed the fact that this debate was taking place.  When I heard that statement, I remembered the time I was last here for a debate, if my memory serves me correctly, on the Criminal Procedure Bill 2009 in which we provided for a maximum sentence of five years for a particular offence and the Senator proposed a longer sentence of ten years.  When we had a debate in the House, the Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, it was a minor offence and I think there was a difference of three months in the sentences proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought it was years, but the Senator may be correct. She took my point that the more we in the Oireachtas reacted to events &mdash; prompted by the media in some cases when the first thing we do is rush into both Houses to state we need longer sentences &mdash; the more we put pressure on the prison estate.  In 1977 the average length of time served by prisoner handed down a life sentence was seven and a half years, whereas today it is somewhere in the region of 17 years.  We are passing legislation to provide for longer sentences, which means prisoners are staying longer in prison and there is not a continuous throughput in the way we would like.  Given, as I stated, that we cannot put up &ldquo;No vacancy&rdquo; signs and the Irish Prison Service must accept everyone and the clear facts which are not acknowledged by anyone in either the media or the Opposition that the Government has invested heavily to put garda&iacute; on the streets by increasing garda numbers from approximately 10,500 in 1997 to 14,600 today and has spent &euro;250 million on new, extended and renovated courthouses and another &euro;250 million in the past ten years on new, improved and renovated Garda stations, it is the case that in recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers being sent to prison, virtually all of them for serious offences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the record of the House will show that I sought to withdraw the amendment referred to as it had appeared on the list of amendments by mistake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I meant to say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>My recollection is that the Senator withdrew her amendment and left the sentence as it was.  I am sorry for honing in on her, but I thought some of the points made in her statement were a little ironic.  Recently Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn stated there should be internment for gangland crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not recall him saying that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>He did.  I can find the reference for the Senator afterwards.  When I see a statement from her criticising the Government on the issue of prison spaces and then see a leading member of her party who should know better proposing internment without trial for gangland members, I wonder where would we find the prison spaces for all those we would round up without trial.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="428"/>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We would not want gangland criminals to be rounded up; that would be terrible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps Labour Party Members should speak to each other before they criticise the Government for not having a strategy.  I deny completely that we do not have a strategy.  I have stated previously that we are dramatically increasing the number of modern prison spaces available and that we are making legislative changes to stop people being placed in prison who should not be there in the first place.  I will not, therefore, accept any criticism.  I suggest to the Labour Party that it should get its act together and that perhaps its members should communicate with each other in order that the Senator will know exactly what its policy is on sentencing and prisons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is flattering that the Labour Party is receiving so much attention from the Minister.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement on overcrowding in our prisons.  He paints a rosy picture.  It is one of utopia in which everything is okay, the Government has done everything necessary and there is no basis for any criticism by or observations from the Opposition.  However, the Minister does have a case to answer.  What he has outlined is as convincing as the statements of the Minister for Finance on the economy, that everything is under control in dealing with the banking crisis and the public finances.  The reality is that the record of the Minister is dismal.  There is still massive overcrowding in the prisons, as highlighted by the recent disturbance in Mountjoy Prison.  Therefore, the Minister is on his own in saying it had nothing to do with prison numbers, practices such as slopping out and low standards in the prison which, to my mind, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment.</P>
        <P>The Minister has stated there were 677 prison inmates, yet the Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, to whom the Minister did not refer in this regard, stated in his report of last July that, on examination of the duties and obligations owed to prisoners, in the case of Mountjoy Prison there were no factors that could be accepted by any reasonable person in suggesting the prison could accommodate in excess of 540 prisoners.</P>
        <P>On the Thornton Hall project which has been an unmitigated disaster from the beginning&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in respect of which there was no proper planning&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the Minister&rsquo;s fault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and a rush to acquire a site when various other locations within existing prisons could have been availed of, the inspector states he is conscious that the intention is that the new prison will replace Mountjoy Prison and that it might be considered understandable that in the interim little has been done at Mountjoy Prison, but this cannot be taken as an excuse for denying prisoners their basic human rights pending the building of the new prison.</P><Col N="429"/>
        <P>An important point with regard to standards in Mountjoy Prison and other prisons such as Cork Prison concerns the practice of slopping out.  The Minister throws out figures, but this is not good enough or acceptable.  He knows we are at risk, as the Inspector of Prisons points out, of litigation in this regard not only in the Irish courts but also in the international arena.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to drugs and mobile phones in prisons.  Again, there is no control.  He also referred to gangland crime.  The priority of any sane prison, sentencing and justice policy should be to ensure those guilty of the most serious crimes are prosecuted and committed, where appropriate.  However, we have a situation &mdash; the Minister knows this, although he never admits it &mdash; where gangland crime is out of control.  He referred to the Fines Act and has made various excuses as to why it has not been commenced.  The fact is that we sentence people for minor crimes and they are clogging up the prisons, while we fail to imprison the serious gangland crime perpetrators, despite a series of rushed legislative measures last year which the Minister stated were imperative because he wanted to round them up before the end of the summer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will refer to a number of points made in the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  He gave figures for the numbers in prison &mdash; 3,881 in 2009.  However, the report of the Inspector of Prisons issued in July stated there were 4,478 people in our prisons.  The Minister has mentioned it is misleading to suggest problems can be solved overnight by the greater use of alternatives to custody.  However, no one is suggesting they can be solved overnight.  On numerous occasions in his report the Inspector of Prisons points out that one does not expect the problems of overcrowding and low standards in our prisons to be solved overnight.  However, the appropriate policies need to be adjusted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister went on to state he would turn to the issue of prison overcrowding.  However, he did not address it; rather, he spoke about the rates of imprisonment, which is a different question altogether.  He avoided the very issue we are here today to address.  He referred to the priorities of previous Governments.  What are the priorities of the Government?  He mentioned the new criminal courts complex built on Parkgate Street.  What are the priorities if one compares standards in our prisons, the need for prison spaces and proper facilities in prisons with the extraordinary expenditure on the new criminal courts complex?</P>
        <P>The Minister has stated releasing serious offenders onto the streets is not an option.  Here, once again, he picks up on an argument that has never been made.  Who suggests such a thing?  What has been suggested is that we should look at the overall prison population, its composition and whether the system can contain and accommodate such numbers with standards that comply with constitutional principles and our international obligations.</P>
        <P>With regard to activities for prisoners, the Minister spoke about a wide range of training workshops operating in the institutions and listed some activities.  However, again, he made no reference to the report of the Inspector of Prisons which stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">In prisons where workshops and educational facilities are provided it should be assumed that relevant structured activities are available for all prisoners in such prisons.  This is not always the de facto position as such facilities may not be operating to their capacity or may not be operating at all.  An example of the latter can be found in Portlaoise Prison where new workshops, finished to the highest standard, have been built in the new C wing.  Apart from two, these workshops have not been commissioned.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The inspector went on to state, &ldquo;Having regard to the matters outlined in this chapter I have concluded that relevant structured activity should be available for all prisoners wishing to avail of such activities for a minimum of five hours each day for five days a week&rdquo;.  The standards and overcrowding in our prisons and the problems they create in terms of the ability of prisoners to <Col N="430"/>avail of proper facilities, have reasonable standards of accommodation and leave open the prospect of rehabilitation and not reoffending when they are released from prison are matters the Minister has not addressed.</P>
        <P>To return to the Thornton Hall project, the reality is that the Minister has suspended many projects, particularly with regard to Mountjoy Prison, because it all depends on the Thornton Hall project providing a panacea for the problems of overcrowding and standards in our prisons.  However, this is so far from reality &mdash; notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s statement today &mdash; that it does not exonerate the Government in dealing with the current crisis in Mountjoy Prison as highlighted by the recent disturbance.</P>
        <P>The Minister is a late convert to the idea of community service as an alternative to handing down prison sentences for minor crimes.  However, again, we are waiting and all we have is promised legislation.  The Fines Act, to which I referred, was signed into law at the end of May but has not yet been commenced and no good reason has been provided as to why this is the case.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">To return to the report of the Inspector of Prisons, what he states is that all prisons must satisfy three criteria, namely, appropriate accommodation, adequate services and regimes, and prison safety.  The prison population must be reduced to the point at which all three conditions are satisfied.  This seems to be a good starting point.  The inspector states a policy needs to be adopted at Government level to limit prison numbers and strive to keep the population below a level at which these basic standards can be adhered to.  In many ways, this is a self-evident proposition, but instead we have the <i>ad hoc</i> approach adopted by the Government, with serious overcrowding which is detrimental to the standards applied to prisoners, the possibility of their being properly accommodated and the provision of opportunities to avail of education and rehabilitation.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P Just="Left">The inspector makes the very good point in his report which I welcome, that he has received total co-operation from the Irish Prison Service and management in all prisons.  They have been open to suggestions to deal with the issues he has raised and highlighted in his reports.  He calls for a two-pronged approach encompassing the stabilisation of the prison population and a building and refurbishment programme to meet our obligations as set out in the report.  This is the way forward.  The Minister alluded to a two-pronged approach, but I do not think it is the same approach suggested by the inspector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have the Fines Act and a commitment from the Minister on the need for community service legislation. We have to look afresh at the sentencing policies which are propagated by the Oireachtas, especially with regard to sentences imposed by the District Court as distinct from sentences imposed by a higher court.  Perhaps the parole system needs to be put on a mandatory basis in order that early release or non-committal for minor offences can be accommodated.</P>
      
        
        <P Just="Left">The two-pronged approach suggested by the Inspector of Prisons is the way forward in light of the standards the State is obliged to effect in its prisons.  The sentencing policy such as the community service alternative to committal for minor offences is very important.  When the Minister has the time, I suggest the commencement of the Fines Act would be a good start to minimise committals to prisons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and this debate on prisons in general.  I have been a Member of the House for 17 years and in the period 1994 to 1997, the coalition Government made a decision to cancel all capital expenditure on prisons, the <Col N="431"/>effect of which was to leave the incoming Government in 1997 playing catch-up in the provision of prison spaces and prison development.  This is a matter of record.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This debate on prisons should be placed in context.  I acknowledge there are difficulties in the system.  I refer in particular to Mountjoy Prison, its capacity and its physical and other failings.  Our prison system should be placed in an international context.  I have visited prisons in America, Asia and the southern hemisphere and prison facilities in this country are well ahead of the average prison in Europe and throughout the world.  I dealt with the case of a European national who served some time as a remand prisoner in one of the southern states of the United States and who was released without charge after 14 months.  He was an elderly gentleman from a European country and the story of his incarceration was frightening as he described the experience of being locked up and the lack of facilities.  Prisoners are much better treated in this country.  I refer to the statistics from Belgium, France, Italy and Spain which show that Ireland is well ahead of the United Kingdom in terms of the provision of prison spaces and in terms of the number of prisoners per head of population.</P>
        <P>A substantial number of prison spaces have been provided since 1997 when the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government came into office but there may not be sufficient spaces to meet current needs.  There has been a tendency to imprison people and to create statistical difficulties by incarcerating people for minor offences.  I welcome recent legislation which provides that committal to prison will be a last resort.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have some questions for the Minister.  Is it possible to entirely stamp out the supply of drugs within prisons?  I welcome the recent installation of security nets and the general improvement in security measures in Mountjoy Prison in particular.  I was deeply concerned when I visited Mountjoy Prison in my capacity as a solicitor on three or four occasions and as a member of the visiting committee.  I noted the availability of drugs and mobile phones within the prison and this was of great concern to me.  I also visited the Midlands Prison a few years ago.  I commend the significant measures introduced by the Irish Prison Service to ensure drugs are not brought into the prisons and that mobile phones are not freely available to inmates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Putting people into prison for minor offences such as non-payment of civil debts and small fines is inappropriate.  I am pleased we are moving away from this practice and the Minister is pursuing a policy to ensure this will be the exception rather than the rule.  From my knowledge of the District and Circuit courts, it used to be the practice that people would be committed for 14 to 28 days for the non-payment of relatively minor fines.  This involved the cost and logistics of conveying them from west Cork to Limerick or Cork Prison only for them to be released a matter of days later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raised the following matter in previous debates in the House.  I was very concerned at the lack of counselling and psychotherapy services available to prisoners.  My interest stemmed from a chance meeting with a clinical psychologist who worked in a prison.  He outlined to me that his work was very limited in the prison as he only attended one day a week for three or four hours.  He acknowledged that such treatment is not appropriate for all prisoners but others welcomed it and he believed it had a very positive effect on their rehabilitation.  We have a duty as a society to ensure rehabilitation of prisoners takes place.  Treatment is essential and should be provided for those with drug or alcohol addictions or for those suffering from mental disorders such as depression.  I represented a person both in the District Court and on appeal.  It was obvious to me within an hour of taking instructions from him that he had suffered from abuse as a young lad. He was very depressed and turned to alcohol as a crutch.  Committing him to prison was probably not the best idea but he had committed a crime and was convicted.  Before he was taken away he begged me to help him as he was a young man and he wanted <Col N="432"/>to get his life in order.  He was sentenced to seven years and this would not help his rehabilitation.  The provision of psychologists and other experts for prisoners should be considered.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>I recall an incident, probably 25 years ago, if not more, involving three or four individuals.  A fisheries officer boarded a small fishing vessel.  A row broke out and the fisheries officer got a belt of a gaff, which is like a stick for hauling pots.  The case of one of the men, who I believe never should have gone to prison, was handled badly.  He was not a criminal but was just on a boat when a row developed and his participation in it was minimal.  When I asked him how he got on in prison, he said he was told how to rob and break into cars, how to rob a till if a barman or shopkeeper had his or her back turned and how to lift televisions and so on.  He was amazed that was what he learned in prison.  That was a long time ago but people who do not have a criminal background are sent to prison for relatively minor crimes and are incarcerated with prisoners who are career criminals and they do not come out rehabilitated.  Fortunately, the man about whom I spoke is alive and well and was in no way contaminated by his three-month stay in prison.</P>
        <P>What was the running cost of our prisons in 2008 or 2009 compared with 1996?  What does it cost the taxpayers to keep a prisoner in prison for a year?  We should be mindful of costs due to the recession.</P>
        <P>From my knowledge of and practice in the legal profession, the use of the probation of offenders legislation has worked very well.  I compliment the work of juvenile liaison officers in ensuring young people at the periphery of crime are taken aside and given a proverbial kick up the backside.  From my knowledge of how they work with local garda&iacute;, they have a huge success rate with young lads who might have committed relatively minor offences.</P>
        <P>Could community employment schemes be used in some way in tandem with community service orders?  Such orders are great but they must be extended.  Could people who do community service for no pay be in some way integrated into a community employment scheme?  In my neck of the woods in west Cork, they would be involved in maintaining waymarked ways, hill walks, playgrounds and so on.  They could get involved in the community and do some productive work.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate on this very important issue and acknowledge the major steps which have been taken not only by this Government but by Governments since 1997 in the provision of prison places and legislation to improve the lot not only of prisoners but of people who should not be in prison and who are dealt with by the probation of offenders legislation or by community service orders and so on.  Significant strides have occurred in the past 13 years since I was elected to this House in 1997.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform&rsquo;s contribution was very interesting and I learned much from it.  He said 1,900 new prison places had been created in recent years.  I saw a television programme the other night called &ldquo;Bad Fellas&rdquo;.  Afterwards, I spoke to a former Garda Commissioner who updated me on some of the figures.  The figures jolted me in that back in the 1950s and 1960s, there was almost no crime.  In one year, there were four murders, none of which involved guns.  The way the situation has changed in recent years is quite dramatic and, therefore, I understand the need for more prison places and the fact we do not have enough.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome this debate which is timely because we need to examine how we implement new ways of administering justice given the state of our prisons.  I was struck by the description by the Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, to whom Senator Regan referred, of the chaotic slopping out of cells each morning in Limerick and Mountjoy Prisons where up to three people share cells designed for one person.</P><Col N="433"/>
        <P>In July, Limerick&rsquo;s male prison held 75% more prisoners than it was designed to hold and the D&oacute;chas women&rsquo;s prison in Dublin held almost twice the number it was designed to hold.  It is fair to say that conditions in overcrowded prisons have the ability to torment inmates with noise, violence and the lack of any semblance of privacy or breathing room, and greatly reduce the capacity to rehabilitate offenders.  We need to place that higher on the agenda than we have in the past.  It is difficult to believe this inspection of prisons found there is no clear policy to deal with the issues of overcrowding, drug use and the reporting of deaths in prison.  Overcrowding was highlighted as by far the biggest problem.</P>
        <P>In 1994, on the first occasion I spoke on prisons &mdash; I had just been elected to the House the year before &mdash; I said there were reasons for prisons, namely, to deter people from criminal activity, to protect society, to administer punishment and to rehabilitate the offender, although not necessarily in that order.  It is a very difficult task to cover all those areas.  There is an argument to be made that overcrowded prisons cannot rehabilitate.  Overcrowding does not give the inmate the proper chance to reflect.  Owing to the conditions in the prison, it may make them think of themselves more as victims than perpetrators.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Work is being done and it was interesting to hear the Minister talk about it.  I was chairman of an education committee which visited Wheatfield Prison some years ago.  I am ashamed to say it was the only time I was in a prison and I really must learn a little more about them.  I was impressed by the amount of work being done on education and training.  Work is being done, about which the Minister spoke; therefore we must not paint everything with the same brush and say it is not possible to educate.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan spoke about a man he knew who went into prison but who was educated on how to break into houses and steal cars.  There is a difficulty in terms of how we handle this.</P>
        <P>One of the areas we should debate urgently is the early release of certain prisoners due to limited space.  I was impressed by the case of an American, about whom I read, who was given a 27-month sentence, plus 1,500 hours of community service and a $400,000 fine.  He was deemed a non-violent criminal.  What was interesting was that he was instructed that his 27-month sentence could be served at home.  Such criminals are supervised at home which includes testing them for drugs, including alcohol.  Not only does this make more room in the prisons, it also saves money.  Some criminologists believe that if criminals saw a clear distinction between the sentences violent and non-violent criminals receive, they might make less violent behaviour choices.  I do not believe we have taken that into account in our sentencing.</P>
        <P>Could we use some of the NAMA apartment blocks to house some prisoners based on the open-type Scandinavian model which would see prisoners moved from overcrowded prisons to empty housing estates and being supervised in making the transition back to normal society?  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s story of the man who went to prison and ended up being taught more about how to commit crime is a reminder that we must rehabilitate in some form or another.  Could the Government consider using some empty apartment blocks or houses in the way I describe to alleviate some of the pressure on the prison service?  This proposal is also related to the use of electronic tagging.  The Minister said an experiment on testing it is being carried out involving 20 people and that the Government will examine its use here.  The measure has allowed other countries to reduce dramatically their prison populations.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that some steps have been taken in this respect and that the Government is examining this option, but what is holding us back from progressing in this area?  We have been talking about this measure for many years and it has been in place in other countries for many years, yet the Minister said it does not seem to work and a very limited test of its use is being carried out.</P><Col N="434"/>
        <P>Should we seek to use some of the money saved from imprisoning people on therapy and counselling services and on investing in the work of probation and welfare officers?  It is in society&rsquo;s interest to help offenders to cope.  Every prisoner the prison service is able to keep on the straight and narrow is a saving in money terms and a protection for society.  We must bear in mind the effect of media pressure on imprisonment and overcrowding.  Tabloid newspapers unjustly highlight and hound judges who they deem to pass, or even seek to justify, lenient sentences.  Due to the fact that most people&rsquo;s experience of the criminal justice system is quite limited &mdash;  certainly it is in my case &mdash; such coverage strongly influences the public mood and some say it even influences the way judges make decisions.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we should also consider more the option of community service &mdash; we have taken the first steps in that direction &mdash; when it comes to sentencing instead of locking people up.  We must also examine ways of speeding up trials instead of letting people linger in prison.  Many other options are open when it comes to addressing overcrowding.  Given the current inadequate conditions in place in many prisons and taking into account the finances of the State, we must consider some of the alternatives without delay.</P>
        <P>We cannot solve the problem of crime but we can solve the problem of overcrowding in prisons.  We need to find and guide those who can best benefit from supervised releases.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to hear, although I know others would not agree with me, that the Thornton Hall project is to go ahead.  There is huge disagreement on this but at least a step is being taken.  The project will take some time to complete.  If we are to achieve what we set out to achieve, we must make sure we have a better prison service than we have had in the past.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s contribution was interesting, particularly regarding the number of prisoners imprisoned.  If those figures are, as I understood the Minister to indicate, much lower than other countries, the problem is not as big as I thought it was compared to others.  However, it is still a big problem and a difficulty.</P>
        <P>There is a big fuss in Britain because European regulations have insisted that prisoners must have a vote.  We have passed such legislation some time back.  The Minister might remind us of the position on that.  This issue is a big fuss in Britain because the British do not like being told what to do by Brussels.  I am pleased to think that at least we have a system in operation, to the best of my knowledge, that enables our prisoners to have a vote and be full citizens.</P>
        <P>I am delighted Senator Bacik sought this debate.  It has been useful.  It forces us to give our attention to a topic that has not got the attention it deserved over the years.  Senator Bacik has sought this debate on a regular basis for some time.  I am pleased the Minister came into the House and gave us almost a full hour of information on this area which I found very educational.  I welcome the debate.  It will help to influence the decisions the State makes in addressing this serious challenge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  The question of prison and our policy on imprisonment is a societal one.  It feeds into our view of prison as a primary tool in reforming people or punishing people.  It is a societal question because there are financial costs involved.  According the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s annual report, the average annual cost of providing a prison space in 2009 was &euro;77,000 and there are the non-financial implications for family and community structures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Progress is being made on the issue of our prisons but I draw attention to specific issues.  The first issue is alternatives to prison.  Imprisonment, as far as possible, should be a criminal sanction; however, I understand that in certain instances and in particularly grave situations it should be a resort of the civil law procedure.</P><Col N="435"/>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment the Minister, his staff and in particular the Probation Service on a comprehensive analysis on the operation and effectiveness of the community service scheme.  In its 2009 annual report, and the report entitled Value for Money and Policy Review of the Community Services Scheme, the authors set out clearly the advantages of community service as an alternative to imprisonment.  These include the ability of offenders to remain in work or education, to remain within the family unit and the community, to learn basic skills and to deliver reparation for the offence.  The community also benefits from the work that would otherwise not be done.</P>
        <P>The existing scheme operating at full capacity could provide supervision services to three times as many offenders.  It is currently operating at only 33% of its potential.  Community service schemes cost appropriately 15.6% of the cost of imprisonment on a full cost basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last night at our pre-budget meeting the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated he would push forward the issue of community service for offences, which is a relief and, thankfully, he will do that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the issue of imprisoning debtors, we got a comprehensive response from the Minister.  The Fines Act 2010, passed at the end of May, provides for an innovative, balanced and more humane approach to the determination and collection of fines.  The Minister has promised us that this Act will be implemented with effect from January next year.  That is definite progress.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every person in Ireland is conscious of the terrible conditions in our prisons, of which we hear constant reports.  There is no defence.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust in its briefing on overcrowding in prisons states the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">Overcrowding is an exacerbating factor for other systematic problems such as poor cell conditions, poor regimes (limited education and meaningful activity among others) and inter-prisoner tension and violence.  The State has a duty to provide safe and humane custody for all prisoners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This is all the more apparent when we recall recent rioting in Mountjoy Prison.  The Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, pointed out that there were 316 prisoners in Cork Prison on 23 July last but it has only capacity for 194.  He said numbers in Castlerea Prison should be kept at 300 but had 414, while Wheatfield should have 378 but had 470.  He said D&oacute;chas women&rsquo;s prison had 107 in rooms designed for 78.  We have had the controversial resignation of Kathleen McMahon, the former governor of the women&rsquo;s prison, and the pre-emptive retirement of John Lonergan.  He appeared on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; last night and gave an extensive interview.  I am still not fully informed of what has been happening, what has been attempted and what has not been achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have visited the Midlands Prison to defend the human rights of prisoners.  I have also visited St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution on a formal basis and learned of the activities young people are engaged in every day.  The tragedy of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution is that almost 90% of the young men I met there came from gangland families.  I do not know how young people from gangland families, especially those from Limerick, will be able to escape the vicious circle into which they have been born.  While staff of the Irish Prison Service are doing their best in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, it is morally wrong that children are being imprisoned in the facility alongside adult prisoners.  I am disappointed that, according to the most recent information, it has been decided not to proceed with the project to replace the institution with a new facility in Lusk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sure 99% of prisoners come from families that are less well off and do not have access to top barristers to get them out of their predicament.  Tragically in this country, people are not sent to prison for white collar crime.  This is in stark contrast to people born into socially and economically disadvantaged families who are imprisoned.</P><Col N="436"/>
        <P>I have no doubt the Minister is doing his best and I hope he does not take personally my view that he was excessively optimistic and defensive about the current system.  I remain opposed to replacing Mountjoy Prison with a new facility at Thornton Hall.  A new prison should have been provided on the existing site.  I also opposed the decision to relocate the Central Mental Hospital to Thornton Hall.  Given that most of those in prison are less well-off, the requirement to travel some distance to the Thornton Hall site will create additional costs and cause greater inconvenience for prisoners&rsquo; families.  The move is not a positive one, whereas the reform of the Fines Act is a civilised and positive measure.  I look forward to Senator Bacik&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate for which I, Senator Cummins and others have called for some time.  It is important the House debates overcrowding in the prison system, although I hope the focus of this debate will continue to extend beyond overcrowding and into more general areas of prison policy.  I am pleased many colleagues spoke about issues other than the important issue of overcrowding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened attentively and with increasing incredulity to the Minister.  Like Senator Regan, I was stunned to hear his rosy, almost utopian vision of Irish prisons which is 1 million miles removed from reality.  Even if one does not go into the prisons to observe the reality, the Minister&rsquo;s vision is also far removed from the reports about prisons which have been produced in recent years, as it is from the experience of prisoners and those working in the prisons.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that we highlight the difficulties and problems facing the prison system.  The starting point is to tackle the Minister&rsquo;s point that the Government has a strategy.  To be fair to him, the problem with the system has been around for much longer than the current Minister.  That Ireland does not have a coherent or consistent approach to imprisonment, sentencing or penal policy generally is the fault of the Executive and Legislature.</P>
        <P>It is laughable for the Minister to claim the current Government has a policy.  Its prison policy can be summed up in two ways.  The first aspect of its approach is to throw legislation at problems.  The result has been a large amount of rushed and problematic criminal justice legislation in recent times.  I have described some of it as &ldquo;July&rdquo; legislation reflecting the fact that it was rushed through at the end of a parliamentary session when there is little prospect of thoughtful debate or amendments.  This rushed legislation is creating problems in prosecuting offences in the courts.  That is the first aspect of Government policy, such as it is.</P>
        <P>The second feature of Government prison policy is to throw more prison places at the problem.  This is not a real solution.  The Minister referred to 700 new prison places coming on stream, including 170 places he recently opened in Wheatfield Prison.  The Minister&rsquo;s figure does not include the supermax prison, as such prisons are known, in Thornton Hall, although it is not certain that project will ever be completed.  It is disappointing that the Minister is throwing more prison places at a problem without questioning the reason so many people are being sent to prison or studying in any depth the types of offences for which people are being sent to prison or whether alternatives are available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I strongly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assertion that we need to focus on community-based sanctions.  I am also pleased to note he is introducing legislation requiring greater consideration to be given to the application of community service orders.  While all Senators on this side welcome the Fines Act, which will result in less imprisonment of fine defaulters, it is disappointing that the legislation has not yet been commenced.</P>
        <P>Welcome as they are, none of the initiatives to which I referred amounts to a coherent prison policy.  I am not making a standard political attack, as one would expect from a member of the Opposition.  The argument that we do not have a coherent prison policy has been made consist<Col N="437"/>ently by many commentators who do not have a political axe to grind, including the Irish Penal Reform Trust, academic commentators on prisons and, most recently and very powerfully, the former governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. John Lonergan, about whom Senator Mary White spoke.  Tribute must be paid to Mr. Lonergan for making such a powerful critique of the prison system, for his reform proposals and for the humane manner in which he tried to improve conditions.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the particular difficulty of seeking innovations in prison policy in recessionary times, the recession also presents us with an opportunity.  For example, the Irish Penal Reform Trust has pointed out that penal reform is under the spotlight in Britain precisely because of budget cuts.  The UK minister for justice, Mr. Ken Clarke, has proposed to reduce the prison population by a combination of legislative and policy initiatives.  This is a progressive consequence of the need to make cutbacks in the prison budget.  One of the precedents for Mr. Clarke&rsquo;s move was set in Canada where, in the 1990s, the government reduced public expenditure on prisons by 20% and the prison population by 11%.  It also addressed the unnecessary use of custody and invested in community interventions.  These steps had a progressive effect on penal policy generally which now has an increased focus on rehabilitation and the prevention of re-offending.  Such a focus is lacking in our system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not wish to sound as if I am being soft on crime.  I accept, as all Senators do, that prison must remain a reality for serious offenders, particularly those who commit offences against the person.  Nevertheless, we must also be aware that many people are serving time unnecessarily for minor offences, including the non-payment of fines, or offences for which community-based sanctions offer a better prospect of rehabilitation.  In terms of the needs of victims, which we must always remember, it is vital that we invest more in rehabilitation and the prevention of reoffending.</P>
        <P>I propose to refer to some of the figures cited by the Minister in support of his case that we have a utopian prison system.  The Minister focused on the number of persons in prison on any one day.  Clearly, it is important to consider the detention rate, which has increased significantly in recent years.  Currently, approximately 4,500 people are in prison on any one day.  The figure has increased significantly since the mid-1980s when we had a peak in the crime rate and the Whitaker committee, despite the high crime rate, recommended we cap the number of prison places at 1,500.</P>
        <P>In 2005, slightly more than 3,000 persons were in prison on any one day, yet a mere four years later the figure stands at 4,500 and continues to rise.  Moreover, the new prison places coming on stream will further increase the detention rate.  The figure cited by the Minister was low because it was based on 2008 data.  On any one day, the detention rate now stands at between 93 and 101 persons per 100,000 of the population.  This is much higher than the figure cited by the Minister.  King&rsquo;s College recently estimated Ireland&rsquo;s detention rate to be 101 per 100,000 of the population.  That alone misses the much higher rate of committals in our system and the Minister did not talk about this.  The Irish Prison Service report for 2009 shows that the committal rate represents the number of committals to prison in any one year.  That is a far higher rate than the rate of detention and it is because so many prisoners are in prison for such a short period that although on any one day one might have relatively low numbers proportionately, we are committing much larger numbers.  A total of 15,425 committals to prison were made in 2009, which was an increase of almost 14% on 2008, and the trend has been for year-on-year increases.  Of those committals, almost one third, that is, 4,806 were committed for non-payment of fines.  This was a massive increase on the numbers committed for non-payment of fines in 2008, which itself constituted an increase.  While it is to be hoped this will change once the Fines Act is commenced, it is certainly of great concern.</P><Col N="438"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has pointed out that the numbers serving longer prison sentences have increased, which is true.  So too have the numbers of persons committed under sentence of less than three months, and 5,750 of the aforementioned 15,000 committals in 2009 were committed for sentences of less than three months.  Those are the people and committals that must be examined.  If a person has been sentenced to less than three months, it is likely that he or she will be turned around through an overcrowded prison system in a matter of weeks or sometimes days.  There is no prospect of rehabilitation and Senator O&rsquo;Donovan noted that the only learning will be learning to commit more crime.  There will be no real attempt to address the problems faced by many prisoners in respect of mental health, addiction, chronic poverty, unemployment and so on.  There will be no attempt to address any rehabilitation aspects nor any attempts at treatment.  The question must be asked whether we would be better served by changing our focus and by making imprisonment the sanction of last resort and by insisting instead that when considering sentences of such short duration, judges would consider non-custodial sanctions first.  I am glad to note the Minister accepts this and proposes such legislation.  There is also a financial imperative as, according to Irish Prison Service figures, it costs approximately &euro;77,000 per annum to keep someone in prison for a year.  The cost of an offender being placed under a community sanction is far less.  While I do not have an up-to-date figure to hand &mdash; the Minister of State might provide one &mdash; I understand it is a much lower figure of approximately &euro;2,000 per year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The knock-on effect of providing more prison places or locking up increasing numbers of people without questioning the reason for it or whether any real public need for safety is being served by so doing has been serious overcrowding.  I wish to focus on this point because the Minister again suggested this was not such a problem.  Members know this is a problem and have seen the riots in Mountjoy Prison.  Moreover, the recent Inspector of Prison&rsquo;s report stated that Mountjoy is operating at a bed capacity of 573 with bunks in the cells.  Mr. John Lonergan has pointed out that the worst thing he ever did was to suggest that bunks might be put in cells because it enabled the doubling up of prisoners, thereby resulting in less safety.  Even with doubled-up cells, however, 660 to 680 prisoners routinely were kept in Mountjoy Prison through 2009 although structured activity is only possible for slightly more than 300 prisoners.  The inspector himself recommended a maximum of 540 in the prison but clearly this number has been exceeded routinely and has led to real issues for the safety of prisoners and staff in the prison.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Slopping out is another factor about which the Minister spoke.  There has been litigation on this practice recently that I believe will require the Government to change its procedure.  It is appalling that in 2010, almost 30% of prisoners still must slop out.  While the Minister stated that 72% of prison accommodation has in-cell sanitation, that means 28% of prisoners still slop out.  This affects prisoners in Mountjoy, Cork and Limerick prisons and in his recent report, the Inspector of Prisons was trenchant in his criticism of the slopping out practice which he described as inhuman and degrading treatment.  He suggested a highly practical cost-neutral solution, which was to operate a toilet patrol throughout the night.  This already is being done in Mountjoy up to 9:30 p.m. and could be continued after that time, which would be a short-term solution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Clearly there are more long-term solutions.  As the Minister noted, Mountjoy Prison is Dickensian and it is clear some change is needed.  The proposed prison at Thornton Hall is not the answer.  If a new prison is to be built, consideration should be given to increasing the capacity of open prisons, which stands at only 6% of prison places.  A far better approach would be to consider the redevelopment of Mountjoy Prison on-site.  I note that plans for so doing were at an advanced stage under the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="439"/>Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue.  This point has been documented in Mr. John Lonergan&rsquo;s book and has been known about by many Members.  Has consideration being given to renewing those plans and redeveloping on-site and then using the Thornton Hall complex for other progressive innovation in prison policy?</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I urge the Minister of State to consider a bolder and more progressive solution to developing a prison policy based on the idea that prison should be a sanction of last resort and that the focus should be on rehabilitation, prevention of reoffending and genuine initiatives such as the former Connect Programme, which had been rolled out across prisons with some success.  Such a policy might be focused on trying to address serious reoffending issues within the prisons.  There is a high rate of recidivism among the prison population, which constitutes a serious problem for victims and for society in general, and this is what should be addressed.  Simply throwing more prison places or legislation at it is not the answer without a coherent policy based on greater use of community sanctions and less use of prison.</P>

	<P>I welcome the debate and congratulate and compliment Senator Bacik on consistently pushing for it for some time.  It has been quite a challenge to arrange it and it is noteworthy that it has attracted such interest that there are more speakers than could be accommodated in the time allotted.</P>
        <P>The net issue of overcrowding in prisons and the combination of the slopping out and doubling up in prison cells must be addressed.  In general terms, when Ireland goes before the United Nations Human Rights Council next year, it will be questioned under the universal periodic review on its record in respect of human rights in its prisons.  Ireland will be required to give an account on the standards of the human rights in its prisons and on the steps being taken to improve them.  I am unsure whether the Minister stated the Government had a strategic plan but he certainly said he did and that he had given this issue much thought.  Having listened to him speak during the debate on the Fines Act in particular, which I appreciate has yet to be commenced, it is clear he is committed to taking out of the prison system people convicted for petty crime and misdemeanours and is considering other ways of rehabilitation and of punishing people in a more appropriate way in order that the punishment fits the crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In itself, it is expected that this will reduce numbers in Mountjoy Prison by at least 5%.  While I acknowledge that this will mean some overcrowding will persist in that particular prison, the economic hard times have had a severe impact.  I recall the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, was in this Chamber when Members discussed the plans for Thornton Hall and how it was planned to build it in such a rapid manner.  As this has been put on the back burner, Members must think outside the box and find other ways to alleviate the pressure on the prison service without being obliged to build such state-of-the-art prisons as were and are planned.  While I do not doubt such plans still exist, at the same time one must now consider other ways.  We might look at the model in England where harsher sentences were introduced in 2003.  The public is crying out for harsher sentences.  This is becoming more and more apparent since the Rebecca French case and since Larry Murphy, a serious offender, was released so rapidly.  These cases have brought the issue into focus in the public&rsquo;s mind.  How can we ensure we deter people from committing the more serious crimes against the person while also having a criminal law code that affects the minds of people in order that they will not offend?  That is a difficult balance to strike.</P>
        <P>We must review our system of sentencing and how judges impose sentences on persons found guilty of crimes.  We need to allow judges to consider the following: the need to deter a person from reoffending, the need to rehabilitate a person in order that he or she will not reoffend, whether the crime requires public or other retribution and how can we stop a person from reoffending, thereby preventing future crimes.  A judge should be able to take all of these factors into consideration and decide on the main aim of the sentence.  He or she must decide whether there is a risk of reoffending or if rehabilitation offers a better route.  We do not give enough consideration to this formula in sentencing.  If we had greater sentencing guidelines, it would follow that people would be given the prison sentence they deserve.</P><Col N="441"/>
         <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Senator Quinn has suggested buildings controlled by NAMA should be used as low security prisons.  That suggestion is worth following up.  Could some NAMA buildings be used to house women prisoners, making Mountjoy Women&rsquo;s Prison available for some of the minor offenders now in Mountjoy Prison?  The Thornton Hall project will not be finished for some time, as we have a funding problem and must be realistic.  Why not look at other options for removing people from the prison system and putting them in different places?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to review immediately the issue of slopping out.  The judgment in the case of Mulligan <i>v.</i>  the Governor of Portlaoise Prison declared that the practice was not a violation of the particular prisoner&rsquo;s constitutional rights, but that is not to say the practice, in general, is not.  Mr. Mulligan had a single cell and access to the exercise yard and spent many hours attending classes.  However, there are many prisoners in Mountjoy Prison who might succeed if they were to take a similar action.  That door is open and leaves scope for further cases to be taken.  Given that Ireland is the only country in western Europe where slopping out is still practised, it is only a matter of time before someone takes such an action.  There must be sentencing options for judges, allowing people to be incarcerated for the more serious offences and a sliding scale of punishments.</P>
        <P>What the Minister said about community courts was interesting.  There is a need for community sanctions and I look forward to seeing how the pilot scheme planned by the Dublin City Council joint policing committee will work.  Community courts would establish a more humane approach to dealing with offenders with drug or alcohol related problems, for example.  The economic recession should not deter us from dealing with the issue.  It would not cost an arm and a leg to sort out some of the prison issues.  How much do visiting committees cost, for example, and are they needed in their current form?  Do we need county councillors or political appointees on such committees?  There are enough philanthropists and interested persons in society to allow the committees to be placed on a different footing and the system to be changed.  Members of the committees are paid considerable mileage expenses.  Could the committees be re-established in a different format in order that they would not cost so much but do the job equally well?</P>
        <P>I welcome much of what the Minister said and some of the criticisms of him were unfair.  He is committed to taking civil debtors and those guilty of the non-payment of fines out of the prison system.  We do not have hundreds and thousands of such persons in our prisons.  They constitute 0.2% of all prisoners.  Therefore, let us keep the matter in balance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must examine the issue of juvenile detention, seek methods of rehabilitation and try to stop people from offending in the first place.  Let us be realistic and acknowledge the fact that crime rates are going up because we are in a recession.  The more heinous crimes, including drug-related crimes, are on the increase.  This also has much to do with the fact that the Garda is securing more convictions, on which it must be complimented.  It would be much worse if we had empty prisons and people offending on the streets.</P>
        <P>Let us keep the matter in balance.  Most of those in jail are there for a reason.  Society wants people to be punished for taking away the liberty of others and committing heinous crimes.  However, Senator Bacik is correct.  We need to balance how we punish people for lesser offences.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have been waiting a number of months for a debate on prisons.  This debate is confined to the issue of overcrowding, but I do not intend to confine my remarks to that matter.  We should also be discussing the reports submitted by the Inspector of Prisons, including that on the use of special cells in Irish prisons and the one entitled The Irish Prison Population &mdash; An Examination of Duties and Obligations Owed to Prisoners.  We must compliment the inspector, Judge Reilly, on the forthright and clear manner in which he has outlined his reports.  When we see the work undertaken by him and his visits to various <Col N="442"/>prisons both day and night, it is clear that we owe him a debt of gratitude for the excellent job he is doing which needs to be acknowledged in the Seanad.</P>

	<P>The figures have been mentioned by other speakers.  In his 2008 report Judge Reilly indicated that there were 3,926 people imprisoned in that year.  On 29 July this year the figure had risen to 4,473, which does not include prisoners on temporary release.</P>
      
        <P>The rate of imprisonment is 93 prisoners per 100,000 inhabitants compared with 80 prisoners per 100,000 inhabitants in 2000.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s lengthy speech.  Informative as it was, he should have read the last paragraph of the report of the Inspector of Prisons which states: &ldquo;It would be wrong if this report was to be used as a vehicle for hysterical outbursts, irrational debate or point scoring&rdquo;.  It would be beyond the Minister to have a debate without engaging in political point-scoring; that is what he indulged in for quite an amount of his speech which is par for the course for him.</P>
        <P>The Inspector of Prisons sets out a roadmap for immediate action and minimum standards and safe custody limits for each of the 14 prisons.  Aspects that receive particular attention include slopping out, multi-occupancy cells, overcrowding, with particular emphasis on the D&oacute;chas Centre and the Limerick female prison, and the need for refurbishment across the prison estate.  Critically, the inspector cites overcrowding as a key issue behind the increase in violence which he describes as endemic in Mountjoy Prison.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In the past the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, made a number of applications to be included in the list of bodies eligible to nominate a person to go forward for election to the Seanad from the Administrative Panel, but its efforts in this regard were unsuccessful.  I have no difficulty with the Bill in principle, but it is strange that it has been brought forward by Fine Gael which wants to abolish the Seanad.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, clearly outlined his position on the matter and I am obliged to state I hold the same position.  As stated, it is strange that a party which wants to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann has brought forward this measure.  I am completely opposed to the abolition of this House which is an important institution of State.  I am extremely proud to be a Member of the Seanad and believe it has an important role to play.  However, like all institutions and bodies it requires reorganisation from time to time.  We will be debating a motion on that matter later in the day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill before the House is extremely important.  It is our job to represent the local authority members who have placed their trust in us for many years.  It is an honour and a privilege to be elected to the Seanad.</P>
       <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, for coming before the House and, as on many previous occasions, giving of his time.  He is fully supportive of the local authority system and a former chairman of the General Council of County Councils which has become the Association of City and County Councils.  He is a distinguished former Member of this House <Col N="443"/>and prior to his election to the D&aacute;il, he served here as the Government&rsquo;s spokesperson on finance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like many other Senators, I support the proposal before the House.  However, I represent the Government side and I am, therefore, obliged to respect its decisions and those of the Department and the senior Minister.  Departments are, in conjunction with Ministers, responsible for making plans in respect of long-term strategy.  From time to time Ministers outline to the House the policies of various Departments and the Government.  I understand a White Paper on this matter is at an advanced stage of development and will be published some time in the future.  It will deal with the reforms such as those included in the Bill which has been brought forward by Senator Cummins on behalf of Fine Gael.  As I said, in principle, I<?oasys _jy ?>have no difficulty with the Bill.  As stated, however, I must respect the position of the Government.</P>
        <P>The establishment of LAMA was a wonderful development.  As I stated at its annual conference, I salute those pioneers who set up the association on a voluntary basis.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, served as its first secretary.  In addition, Senator Walsh is numbered among its former chairmen.  Former councillors Michael Lawlor and Willie McKenna who hails from Monaghan both served as chairmen of and made major contributions to it.  The current chairman, Councillor Hugh McElvaney, and secretary, Councillor Noel Bourke from Edenderry, are also making tremendous contributions.</P>
        <P>LAMA is strongly requesting parity of esteem with the Association of City and County Councils in order that it might nominate a person to go forward for election to the Seanad from the Administrative Panel.  Councillor Bourke is a most efficient man and has relayed to me that it is the strong view of the association&rsquo;s chairman, Councillor McElvaney, and its executive that the House and the Minister and his Department should give serious consideration to its application which has been submitted to the Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The request made by the Government in respect of the Bill makes common sense.  We should await publication of the White Paper before evaluating what progress might be made on the proposal contained in the Bill.  I have been working with Senator Cummins on the matter and I am aware that he has the best interests of LAMA at heart, for which he must be commended.  As stated, in these Houses we represent hard-working and dedicated councillors throughout the country who give of their time &mdash; in some cases it is possible that individuals work up to 100 hours a week &mdash; in the interests of democracy.  I have outlined my position on the matter and look forward to progressing it when the White Paper is published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Cummins for introducing the Bill.  Perhaps his actions might focus minds on how we might bring about reform of the Seanad.  We have been down this road so many times and, in such circumstances, it is absolutely appalling that we are discussing the matter again.  When I spoke at the annual conference of LAMA on this matter, I stated I would support the Bill.  I do support it and thank Senator Cummins for bringing it forward.  However, I am sure I will be bound by the party whip in respect of it.  As a result, I feel I am speaking out of both sides of my mouth.</P>
        <P>The Bill will do one thing, namely, it will speed up the process of reform.  We have no choice but to reform the House.  I am glad Senator O&rsquo;Toole has tabled a Private Members motion on the matter and that we will be in a position later to discuss how we might move forward.  Since I became a Member in 1993, we have been discussing reforming the Seanad and how best we might bring about such reform.  All the Bill before the House would require of us is to include LAMA as one of the nominating bodies.  The Association of City and County Councils is already included as such a body and the same privilege should be afforded to LAMA.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the work done by LAMA.  I attend all of its conferences and support it in everything it is doing.  It does great work in representing councillors, seeking greater power for <Col N="444"/>them and giving them a platform to expound and expand on their ideas.  It is a pity, therefore, that I cannot support Senator Cummins on the Bill.  However, I am with him.  If I can assist him in progressing the matter &mdash; with the exception of voting in favour of the Bill &mdash; I will do so.  All I can say to him is, &ldquo;Well done and keep up the good work.&rdquo;  I will continue to support his efforts and ensure the matter is discussed.</P>
        <P>I would welcome it if we could engage in some reform prior to the next general election.  The system governing how people are nominated for election to the Seanad is wrong.  We cannot remove from councillors the power they possess in this regard.  God knows their powers have been eroded to a substantial degree.  They do not tend to come up short with regard to the people they nominate for election to the House.  It has been proven time and again that county councils are able to judge who they want to represent them in the Seanad.  It is one area to which we must stick.  The Association of City and County Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and LAMA should be part of the group of nominating bodies as they push for councils, have a feel for us as Senators and understand what we are at because we all came from the same ship.  We were councillors and reflect their views.  I want to continue with that system.</P>
        <P>I will do my best for the Senator behind the scenes.  I feel awful standing here today.  I support him in principle and I wish I could vote in favour of the Bill but, unfortunately, I<?oasys _jy ?>cannot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Like me, Senator Ormonde was at the LAMA conference in Listowel.  I shared the top table with Senator Cummins.  Like my colleagues on the other side of the House I agree with the sentiments, but the Government has a view that the Bill should be part of a widespread and comprehensive reform of local government which I am sure will involve the inclusion of LAMA as a nominating body.  One of the more disturbing parts of local government reform is currently taking place.  While we were promised White Paper as part of the programme for Government, we have essentially local government reform by stealth.</P>
        <P>The efficiency review implementation body was appointed in recent days by the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  While we all agree that there must be efficiencies within all Departments, we will have reform of local government without having a debate on the 106 recommendations of the efficiency review report on local government, some of which are wide-ranging, including the merger of various offices within local authorities, including county managers.  I can see a lot of sense in having shared facilities when it comes to payroll and other issues.  If there is a payroll department in a city council like Limerick and a county council has a similar staffing arrangement, surely efficiencies could be found there.</P>
        <P>When I look at the names of the people who are on the efficiency review implementation body, I note one of them is a former deputy chief executive of the HSE, Pat McLoughlin.  If we are now looking for efficiencies in the HSE with the loss of 5,000 people, which is only coming this week, what was Pat McLoughlin doing when he was deputy chief executive and why was he not implementing those efficiencies in the HSE over recent years?  He is now being asked to do a job which he was not able to do in an agency.  There is also a former Secretary General of the Department of Finance and John O&rsquo;Hagan, who is a professor of economics in Trinity College.  We all know economists cannot agree on anything and that if one put all the economists in the world end to end, they would not come to a conclusion.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The local government reform which we were looking for, through the White Paper, is now taking place under the 106 recommendations of the efficiency review implementation body.  I ask the Minister of State that, every two months, the members of the board be brought before the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to be challenged on the review and efficiencies they are to implement as part of their programme of work and questioned, as part of their job in implementing the report, on the rationale behind the decisions in the report and whether they will bring about efficiencies, make a difference or deliver better local government.</P>
        <P>To return to the issue at hand and the Bill, it will come as part of a more comprehensive document and a White Paper and I look forward to it coming to the House at some stage in order that we can have genuine reform of local government debated by Members of this House and the other House and implemented by elected representatives, not by an efficiency review implementation body which was not elected by anyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Members for their contributions to the Bill.  I find it extraordinary that the Government will vote against it, as outlined by the Minister of State.  I find it extraordinary that about 12 months ago it was agreed unanimously by all present at an all-party meeting, including the Minister, that the Bill would form part of his proposals on Seanad reform.  He rushed the all-party meeting last October because he wanted to have his proposals out by last Christmas.  We had two or three all-party meetings and we agreed on a number of proposals.  Christmas has come and gone, we are nearly at another Christmas, and we have seen no sign of Seanad reform.</P>
        <P>This Bill was introduced and has been on the Order Paper since 2008.  When people inquire about my party&rsquo;s policy on Seanad &Eacute;ireann, they will find the Bill was proposed in 2008 at a time when we had legitimate proposals for the reform of the Seanad which have not been acted upon by the Government despite all the promises.  We have had numerous reports agreed by all parties.  Even in the last Seanad a report that was agreed with the two leaders of the main parties in the House at the time, Deputies O&rsquo;Rourke and Hayes, and in which all parties took part was shelved, as have all the others.  I was very surprised that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, after the meeting in October last year and having stated that he would publish the White Paper by last Christmas, reneged on those responsibilities and commitments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree totally with the assertion of the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, that legislation should not be introduced piecemeal.  When there is an anomaly, however, whereby two of the representative associations have a nomination to the administrative panel but not LAMA, which came into existence after the original Act, the only way to proceed is to address the anomaly and bring them all under the authority of the Act, as this Bill proposes to do.  The purpose of the Bill is to correct this anomaly.  I did not think we would have disagreement from the Government.  I am very surprised that we have disagreement on this short Bill when it is agreed that there is an anomaly in the legislation and that the Government is not prepared to plug the gap.  Whether this legislation is accepted, it will certainly not bring down the Govern<Col N="446"/>ment, but I would have thought common sense would come into it.  We will have another debate later on Seanad reform, but that is another day&rsquo;s work.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Daly and Senator McCarthy of the Labour Party, I attended the Local Authority Members Association annual conference in Listowel recently.  The Leader of the House gave an undertaking that the Bill would be dealt with in the House and told the conference that we would receive Government support for it, but, like the snows of last winter, that support has vanished.  It is extraordinary that the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il Members cannot stand up and be counted, as they agree with the Bill in principle.  What is preventing them from voting for it?  I certainly agree it is piecemeal legislation, but the Government has failed to bring forward any proposals on Seanad reform, despite the meetings held last year about which I spoke.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I still appeal to Members to support the Bill to address the anomaly identified.  I hope Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Members will reconsider their positions.  The Bill would address a wrong which Members on the other side of the House have acknowledged, but they are not prepared to right it, although they have an opportunity to do so now.  I appeal to them to grasp the nettle and support this short Bill to correct an anomaly in the existing legislation.</P>

    <Title>Seanad Reform: Motion</Title>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />believing that it should operate primarily as a House of influence, reform, scrutiny, reflection, consolidation and persuasion and rather than replicate or undermine the D&aacute;il, should act in parallel to it by giving new breadth to the parliamentary process;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />believing that the House should seek to convince by force of argument and logic rather than compel by weight of numbers and formal powers;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognising that the future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann cannot be secure unless it is seen to have a viable and creative role;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />appalled by the Government&rsquo;s lack of progress on Seanad reform;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />resolving that the membership of the House should be a fair reflection of civic society and that the various panels and constituencies should be designed to reinforce that concept and to ensure the citizens of the State be the main stakeholders;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />believing that every citizen eligible to vote in D&aacute;il general elections should also be eligible to vote in Seanad general elections;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />demands, as an indication of its determination, that from 1 January 2011 all degree holders who are Irish citizens and graduates of Irish universities be entitled to register on the register of electors for a six seat higher education constituency and be entitled to vote in all Seanad general elections after that date;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />supporting proposals for a Seanad structured along the following lines:</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash82" />23 directly elected by national popular vote using a list-PR system;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash82" />6 directly elected to a higher education constituency under PR-STV;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash82" />23 indirectly elected under PR-STV to a national constituency by D&aacute;il Deputies, Senators and county councillors;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash82" />8 nominated by the Taoiseach; and, an automatically re-elected Cathaoirleach of the Seanad;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />demands that, such an arrangement be in place for all Seanad elections beyond 2012 and demands that the Government should now implement such proposals by bringing forward the necessary legislative and constitutional amendments and putting them to the people by referendum or proposing them to the Legislature as appropriate; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />decides that, even though citizens may qualify to vote on more than one panel, insists that no voter may exercise more than one vote at an election for Seanad &Eacute;ireann and, in that regard, must make a personal choice as to on which panel he or she will register.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I understand the senior Minister is dealing with a crucial legislation in the other House.  I have no doubt he will keep an eye on this motion.</P>
        <P>I could stand up here and say &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; or &ldquo;the same again&rdquo; because it is embarrassing that this topic has been discussed many times in the House.  This Chamber is not fulfilling its role <Col N="448"/>as contemplated by Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  In its current embodiment it is indefensible, it is not viable as a political institution and there seems to be no political will for change.  I could quote what the Minister, Deputy Gormley, said two or three years ago.  I could refer to the discussions with the Minister in various places and I still believe that he was well intentioned towards it but he has been completely outmanoeuvred by the main Government party which has ensured he has made no progress whatever on this matter.  In my view, the Seanad will die if it continues the way it is going.  It is indefensible as it stands at the moment and we must examine its role.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of whether the Seanad has sufficient powers.  The Seanad was never intended to be a mini-D&aacute;il or to subvert the will of the people as articulated in the Lower House.  That is not the role of an Upper House in this part of the world.  It is that way in Washington, which is why they are in trouble today because the Administration only controls one of the Houses of Congress.  This causes legislative gridlock, which was never intended in the Irish Constitution and which, I wish to make it clear, is not what I am proposing in this motion.</P>
        <P>The Seanad was meant to be a deliberative Chamber with experienced and knowledgeable people who would inform, amend, extend and consolidate legislative and policy initiatives through persuasive argument and thoughtful debate and which would make a distinctive contribution to the parliamentary process.  The main Government party has its head in the sand.  I do not want Members opposite to regard my statement as being a personal criticism of them.  I have no worries about the people who sit opposite and anything I say is not to be taken as a reference to them because this is not the case.  They are good people who mean to do the right thing.</P>
        <P>That said, anyone who thinks the criticism will go away is wrong.  It is also wrong to believe we can survive the onslaught of negativity about the Upper House.  The response of the Fine Gael leader, much as I disagree with it, is understandable but is inadequate and inappropriate.  Surely at a time of recession, politicians should know better than anyone, having seen what has happened in other countries and during other times of recession, that it is inappropriate and inadequate to try to row back on the structures of democracy.</P>
        <P>The Green Party Minister, Deputy Gormley, stated in this House three years ago this month that he intended to use the period of this Parliament to address reform of the Seanad.  He has not done so.  In that context, I have some sympathy for the point of view articulated by Deputy Kenny.  I do not agree with it but I understand his frustration.</P>
        <P>The Seanad should be a tether to the people, connected at all times.  It should be the conduit between politics and the people.  It should form a synthesis with the people and that is what it was always intended to be.  Any reading of the Constitution will make this clear.  It should be the voice of the various components of our community.  It should be the channel for bringing the vocational experience and knowledge to the legislative heart of Parliament and also to the policy drivers of our democracy.  This is what it was meant to be, not a place to embarrass, subvert or overturn the Government.  It was meant to add to rather than take from.  The thinking was that rather than demonstrating outside the gates of Leinster House, seeking grace and favour meetings with Ministers, Deputies and Senators, or having to lobby individual Members of these Houses, groups in society would be in a position to have their views articulated within the Parliament.  This is how it could work.  The role of the Seanad is only discussed during election time and perhaps we are in election time again.</P>
        <P>I am making proposals in this debate which go against the grain for me because time and again I have said I would oppose any attempt at reform which was merely to change the university panel and nothing else.  I have moved back from that position, in pure frustration.</P><Col N="449"/>
         <P>I propose we put in place what the people decided 30 years ago, namely, to extend the franchise to Irish graduates of all Irish universities.</P>
        <P>In order to discharge the function about which I spoke &mdash; our role in society &mdash; ordinary citizens should be the main stakeholders in the Seanad.  That is crucial.  The Seanad cannot continue merely as a creature of political parties.  It is past time for the Government to take a serious look at how we can change it and how it is working currently.  I will not go down the road, which I could easily do, of talking about the great things we do at times, the very good debates we have or the great people who have come through this House.  I will not go down that road because it would sound overly defensive and like self-justification.</P>
        <P>I would like to look at this as if I was not a Member and I was outside trying to create a second House of Parliament.  I would begin by acknowledging that Seanad &Eacute;ireann is exclusive, undemocratic, unrepresentative and, in particular, that its opaque system of election is in urgent need of abolition.  One can no longer justify that 43 Members of the 60 are elected by fewer than 1,000 local authority members.</P>
        <P>However, I wish to put that in context because earlier I listened to people like Senator Glynn speak about issues on which I agree with him.  I support the principle of one tier of democracy electing a distilled version above it.  The idea of members of local authorities electing people to the Houses of Parliament is one I welcome.  It works very well in other ways.  However, I do not welcome that they should elect 43 Members out of 60.  That is indefensible.</P>
        <P>We need to look at how people get elected to the Seanad.  All of us on the Independent benches are very political people but we are not members of political parties.  However, the only way we could get elected to the Seanad was through the university panel.  As someone who came from an education and trade union background, the choice for me to go on the university panel was difficult.  I believed it to be an exclusive cadre.  I could not justify it, except that other people had the vote.  It reflects a time which is long gone.</P>
        <P>We should give voting rights to people.  In each of the panels, there is a nominating bodies sub-panel and an Oireachtas sub-panel.  Those on the Oireachtas sub-panel are nominated by four Members of the Oireachtas while those on the nominating bodies sub-panel are nominated by the nominating bodies.  There is a more simplistic approach, although I do not propose it as an absolute solution but it is an example of how this could be done.  If those on the Oireachtas sub-panel were elected by local authority members, it would deal with that issue.  The nominating bodies sub-panel could be elected by members of the nominating bodies.  That is the way one could get them involved.  The agricultural Oireachtas sub-panel would be elected by local authority members while the nominating bodies sub-panel would be elected by those involved in agriculture.  The same would apply to the labour panel and the remaining vocational panels.  Every citizen should be entitled to vote in a Seanad election and this could be achieved by the simplest of constitutional changes.  Members could be elected in the manner I just outlined and in other ways.</P>
        <P>Imagine if the Seanad was put together in four different sections.  Section one would be elected by registered voters in large geographic constituencies, for example, the European Parliament constituencies.  People entitled to vote in a general election would be entitled to vote in a Seanad election.  Section two would be ordinary citizens elected through a variety of panels, like the nominating bodies sub-panel about which I spoke, and including the university panel.</P>
        <P>The only way one can justify the retention of a university panel is if other people can vote.  In a modern democracy in the 21st century, one cannot justify the idea that people have a vote because they are graduates of certain universities.  My colleagues and I find it embarrassing.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="450"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I find it embarrassing that democracy is not extended to the other ones.  That is the argument but I do not agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  That is the argument.  The exclusive nature of restricting the vote to graduates of certain universities is indefensible.  Outside of that, it becomes very easy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 3 could be elected by local authority members while section 4 could be nominees of the Taoiseach.  I do not have a difficulty with nominations by the Taoiseach.  I am not interested in creating a situation where the Government could be overwhelmed, toppled, restricted or perverted in this House.  However, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees should have to subscribe to various categories.  People would have views on the walks of life from which they would come, whether the emigrant community, the Northern Ireland community or various other areas.  I will not go into that but there should not be a free rein for a Taoiseach to nominate his or her buddies to the Seanad; it must be specific.</P>
        <P>Recently, many of us met our Northern Ireland colleagues in County Down and talked about a North-South parliamentary body.  One of the big issues being addressed is a civic forum, North and South.  In the past two weeks, I heard people talk about the importance of a civic forum in which ordinary people would have a voice.  That is what this House was intended to achieve and what it should do, that is, be a bicameral Chamber where people would reflect the views of various groups.  If every group in the community was represented in the Seanad, one could get a full view of the community.  It would add to the debate and make it much more important.  It would give ordinary people a stake in what goes on here, which they do not have currently.</P>
        <P>People do not feel connected to this House.  I defy anybody to disagree with me on that.  Our job is to be a conduit for people.  If we cannot be such, we are going nowhere.  It is not as if the D&aacute;il does it that well but that is its business.  There is a huge disconnect, some of which we cannot control.  However, we can control other parts of it.  What I propose in the motion is an attempt to build that bridge to the population and to make the people stakeholders in the formation of the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said and congratulate him on tabling this motion.  I do not agree with every detail in it but the thrust of what was said about the need for Seanad reform and dramatic change is indisputable.  I will not go over old arguments but the Seanad is in serious danger of extinction.  That is because the main Opposition party has said that if it gets into Government, it will abolish it.  That is a populist and reasonably thoughtless response to what is undoubtedly the public&rsquo;s view.  However, one cannot necessarily blame it for doing that because it is in the business of reflecting public opinion even if it is a cheap jibe at something in which it has participated and played the game extremely well for a very long time.  However, that should focus our minds on the fact the Seanad is in danger of being abolished.  Even if it is a cheap response, it has some sort of justification.  If we reflect on what has happened in the Seanad in recent times, the respect or the attention it gets not only from the media &mdash; I would not worry about that so much because everybody is always bellyaching about the media which has its own agenda and we can let it get on with it &mdash; but from the Government in power is pretty derisory.  I do not want to be disrespectful to the Minister of State present but it is indicative that we constantly get a Minister of State in here baby-sitting various motions.  That is what happens.</P>
        <P>During this period of financial crisis the Minister for Finance has not been in here as often as the Minister of State.  The Minister has been in the D&aacute;il, Brussels and all sorts of places &mdash; I know he is a busy guy &mdash; but it shows where we stand in terms of priorities.  This is not only the case with the Minister for Finance but other Ministers constantly dispatch people in here <Col N="451"/>to take a debate which they do not take seriously.  They are sent in here to get legislation through.  That is what is happening.  All that tells us is that the Government does not have very much time for the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole was right in what he said about the Seanad.  It has not been much use to the public.  It has not reflected very much what the public wants to hear or see, rather it has reflected what political parties want.  The Seanad has become a tool for political patronage.  That may or may not be what it was designed to be.  One never knows what was in the extremely Byzantine mind of Eamon de Valera when he set it up.  The result was that it is people who are favoured particularly by the leadership of political parties who find their way in here.  They have an agenda which is basically not to rock the boat and to get seats in the D&aacute;il.  That is what it is all about.  As a result of that, they do not take legislation as seriously as they should.  I heard a Member refer to &ldquo;my constituency&rdquo; here today.  His constituency is a panel but what he was referring to was his geographical constituency.  He regards his constituency as being in here to serve a D&aacute;il constituency until he gets in there.  That is what this place is all about.  There are some exceptions. I do not want to say too much about the university seats but I will speak about them.</P>
        <P>I thought the first and obvious reform would be a simple one, namely to have D&aacute;il and Seanad elections on the same day.  I cannot see that being a problem except that it would not allow people who have ambitions to be in both Houses to stand.  That would be the idea of it.  It would immediately give a new character to the type of person who would stand for election to this House.  It would be someone who had made a decision that he or she would stand for this House, that he or she would not stand for the other House and very likely he or she would have less ambition to be in the other House than to be in here.  That is a dramatic but simple change that could be made, whereby people would opt to stand for election to this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other problem is the electoral system.  One of the best examples of the way the original idea was denied, that of making the Seanad a vocational body for people who have a different and less political contribution to make, was the candidacy of Ken Whitaker for this House.  Ken Whitaker, whatever one thinks of him, has an extraordinary expertise, which is and would have been of great value to the nation after he retired from the multiple positions he held in the Civil Service.  He was nominated to this House, as most Members will know by Garret FitzGerald in 1981.  He was also nominated to it in 1977 &mdash; he was nominated twice.  He was a very articulate and useful contributor and offered an expertise, which was not available, because of his background in the Central Bank, the Civil Service and his work with Se&aacute;n Lemass.  He was not nominated by, I think, Charlie Haughey for reasons which are probably political but that is neither here nor there.  In 1987 Ken Whitaker decided he would stand for one of the panels and, as a man of great expertise and distinction, regardless of what one thinks of him and many people like him and many people do not, one would have thought that if this was a great vocational body of any sort, at least he would be worthy of being in this House but he got a derisory vote.  People would say that shows a naivet&eacute; on the part of a person who did not understand the political system but it also shows an absolute and utter ruthlessness on behalf of the electorate who happen to be extraordinarily political in a party political sense.</P>
        <P>I thought we wanted more people like Ken Whitaker in this House and fewer people whose sole ambition is to get into the other House.  There is nothing wrong with having that ambition but there really is not a place in here for people whose sole ambition is to do that.</P>
        <P>There are other areas where we could do great experiments.  There have been some great contributors here in my time, mostly of a non-political basis.  It was a great education to listen to Seamus Mallon, Brid Rogers, Gordon Wilson and others from Northern Ireland &mdash; Senator O&rsquo;Toole touched on this point &mdash; and they were listened to with enormous respect because <Col N="452"/>they had an expertise.  They educated people here about what was happening there, which we did not know anything about because most of the people here had not been there.  They made an enormously valuable contribution.  That type of contribution is something which the Seanad can very valuably make.</P>
        <P>I do not care whether we defeat legislation.  That should not be our purpose or role.  We do not have to have powers to delay legislation for 90 days.  That is not the point of having people here who are not elected by the people.  The point is offer expertise where subjects are debated in a non-politically contentious manner and where it is easier for a Minister to say that an amendment tabled is sensible and that he or she will take it on board and no political embarrassment is attached to it and there does not necessarily even have to be a vote on it.  That could be an important role.  The Seanad does not need a democratic mandate from all or any of its Members if it does not have those sorts of powers.  If its powers are simply vocational and moral, that is all it needs.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a few points about the university seats.  I agree with everything Senator O&rsquo;Toole said.  It is virtually impossible to justify the structure of our seats at present.  There is no way we can say that Dublin University should elect three Members, the National University should elect three Members and that DCU, Limerick and all the others be deprived of the democratic franchise.  That is utterly and totally indefensible and unjust.  If we are to survive and if the Seanad is to survive, which is now very much in doubt, and rightfully in doubt, part of the solution must be that  these seats are radically reformed in a way which is acceptable where we cannot be accused of being part of the kind of elite which comprises this House.</P>
        <P>If we do not do anything about it, this House will not necessarily be abolished because Fine Gael will have difficulties about that if it ever gets into power, but it will wither away into complete and utter irrelevance and it will attract people with little talent, vision and energy.  That is the fate that is facing us if we continuously refuse to confront this problem.</P>

        <P>One good feature of today&rsquo;s debate is that at least we are talking about Seanad reform, which we have done on many occasions.  There have been quite a number of reports on it, one having been published not many years ago, which up to now has been gathering a layer of dust on a shelf.  We are talking about Seanad reform and, hopefully, some day soon we will get there.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole and the Independent Senators on tabling the motion.  However, in light of my position in the House, I will be unable to support it.</P>
        <P>I am extremely proud to be a Member of the Seanad.

We must consider the issue of Seanad reform in a deeper way than has been the case thus far.  We are informed the Seanad is a House of legislation, which is the case, and that as Members of the Upper House we are supposed to have in-depth knowledge of how legislation is amended.  If one takes this statement to its ultimate conclusion, the question begs as to how one interacts with the people for whom one is supposed to legislate, namely, members of the general public.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the facilities or lack thereof available to Senators.  While this may not be a popular statement to make at this time, it is true none the less.  Senators are not given an office allowance, the Seanad is regarded by some members of the public as an entity from outer space.  People do not see a role for Senators because they never see one and they do not have constituency offices.  Provision is not made for Senators to behave and interact in a way than would endear them to a greater degree to members of the public who are, after all, the beneficiaries or objects of legislation passed in the House.  As I have stated previously, this is wrong.  Senators should have a facility to enable them to interact with those who are paying their wages, namely, members of the public.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Ross indicated which people are disenfranchised under the current system.  Another large group of people is also disenfranchised.  I raised the ire of Senators on all sides when I made this point on previous occasions.  I refer specifically to town and borough councillors who do not have a vote in Seanad elections, despite certain town councils having a larger population than some counties.</P>
        <P>If one takes the position that currently obtains to its logical conclusion, a Senator must have multi-locational talents and must be able to take on board the views of people from the four corners of the country.  If we were to interfere in a major way with the current system of electing the 42 Members on the five vocational panels, this would certainly be the requirement.</P>
        <P>As a democrat, I accept the need for change and reform.  The commitment in the renewed programme for Government of 10 October 2009 is to establish an independent electoral commission incorporating the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission with enhanced powers of inspection.  The commission will be mandated, among other things, to outline new electoral systems for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the good thing about tonight&rsquo;s motion is that we are at least discussing this issue.  In the fullness of time, we must do something about Seanad reform but I strongly repudiate the uninformed views of those who argue that councillors should not elect Members of this <Col N="454"/>House.  In the exercise of the franchise who is better informed than those with a mandate who are at the front line of public representation?  I refer, of course, to county and borough councillors as well as Deputies and outgoing Senators.</P>
        <P>I strongly support giving voting rights to graduates of all third level institutions.  People in Northern Ireland should also have some say if we are to give recognition to our aspiration to have a 32 county republic although that is a matter for a different debate.</P>
        <P>Many issues need to be considered when one speaks of Seanad reform.  It is regrettable that this House has been used as a stepping stone into the other House and continues to be used as a place of refuge for some who have had the misfortune of losing their seats in the D&aacute;il.  It is necessary to have professional Senators and, like many Senators on both sides, I lay claim to that role in the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Local authority members have a pivotal role to play in Seanad reform.  If electing a number of Senators through single transferable vote from the general population would bring about a connection between this House and citizens, I would welcome any such measure.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole and his Independent colleagues on producing the proposals set out in the motion.  I accept to some extent the comments made by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Ross on the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s policy on the Seanad.  The utterance by the leader of the Fine Gael Party was unhelpful and I am given to understand he did not have universal support among elected Members of his party in this House or on local authorities.</P>
        <P>In any event, the one good thing about this debate is that Seanad reform is at least on the cl&aacute;r and being discussed.  Whether we agree on what steps should be taken is irrelevant; some day we may stop the talk and indulge in the walk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Government, I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for putting forward some interesting proposals on the Seanad electoral system, even if the debate is liable to range over similar ground to that covered in the debate on the Second Stage of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) (Amendment) Bill 2008 on 20 October, which resumed in the House earlier today.  I am pleased to set out the Government&rsquo;s position on the matters in question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During his speech on the recent Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, gave an extensive account of both the role of the Seanad and the current electoral system.  For this reason, I do not propose to revisit these details.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s motion focuses specifically on the electoral aspect.  It is interesting to note that the proposals he is making seem to reflect closely some of the recommendations of the report of the Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform published In April 2004.  For example, the report proposed that a number of members be directly elected, a list PR system be introduced, six seats be filled from a reformed higher education constituency with graduates from all higher education institutes in the State being eligible to register, indirect election by Oireachtas and local authority members continue and the system of Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees be retained.  These issues have previously been debated and, as has been pointed out in the course of the relevant debates, it is clear there is all-party consensus for all of these proposals, which would require significant constitutional change.  As the 2004 report acknowledged, it would also involve some difficult decisions.</P>
        <P>One specific element of the 2004 report would be most unlikely to meet with enthusiastic public support in the present climate, namely, a proposal that the number of seats in the Seanad be increased to 65 Senators from the current total of 60.  I am rather surprised that Senator <Col N="455"/>O&rsquo;Toole also appears to propose an increase in the overall number of members of the Seanad, albeit by only one rather than five.  This seems to be an inevitable consequence of his proposal that the Cathaoirleach be returned automatically.</P>
        <P>However, in the context of demands for retrenchment and rationalisation in public administration, it is surprising to see any proposal being put forward by a public representative that would be likely to give rise to even a marginal increase in cost to the taxpayer.  No doubt the main Opposition party would be strongly opposed to such a proposal in view of its desire to abolish the House.</P>
        <P>One issue on which there does seem to be a measure of agreement, at least in broad principle, is that of the university constituency.  It is generally accepted that the current restriction of the Seanad university seats to three elected by graduates of the National University of Ireland and three by Trinity College graduates is unsatisfactory, although I am aware that some have even questioned the continued existence of these seats.  There already is constitutional provision for the extension of the higher education franchise, by legislation, to other institutions of higher education in the State.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has already indicated his agreement with the principle of widening the third level franchise and I can confirm that this commitment stands.  However, a number of detailed issues must be addressed with regard to implementing possible changes in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2007 programme for Government contained a commitment to seek to advance Seanad reform as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall approach to Oireachtas reform.  The matter has subsequently been considered by an all-party group on Seanad reform which identified a number of possible options on a range of issues, including electoral matters.  It also identified a fundamental absence of consensus among the political parties on how best to proceed.  It noted that most significant changes to the composition of the Seanad would require constitutional amendment.  There was a collective appreciation of the difficulty of pursuing constitutional reform in the short term.  The group narrowed its consideration to the following four main areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">First, the group considered an enabling amendment of the Constitution to permit subsequent reform by legislation such as, for example, to provide for changes to the electoral system.  However, it generally was considered that the details of any new system would have to be known before a proposal was put to the people.  Second, the group considered the expansion of the higher education constituency.  However, the university Senators were opposed to this issue being treated in isolation.  The third area was scrutiny of certain senior public appointments by the Seanad to improve transparency, while the fourth was making provision for the membership of the Clerk of the Seanad of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The party responses on these matters indicated that while there was consensus on making some changes, there was little all-party support on the major issues of Seanad reform.  In the absence of adequate consensus to pursue constitutional change to reform the Seanad, it will fall to the Government to give due consideration to reform options and make decisions accordingly.  To inform the Government&rsquo;s consideration, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, intends to bring to the attention of the Government the results of the deliberations of the all-party group on Seanad reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As for wider electoral matters, the renewed programme for Government of 10 October 2009 contains a commitment to the establishment of an independent electoral commission with a wide mandate that would incorporate the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission with enhanced powers of inspection and wide-ranging responsibilities.  The commission will propose reforms to the electoral system which will include making recommendations on the feasibility of extending the franchise for presidential elections to the Irish abroad.  In addition, it <Col N="456"/>will examine and make recommendations for changes to the electoral system for D&aacute;il elections, including the number of Deputies and their means of election.  It also will outline new electoral systems for Seanad &Eacute;ireann and advise on the basis for European elections to reflect new realities of the role and influence of the European Parliament, including consideration of moving towards one national constituency and using a list system.  In addition, it will make recommendations on the possibility of extending the franchise for local elections to those aged 16 years and over and set minimum standards for the taking and publication of political polls within the State to ensure fairness and accuracy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the particular proposals made in the motion relate specifically to electoral aspects, it is clear from the overall text tabled by Senator O&rsquo;Toole that there are wider questions surrounding the role of the Seanad.  This was also evident during the debate on the recent Private Members&rsquo; Bill and earlier today in the House.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole made some interesting and insightful contributions to that debate.  For example, he expressed the view that in its operation as contemplated by Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann the House was to act as a civic forum, that it was never meant to be a &ldquo;mini-D&aacute;il&rdquo; but a deliberative Chamber and that he opposed the idea of additional powers for the Seanad.  The motion makes the point &ldquo;that the House should seek to convince by force of argument and logic rather than compel by weight of numbers and formal powers&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I am unsure that it is self-evident that changes to the electoral system <i>per se </i>are required to make progress on these civic objectives.  Perhaps Senator O&rsquo;Toole is of the view that the Members nominated and elected under the current system are not sufficiently representative to attain these goals.  However, one hears regularly, including in the recent debate on the Private Members&rsquo; Bill, comments to the effect that the quality of debate in this House is very high, possibly higher than in the D&aacute;il.  While that may be so, perhaps it begs a question as to whether Senators are content for the House to be regarded in some quarters as a form of high level debating society.  Can the Seanad play a more meaningful and effective role, even within its current parameters?  As is incumbent on every public institution in the current economic environment, can it identify ways of achieving greater efficiencies and ensuring effectiveness in how it conducts its business?  The fact that today it has held two debates covering broadly similar territory appears to indicate potential in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a striking observation in his contribution on 20 October that &ldquo;there is no goodwill or support for this House among ordinary people.&rdquo;  Clearly, the Fine Gael Party not only shares this view but also believes the Seanad is in terminal decline and calls for a drastic measure.  I suggest, however, that the issue of public credibility presents a challenge for the House itself.  While changes to the electoral system may, to some extent, be capable of enhancing public identification with the Seanad, it also is necessary in the first instance for the House to demonstrate its relevance to those to whom the Senator referred as &ldquo;ordinary people&rdquo;.  It should, for example, be able to make a substantial input to addressing the difficult challenges the country faces and an influential contribution generally to the economic, social and political affairs of the nation.</P>
        <P>Seanad reform involves wider issues than the electoral system, but that is the aspect of most direct relevance to the core functions of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the specific issue raised in the motion before Members.  As I have indicated, electoral matters generally will fall to be addressed more comprehensively in the context of the electoral commission.  In the meantime, however, the Minister proposes to bring the results of the deliberations of the all-party group on Seanad reform, including electoral aspects, to the attention of the Government as indicated in the amending motion, with relevant matters arising during the debate on this motion.</P><Col N="457"/>
        <P>I understand the Minister is also giving consideration to the approaches to be taken to implement the programme for Government commitment to establish an independent electoral commission.  This is, of course, one of a number of items on the electoral reform agenda in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in which the legislation for a directly elected mayor of Dublin is an immediate priority, as is the Government commitment to address the issue of political donations.  The debate on the Bill to provide for the directly elected mayor is commencing on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il today and this represents a significant departure in the development of local democracy in Ireland.  The Minister will also be taking forward decision-making on local government structures in Limerick on foot of the recently published report of the Brosnan committee.  Comprehensive proposals for the modernisation and development of local government will subsequently be set out in a White Paper on local government which is being finalised by a Cabinet committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I was amazed to learn from the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution to the debate that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, had not yet gone to the Cabinet with the findings of the deliberations of the all-party group on Seanad reform, as he was meant to so do almost one year ago.  My understanding was that he intended to come to this House before December with recommendations from the Government.  What has happened to that process?  When does the Minister intend to take the actions he proposes in respect of the electoral commission?  One can only conclude from what the Minister of State said that yet again Seanad reform is not on the agenda.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole and the Independent Members for using their Private Members&rsquo; time to facilitate a discussion on Seanad reform.  However, if one were to examine the agenda of the Seanad since its return, one would be obliged to express extreme disappointment at the fact that the Government has not placed any legislation on the Order Paper of the Seanad in the last four weeks.  Why is this the case?  What is happening to the legislative programme of the Government?  As this House has taken as its primary function the examination and amendment of legislation, it does not help if no legislation is brought before it.  This makes it very difficult for Members to gain credibility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While Members are debating Seanad reform tonight in the context of its future, such a debate does not take place in a vacuum.  All Members must recognise the extent to which confidence, trust and faith in the body politic and its ability to deliver are unquestionably at an all-time low.  At such a critical time for the country, from a fiscal, economic, social and political point of view, it is a serious issue that the people have so little confidence in the Oireachtas and in how our democracy is run.  It is one we have taken very seriously in Fine Gael.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I reject Senator Ross&rsquo;s comments.  His description of the work we have done on the New Politics document is far from the truth.  We have taken the question very seriously, as anyone who reads the document will see.  A lot of research and thought have gone into it and we have not pulled  from anywhere the recommendations made.  We made them following examination and detailed work with a view to reforming the political system to make it more effective and efficient, which is what the people want to see.</P>
        <P>The people have been left feeling very despondent, yet Irish people care about their political structures in delivering.  The public meeting, Building the Future, held in the RDS on Saturday last was attended by 1,000 citizens.  Some 2,000 people had applied to be there to talk about what mattered to them, how the State was run and how they wanted to see it delivering for its people.  This is something Irish people care about, even if they are disillusioned with the structures.  Therefore, it behoves us to address the issue.</P>
        <P>We must accept that the problem goes further than the Seanad.  The D&aacute;il needs radical change to deliver a Parliament of which the people can be proud.  That is why Fine Gael has <Col N="458"/>stated that when in government we will witness the biggest revolution in parliamentary structures since Independence, including holding a referendum; asking the people what they think about the future of the Seanad; reducing the size of the D&aacute;il; strengthening the role of Members in the committee system; changing the budgetary system; and producing other radical reforms.  We cannot talk about reforming the Seanad in isolation.  Reform is about how both Houses operate.</P>
        <P>How the budgetary system operates is relevant as we approach budget day in the next few weeks.  How many times have we discussed changing the way we deal the budget?  That has relevance for this House, as well as the D&aacute;il.  How many times have we talked about having meaningful dialogue, looking at the Estimates and having real discussion in the Houses?  It does not happen.  How many times have we talked about having a register of lobbyists and reforming quangos?  It is extraordinary how slow the system is to change and respond.  That is why the people are disillusioned.  They see report after report being produced.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael report, New Politics, analyses the history of unicameralism in Europe and how other countries provide for checks and balances in the legislative process and other areas.  The biggest failing of the Seanad is not how it has done its work but the inability of Governments to fix it.  We have had 12 separate reports which we have reviewed during the various debates on Seanad reform.  The most recent was drawn up in 2004 when there was a real sense of agreement.  Reports were also compiled in 2002 and 1997.  There was the report of the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution in 1967, the report of the Seanad Electoral Law Commission in 1959, the report of the Joint Committee on Seanad Panel Elections in 1947 and the report of the Commission on Vocational Organisations in 1943.  Other reports date back to 1928, but none of the recommendations made in any of these reports was taken on board, to any degree.  So much effort has been put into producing reports but so little into implementing the recommendations made.  This is a general failing of the Government.  We bring in consultants and receive reports, but their recommendations are not acted upon and the reforms not made.</P>
        <P>The Seanad has failed in spite of and not because of the quality of its Members.  Everyone is agreed on this.  Work of quality has been done in this House, whether one talks about people who started their careers or spent part of them here.  It would be invidious to name names.  Some have been named tonight, many of them politicians.  It is wrong for Members to denigrate politicians who come through one part of the system as opposed to another.  There is no question that reform is needed across the gamut of the Seanad electoral system.</P>
        <P>The failure has not been of those in the House but in the way it is constituted.  The flaw is in the design and goes to the heart of the Upper House.  There have been superb debates in this House.  People often say the standard of debate is stronger in the Seanad than in the D&aacute;il, but it does not receive the coverage we would like.  That is just one example of how the Seanad is viewed.</P>
        <P>We cannot look at Seanad reform in isolation from reform of the Oireachtas.  That is the key point Fine Gael is making.  Having reviewed the issue, we said it would make more sense to bring about substantial change in the D&aacute;il, including adding the checks and balances that modern democracies with similar chamber parliaments have adopted, rather than maintain the illusion of checks and balances in the current bicameral Oireachtas.  Many disagree with this approach, but it is the point of view we are presenting on reform.</P>
        <P>I do not think anyone disagrees that reform is necessary. We must reform the way politics does its business in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The reform agenda has long been talked about and we desperately need to take action.  I welcome this debate, but the time for talking <Col N="459"/>is long over.  We must take action.  I am not impressed by the approach of the Minister who said he was serious about reform and would present a plan before December last year.  What has happened to that plan?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be able to answer Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s question.  I find myself speaking on the issue of Seanad reform while still learning what the Seanad is about.  Perhaps getting the perspective of a Seanad novice might not do any harm in this debate, coming as I did to the House in February this year.</P>
        <P>A number of things struck me.  The first was the resonance the Fine Gael leader&rsquo;s call for the abolition of the Seanad had among people I know and speak to and who were anxious to know &ldquo;what it is like there.&rdquo;  That is a conversation I have had many times in recent months.</P>
        <P>The clauses included in the motion are impressive.  The proposers believe &ldquo;that the House should seek to convince by force of argument and logic rather than compel by weight of numbers and formal powers&rdquo;.  That is a lofty and worthy outcome to pursue.  Would the demands that follow in the last two paragraphs of the motion help to make it realisable?  I do not think they would.  They do not go far enough.  Either the idea should have been dropped or the demand should have been far more radical.  If this issue was put to a referendum, as Fine Gael states it will do, the people would probably vote the Seanad out of existence.  It is a question of reform or die.  It seems to be that reform &mdash; radical reform &mdash; is the option that should be chosen in the context of the much greater political reform that needs to happen.</P>
        <P>Recently I made the point that the number engaging in the electoral process on voting day, while still high, was slipping.  The level of engagement, particularly among younger people, seems to be lower than in the past when I was growing up, when people were less detached from the political process than they are now.  That is worrying and the political system needs to respond to it.</P>
        <P>The overall reform agenda the electoral commission envisages taking on is something I would dearly love to see happening, as a matter of priority.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is disappointing that the goals set out in the programme for Government over a year ago to establish an independent electoral commission incorporating the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission have not made sufficient progress at this point.  The outcomes this commission looked forward to achieving concerned constituency boundaries, the voter registration process, voter education programmes, advice on mechanisms to increase the participation of women in political life &mdash; an issue on which I have spoken on several occasions &mdash; a review of the electoral systems for Seanad &Eacute;ireann, making recommendations for changes in regard to D&aacute;il elections and getting rid of the weaknesses of the multi-seat constituency system.  All of these are worthy and engaging ideas that would in all likelihood lead to a far greater level of interest and engagement from voters and future voters.  In particular, the recommendation on the extending the franchise for local elections to those aged 16 and over was a strong idea which would mean a person&rsquo;s introduction to the electoral process could happen in the context of their secondary school education.  A fertile crossover could be created when the promised electoral commission begins its work and delivers its recommendations which are passed.  We are a long way from all that but there are many exciting ideas.</P>
        <P>In the context of all these ideas and while I generally agree with the proposals for changing the voting mechanisms for the Seanad, they are a long way short of where we need to go to make the Seanad the Chamber it can be.  With regard to the votes councillors have in Seanad elections, I was excluded from that process although I was on a rating and planning local authority.  Even in that case, there was a degree of fairly arbitrary discrimination in regard to <Col N="460"/>how councillors could vote and this is magnified tenfold when one considers the range of graduates who can vote.  It is fundamentally unfair that graduates from certain colleges can vote while those from, for example, the institutes of technology cannot.  It underlines the fact we still have not fully embraced the whole third level sector as being of equal importance and merit.  It is a strong signal that the institutes are still considered to be secondary in the overall scheme.</P>
        <P>I spoke on radio with Senator Norris one morning in regard to Seanad reform.  He described the unfortunate level of wind-baggery that goes with some of the contributions here.  This has struck me too, although I could be accused of it at this moment.</P>

        <P>Overall, the wider framework of political reform is the context in which a much more radical overhaul of Seanad procedures and functions should be considered.  In that context, I will support the amendment which the speech delivered by the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, explained quite well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to keep the wind-bagging to a minimum.  I congratulate Senator O&rsquo;Toole and his colleagues on tabling the motion.  There is an element of this debate that is profoundly depressing because it is shot through with a terrible feeling of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  This is at least the third time in my short time in this Chamber &mdash; although not as short as that of Senator Dearey &mdash; when I have stood up to make pretty much the same contribution I am about to make.  That is not acceptable, and it is not acceptable that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, would finish his speech to the House in January 2010 with the following conclusion:</P>
        <P LI="1">We seem to be some way off cross-party consensus on reform of the Seanad and I will be reporting this conclusion to the Government.  I intend to submit a report for discussion with my colleagues in government shortly.  We will have regard to the views expressed by all parties and the commitments given in the programme for Government.  We will then consider the next steps to be taken in the process.  While consensus remains elusive, I have previously informed the House that the absence of consensus cannot be allowed to lead to paralysis.  It is my ambition that the Government will press ahead with reforms from which successive Governments have shied away.</P><Col N="461"/>
        <P FLI="0">He is correct about successive Governments having shied away.  I will take that criticism in so far as it involves parties on this side of the House.  However, that is now almost one year ago.  The Minister had said the same thing in the House some months earlier and the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, said the same thing again today.  Senator Fitzgerald was right to ask whether this proposal has been brought to Government.</P>
        <P>We cannot fly everything on the electoral commission.  Either the Government has serious proposals to bring forward or it does not.  Perhaps it should just say it does not see Seanad reform as being a priority at this time.  That is what I gathered from listening to the Minister of State and, although it is not what she in fact said, it was what any reasonable person would have concluded.  She tipped us off when she asked what we were doing about it.  I wonder what the Leader thinks about the very thinly veiled criticism of some of the procedures and practices in the House.  For example, the Minister of State was unhappy today that we had two debates about the Seanad and wanted to know what reforms we were bringing forward ourselves.  In so far as it goes, that is not an unreasonable point for her to make but it does not constitute a response to this debate.</P>
        <P>I and others have raised this issue repeatedly.  On the Order of Business last week, I asked the Leader to name one reform, however minimal, he had brought forward in the lifetime of this Seanad.  Our of respect, I tried to maintain my practice of not interrupting when he replies to the House and although sometimes I fail, on that occasion I did not.  He announced in his reply that he had brought about a change, namely, a practice had been introduced whereby Ministers who made statements in the House would take questions.  That is not a reform that has been introduced since 2007 because it has been in Standing Orders for many years.  Therefore, the sum total of the reform that has been introduced since we all were elected to the House in 2007 is exactly zero.</P>
        <P>People on both sides are blue in the face talking about the economy and the grave financial situation facing the country.  Why can we not have a debate that is structured differently?  Why is it all about the Minister making a statement before we make set-piece statements?  Why can we not have a more committee-style debate?  Why can we not &mdash; perish the thought &mdash; interrupt each other sometimes, not in an attacking way but in a way which seeks to clarify what each Member is saying in order that we can add to the debate and move it forward?</P>
        <P>I am a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where these issues have arisen.  I have also raised at the CPP the issue of a petitions system which the Labour Party has been pushing for years and which was, I understood, agreed at the CPP.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole can correct me if I am wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been agreed for years but where is it?  We do not need to change the Constitution for any of these issues.  The Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, asked what the Seanad itself is doing about making itself relevant.  It is a perfectly reasonable question and it should be answered.  As a Chamber, we are not doing anything about it.  We stand condemned.  I do not take the blame because I believe it is principally a matter for the Government to bring forward the proposals.  It has not done so.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole on his remarks.  There is no question but that the future of the Seanad is on the line.  Its survival, in terms of its place in our political system, is open to question.  If it is possible to have reform instead of abolition, we must realise that much of what is in the motion describes the kind of reform of which I am in favour.  It draws attention to the sorts of issues we should be addressing.  I remain sceptical as to whether we can reform this Chamber on its own.  We require considerable reform across all our democratic institutions in <Col N="462"/>the near future.  We need a much stronger Parliament, as everyone is saying, and we need a stronger committee system.  I doubt we can or should be trying to address only one aspect of the reform required.</P>
        <P>We must ask ourselves what the Seanad is for.  It is implied in the motion that we do not want to be a second D&aacute;il or a shadow D&aacute;il.  What would be the point in that?  What is the point in having a mini-D&aacute;il upstairs?  The Seanad should have a separate, credible and identifiable role but it is not really clear what that is at present.  The only constitutional role there is for the Seanad is to pass legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When Senator Ross was speaking, he implied it did not matter one way or another whether we pass legislation.  Passing legislation is the only role we have under the Constitution.  It may come as a surprise to Members to know that between the Seanad election in mid-2007 and the middle of 2009, only 40% of the Seanad&rsquo;s sitting time was devoted to legislation.  Unfortunately, I do not have figures for 2010.  The Order of Business took up 25% of the entire sitting time of the House during the period in question.  There cannot be many parliaments in the world whose orders of business account for 25% of sitting time.</P>
        <P>The Order of Business is an opportunity for Members to raise topical issues.  However, as Senator Norris stated, it is a bit much that we do not have a more structured and realistic way to have regular daily debates than engaging in the fiction of having them on the Order of Business.  It does not make sense.  This is a matter we could consider but we just do not seem to be capable of doing so or want to do so.  It ought to be considered.</P>
        <P>Since we resumed six weeks ago, we have not had any Government legislation at all.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs.  It is pretty extraordinary, therefore, that the Minister of State asked about what the House could do to become more efficient.  Many people have questions to answer.</P>
        <P>One possible answer to the question of Seanad reform, which will not be very popular, is that rather than panicking about sitting three days per week and trying to ensure we fill the time with business every day to take away the bad look, we should sit less often.  This should have a financial implication for Members.  Members should be paid for the time they sit here.  I propose this for consideration.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and am glad to have the opportunity to discuss this issue.  As I was listening to the debate, I wished I were a university panel Senator.  A great luxury certainly attaches to the position.  I then decided the only better position would be a Minister.  I reflected further and concluded that it is not bad being a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee either.  Considering the aforementioned question of the constituencies to which Members cling, at least a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee has the country as a constituency.  As with the majority of Members of this House, I am one of the revolting creatures who aspire to getting into the Lower House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I lament the fact that the Government has tabled an amendment to the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with every word of the motion but certainly agree with the feeling behind it.  I listened to the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  When the debate came to this side of the House, enthusiasm became progressively cooler.  Senator Dearey was clearly uncomfortable in making his remarks.  I will bite the bullet and say I am not supporting the Government amendment.  I am going to support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s motion because I believe he is correct in contending that if we do not do anything proper to reform the Seanad, it will be gone.</P>
        <P>I am from a party that believed in the abolition of the Seanad but, having spent some time here and having reflected maturely on the matter, I have come to the conclusion that it has its merits.  However, it needs to be something totally different from what it is.</P>
        <P>I totally disagree with the notion of moving over on the trough in dealing with the university panel seats just to allow those who have a degree access to voting rights in the Chamber.  Change needs to be much more radical.  I like what Senator O&rsquo;Toole has proposed because I believe we need to proceed on a different basis.  As other speakers have said, we should not mirror the D&aacute;il.  The D&aacute;il elects Members for constituencies and it is their duty to represent them.  We have a different duty in this House.</P>
        <P>As a Member of this House, I noticed that one really must have the national interest at heart.  This is one of the reasons I am not going to support the Government amendment.  Opposing the other side of the House, in either direction, for the sake of it is nonsense.  The motion before us is very good and deserves further consideration and support.</P>
        <P>Having been in a political party and being a believer in the political party system of governance, I believe one needs some of the discipline that comes with being in a political party.  This presents its own problem.  Senator Ross spoke about people of the calibre of Ken Whitaker who stood for a certain position in the Seanad, naively or otherwise.  It is great to think he could have been elected but our political system is tribal and its rules operate on a tribal basis.  Unless one is a member of one of the political parties under the current system, one will not get elected.</P>
        <P>I admired Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s honesty in referring to a general failure of Government.  Senator Alex White spoke about this as well.  Let us not be under any illusion about the fact that the Government will always protect the <i>status quo</i>.  I am supporting the Independent Members&rsquo; motion because change will only come from the Independent benches.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, I agree completely with Senator Alex White&rsquo;s comments on the establishment of an independent electoral commission.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is in the other House dealing with the question of the Dublin mayor.  That is not a priority for us at present.  I would prefer if the Minister was bringing forward the Bill relating to the independent electoral commission which the country needs much more than the creation of another layer of government through the establishment of the position of a directly elected mayor for Dublin.</P>
        <P>As previous speakers indicated, the Minister had the opportunity to prove that he would deal with the issue of Seanad reform.  There is no need to reopen the matter because the previous Seanad did a great deal of work on it.  Everyone is aware of what must happen.  The Minister had the opportunity to take action, but he has failed to come back to the House and the people to demonstrate something can be done.  He has illustrated the fact that Seanad <Col N="464"/>reform is not a priority.  It is, therefore, the responsibility of the House to bring about reform.  If, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, the Seanad fulfilled the role originally envisaged for it, it would operate in a much better way.</P>
        <P>There is a degree of antipathy on the part of the public towards the House.  I was interested in Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments on how Fine Gael would put a question to the people in a referendum.  I wonder about the nature of such a question and whether it would be as straightforward as asking whether people were in favour or opposed to Seanad &Eacute;ireann remaining in operation.  The answer to such a question would be an overwhelming no.  That is the reality.  Whether Fine Gael will get the opportunity to put such a question to the people is another matter.</P>
        <P>As previous speakers stated, we have an opportunity to create a dynamic second force in Irish politics which would have greater relevance and in which, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole stressed, ordinary citizens could feel their voice would be heard.  That is the direction in which I would like the House to move.  It is only through reform that this will be achieved.  I hope this debate will progress the type of reform to which I refer and will encourage the Minister, Deputy Gormley, who will be under pressure from his colleagues in the Green Party to bring forward true proposals for reform and establish the independent electoral commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment my colleagues on the Independent benches on tabling the motion.  I have listened to the entire debate up to now and I am of the view that not one new idea has been brought forward.  A number of interesting ideas have been propounded but not a single new one has been offered.  I challenge colleagues to demonstrate that I am incorrect in this regard.</P>
        <P>There has, however, been one interesting and welcome development, namely, the statement by Senator O&rsquo;Malley to the effect that she proposes to cross the floor of the House and vote with the Independents.  The Senator has displayed a remarkable and courageous attitude.  However, she could not have received a more seductive invitation to cross the floor than that offered in the weak, vapid and inane amendment placed on the Supplementary Order Paper by Senator Cassidy whose name is unaccompanied by any of those of his party colleagues which may perhaps reflect their embarrassment regarding the amendment.</P>
        <P>I wish to consider amendment No. 1 in detail.  As usual, it proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and then states the House &ldquo;notes&rdquo;, which means nothing at all will be done.  It notes the deliberations which took place on various proposals, the lack of adequate consensus, the absence of such a consensus, the commitment contained in the renewed programme for Government and blah, blah, blah.  It then resolves to request the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to blah, blah, blah.</P>
        <P>I have been through all of this before and have campaigned on the issue of Seanad reform for 30 years.  It is nearly a quarter of a century since I was elected to the House.  One of the platforms on which I was first elected was reform of the Seanad.  I assure Members nothing has happened during the entire period to which I refer.  Not one scrap or iota of Seanad reform has been introduced.  I accept there has perhaps been some minor and ineffective tinkering at the edges of the Order of Business, but there has been absolutely nothing else.  On my first day as a Senator I tabled a motion in which I welcomed and suggested the implementation of the recommendations of the all-party committee.  Those on the Government side voted down the recommendations to which I refer and which had been brought forward by a committee established by the then Government.  That will inform Members as to the degree of movement they can expect on this issue.</P><Col N="465"/>
        <P>I was later appointed to and sat on the all-party group on Seanad reform chaired by the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  The Minister of State has indicated that not everyone agreed that we should proceed with just reforming the university constituency.  That proposal was made and I am absolutely unapologetic.  The notion that we should tackle the position on the university seats first has often been brought forward.  I respectfully demur from what Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated.  There may perhaps have been a slight blurring in the language he used and he may not entirely have meant what he said.  However, I make no apology whatever for being a member of the only democratic element in the House.  University Senators do have constituencies, of 65,000 and 110,000.  Senator Dearey made a most engaging contribution and was humble in a way to which I could only aspire.  However, he was elected by the votes of only 237 people.  I find it difficult to take lessons from an apparatus which produces elections in which candidates need only 237 votes when people such as Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I are required to attract the votes of tens of thousands of individuals.  I apologise if what I am saying appears to be arrogant in nature, but it is also a fact.</P>
        <P>Having dealt with the amendment, I wish to proceed to the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  She stated &ldquo;I am pleased to set out the Government&rsquo;s position on the matters in question.&rdquo;  Where have we heard that before?  We hear it every night on radio and television when people state &ldquo;I am glad you asked me that question,&rdquo; which in reality means they are not glad at all and are going to provide a completely wooly response.  That is, of course, what happens.  The Minister of State also referred to the all-party group on Seanad reform chaired by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, but stated &ldquo;a number of detailed issues must be addressed with regard to implementing possible changes in this area.&rdquo;  Translation: one should not hold one&rsquo;s breath because nothing is going to happen.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State then began to wander around various areas of the Constitution, stating an enabling amendment would be required, that the higher education constituency would have to be expanded, etc.  I absolutely applaud and support the latter.  However, it must be managed efficiently and properly and reflect the interests not only of Seanad &Eacute;ireann but also those of voters.</P>
        <P>I stated not one new idea had been expounded during the debate.  However, Senator O&rsquo;Toole did bring forward a fairly new idea &mdash; it represents the most valuable suggestion made during the entire debate &mdash; namely, the creation of a hybrid method of election in respect of the panel system.  He suggested some element of contact with local authorities could be retained but that the other sections of the panels could be broadened to encompass universal suffrage.  That is the way to proceed because it would make Seanad &Eacute;ireann truly representative.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the commitment to establish an independent electoral commission.  It is just that &mdash; a commitment.  I once heard a very decent Leader of the House, former Senator Mick Lanigan, give a commitment to Senator O&rsquo;Toole which he then failed to honour.  The Senator will confirm that Mr. Lanigan accepted that he had given a commitment but that it was not binding.  We know, therefore, how much commitments are worth.  The electoral commission is not even in existence but Ministers are relying on it to defend their position.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made a number of interesting comments.  For example, she referred to &ldquo;making recommendations on the feasibility of extending the franchise for Presidential elections to the Irish abroad,&rdquo; to which I say, &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;  However, the franchise should not just be extended to the Irish abroad, it should also be extended to the Irish on this island.  People who are citizens of the Irish Republic and live north of the Border are prohibited from voting in Presidential elections.  Members are probably asking why I am referring to the Presidential <Col N="466"/>election.  I am doing so because I am interested in it and my hat is in the ring.  If anyone did not know that, they do now.</P>
        <P>Since we have wandered into this area and given that we are discussing democracy, a recent poll carried out by MillwardBrown Lansdowne indicates that my level of support among members of the public is greater than that of the next two candidates put together.  However, I may never be able to enter the contest for the Presidency because the political parties control the mechanism of election.  In order to stand, I would require the support of either 20 Members of the Oireachtas or at least four county or city councils.  If the political parties believe in democracy, they should take steps to prove it by removing the rigid application of the Whip in order to allow councillors to make an independent determination in this matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has referred to whether we are content to have the House viewed as some sort of debating society.  I am all in favour of such societies.  However, the Minister of State displayed some cheek when she said the House really was a debating society and asked whether it could play a more meaningful role.  We could if the Government produced legislation.  There are more than a dozen items of legislation from this side of the House; every single one of my Independent colleagues has placed legislation before the House.  That takes work, determination and expertise.</P>
        <P>I respectfully disagree with Senator Alex White who said we should reduce the time involved.  That would be the death of the Seanad.  If we were to reduce it further, we would be a total laughing stock.  The work we do does not just take place in the Chamber.  Colleagues on both sides of the House work 14 to 18 hours a day and I do not want to work for nothing.  I want decent, modest recompense.  I want my work to be recognised, not just financially.  I want people to know about it because I sometimes leave here at midnight.  On my way home I hear repeats of programmes in which radio broadcasters say the Seanad does a day and a half&rsquo;s work in the few weeks it meets.  Lots of us work hard in this place and we deserve respect.</P>

        <P>To put the record straight, when I became a Member of the House in 1982, the Seanad sat for about half a day every week.  The situation changed and colleagues now on the Independent benches should know that in 1987 it sat for about a day and a half each week.  It now sits three days a week.  The business conducted today is completely different from that which was conducted 25 or 30 years ago.</P>
        <P>On the opportunity to initiate a Bill, 25 or 30 years ago it would have been cause for a celebration for Members of the House if one Bill a year was initiated in the Seanad.  In 2008, 30% of all legislation was initiated in this House and 1,201 amendments were proposed and accepted by the Ministers of the day.  The priority of the House is to deal with legislation.  Senator Alex White is correct when he outlines our constitutional obligations as Senators.</P>
        <P>Since I became Leader in 1997, I remember only two occasions on which the debates on Bills had to be guillotined.  That is our great strength, as I keep on saying.  All Bills in the D&aacute;il, because of time constraints and the fact that there are 166 Deputies, cannot be debated in full and it has to guillotine the debates on Bills at some stage, but that does not happen in the Seanad.  We are the protector&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-of the Legislature, the Constitution and the taxpayer, for which we make no apologies to anybody.</P>
        <P>It was said in this House that Fianna F&aacute;il was holding up the review of the reform of the Seanad.  That is not true.  I am holding the Fianna F&aacute;il submission made, with those of other colleagues, parties and groups, and it is now with the Minister who has given due consideration to it.  It is definitely not the fault of the major Government party, Fianna F&aacute;il, which accounts for almost 50% of the membership of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>In regard to how we are elected or selected from panels, let us wait and see what the findings of the Government&rsquo;s deliberations are.  We have made a contribution.  I take in good faith what Independent colleagues have said about their electorates with a turnout of 30% or 34%.  We cannot justify this because under the panel system there was a turnout of 98.5% in the last seven general elections to the Seanad.  That is the highest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It was said some colleagues on the university panels were promoting themselves with a vote of 2,500.  I received 7,500 votes but did not win a D&aacute;il seat.  Let us put <Col N="468"/>everything into proper perspective.  The people we represent are the most hard-working and decent of people, each of whom represents, on average, 1,000 people.  We are democratically elected.  If there was to be a change, I would love to see at least five or ten members of the Northern Assembly represented here and to have a 32-county Parliament.  People who have gone before me would dearly have loved to have seen it during their lifetimes.  If there is to be change, we will embrace it and do everything we possibly can to assist in the process.  There is not a day that goes by on the Order of Business without demands and requests being made to me for debates to take place.  The debate today on overcrowding in our prisons had to be rolled over.  I cannot accede to requests made on the Order of Business for a debate to take place on the same day because I have to consult with Ministers.  They might need to be in Brussels or Luxembourg.  Members, therefore, have to be reasonable.  I welcome the debate and thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for placing the motion on the Order Paper.</P>
        <P>I have served here with some very distinguished colleagues, including the late Jim Dooge, Seamus Mallon and the late Gordon Wilson, whom I sat beside.  I highlight the fact that Charles Haughey acknowledged and appointed Members from Northern Ireland, including Seamus Mallon and Gordon Wilson.  Other Taoisigh did the same.</P>
        <P>This House is necessary and has a great future.  In our review perhaps we should also examine whether proceedings could be broadcast live for at least one hour a week to let the people see the great work being done in the House on a daily basis.</P>

        <P>The concept behind the House was correct back in 1937 when Eamon de Valera held the view that there was a need for a second Chamber.  What he tried to put together was a House that would represent different vocational interests.  Unfortunately, the manner in which he put it together meant it did not work in the way envisaged and we have ended up with a Chamber which is not performing as well as it should because, to a very large extent, we now have political parties which do not give their members freedom to vote in the way they would like.  The benefit of the House comes, to a large extent, from having Independent Senators, most of whom are elected from the university panels.</P>
        <P>I have stated previously that I do not believe the Seanad needs more power.  If we do, we should earn it ourselves and we have the ability to do so.  There are examples.  Senator Norris has stated each of the Independent Senators has brought forward legislation.  I am looking forward to the Construction Contract Bill passing through the House in a couple of weeks&rsquo; time, as it is a Bill that will bring considerable benefits and I only hope we can get it through quickly enough for it to become law.  I am not in favour of having a more confrontational Seanad.  We have learned during the years how we can benefit from debates, but we must work together in doing so.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">The Seanad has what political scientists call &ldquo;output legitimacy&rdquo;, which means it does work that is relevant and effective and has done so during the years.  However, it lacks input legitimacy because the way in which Senators, particularly from the vocational panels, are elected lacks credibility.  The vocational panels were originally designed to produce Members with experience and expertise, but they have been rendered much less representative largely because <Col N="469"/>of the manner in which Members are elected.  If we are to achieve greater recognition, we must focus on the way Members of the Seanad are elected.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole has proposed, we need reform that goes beyond merely changing the way university Senators are elected.  I agree fully that university graduates not currently represented should be entitled to vote in all Seanad elections by next year.  We do not need a constitutional referendum to do this because that constitutional amendment has already been agreed to.</P>
        <P>There was an interesting article by Mr. Neil Callanan in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> recently in which he made the point that two Ministers could be appointed to the Cabinet from the Upper House, but the stipulation is that they cannot be made Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste or Minister of Finance.  That is acceptable.  Perhaps we should look at increasing that quota instead of abolishing the Seanad, although we do not need to increase it because the provision is only used on rare occasions.  There is an opportunity to bring into the House using that system persons with more experience and I do not refer only to business persons, although I certainly include them.  One need only look at the example of Sir Philip Green who was recently brought on board by the new British Government and who suggested he could cut &pound;20 billion from the cost of the public sector.  He is a successful businessman, but one could say Mr. Colm McCarthy has done something similar here.  Therefore, there are things we could do and we should do them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The attractions in increasing the Seanad representation at the Cabinet table are obvious.  There would be no direct answering to constituents.  Successful persons would be like those in the United States who the President brings on board in the Cabinet and who do not rely on the votes of constituents.  Therefore, they are able to act in the best interests of the state, in the way somebody running a business acts in the best interests of its customers.  In the newspaper article Mr. Callanan made the valid point which I have made on many previous occasions that we simply did not have enough persons with real world experience at the Cabinet table.  Instead, we have career politicians, many of whom have inherited seats, in many cases from their fathers, and who do not have outside experience, which I would like to see.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that some in New Zealand are pushing for the reinstatement of the Senate.  Earlier this year the New Zealand Policy Unit of the Centre for Independent Studies proposed an election to a Senate in 2011.  It proposed an Upper House with 31 seats, with members being elected using a proportional list system by region, with the members of the House of Representatives with 79 seats being elected using a first past the post system; in other words, there would be a contrast between the two.  The New Zealand Senate was abolished in 1951, but the report on its reinstatement states importantly that one of New Zealand&rsquo;s constitutional problems is that it is too easy to pass laws quickly and without proper authority and that having a Senate would provide a publicly visible role for Senators in revising legislation such that those deciding to block or support certain laws would be politically compelled to explain their decisions to the public.  New Zealand is one of the few countries which has a system based on the Westminster form of government.  It is one of the few that had a bicameral system &mdash; as we do to a certain extent &mdash; that decided to abolish its Senate but is now planning to reinstate it.  It reminds us that the Seanad serves an important function.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased to support Senator OToole&rsquo;s worthwhile proposal.  Like so many other institutions, the Seanad can be improved and modernised.  I urge the Government to take on board the calls made in this House to take action on the issue.  It has not done so tonight.  I am disappointed at what I heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Brady.  There are steps that have been suggested that are reminders of what could take place, one of which, suggested by Senator Ross, was holding the elections to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on the same day.  That would make sense.  It would be logical to do so and one would not need a constitutional change.  Neither do we need a constitutional change to bring on board graduates of the University of <Col N="470"/>Limerick and DCU.  I like the concept proposed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole because it suggests, &ldquo;Let us shake this up.  We can turn this into a worthwhile Chamber.&rdquo;  We can make it one that would be regarded highly because we will earn that right.  I, therefore, urge the Government to respond positively to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s motion, not in way it has responded tonight but with enthusiasm and support.</P>

	<P>I compliment Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Ross on raising this issue again in the Seanad.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole did so previously, with the support of his colleagues on the Independent benches.  However, I wonder whether it is an exercise in futility as this is the third such debate since I was elected in 2007.  On the first occasion the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, spoke confidently that by Christmas of that year legislation would be brought forward and that in the next election to the Seanad, so far as the university seats were concerned, there would be a wider pool of graduates.  Within a year we had a second debate.  This time the Minister had pulled in his horns enormously.  He was much more cautious about making predictions about whether and when there would be change.  Now in a way that is laughable the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power &mdash; I mean no disrespect to him as he is a man of accomplishment and ability, but he is not the Minister in charge &mdash; has been sent to tell us the bad news that there will be no progress made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We have moved from being somewhat hopeful to very disappointed to massively disappointed and it seems that amounts to progress around here.  It is regrettable that, given all the reports that have been produced during the years involving Members of this House and the efforts of Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others to advance the issue, we are being mocked, not only by the failure to obtain clarity on what will happen and when, but also by the technique the Government sometimes uses in picking out and rubbishing a small net point in what has been proposed in order to be seen to be making a substantive argument.</P>
        <P>The example I want to pick is the pathetic argument and sheer waste of time by the Government in addressing the point that Senator O&rsquo;Toole is proposing an increase in the overall number of Members of the Seanad, albeit by one, rather than five as previously proposed.  It makes a mockery of the debate to focus on such a point and engage in posturing in respect of concern for the public purse.  God knows the Government has wasted enough money and I need not recount the various white elephants about which the public has heard in recent years.  Spending time on making such a pathetic argument shows how little thought has been given the Government&rsquo;s response to the motion.  It is very disappointing.  Everybody knows we would be happy with a Seanad with 60 Members, if only there was a proper system for electing its Members.</P>
        <P>We must accept that our parliamentary system has fallen into disrepute in recent years.  There is widespread awareness of how the Oireachtas has failed to hold the Government to account.  We can look at the economic crisis and can see instances of how the hard questions were not asked, either by backbenchers on the Government side or by Opposition Members.  We have a weak parliamentary system and there seems to be no will to change it.  In this context, I would like to state that, unlike some of my colleagues, I believe we do need to strengthen the role of the Seanad.  As our parliamentary system has failed to hold the Government to account, let us look at giving more powers to the Seanad.  Let us look at a future where the Seanad might vote against Government legislation and the sky would not fall, much less the Government.  If Senators were allowed to vote against Government legislation, they might be less subject to the party Whip and in that way there might be a genuine debate about <Col N="471"/>proposals instead of the nod and wink when we make sensible suggestions on legislation and a Minister glances at his or her civil servants who say &ldquo;no can do&rdquo; and the Minister offers a glib refusal without ever engaging intellectually or in any substantive way with what has actually been proposed.</P>
        <P>We should look at a strengthened Seanad which would not merely scrutinise public appointments or prison visitation committees, although we could certainly usefully spend some time doing this type of work, but would also have the power to knock down badly thought out or problematic legislation.  This will only happen if we change the way the Seanad is elected, making it more directly accountable to the people and in some way seeking to mitigate the negative aspects of the party Whip system as it operates in the other House.  We should take seriously the idea that the Seanad should be a forum for people with alternative and varied ideas about issues who would have the power to force back legislation if it was desired to do so.</P>
        <P>Somebody mentioned one could not justify how the House of Lords was selected but often it manages to do the job.  Turning back legislation happens more often in Britain, where legislation from the House of Commons is turned back by the House of Lords.  Sometimes it even suits the House of Commons to hide behind the skirt of the House of Lords, so to speak.  The Leader would have a conniption if the Government even lost a vote on the Order of Business, on something as pathetic as that.  This is not taking democracy seriously; it is contributing to the circumstances whereby we are a laughing stock among the public.  It is simply no argument for the Leader to state the low turnout in graduate elections for university seats is relevant when he claims 99% or 99.5% vote under the panel system.  Be honest with people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>They are rotten boroughs.  Of course, they must all vote because to my knowledge they must consult each other and sometimes I believe people are even made to show how they will exercise their franchise in what is a further mockery of democratic practice.  It is true to state the current system of electing six university Senators in the way we do is a scandal and does look elitist.  However, it looks all the more elitist when the other vocational sectors are not given a chance to be involved directly in the election of Senators.  It would look less elitist if Members from the other vocational panels, including the Agricultural and Industrial and Commercial Panels, were voted in by those sectors of the community.</P>

	<P>Then we would have an acceptable third level graduate franchise.  I will not make any claims about the particular contribution the university senators have made during the years; they have simply done their duty.  However, it further brings the Houses and our system of government into disrepute that we had a referendum in 1979 providing for the introduction of legislation that would widen it and it still has not happened.  It is embarrassing for every university Senator when we canvass people whose degree is as good as our own but who cannot vote in Seanad elections because of an out-of-date system.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.3- ?><P>We are very fortunate in some of the Senators we have, not only those on the university benches; they come through this rather corrupt and outdated system.  We are very fortunate to have Members such as the Acting Chairman, Senator Ormonde, whom I have heard make very interesting and insightful points on a range of issues.  The same goes for Senator O&rsquo;Malley and the Leader.  The fact is they come through a system which is unjustifiable.  We just happen to <Col N="472"/>be lucky.  We all know there is another side to the way in which Senators are elected from the other panels which involves from time to time patronage and other things about which we should not speak too much lest we anger the public even more.</P>
        <P>Let us have a serious attitude in favour of necessary change.  Let us take seriously the anger and be more philosophical about the way our democracy is working.  Let us be honest enough to say that just because we have always done it this way does not make it right.  Why not have genuine engagement by the Government and the Houses on making the Seanad more fit for purpose and regaining some of the trust and respect of the public, to which we would be entitled if we were working in the way we should?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for the time given to the motion and the various speakers who contributed.  It has been a very interesting debate, but I am totally discouraged.  I have spent 24 years trying to make movement on this issue, but no movement has taken place.  I am glad Senator Mullen made his concluding points.  My criticism of the system of election is not to be taken as a criticism of the people who come through that system.  I completely agree with the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Malley and others that it is quite in order and to be welcomed that people aspire to move to another House of the Oireachtas, be it the Presidency or the D&aacute;il.  I do not have a problem with this.  I also welcome Members who have been Members of the D&aacute;il.  For me, these are not the issues.  The issues are the ones about which I spoke.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross stated we were in danger of extinction.  I value very much the contribution of local authority members.  One of the problems is the lack of power at local authority level.  If I had time, I would develop this further because I feel as strongly about it as I do about the situation in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The speech made by the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, was appalling.  Senator Mullen made the point that it was a mockery.  He also made a simple point about the extra Member.  If one reads very carefully one will see it would not be an extra Member; I pointedly did not indicate how that person &mdash; the Cathaoirleach &mdash; would be returned.  I could give five or six ways in which that person could be returned without increasing numbers.  I was very careful not to increase them in order that it would not be jumped on as a simple way of having a go.  It was jumped on anyway, which I regret.  For me, the most serious matter about the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, is that we now realise the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has not reported to the Government on the outcome of our meetings.  That is appalling.</P>
        <P>Senator Deary made the point that the motion did not go far enough.  I could make a speech about all of the &ldquo;does not go far enough&rdquo; speeches I have heard during the years.  This is an incremental attempt to effect change.  The same applies to the speech of the Minister of State; of course, there are things we could do on our own.  I found it a bit much to listen to the Minister of State say the House could do much more itself.  I will agree with Leader that he would make many changes here &mdash; not as many as I would like &mdash; but he does not have the agreement of the Government.  That is the reality.  I know this to be the case.  If we were allowed to change things, we could change them in the way many want.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White raised the question of how we would operate and on what we spend our time.  He is right.  I will gently add to one point he made about the amount of time spent on the Order of Business.  He is absolutely right about the amount of time we spend on it but it is time well spent.  Other Parliaments such as the Bundestag spend the first hour or hour and <Col N="473"/>a half dealing with the topical issues of the day; they do not call it the Order of Business, which would be a more sensible way to deal with it.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White is also absolutely right in the point he made about a petitions committee, which would fit in completely with what I stated about us reflecting civic society.  Many Parliaments have such a committee and we have seen it in action.  We have proposed a Standing Order in order that we could put one into operation in the morning.  There are only minor reasons it could not be done.  It might cost marginal amounts of money.  I have seen committees work where ordinary people with ordinary issues come before a committee of a House of Parliament to make their point.  Petitions committees do not have the power to effect<?oasys _jy ?>change.</P>
        <P>The point on which I take greatest issue with the Minister of State concerns her comment about this being a high quality debating society.  That is the saddest comment I heard all night long.  One could say the same to a senior counsel going into the courts.  He or she makes an argument with no power, except the power of persuasion.  It is the person who hears the argumentation that makes the decision.  If a Minister of State does not understand this, is it any wonder I am discouraged because we are not going anywhere?  I do not mind a Minister of State arguing and stating he or she does not agree with me.</P>
     
        <P>If this House cannot produce a debate of high quality with argumentation and persuasion, it is up to him or her to respond.  If he or she does not respond, there is no point in him or her saying this House is only a debating society.  This proves the point that no thought is being applied.</P>
        <P>I welcome very much what Senator O&rsquo;Malley had to say and her offer of support which is deeply appreciated.  I am not surprised because she is a woman who has always been independent-minded and expressed a point of view.</P>
        <P>On the issue of broadening the electorate, I assure the Members opposite they do not need to be afraid of everything.  For instance, if I may be excused for referring to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; as an example, he is elected from the Cultural and Educational Panel.  He would be elected on an extended Cultural and Educational Panel if educationists and those involved in Irish culture had votes.  I want people to think that way, but the Members opposite are afraid of what I am saying.  There are opportunities here, not just threats and crises.</P>
        <P>I visited the New Zealand Parliament where they had invented measures to slow down the passage of Bills by introducing extra Stages.  There were seven Stages to a Bill which gave more time for debate.</P>
        <P>I will be unable in the time remaining to deal with all of the issues raised, except to say this House could bridge the gap between the people and the political system.  We could be the conduit between them.  This could prove exciting, challenging and effective, as well as restore faith, trust and confidence in what we do.  There is nothing to be afraid of.  I would be prepared to do this in a way that would help everybody.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I ask that the university panels issue be dealt with, but, in deference to my colleagues opposite, that rather than make the changes for the next election, they should not take effect until the following election in order that there would be more than one term to prepare.  In the meantime ordinary people would have an opportunity to make their commitment.  All citizens would have an opportunity to vote, but they would have to decide which voting panel to which they belonged.  For instance, a person who is a graduate but also a farmer, a trade unionist and an ordinary citizen would still only have one vote and he or she would have to choose the panel for which they would register.  This would allow younger people to be given a vote if this was so decided.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State and hope she has a good response for me.</P>
        <P>The matter I am raising relates to a proposal mooted by the Minister for Social Protection sometime ago to means-test the State contributory pension.  Does he propose to deprive people of something for which they have already paid, in some cases for more than 40 years or more in others, and which, in itself, is subject to levies?</P>
        <P>I will outline the reasons many people who have contributed to a State pension scheme believe this proposal is patently unfair and perhaps would be open to legal action.  Apart from the consequent hardship, there is a potential grave injustice for a number of reasons, the first of which is that the State contributory pension is not a gratuity.  It has been paid for over a period ranging up to 50 years.  On the other hand, senior civil servants and public representatives such as ourselves can receive substantial indexed-linked pensions towards the cost of which we pay nothing.</P>
        <P>The second reason is a qualified adult allowance is payable to spouses.  For example, a wife with no income or entitlement is already means-tested.  It would be truly shocking if a wife who has devoted, say, 40 years to her family in the home was now to be deprived of the only income she receives in her own right.</P>
        <P>The third reason is that most privately funded occupational pension schemes have been integrated with the PRSI system, with the employer paying 10.75% in PRSI on a full salary, in addition to the employee&rsquo;s contribution.  The removal of the State contributory pension from some employees would have serious financial consequences for already hardpressed employers.</P><Col N="476"/>
        <P>The fourth reason is that many people are fearful about the future in terms of their occupational pension, given the state of the stock market.  It is common to hear pensioners say they will at least always have the State pension.</P>
        <P>The excuse used for considering means testing the contributory State pension is to protect the vulnerable.  There are few people more vulnerable than people aged in their 70s who depend on a private occupational pension.  Many of the individuals in question must support unemployed adult children.  As the Minister of State is aware, private occupational pensions are subject to the vagaries of the market.</P>
        <P>The contributory State pension is already subject to full PAYE tax assessment.  In addition, pensioners already pay levies &mdash; PAYE and the health contribution &mdash; on occupational pensions.  At least this approach is fair as it applies to everyone above a certain minimum income.</P>
        <P>The essence of means testing is that anyone having a private pension income in excess of a specified threshold will not receive any additional income from the State.  In other words, if the Minister for Social Protection introduces means testing of private pensions, many pensioners will lose the contributory State pension, despite the pension having been paid for.  Depriving some people of something which has been paid for is unfair and of doubtful legality.</P>
        <P>There is an even greater potential for unfairness when one makes other comparisons.  For example, will a senior civil servant on an index linked pension of &euro;142,000 per annum and a tax free lump sum of &euro;630,000, for which he or she has not paid, have his or her pension reduced to a specified amount per annum?  The Minister of State will be aware of the types of people I have in mind, including the likes of Rody Molloy and the former Financial Regulator, Mr. Neary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should refrain from referring by name to individuals outside the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Furthermore, we have the example of the Government executing a U-turn on proposed cuts in the pay of senior civil servants last December.  As a result, the civil servants in question managed to avoid income levies.  One then wonders why people are cynical.</P>
        <P>The proposal to means test pensions is stupid and unjust and should go the way of many reports, namely, into the dustbin.  As in many other cases, it aims at soft targets while avoiding the privileged.  Given that the contributory State pension is already subject to PAYE and levies, the proposed measure would yield little while adding a new layer of bureaucracy.  Depending on the value of a person&rsquo;s pension, the proposal would render some people eligible for a medical card, causing the Government another problem.  It would also cause great hardship to people who lose their occupational pensions due to poor investment returns.  The grossest injustice would be to deprive home-making wives of the only independent income they have enjoyed.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish system of social protection is often described as a mixed system.  It combines a social insurance system whereby entitlement to contingency based benefits is secured largely on the basis of paid contributions linked with earnings income, with a system of social assistance whereby entitlement for similar contingency based payments is made on the basis of an assessment of the person&rsquo;s means.</P><Col N="477"/>
        <P>The social insurance system is based on two fundamental principles, namely, the contributory principle whereby there is a direct link between contributions paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions that are payable as a right if and when particular contingencies arise, and the solidarity principle whereby contributions paid by insured persons are not actuarially linked to benefits but are instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  It is an expression of solidarity between both earning groups and generations.</P>
        <P>The system maintains a relationship between labour force status, earnings from work, contributions made and entitlement to benefits in the event of certain specified contingencies such as illness, unemployment or old age.  As with many social insurance systems throughout the world, the Irish social insurance system is based on the pay as one goes principle, whereby current contributors fund the pensions and benefits of present recipients, namely, previous contributors, while building up entitlement to their own future benefits, in turn paid for by future contributors.</P>
        <P>The current qualifying conditions for contributory State pension require a person to have entered into insurable employment before age 56, have at least 260 weeks full-rate contributions paid, that is, a minimum of five years minimum and a yearly average of at least ten contributions recorded, taking paid and credited PRSI contributions into account, from 1953 or from the date of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
        <P>To qualify for the maximum rate a yearly average of 48 contributions is required.  From 6 April 2012, and as provided for in legislation since 1997, the minimum number of paid contributions required for contributory State pension will increase from 260 to 520, that is, ten years.  As the Senator will note, there is no requirement to have 40 years contributions to receive a full rate pension and many pensioners had considerably less than that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has committed to endeavouring to maintain the value of the State pension at 35% of average earnings.  The national pensions framework, launched in March this year, outlines Government policy on future pension provision.  The Framework includes a number of changes to the State pension to make it more transparent, simple and equitable for those who reach pension age.</P>
        <P>Recognising that people are living longer and healthier lives, the Government has decided to amend State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension (transition) will be abolished.  The effect of this will be to standardise State pension age at 66 years.  In 2021, the State pension age will be set at 67 years.  In 2028, State pension age will be set at 68 years.</P>
        <P>For those who wish to postpone drawing down their State pension, arrangements will be put in place to enable them to receive an actuarially increased benefit when they decide to retire.  In addition, for those with contribution shortfalls at pension age, arrangements will be put in place to allow them to receive additional benefit at a later date if they continue to make paid contributions for pension purposes while remaining in work or self-employment.</P>
        <P>From 2012 onwards, social insurance credits will be introduced for people who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  This will replace the current homemaker&rsquo;s disregard and will assist people, particularly women, to qualify for a contributory pension or higher level of payment.</P>
        <P>From 2020, the way in which eligibility for State pension is calculated will be simplified.  Specifically, there will be a switch from the way in which pensions are currently calculated over the average working life.  Under the new system, the level of pension paid will be based on the total number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  A person will need to make contributions for 30 years to qualify for a maximum pension.  Once a person has the minimum number of paid contributions required, he or she will accumulate one thirtieth of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum 30 years.  Upon <Col N="478"/>introduction of the total contributions approach, the maximum number of credits that can be used for pension purposes will be set at 520.</P>
        <P>An implementation group for the national pensions framework has been established by the Department of Social Protection and is working through the relevant issues in implementing the measures contained in the framework.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that there is no proposal to means test pensions.  On the budget, the Minister is engaged in an intensive round of consultations with a wide range of welfare representative organisations and is listening carefully to their views.  In an uncertain international environment, the priority will be to ensure the overall Government strategy is advanced to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead.</P>

She should also note that it was an uncertain national environment and not only an uncertain international environment that brought us to this juncture.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this important matter.  As her background is in education, she will be only too aware of the importance of a comfortable physical environment for the teaching of children in schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise this matter on behalf of all the stakeholders involved in Portlaw national school, County Waterford, including the pupils, staff, parents council, board of management and patron.  The school is of medium size, is attended by almost 240 students and has 14 teaching staff, as well as ancillary staff.  Historically, there used to be both a boys national school and a girls school run by the Sisters of Mercy at this location.  While I publicly acknowledge the enormous contribution to education of the Sisters of Mercy, some years ago the girls school closed and the schools were amalgamated.  The boys national school was extended and I acknowledge the investment by the Government in various extensions to that school over the years.  The site of the closed girls national school lies directly adjacent to the existing school, is available for an extension and everything is ready to go.  Unfortunately, the position to date is that three prefabs operate on the school site, one of which is a special unit for the hearing impaired.  Another very important point in today&rsquo;s climate is that such a large school lacks a general purpose hall for the congregation of pupils, either for sport or for general events.  This is an important facility for any school and should be provided by the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My information is that the application for a new extension to the school goes back as far as 2002.  Although many surveys have been conducted and the relevant information has been provided, the project appears to have met a barrier at this point because no clear direction is being given by departmental officials.  I understand the preferred option is the renovation of the old girls school.  However, many conservation issues arise in that regard because it is on the Minister&rsquo;s list and probably will be protected in the future.  Moreover, it is not the cheapest solution to the provision of an extension and this is where confusion has arisen.  I am aware the board of management has sought numerous opportunities to meet departmental officials to try to make progress on the project but unfortunately they are not getting the requisite co-operation.</P>
        <P>The population projections for this area and this town are increasing continually, which is acknowledged in the various county development plans and in the town&rsquo;s local area plan.  Consequently, there will be an even greater need in the future for a proper, permanent school <Col N="479"/>structure in this town.  I am hopeful the Minister of State may have some good news that may further this project.  I understand this school, which has waited for so many years, already is in the Department&rsquo;s priority one band.  For that reason, I hope to get good news from the Minister of State and that the school eventually can see the commencement of its new extension, which would provide a good, permanent and comfortable physical environment for pupils and staff and would stimulate the local economy and create employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank Senator Coffey for the opportunity to outline to the House the Department&rsquo;s position relating to the application for improved accommodation from Portlaw national school, County Waterford.  This school is a co-educational and fully vertical national school that operates under the patronage of the Bishop of Waterford and Lismore.  Based on the 2009 school returns, the school had an enrolment of 232 pupils, which represents an increase of 4% over the previous five years.  The school has a core staffing level of a principal and nine mainstream teachers, as well as a number of support staff.  The school also has a special class for hearing impaired pupils.</P>
        <P>The school authority has applied to the Department for major capital funding to provide for an extension and to refurbish its existing accommodation.  As the Senator will be aware, all applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  There are four band ratings under the criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves though the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  As the Senator correctly stated, Portlaw national school&rsquo;s application was assessed and was assigned a Band rating of 1.2.  The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme for 2011 and subsequent years.  However, in light of the competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at Portlaw national school at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the meantime, however, the Department has provided funding for the school to cater for the interim accommodation needs.  The school&rsquo;s current accommodation consists of seven permanent mainstream classrooms plus two temporary mainstream classrooms that were installed between 2006 and 2009, as well as a unit for the hearing impaired class which was installed in 2005.  Under the 2010 summer works scheme, the Department approved funding for the complete replacement of windows at the school.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senator for raising this matter and assure him that the Department will continue to work with the school authority regarding its accommodation needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the Minister of State&rsquo;s response but unfortunately I already was familiar with much of its content.  The school is lucky to have teaching staff of the highest order who provide the best of education.  However, the Minister of State&rsquo;s response acknowledged that this school has a band priority of 1.2.  While I understand there is great <Col N="480"/>competition for budgets and funding at present, this school has been waiting for a number of years and already is in a high priority band.  I ask the Minister of State to revert to her senior Minister, who at the very least should ask the departmental officials in the planning and building unit to engage with the board of management to enable it to set in train a plan or project in which the various stages were known, because there has been no engagement whatsoever for almost two years.  This would be a start and were the Minister of State able to arrange this, it would be appreciated.</P>

    <Title>Palliative Care Services</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday morning, the people of County Donegal were shocked by what they learned on Highland Radio, the local radio station.  The shock did not come from the news that former Deputy James McDaid had resigned from the D&aacute;il but from an announcement by Dr. Donal Martin, the consultant in palliative medicine at Donegal Hospice, in which he informed the listeners to the &ldquo;Shaun Doherty Show&rdquo; that Donegal Hospice would close its doors to new admissions from 21 December onwards.  I did not hear the interview but have had the opportunity to speak to Dr. Martin in recent hours.  He has informed me of the reasons he made such a statement and I understand he also issued a letter that was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.</P>
        <P>Dr. Martin claims the HSE has been running down funding of Donegal Hospice over a number of years.  He informed me that since 2003, Donegal Hospice has seen a reduction in its nursing staff of 50% from 18 to nine.  Recently, it has had its secretarial services scaled down to one day per week and its receptionist, who is on sick leave at present, has not been replaced.  In addition, catering and cleaning staff numbers have been reduced at the hospice.  He spoke about the need for savings and about how it is important for the Government to find savings in the budgetary environment in which we find ourselves.  He mentioned how in the past there were empty beds that could not be filled because the rooms in which they were located were not cleaned because of the absence of cleaning staff.</P>
        <P>The reason for the most recent announcement is that the HSE is refusing to fill the vacancy that will arise as a result of the expiration of the contract of one of the hospice&rsquo;s junior doctors in December.  Dr. Martin informs me and has claimed on the radio show that he cannot operate Donegal Hospice at a safe level without three junior doctors and one consultant.  Moreover, he states this is not simply his own view but is grounded in the recommendations of a committee that was established in 2001, namely, the National Advisory Council on Palliative Care.  The Government has endorsed this council and its recommendations, one of which was that to be run safely, hospices should be run on the basis of one consultant and three junior doctors.  I note the Minister for Health and Children has withdrawn services from the north west on the grounds that they could not be run safely.  This news has been met with outrage and anger, much of which has been focused on the consultant himself for stating on Highland Radio that this facility was to close.  He, in his defence, will say he cannot operate it safely and that it is within the HSE guidelines that he forms that opinion.</P>
        <P>We need clarification.  First, will Donegal Hospice be able to continue to function for new admissions after 21 December 2010?  With that in mind, I ask the Minister of State to refer to the fact that the consultant is the only person who can allow new admissions.  If he says he will not allow admissions to happen because the hospice cannot operate safely, how do we get beyond that point?  Second, can an eight-bed hospice run safely and provide services with only two junior doctors?  I understand the HSE is talking about negotiations with staff and that there are issues about pay bills and so on.  We have launched the Sinn F&eacute;in pre-budget submission and we have made it clear that public sector workers should not earn in excess of &euro;100,000.</P><Col N="481"/>
        <P>The Government must take decisions in terms of the budget but my concern is not about what doctors are paid.  It is whether new admissions to the hospice will be allowed after 21 December and how that will be brought about if the consultant, who is the only person with authority to receive new admissions, is refusing to do so, not on a whim but because he cannot operate the system safely.  Who in their right mind would allow a system to operate for people at their most vulnerable time if it could not be operated safely?  Those are the questions we need to ask.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the importance of a functioning palliative care service that reduces hospital inpatient stay by 25% and emergency department attendance by 40%.  It is crucial that we continue to have this service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to my earlier point.  The number of nurses has been cut by half from 18 to nine, the secretary&rsquo;s hours have been cut to one day a week, the receptionist has not been replaced, the catering staff have been scaled back and that only cooked chilled food is served, the cleaning staff have been reduced to the extent that some rooms cannot be occupied because they are not clean, and now the number of junior doctors has been reduced.  Is there an agenda for the HSE to downgrade Donegal Hospice and force its ultimate closure?  I hope the Minister of State can give positive news and allay the fears of the people of Donegal.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention the huge work done by people in Donegal and by people from Donegal in other countries who have raised money for Donegal Hospice, and the committee at the heart of Donegal Hospice which has done Trojan voluntary work.  Without their work the hospice would not be where it is today.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Doherty for raising this issue.  It provides me with an opportunity to update the House on this matter.</P>
        <P>Government policy in relation to palliative care is contained in the 2001 report of the national advisory committee on palliative care.  The provision of modern, quality services remains high on the Government agenda and is reflected in various significant policy and service developments in recent years.  In this context, more than 4,000 patients received palliative services in 2009, with overall expenditure by the HSE on these services last year being in the region of &euro;79 million.  Expenditure this year will be in the region of &euro;74 million when public service pay cuts, etc. are taken into account.  The investment being directed to palliative care, in the context of the HSE national service plan for 2010, allows for the provision of a wide range of supports, including specialist inpatient beds, other palliative supports in acute hospitals and the provision of community-based services.  These include 25 palliative care consultants and 26 home care teams nationally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While robust financial management systems are an essential feature of any health service, our primary focus obviously must remain on patients.  The range of professional and other essential staff involved in each hospital or local health area must aim at all times to provide the best possible service for patients and other clients, in line with available resources.  In addition to this, the palliative care services five-year medium-term development framework was published by the HSE in July 2009.  It details the actions and initiatives necessary to address the gaps in palliative care service provision, thus adopting a more a patient-centred approach overall in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE recently established an implementation and development committee to monitor progress on the strategy at national level.  It is chaired by the HSE and membership includes representatives from organisations previously represented on the National Council for Palliative Care, including the Irish Hospice Foundation and the Irish Association for Palliative Care.  The quality standards for end-of-life care in hospitals were launched in May this year.  These were advanced as part of the hospice friendly hospitals programme. The standards aim to <Col N="482"/>support and enhance the provision of quality patient-centred end-of-life care within all hospital settings, especially in acute care facilities.</P>
        <P>There are several other initiatives under way at national, regional or local levels.  These include, for example, extending the access programme being undertaken by the Irish Hospice Foundation and the HSE which focuses on life-limiting conditions and involves pilot projects to develop best practice models in relation to chronic illnesses; the establishment of a bereavement support service in each HSE region; the inclusion of palliative care as one of the initial national programmes under the HSE directorate of quality and clinical care; and a specific standard in the national quality standards for residential care settings for older people relating to end-of-life care.</P>
        <P>Donegal Hospice is an eight-bed unit in Letterkenny.  The Health Service Executive has provided funding of slightly in excess of &euro;2 million towards the service this year.  The facility is staffed with one consultant in palliative care and three non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  The medical staff is rostered Monday to Friday, with out-of-hours service provided through on-call and overtime.  The estimated occupancy figure for the hospice is 70%, with no weekend admissions.  The HSE is reviewing current medical pay costs at the hospice.  A significant portion of pay costs are associated with issues such as overtime and on-call arrangements.</P>
        <P>The HSE has indicated that options to provide some of the out-of-hours services via NorthWestDOC or other doctors at Letterkenny General Hospital are the subject of detailed and ongoing consideration.  I understand a meeting has been arranged next week between the HSE and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, to advance matters.  While discussions are ongoing regarding restructuring the service, no decision has been made to suppress posts.  I stress that the HSE has no plans to close the hospice inpatient unit in Letterkenny.  The suggestion of closure is without foundation and caused regrettable concern for families and patients in the county.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It will be clear to this House from what I have just outlined that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to palliative care is obvious.  The Senator will appreciate, however, that the HSE has operational responsibility for delivering and supporting specific services at local level, including those at the Donegal Hospice.</P>

	<P>I welcome Minister of State&rsquo;s statement that no decision has been made to suppress posts.  I understand Dr. Donal Martin&rsquo;s statement on Highland Radio yesterday was made on the basis that the HSE had decided not to fill the vacancy.  The clock is ticking.  The post has not been advertised and a replacement needs to be put in place if we are to work within the guidelines of the National Council for Palliative Care, to which the Minister of State referred.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State&rsquo;s assurance will come as a relief but there are other serious questions.  If the post is suppressed and the consultant is the only person who can take admissions, the service could be closed by default.  As someone said yesterday, that will happen over our dead bodies in Donegal because so much effort and time has been put into ensuring the service is up and running and maintained.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement which will come as some relief and I wish everybody involved in next week&rsquo;s talks well.</P>
