	<P>I have received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to outline the process undertaken by her in considering and awarding the patronage for a new second level school in Lucan, County Dublin.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to clarify the resources she will provide to make Cregmore national school, Cregmore, County Galway, a safer location, further to her supportive telephone call to the school following the horrific road accident on 28 April in which life was seriously threatened and 11 vehicles were demolished.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide approval to allow the Glenties primary care centre, County Donegal to proceed to tender immediately.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the impact maternity leave and retirements are having on community hospitals nursing units due to the moratorium and the long term implications for facilities such as Carndonagh and Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Fitzgerald, Healy Eames and &Oacute; Domhnaill and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Keaveney may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>Yesterday, Senator Ross raised the comments of the Director of Public Prosecutions as regards the need for whistleblower legislation.  On rereading the comments of the Director of Public Prosecutions, it is clear he expects the Government to make the required changes to the criminal justice system if we are to implement a proper regulatory system.  This raises the question of legislation.  Will the Leader tell us whether legislation dealing with this issue will be brought before the House before the end of this term?</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been much talk about political reform, but I am concerned that people&rsquo;s democratic rights are not being respected.  There are three by-elections due to be held, in Dublin South, Donegal South West and Waterford.  The Taoiseach rather glibly told people last week not to worry about them.  However, not holding them takes away their democratic rights.  At the same time, we are talking about holding a mayoral election in Dublin.  Will the Leader, or perhaps Senator Boyle, tell us whether legislation establishing the position of lord mayor will be brought before the House before the end of this term?  Serious questions arise about the role and functions of the lord mayor, given that there are already four mayors in the greater Dublin area.  There are also significant questions about the budgetary control such a mayor would have.  The issue requires detailed debate in the House.  Given the lack of legislation before the House, is there an intention to introduce legislation to deal with these matters?</P>
        <P>To hold a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights, legislation will also be required.  The Labour Party has tabled a motion in the D&aacute;il in this regard.  Is it intended to introduce legislation before the end of this term?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to return to the point I made yesterday about legislation.  Looking at the Order Paper for today, one can see 12 Bills tabled by various Members on this side of the House that are yet to be dealt with: two from Senator Bacik, three from me, two from Senator Quinn and others from Senators Coghlan, Regan, Ryan, Alex White and Cummins.  I note that yesterday in the other House there was a row and questions about why the Multi-Unit Development Bill 2009 was reposing in the Seanad.  I do not blame Members of the other House for asking what we are doing with the Bill on Report Stage.  We have business that could be done now.  The Government should either move ahead with these Bills or produce its own, but we should be spending at least half our time dealing with legislation.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to use his influence in this regard.  To ensure the image of the House is projected properly, we need to do this work.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Government.  If it cannot provide legislation, there are 12 Bills on the Order Paper produced by the Opposition at no cost to the Exchequer or the Civil Service, by employing our own draftsmen and so on, which could be dealt with.  I ask the Leader to consider this seriously in order that we would be seen to be doing our work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I previously raised the question of energy.  Legislation introduced in the other House by Deputy Varadkar states the Government should make an attempt to reduce the cost of energy, communications, travel and so on by 10% where it has such influence.  This is a reasonable point and has become relevant in view of the recent job losses in the pharmaceutical industry.  One of the factors that must be considered is the cost of energy in this country which is greater than the cost of labour or anything else.  We should have a full debate on the issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in which we would also deal with the Front Line report on the Shell to Sea campaign.  There are issues in that regard that need to be discussed.  We must consider why the Government has not moved on the issue.  If we are to achieve independence in energy production, gas from the Corrib field must be brought ashore.  This should be an issue of urgency, although I agree that Shell must comply with every single law we put in front of it.  One of the issues blocking progress is the Government&rsquo;s refusal to proceed with the offshore renewable energy development Bill which was put together by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security &mdash; the first committee ever to produce a Bill &mdash; with full support from all parties.  However, the Department, for its own reasons, is not prepared to go ahead with it.  I ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to overrule his departmental advisers and proceed with the Bill which would allow offshore development to be carried out in an efficient and effective manner.  I apologise for going over the allotted time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I renew my call for a debate on the role of the church in education and the issue of school patronage, about which Deputy Quinn has been speaking for some time.  He has called for the establishment of a national forum on patronage, which is a good idea.  I called for such a debate yesterday in the context of the ongoing revelations about abuse within the church, the cover-up of abuse and Cardinal Brady&rsquo;s refusal to resign.  I took exception to Senator Mullen&rsquo;s response to my comment in which he accused me of using the abuse issue as a cover for another agenda.  In fact, his response is one of the reasons we need a debate because it shows that the Catholic Church and its spokespersons have not grasped that the two issues are not separate.  The issue of abuse within the church and the culture of cover-up by the hierarchy which still persists and about which Archbishop Martin has spoken so bravely is one of the reasons we need to consider the ongoing control of the primary education system by the Catholic Church.  At a time when 92% of State-funded national schools are under its control, we really need to have such a debate.  To see the issue of abuse and a cover-up as separate from the issue of education is to miss the point entirely.</P>
        <P>I also ask for a debate on white collar crime and the need for whistleblower protection.  Deputy Rabbitte introduced a Bill in the other House, while in this House last year the Labour Party group called for whistleblower protection legislation as part of a debate on better governance.  Until we have that legislation, as others have said, the Director of Public Prosecutions will not be able to mount successful prosecutions in tackling white collar crime.  This should be a priority of the House.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, there is a great deal of urgent legislation brought forward by the Opposition with which we could be dealing, but the Government is not willing to put these Bills on the Order Paper.  In that context, I ask the Leader for a debate on my own Climate Protection Bill which is long overdue.  It has been before the House since October 2007.  This <Col N="780"/>week, starting on Friday, is biodiversity week, which would be a good time for us to debate climate protection legislation and the pressing need to introduce a binding obligation on this and future Governments to ensure cuts in carbon emissions.  I ask the Leader to arrange these debates.</P>
        <P>On the day of our debate on the issue of child protection, I congratulate Ms Siobh&aacute;n Parkinson on her appointment as Laureate na n&Oacute;g, the first ever appointment of a laureate for children&rsquo;s literature.  Having read some of her books, she is an excellent choice.  This is a positive sign in terms of our regard for children&rsquo;s rights at a time when we are all too conscious of the flaws in our treatment of children and in our child protection laws.  That is a positive note on which to begin the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree there is a need for general and specific legislation on the issue of political reform.  Now that the Cabinet has approved the idea of holding an election in 2010 to fill the position of lord mayor of Dublin, the legislation must be passed in both Houses before the end of this session.</P>
        <P>The comments of the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; not only his recent comments about whistleblowers but his previous comments at the Burren Law School the week before about political donations &mdash; should make us all pause for thought.  He stated the notion of political donations created a perception and allowed an opportunity for corruption to occur.  When an important officer of the State makes such a statement, everyone involved in the political system has an obligation to respond.  The Government has made a commitment to act on the issue of corporate donations, but I would like to hear the views of those on the other side of the House on their dependence on political donations.</P>
        <P>Legislation is being prepared to tackle the issue of climate change.  I ask Senator Bacik to contrast that with the Government&rsquo;s Bill as we try to put that legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>On the issue of broadcasting which we debated yesterday, as part of the ongoing consultation process there may be a need to discuss not only the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland but the proposal on free-to-air television and the reactions that has provoked because there are different views on protecting professionalism as opposed to encouraging participation in sport that this House would be well served in debating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, we learned about the loss of 785 jobs in Pfizer and heard also that of all the locations throughout the world in which Pfizer operates, Ireland is its highest cost base.  As I speak, every company in this country is facing the threat of remaining competitive.  Why are we not playing to our strengths as a nation?  Why are we not harnessing our natural resources?  We have the second highest wind speeds in Europe after Scotland.  We have wave power and it rains here almost every day.  Why are we not a harvester of energy?  As a nation that is the natural infrastructure in which we should invest.  It is for that that we should borrow from the European Central Bank to ensure we can not only supply our own energy needs but also be a net exporter of energy to Europe.  If we decided to be forward thinking we would see that we are sitting on a green energy goldmine.  I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for a debate on energy to allow us examine our overall natural resources.</P>
        <P>Last week <i>The Irish Times</i> did a wonderful feature on the Finnish education system.  It outlined the main reason it excels in achievement and is the leader in education in the developed world is because of the quality, autonomy, status and qualification of its teachers.  The teaching profession is under attack in this country and the education system is unravelling.  I ask the Leader to arrange an open, all-party debate in this House on the type of education <Col N="781"/>system we want for our country that will deliver a caring society and a thriving economy, because we need both.  We must also have the debate on governance.</P>
        <P>What is the maximum response time by which a fire service should be available to ensure there is a reasonable chance of lives being saved?  In south Connemara currently, there are cases of people having to wait up to one and a half hours for a fire service.  Is that legal?  I would appreciate it if the Leader put that question to the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to the Chamber to discuss An Post, specifically the integrity and security of our postal service.  More than 3 million items of post are handled by An Post every day and, in general, it does a first class job, but recent media reports suggest there are rising levels of theft in the system, both internal Irish mail and particularly Irish mail to the United Kingdom.  We have no control over the Royal Mail service but many people in the business community and ordinary citizens are starting to lose confidence in the postal system.  That is alarming.  This kind of theft is insidious.  I have been in touch with An Post&rsquo;s press office and it accepts there is a level of theft.  That level has reached unacceptable heights which is why I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on that issue soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport to come to the House as a matter of urgency?  The House may not be aware of the fact that CIE is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Joint Committee on Transport.  Yesterday, in a move which I believe is possibly unprecedented and is indefensible, the executive chairman of CIE wrote a letter stating that the non-executive directors have refused to appear before the committee to answer questions about the way CIE is governed.  That is a matter of serious urgency.  It is also a matter of CIE and its non-executive directors frustrating the wishes and the inquiries of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I would be particularly interested to hear what the Green Party Members have to say about this matter because they would normally support that sort of response and accountability from non-executive directors.  If corporate governance of semi-State bodies is to be used just to appoint political hacks who refuse to be accountable to the Oireachtas, there is no point in having these joint committees and we can allow these semi-State bodies to run amok.</P>
        <P>CIE is being investigated for good reasons.  It found some corruption inside its organisation and because the board never saw the &euro;500,000 report that was commissioned by certain executives in CIE.  Board members did not even know about it, nor did the Minister.  Now, the non-executive directors who are paid by State money and appointed by the Minister and former Ministers are giving the two fingers to us and telling us they will not appear before the committee to say what is happening or what they knew or did not know.  This is a serious situation and it will make F&Aacute;S look like Scrooge if we do not get to the bottom of what is happening to the money in CIE.  That organisation receives &euro;300 million a year in a State subsidy and, when we ask it what is happening to that money, its board says we can go and jump in a lake.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister must come to the House to tell Members if he will stand for the executive chairman doing that because many of these people are his appointments and those of his predecessors.  Even having an executive chairman, Mr. John Lynch, is in itself a breach of corporate governance and should not be allowed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Many people, including young children, go missing in Ireland and across the European Union.  We are all conscious of the level of human trafficking and associated abuses.  I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to the fact that, in 2007, the European Commission reserved the number 116000 as an EU hotline number for missing children.  Can the Leader advise on the progress, if any, that has been made by the Minister and the Irish authorities to activate that missing persons hotline number, 116000, in Ireland?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I call on all mobile phone users to ensure they have an ICE, in case of emergency, number registered on their phone.  That simply registers an &ldquo;in case of emergency&rdquo; telephone number of the person who should be contacted should it be required in the case of an emergency.  The hotline number has been welcomed by the emergency services, and first responders in particular.  This could be greatly encouraged by a simple message on work and social networking contacts.  Will the Leader arrange for the House commission to show example by e-mailing all Members and staff highlighting the benefit of having such a number registered on our mobile phones.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the point made by Senator Ross about CIE and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The chairperson of that organisation was recently reappointed to his role.  There was a vote of confidence in him from the Government in terms of the way he was organising that business, yet when the Oireachtas looks for action and answers from him, it is not given them.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago I raised the issue of the status of the Dublin interconnector or underground DART, but the week before last we found out there would be a delay of which the Minister for Transport was not informed.  I thought that was an amazing saga, but then, to my astonishment, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann announced on Monday that it would lodge the planning application anyway.  Can someone tell us what is going on in that regard?  This organisation receives a vast sum of money.  It is clear the Minister for Transport is not being informed of what is going on.</P>
      
        <P>When the Oireachtas makes an effort to understand what it is doing and how taxpayers&rsquo; money is being spent, it is treated with derision.  This is an organisation out of control.  It rejects any attempt made by the Oireachtas to ensure oversight and proper governance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it appropriate for the Seanad to offer its support to Derry in seeking to be designated the UK city of culture?  Could we, particularly in the current climate, add our voices to the many that see value in driving this idea?  I express my interest in the issue because anything that will place the focus on Derry will also place a focus on the north west.  Therefore, those of us living in its hinterland should add our support.  We should add our voices so as to promote the development of the north west that would be assisted by the designation of Derry as UK city of culture.</P>
        <P>I empathise with Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, whose office was attacked recently.  As someone whose family home was also attacked on a couple of occasions recently, such attacks are an indictment of the way people think on how they should approach and deal with those who have been democratically elected.  We need to have a strong debate soon on what we see as the future of our democracy and the kind of republic we want for the future.  As we move closer towards 2016 and a commemoration of the events of 1916, we must embrace all of the people on the island of Ireland.  Therefore, we need to discuss our vision for this new republic <Col N="783"/>and deal with what we consider to be unacceptable behaviour in a democracy.  We do not want to witness more intimidation.</P>
        <P>On Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, a long time ago I raised the issue of the running of the Enterprise train service between Dublin and Belfast by Translink and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and their exploitation of those passengers who paid in euro.  However, they continue to refuse to show the exchange rate between euro and sterling.  In recent years they have exploited passengers by using an exchange rate of 69 cent.  This is another example which shows what has gone wrong in the transport industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><b>Senator David Norris:</b> Following on what Senator Fitzgerald said about the need whistleblower protection, I propose a change to the Order of Business.  I suggest that, immediately following the conclusion of the Order of Business, we take motion No. 17 on the Order Paper which was brought forward by me and a number of other colleagues.  It addresses the remarks of the Director of Public Prosecutions and particularly the question of whistleblowers.  I raised on the Adjournment the very serious matter of dishonesty on the part of one of the biggest banks in the IFSC, in the massaging and non-revelation of defects in liquidity ratios.  It received very little publicity initially, but then a large article which did not refer to the debate in the Seanad was printed in <i>The Irish Times</i>, while on Sunday a very incisive article appeared in <i>The Sunday Business Post.  </i>The story was also taken up in<i> S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung.  </i>The reason I raise the issue today is that the person who was my informant on that occasion effectively lost his job as a result.  We have no whistleblower protection and should address the matter immediately.  In the D&aacute;il the Labour Party produced a Bill to tackle the issue.  We could discuss that Bill this morning.</P><P Just="Left">These days I rarely speak about the subject of homosexuality, either domestically or internationally.  However, my attention has been drawn to a case in Malawi, a country to which we give large sums of money in aid.  Two young men, Mr. Steven Monjeza and  Mr. Tiwonge Chimbalanga, held a public ceremony of commitment in December.  They were arrested at the end of that month and accused of gross indecency under the British statute that we have abolished in this country.  There has been an attempt to subject them to forcible anal examination which has been described by Amnesty International as contravening the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.  This is a very human story and they are extraordinarily courageous people, to whom I have sent a message of support.  Tiwonge said: "I love Steven so much.  If people or the world cannot give me the chance and freedom to continue with him as my lover, then I am better off to die here in prison.  Freedom without him is useless and meaningless."  His partner, Steven, said: "We have come a long way and even if our family relatives are not happy, I will never stop loving Tiwonge."  They deserve our support.  I ask the Leader to contact the Department of Foreign Affairs to ask it to intervene and express our strong condemnation of this violation of every human principle of decency through the torture and imprisonment of these young men who have so courageously stood up for the principle of human love.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It is possible we need in this Chamber a debate on the issue of education because many changes are taking place and there are issues we should discuss.  However, it is neither fair nor tenable to base the request for such a debate on the issue of child sex abuse.  In this regard, we must be fair to everybody.  It is not right to indict the entire Catholic Church because of the actions of a small minority of clerics who have been responsible for engaging in child sex abuse.  It is not right to suggest either that the church should not be involved in education.  The logic of that argument is that the State, because of its responsibility for the non-cleric teachers in the education system who have been found guilty of engaging in <Col N="784"/>child sex abuse, should also be excluded.  Other members of society, too, should be excluded.  We should remember the role the church has played during through the years in the most difficult of times in providing an education system which was provided for persons who did not have the means to pay for an education.  I do not accept either that it is correct to casually drop the name of Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady into a debate in this context because the day this Chamber sets itself up as judge and jury in such cases is the day we will open the floodgates that could be disastrous for society as a whole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the same point.  I have no issue with Senator Bacik&rsquo;s request for a debate on the education system and its configuration.  Such a debate should be ongoing.  Senator Bacik, for whom I have good personal regard, will be aware that Bishop Leo O&rsquo;Reilly and the bishops&rsquo; conference have already suggested there will be a need for modification of our educational structures which will need to be altered to accommodate societal and demographic changes.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Archbishop Martin suggested that also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the case.  I am also concerned that a link might be made between the call for such a debate and the sex abuse scandal.  There is no evidence to suggest there is a link or that Catholic schooling as currently constituted is in any way a contributory factor in or linked with child abuse.  It is important this distinction is made and that it is clear we are not talking about the same thing.  While we would welcome a discussion of the organisational structure, we cannot make that connection.  It is vital that we point out that there is no connection between Catholic schooling and sex abuse.  There have been isolated cases &mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I accept that, but it is vital that we make the point.  It is equally vital that we make the point that there is no link between a discussion of child abuse and the reorganisation of educational structures and that Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady&rsquo;s name should not be mentioned.  That is not valid.</P>
        <P>I return to a point raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  He called on the Leader to arrange a debate on the legislation proposed in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Varadkar to have Government charges reduced by 5%.  I ask for that debate to take place.  Government charges are a huge contributory factor to our lack of competitiveness, costs and inflation.  They should be reduced in line with the need to reduce costs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Ross that it is reprehensible that directors in CIE who are paid with taxpayers&rsquo; money are refusing to answer to the custodians of the people&rsquo;s welfare &mdash; their elected representatives.  This is absolutely disgraceful and unsustainable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross wondered about the Green Party view on this matter.  Any semi-State body in receipt of public funds must be amenable to examination, questioning and oversight by the committees of the Houses.  That applies in this case also.</P>
        <P>The issue of whistleblower protection warrants debate.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to debate it.  I noted the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the protections various Acts afforded people trying to expose <Col N="785"/>corruption or malpractice within the sectors in which they operated.  While I accept there are protections in these Acts, that does not replace the clarity, rights and protections such a charter would convey.  I am familiar with the case mentioned by Senator Norris; there is no doubt a charter would have been a huge advantage to the individual involved.  This is something we must consider, notwithstanding the protections people already enjoy in this area as outlined by the Minister yesterday.</P>
        <P>I wish the crew of the <i>Rachel Corrie</i> well.  The ship is at sea off the coast of County Wicklow and sailing to the city of Gaza with a cargo of humanitarian aid.  The cargo, which I have seen, consists of cement, wheelchairs and medical supplies.  It is highly likely that in the next few weeks the <i>Rachel Corrie</i> will be 20 miles off the coast of Gaza city and that the crew will be involved in a dispute with the Israeli authorities.  It behoves us to keep a watching brief on the fate of the Irish citizens concerned and what is undoubtedly a humanitarian mission.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to discuss the potential impact of the working time directive?  This is a progressive directive from the European Union, but perhaps the Minister will discuss its impact on the ability of non-consultant hospital doctors to deliver services in local hospitals.  I have in mind the very serious impact it will have in County Louth where Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and Louth County Hospital will be seriously affected in different ways as the directive begins to take effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Norris in expressing dismay at the outcome of the recent court case in Malawi.  I contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs yesterday to ask it to direct our ambassador, Mr. MacGabhann, to make representations at the highest level in Malawi.  Will the Leader join me and ask his office to contact Mr. MacGabhann to impress on him the need to make a case to the Government of Malawi on the reasons the sentences should be at least commuted?</P>
        <P>Will the Leader confirm that legislation on the Dublin mayoral election can be expected in the House before the end of this session?  It is unusual for the Deputy Leader to announce legislation.  Will the Leader confirm that the Deputy Leader is correct in this case?</P>
        <P>Focus Ireland&rsquo;s report on homelessness was published this morning.  It predicts that approximately 100,000 people will be on social housing lists throughout the country by the end of the year, while 250,000 houses are lying idle.  In County Meath there are several thousand people on waiting lists.  Like other Senators, I am contacted daily by people who are living in substandard conditions, while next to them houses are left empty because the developers cannot sell them.  Will the Government take some action to tackle this issue?  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>There has been much talk in the last few days about the impact the Government can have on sports bodies.  Yesterday we saw its impact on rugby.  Will the Government intervene and seek a review of AIB&rsquo;s policy on sponsorship?  The State owns 20% of the shares in AIB which sponsors a corporate box, to the tune of &euro;100,000 a year, at a soccer ground in Islington in London.  At the same time, League of Ireland clubs are desperate for cash, with some of them going out of business in the past year.  My club, Drogheda United, is seriously strapped for cash.  A review of AIB&rsquo;s policy on sponsorship would help, as it should put more money into the Irish game.  I ask the Leader to convey that message.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the outrage of Senator Ross and other Members at the non-appearance of representatives of a semi-State body before an Oireachtas committee.  Frankly, all of us share the blame for this, as there is no compellability.  Members will recall that a legal challenge was mounted against two sitting committees in the early 1990s and both investigations collapsed because the committees&rsquo; rights to investigate issues of the day had <Col N="786"/>been challenged.  A number of Members of both Houses have since appeared in the Four Courts to try to defend the right of the Oireachtas to investigate matters through the committee system.  The issue has been left fallow for over a decade.  There is, therefore, an urgent need for an examination of the entire structure of the committees of the Houses.  Elected representatives in both Houses should be able, as happens in other jurisdictions, with the American model being perhaps the best example, not only to investigate current issues but also to compel witnesses to appear before committees.  However, we have done nothing about the matter.  The Leader can correct me if I am wrong, but I recollect that when the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, was given an expanded brief to include representing the Department of the Taoiseach, he also took on a role, whereby he might be able to investigate this deep flaw in the structures of the Houses.  Ironically, the new Deputy Prime Minister in Great Britain, Mr. Nick Clegg, later today will announce sweeping reforms.  This Parliament took all of its conventions and practices from the British Parliament, yet that parliament appears to have moved on in making itself more relevant, but we appear not to have followed it.  I do not wish to labour the point, but there is an urgent need for a debate on the reform and improvement of the committee structure in the Houses to address the issue Senator Ross and others raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Norris.  Senator Ross has yet again raised an important point and exposed the fault line in our democracy.  CIE has deliberately frustrated the will of the members of a committee, the people who represent ordinary citizens.  It is a disgrace and an abomination that CIE can tell a committee of the Houses that its representatives will not attend a committee meeting or co-operate with it.  Does the Leader of the House agree with this?  It is time we moved away from our current model.  I agree with Senator Mooney that committees must be given the power to compel witnesses to attend, as happens in the American model, in order that they can be brought in and held to account.  The example of CIE shows that the frustration felt is due to the political patronage Fianna F&aacute;il has perpetuated in the past 13 years, with its appointment of pals and cronies and giving the people the two fingers.  It is about time this was changed.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Reilly that a debate is required on the issue of school patronage.  As an educator and having spent five years in a seminary, it is important that we have a collective and holistic examination of education.  However, one should not blame the Catholic Church for all the wrongs done by a minority.  There are decent, ordinary teachers who are struggling.  Patronage of our schools is a very important issue which we must examine.  Let us bring about reform and meaningful change, but let us include everybody in that regard.  Are we seriously suggesting Catholicism permeates mathematics or geography?  We must also examine the funding of Protestant schools.</P>
        <P>I join Senators Norris and Hannigan in asking that the ambassador to Malawi make very strong representations to the Malawian Government regarding the appalling case mentioned.  It is a blight on that country that it would allow two people to be jailed for being in a relationship which would be considered acceptable in this society.  It is wrong and we must send the message to the Minister and our ambassador that we cannot condone it.</P>

	<P>On a number of occasions I have sought a debate on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the reform of the electoral system.  It is a worthy report and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to come to the House to discuss it.  When an election is held, there is a barrage of complaints about people being left off the register and others being on it five or six times.  When the Leader can find time on the schedule of the Upper House, will he invite the Minister in?</P><Col N="787"/>
        <P>I agree with the utterances of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on education.  There are two groups of victims in the issue of child abuse linked to education: those who were abused and the decent priests, brothers and nuns who did nothing wrong but are tarred with the same brush as those who perpetrated abuse on children.  That is very wrong.  The church has still a strong role to play in education.  Even the church itself is saying there is nothing so perfect that it cannot be improved.  It is time to have another look at it.</P>
        <P>I sympathise with my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, who has had his office vandalised.  I can identify with that.  Mine has been vandalised three times and another political office in Mullingar was vandalised as well by the same individual.  It is not a new phenomenon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the Leader outlined in his reply on the Order of Business that we had quite a number of Bills to deal with in this term.  Why are these Bills not being debated now to prevent a flood of Bills in the last few weeks of the term?  This is an ongoing problem.  I do not know whether the Leader is at fault or whether the various Departments are not bringing these Bills forward for the Leader to introduce.  It is certainly a problem that must be addressed because it is happening on an ongoing basis.  We all know that rushed legislation can be bad legislation.</P>
        <P>Why will the Leader not allow a number of the Bills from the Opposition side that are on the Order Paper to be introduced in Government time?  Bills are introduced by this side of the House in Private Members&rsquo; time, the latest example being the Independent Members later today.  Surely there should be a response from the Leader to allow some of these Bills to be addressed in Government time when there is not sufficient legislation coming to the House.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Boyle that we should have a debate on the broadcasting regulations on sport and the free-to-air programmes.  If the Minister, Deputy Ryan, persists with his proposals for rugby football, he will cut off the IRFU&rsquo;s funding stream totally and he will destroy rugby football in this country.  It is about time we had a debate on this issue, as Senator Boyle requested previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>On the remarks about CIE, we also found when we were looking at the Barron inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and held hearings on other such atrocities that the lack of powers of compellability, especially to get sworn evidence, is a serious shortcoming.  I agree with everything Senator Buttimer said in this regard.  I ask the Leader for a debate.  We have debates on all sorts of matters.  This matter is a priority from the point of view of the efficacy and the manner in which this House has the powers to conduct business that really impacts on people.</P>
        <P>I listened to the broadcaster Pat Kenny who interviewed an author who had apparently studied and written extensively on the crime scene in Britain and, by extension, in Ireland, in particular on the drug trade.  It was quite enlightening on the manner in which people graduate from juvenile crime beyond their teenage years simply because of the revenue that they are getting from the drugs trade and the hierarchy within that organised crime sector as well.  It stuck me in listening to it that we have lost the battle in that regard, not only in Ireland but in all western democracies.  We need to look at it with a different mindset rather than merely trying to deal with it purely as a policing issue.  We are failing and it looks to me from what was said yesterday as if we will probably never succeed in that regard.  We are turning a blind eye to everything that is going on.</P>
        <P>I agree with everything Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, O&rsquo;Reilly and Buttimer said on education and the patronage of our educational system.  There are elements who would seek to advance progressive secularism by exploiting the atrocious and appalling abuse that occurred within the church and in church institutions, but to name persons who are honourable, such as Cardinal <Col N="788"/>Brady &mdash; I do not know the man but those who do regard him as a man of the highest integrity and probity &mdash; to advance a secular argument brings no credit to those who pursue that line.</P>

	<P>I support the call by Senators Norris and Buttimer for a debate on whistleblowers.  If this House is to be relevant and topical, we should be handling the items of the day rather than not discussing them.  Senators Ross and Norris have made a strong case for that debate on whistleblowers to take place and I believe it should take place.</P>
        <P>I also support entirely the call for a debate on education.  This should be ongoing and wide-ranging.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others spoke about one aspect of it.  I want to refer to another, wide-ranging one.  For instance, we have not yet debated the intention to abolish the National University of Ireland.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The other issue that attracts me is the fact that we introduced the word &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; into a Department two weeks ago.  There was an innovation task force whose report I re-examined recently to see what it discussed.  In that report, Professor Patrick Cunningham, who was appointed chief scientific adviser to the Government, made strong cases which I had not quite understood previously.  He stated that, as part of our gross domestic product, there is natural capital such as oil, produced capital such as buildings and railways, and all the rest is intellectual capital.  In countries which have been successful, of which we are one, intellectual capital makes up 80% of GDP, yet that needs an investment in education and science.  Other countries are doing this and we are in danger of being left behind.  It is interesting to see what other countries have done.  The United States is investing 3% of GDP in science, and President Sarkozy in France has set up a commission to measure the economic performance based on that as well.  I urge the Leader to ensure we have a debate on education that covers all those areas of which we spoke and the necessary investment in science.</P>

	<P>In light of the fact that the Civil Partnership Bill 2009 will soon be before the House, will the Leader allow for a debate on the need for a referendum on this issue?  It is almost certain that, should the Bill be passed, it will be challenged in the courts.  I want to take the opportunity now to show the Judiciary, who watch what we undertake here, that there was no stomach for a referendum because I believe it would not be passed in a referendum.  That is why I would strongly call on the Leader and the members of the Green Party to hold this referendum.</P>

	<P>Sometimes it is like &ldquo;The Muppet Show&rdquo; in this House.  Will the Leader examine the situation of pubs in rural areas?  I am particularly cognisant of the fact that we have passed legislation introducing the smoking ban and reducing the blood-alcohol limit for drivers, which we are to reduce further.  Pubs encounter difficulties at 11 p.m. and 12 p.m. in clearing their houses because of a shortage of taxis.  It is a simple issue.  Having created the difficulty, it is time that we did something to assist these pubs.  One cannot transport a few thousand people from the pubs in a district within a short space of time.  The garda&iacute; are calling to ask why the house is not cleared and the house is not cleared because it is not safe for people to travel.  We need a regulation or a Bill to allow people extra time so they can get home safely.</P>

	<P>Yesterday we heard the bad news of the loss of 785 jobs in Pfizer.  We knew the merger of Pfizer and Wyeth in January last year would inevitably lead to some rationalisation and job losses but the extent of the losses came as a surprise.  I am taken by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s statement yesterday when she said that Pfizer&rsquo;s decision had nothing to do with the Irish economy.  She stated we are in fact much more competitive than we were.  However, this is completely and flatly contradicted by the National Competitiveness Council in its report earlier this year when it stated that urgent action is required to support export growth and job creation to ensure a competitive operating environment for businesses to enable exporters to trade successfully in difficult international markets.  Energy, wage costs, telecommunications and commercial rates are the issues that have to be tackled.  The ESRI has made the same point.  It is the extent of the losses which are influenced by the lack of competitiveness and the fall in Ireland&rsquo;s position in the league of competitiveness of export-orientated economies.  The T&aacute;naiste is way off the mark on this issue.</P>

	<P>Surprisingly, Pfizer is to close a plant in D&uacute;n Laoghaire completely between now and 2014.  IDA Ireland will be engaged to find a replacement plant and Pfizer will attempt to find a new operator to take over what is a very modern plant.  I hope this plan succeeds.</P>
        <P>On &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; last night, Richard Boyd Barrett of the Socialist Workers Party, trading as People Before Profit, suggested that the plant be nationalised.  This brings home to people what that party represents.  It is a case of nationalising everything in this country.  We have tried that policy before in the 1930s and we have been living with the legacy every since.  There have been much more unfavourable examples in other jurisdictions such as Russia.  That is what the People Before Profit, the Socialist Workers Party, represents.  We should recognise this because people on those protests last night and last week are being misled and voters are being misled by People Before Profit.  It is not as benign or as appealing as it sounds.</P>

	<P>I endorse those comments of Senator Regan.  I also refer to the comments of Senator Hanafin with regard to same-sex marriage.  After the civil partnership Bill has gone through the Houses, it would be wholly appropriate to have a referendum on same-sex marriage.</P><Col N="790"/>
        <P>With regard to the comments made by Senators Keaveney and Glynn, I ask for a debate on levels of violence and intimidation within politics.  This is not new in this country or in any country but I note increasing levels.  Along with the Leader I saw the attempted break-in to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last Tuesday.  Missiles were thrown over the wall and the garda&iacute; did very well to hold out the protesters on that occasion.  We should have a debate because we have to stand up to intimidation.  I have made the point before that it is totally incompatible to have an anti-war stance while at the same time using methods of violence and intimidation to get one&rsquo;s point across.</P>
        <P>I agree completely with Senators Mooney, Dearey and others about the public transport issue and the issue of compellability of witnesses in committees.  It is time to get a lot tougher with regard to committees.  Senators should unite on this issue.  We should be much stronger with regard to compellability of witnesses.  I detect there is probably an all-party mood to achieve this and I call on the Cabinet to look carefully at the issue.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators called for a debate on energy and I welcome such an important debate.  Since this Government came to power, renewable energy has increased from 7% to 15% of electricity and significant progress is being made in that area.  The 2020 vision is to have 40% renewable energy and the 2050 vision is to have 100% renewable energy.  This Government is making great inroads.  A continuing debate on energy is important because it is one of the key issues facing both our society and our economy.</P>

The Famine Memorial Park is under the shadow of Croagh Patrick.  I congratulate the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, for the dignified manner in which he represented the Government and addressed the gathering.

	<P>I also wish to respond to the opening of the memorial garden for the 83 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were killed in the service of the State.  Senator Carty brought this to my attention yesterday.  The garden was opened at Dublin Castle at the weekend and attended by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner.  The names of the 83 garda&iacute; who were killed were inscribed in stone on a roll of honour and medals were presented to the representatives of the families of each garda on the roll of honour.  I am aware that Senator Carty had a family member who was killed in the line of duty.  It is important this House takes this moment to recognise the pain visited upon the loved ones of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in our name.  Senator Carty asked <Col N="791"/>that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would consider the taking of a minute&rsquo;s silence in their honour and this will be discussed at the next meeting.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik, Boyle, Norris, Cummins and Quinn expressed their strong concerns regarding the comments of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As I said on the Order of Business yesterday, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008 is due in the House at the end of June.  This Bill will cover protection of persons reporting suspected corruption offences in good faith.  I have no difficulty in allowing a debate at any time, if at all possible, on the matters which have been brought to my attention.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald is very anxious about the dates for the three by-elections.  As we all know, this is a decision for the D&aacute;il.  I remind the House that a by-election was held in Dublin South but the seat could not be held on to.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy Leader was correct in saying the Bill to provide for the election of lord mayor of Dublin will be before both Houses before the summer recess.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked about legislation.  I informed the House yesterday that 16 Bills are coming before the House, three of which have been published.  A Private Members&rsquo; Bill will be dealt with this evening.  Tomorrow the House will deal with all Stages of a Bill and a motion for earlier signature.  I have always given priority to any legislation that can be processed in this House and this has not changed.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Healy Eames spoke about Ireland on the periphery of Europe exploiting the possibility of wind energy and every other type of energy.  We have come from 2% to 12% in this area.  We are making steady progress and I agree with all colleagues that there are opportunities.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik, Healy Eames, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Buttimer, O&rsquo;Reilly, Glynn, Walsh and Quinn expressed their strong views on the role of the Catholic Church in education and called for an all-party debate on the matter.  The contribution the church has made in education has been enormous, not alone in Ireland but throughout the world.  Our missionaries were the great unsung success of the Irish people across the world.  Those of us who have been on trade missions realise only too well the terrific work done by our missionaries in bringing not alone the faith to different parts of the world but educating the poorest of the poor.  I congratulate the churches, particularly the Catholic Church, in what they have done.  However, as has been said here, there have been difficulties.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; typified what most Members would have liked to have said on the church&rsquo;s role and contribution.  I have no difficulty in having a debate on the matter at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik and others inquired about climate protection legislation.  I will look into it and come back to the House on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle, Hannigan and Cummins raised the issue of free-to-air broadcasting of sporting events.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement in this regard on behalf of the 1 million people who cannot afford to pay for sports pay channels on television.  Under the Constitution, we must treat all of our people equally.</P>
        <P>I congratulate all Ministers who have brought the All-Ireland hurling semi-finals and finals, the Grand National, soccer and rugby sporting events to television.  We must encourage poor children and underprivileged families as they are the ones who need the most help.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the House having a debate on the matter with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  He has said he will allow a two-month consultation period.  Why can the Seanad not have its consultation with the Minister present and make its views known to him?  We must also congratulate everyone in the sport of rugby for what they have done for their sport.  They are doing enormous good work across the country. <Col N="792"/> We certainly support all sporting organisations.  As we all know, the greatest gift one can give one&rsquo;s body is to have it fit.</P>
        <P>Senators Healy Eames, Cummins and Bacik raised the issue of Ireland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness.  As the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills said, in the past 12 months we have increased competitiveness by 6%.  That is a terrific achievement in very difficult times.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely raised the matter of young children going missing and the missing persons helpline.  I will pass on his strong views to the Minister after the Order of Business.  His proposal for the House commission to e-mail Members and staff on the ICE mobile telephone number is a very good suggestion which I will pass on to it.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames inquired as to the response time of fire services, a very important point.  I will make inquiries of the Minister&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan called for a debate on An Post, particularly his concerns regarding postal services.  I have no difficulty with this matter being debated.  I congratulate the postal services on their work.  For the many of us who worked in the service down through the years, we were the family friend of everyone&rsquo;s door we called to.  Sometimes in rural places the postperson would be the only person one of our senior citizens might see in not alone one or two days but even three days.  I certainly have no difficulty in having time left aside for this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Ross, Donohoe, O&rsquo;Reilly, Dearey, Mooney, Buttimer and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for a debate with the Minister for Transport on CIE, particularly its executive chairman not appearing before Oireachtas committees.  While there may possibly have been a good reason for this happening, this is a serious challenge to the Oireachtas committee system.  As Senator Mooney said, we should urgently visit the position on compellability of appearing before committees.  I will endeavour to find out and assist transport committee members and its chairman in having the CIE executive chairman appear before them at an early time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keaveney wished the people of Derry every success in their application to become UK city of culture.  We certainly support her in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senators Keaveney, Glynn and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in raised the matter of break-ins at various political offices.  Senators and Deputies having their constituency offices vandalised at weekends is an exception rather than the norm.  Senators Glynn and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in pointed to their particular incidents.  We hope it will not start to happen more frequently.  In fairness, however, to the general public, it seldom happens.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney spoke again about the difficulties she is experiencing with exchange rates, particularly in the transport area.  We will pass these on to the Minister for Transport.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and Hannigan called on me to contact the Irish ambassador to Malawi, Liam MacGabhann, regarding the human rights of two persons detained there.  I will certainly do this with the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Dearey wished the crew of <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> well in bringing its cargo to Gaza City.  We commend everyone in this endeavour and their achievements in helping the poor people of Gaza City whom we have seen on our television screens.  We wish them well and hope they have a safe voyage.  He also raised the issue of non-consultant doctors.  I will pass on his views to the Minister for Health and Children after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on reform of the electoral register.  I will include this in the next Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; time.  Senator Glynn has been seeking a debate on this for some time and I will afford him it on Private Members&rsquo; business.</P><Col N="793"/>
        <P>Senator Walsh raised the serious challenge facing the world from the drug trade and what changes in policy might be brought about.  It would be a timely debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn welcomed the appointment of Dr. Patrick Cunningham, whom I wish well, to the innovation taskforce.  He cited the 3% of GDP devoted by the US Government to intellectual capital.  It is an area we, as a Government, are taking very seriously as shown with the smart economy proposals.  I agree with Senator Quinn on this matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, had a very good radio interview this morning on RTE.  It was very uplifting for everyone in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.  I hope his deliberations with the banks both yesterday and today will bear fruit for this sector because it certainly needs it.</P>
        <P>I believe when an application is made for financial facilities from a bank, particularly by SMEs, it should be made in writing.  Accordingly, we would have the documentary evidence to assist them if they were not successful.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has agreed to come to the House for an all-day debate on his portfolio.  I am endeavouring to have this date arranged with his diary.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for a debate on the Civil Partnership Bill.  I will pass on the views of the Senators to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called for the consideration of a special arrangement for the pubs in rural Ireland given the difficulties in transportation.  What he outlined to the House is quite correct and we are all aware it is taking place.  Businesses family run for generations are struggling to survive and keep the doors open.  Everything we can do should be done because they are also a major contributor to the Exchequer and certainly we will include this matter the next time we have a debate on the liquor licensing laws.  Any other areas where we can help the pub trade should be considered because they could not have foreseen in their wildest dreams the changes they are experiencing at present.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State consider this point?  One of the biggest problems in creating space for women in politics or in various organisations is right-wing and conservative women who, having become successful in their own way, feel they should pull up the ladder behind them.  These women often say: &ldquo;If I did it, they can do it.&rdquo;  This is a serious point.  I have dealt with this problem in the trade union movement and elsewhere.  The objection <Col N="795"/>is well intentioned.  Some women say they do not want things to be made easier for them.  Time and history have shown things do not work quite that way.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The proposal in the report we are discussing takes a much broader view and looks at how we might deal with this question.  The report deals with the quota issue.  Usually, when one mentions the word &ldquo;quota&rdquo;, one puts it in italics and puts on one&rsquo;s suit of mail in anticipation of people saying: &ldquo;Watch out.  Stand back.  We are not having this.&rdquo;  The quota issue is dealt with very cleverly in this regard in the report.  The quota referred to is not a quota of outcome.  It does not determine how many or what percentage of women have to be elected.  It is a quota of opportunity.  That is a very clever device and one that should be given a real chance and supported.  There are two points to be made in this regard.  Those women who feel inclined to oppose this system should stand back, forget about their own circumstances and consider the fact that they have been successful in a system that is not woman-friendly in many ways.  They should also look at how we need to make this happen.  Why do we need to make it happen?  I am not a great believer in creating huge structures to encourage greater participation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, and I differ slightly in that regard.  I believe participation is a means to an end.  There is bad decision-making where there is not a gender balance among the decision-makers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a practical person in that regard.  It is a question of participation being seen as a means to an end.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to consider other matters also.  One of the problems with Parliament, apart from the fact that it is very much a male club and male-friendly, an environment in which I am very comfortable, is that its schedule is not attractive to women.  We need to tell the media that may take an interest in this issue that the idea of parliamentarians being in Parliament five days a week is a lot of nonsense, anti-democratic and bad for decision-making.  We need parliamentarians to be in Parliament for two and a half days.  Meeting for two and a half long days would be more attractive to women than the current arrangement.  I do not believe having a cr&egrave;che in Parliament is very attractive if one is in an occupation in which one does not know whether one is going to finish at 5 p.m., 7 p.m., midnight or 1 a.m.  If one was required to be in one&rsquo;s constituency for half the week and in Parliament for the other half, it would be a much more attractive proposition.  We should consider this and take on the media commentators who present it as people not working.  The last thing we need is the kind of parliament featured in other countries whose parliamentarians would deign to visit their constituencies every couple of months, as if to say to the little people, &ldquo;Here I am, I am back again.&rdquo;  We need to consider having a quota of opportunity for a limited period.  Let us see how it would work, assess it and determine its outcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In five constituencies during the last general election there was not even a choice to vote for a woman.  We do not want this to happen again.  I am not attracted by the idea of someone looking at a ballot paper and saying he or she is going to vote for a woman, but the women who would stand for election would have a lot to offer and afford the voter a real opportunity in terms of diversity of representation and choice.  We have tried many approaches.  It cannot be true that decisions are better made by men only or any other gender.</P>
        <P>I have faced this issue in various professions.  In the teaching profession it is important that there be role models representative of our community, society and nation.  This would involve a gender balance that would be more or less 50:50.  We should strive towards meeting the objective of creating the opportunities to allow this to happen.  That is the great value of the report in question.  It does not tie people down and stipulate there must be a 50:50 ratio of <Col N="796"/>men to women.  I have always been unhappy with such stipulations.  What we would be doing is creating a quota of opportunity to ensure parties nominated a certain number of people at all times, not to be restrictive but to afford a greater opportunity to participate with a view to having better decision-making.  Voters would have greater opportunities when selecting candidates and a better climate for decision-making would be created in Parliament.</P>
        <P>I support the report, the debate on which is very important.  I would like to annoy people for a little longer, but I have run out of time.  We need to address these issues.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted this debate is taking place on the role of women in politics.  I have not written a long speech.  As spokesperson on justice issues, I could have led off on the last occasion, but I ceded ground to Senator McDonald who spoke very eloquently on the subject.  It is important that women have their say in politics.</P>
        <P>On the imposition of quotas, some of the points made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole were interesting because while one can take a horse to water, one cannot make it drink it.  I have one daughter and she has as much interest in politics as the man in the moon and believes I am crazy.  She said that, when growing up, she hardly ever saw me and only saw me at funerals or meetings and that I was always away in Dublin or Cork County Hall.  Her point was valid.  She did not make it until she was about 16 years old, at which time it was probably too late for me take on the role expected of me.</P>
        <P>In my area I have always encouraged women to get involved in politics.  On Bandon Town Council there are four female councillors.  Three of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s four elected representatives are female, about which I am delighted.  On Skibbereen Town Council Fianna F&aacute;il has two of the nine elected representatives, one of whom is a young girl.  On Bantry Town Council there has always been, at least in the past 20 years, one or two females from different parties.  We have always encouraged the girls, or ladies, to become involved in politics.  It is important that this be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>There is a perception that politics is a man&rsquo;s world and that we are against the involvement of women in politics.  That is far from the truth.  In many cases I have found it almost impossible to get women to become secretaries or chairpersons of Fianna F&aacute;il cummain.  I have written to them and cajoled and begged them to do so.  They probably find the lifestyle difficult.  Politics is becoming a very tough career.  If I had put the same number of hours and work into the legal profession as I have put into politics since joining Cork County Council in 1985, at which time I was a young solicitor, I would certainly be a far wealthier man today and I am not being facetious in any way in saying this.  I would have a better lifestyle and have had a greater input into my family life when my children were growing up.  It would be disingenuous of me to say otherwise.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, there is a public perception of politics to the effect that politicians are all crooks and gangsters.  This applies across the board, although Fianna F&aacute;il, being the party in power, may be hit hardest.  It can be heard in the pub or at GAA matches.  As with men, professional women who have spent five or six years in college and the possibility of pursuing a career with a guaranteed income or perhaps a guaranteed period in office think hard, twice and three times, about becoming involved in politics.  I come from a family of 11 and have <Col N="797"/>seven sisters &mdash; I was cowed down by seven girls.  However, I do not believe any one of them would have got involved in politics.  They all had a reasonably good education and some had to emigrate.</P>
        <P>The perception that Parliament is an exclusively male club is wrong.  Perhaps other parties have different experiences and, if so, I would like to hear about them.  In 1981 I encouraged a lady to stand for election to the D&aacute;il.  She was the first lady in my party in my area to do so.  She was placed on the ticket and I canvassed very hard for her, but she was unsuccessful.  She emigrated subsequently and is now married in Paris or some other location in France.  When I met her recently, she said that, in one sense, she was glad she had not been elected because she had made a life for herself in France.</P>
        <P>If one considers the ancient political structures, including in England before democracy, one will note that women made their mark in politics right across the world.  Women who participated in politics include Indira Ghandi and Margaret Thatcher in England, as well as various queens, including Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary I, Queen Mary II and Queen Victoria.  The United States came relatively close to having a female President elected on the last occasion which would have been an historic occasion.  Perhaps it is believed in that country that it was not the right time for Ms Hillary Clinton to make it.  Others will say that because she was so closely linked with Mr. Bill Clinton, it probably damaged her career.  She now holds a senior political position in the United States.</P>
        <P>I am delighted this debate is taking place.  At our group meeting I asked the Leader not to stifle the debate but to allow it to roll over.  This is the second day on which we have discussed women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  When this very important debate concludes today at 1.30 p.m., 23 or 24 Senators, over one third of the Members of this House, will have participated in it.  It is only right this debate should take place.</P>
        <P>As many more speakers are offering, I will bring my remarks to a close.  I have always encouraged the participation of women in politics.  However, imposing quotas for the sake of doing so would not constitute an ideal system.  I have been involved in politics since 1985 and I do not recall any occasion when Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s internal structures prevented or dissuaded female candidates from running or were used to oust such candidates at party conventions.  Whenever a female member put her name forward for election to a town or county council or to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, she was encouraged.  This was due to the perception that a young female candidate can obtain the additional votes necessary to ensure she is elected before one of her male counterparts.</P>
        <P>I am merely outlining my own little aguis&iacute;n.  My experience indicates that women are not disadvantaged when it comes to their involvement in politics.  They have an extremely important role to play.  I accept the system militates against them and that politics is a difficult job.  Many women with good careers are not anxious to wade into the current quagmire in which politics finds itself.  They perceive the difficulties involved and realise there is no guarantee that once they have won a seat, they will be re-elected.  The constituency rivalries that exist among members of the same party give rise to difficulties for any candidate, male or female.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe.  I also welcome the chair of the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and the representatives of the Irish Women Lawyers Association who are in the Gallery.</P>
        <P>As a former member of a 26-seat county council &mdash; I was one of two females who served on that body at the time &mdash; I am only too well aware that women are underrepresented at local government level.  As someone who worked as a midwife in the health service for over 20 years, <Col N="798"/>I am well aware of the anti-social nature of that job.  Politics is also an anti-social profession and, in that context, I often feel I am missing a wife.</P>
        <P>This debate is truly historic.  It is the first occasion on which the issue of women&rsquo;s participation in politics has ever been placed on the agenda of either House of the Oireachtas.  I welcome the fact we are debating the report on women&rsquo;s participation in politics which was published by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights in October 2009 and which was authored by my esteemed colleague, Senator Bacik.  I am glad its emergence led to the holding of this debate in the House.</P>
        <P>The context for this debate is important.  It has been suggested the Celtic tiger was really a Celtic tigress, particularly in light of the fact that the increased numbers of women in the labour force during the boom years played such an important role in generating increased wealth for everyone.  Despite this increase in numbers, women in the workplace continued to be restricted by the existence of glass ceilings and also continued to bear the largest share of domestic and child care responsibilities.  That is why I referred earlier to my needing a wife.  Serious discrimination remains in the workplace in respect of unequal pay and the lack of child care facilities.  However, despite these obstacles, the numbers of women in paid work increased dramatically during the 1990s and early 2000s.  In contrast, the number of women in the D&aacute;il fell.  Further action must be taken to encourage more women to enter politics.</P>
        <P>We can work with our current electoral system in this regard and there would not be a need to change from our proportional representation-single transferable vote, PR-STV, system in order to increase the number of women elected to councils or to the Oireachtas.  What we need to do is address existing and highly restrictive candidate selection procedures operated by all of the political parties which prevent women from becoming candidates.  The key reform required to address this is the establishment of a legislative quota system that would require all political parties to select a certain minimum proportion of candidates of each gender.  Without such a system, political parties will not alter their procedures voluntarily.</P>
        <P>All of the parties represented on the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights supported the recommendation relating to legislative quotas.  Like all the members of that committee, I wish to express my support for quotas.  It is, however, important to emphasise, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole did, the type of quota model recommended in Senator Bacik&rsquo;s report.  The model in question relates to a very limited &ldquo;opportunity quota&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;quota&rdquo; sometimes conjures an image of reserved seats, with a quota of seats in a parliament being reserved for women.  This is not what the joint committee of which Senator Bacik is a member recommended, although it is the model used in some countries, such as Rwanda where 56% of representatives in parliament are women.  We do not advocate this model, partly because it would give rise to difficulties under European law.  We are suggesting a much more limited form of quota, namely an opportunity rather than an outcome quota.</P>
        <P>An opportunity quota merely requires that political parties put forward a minimum number of candidates of each gender.  This system is operated in Belgium, where no more than two thirds of candidates can be of one gender, thereby placing a cap on the number of men a party may select.  This does not restrict voter choice but it would increase the number of female candidates available for election.  A quota does not make an imposition on voters, it simply recognises the reality of the political parties as the gatekeepers in the context of deciding who should go forward to face the electorate.  These gatekeepers must be subjected to certain rules in respect of the number of candidates they select.  Legislation to deal with this matter must be introduced as a matter or urgency.  The Minister of State takes great interest in debates of this nature and listens to what is being said.  That face is very much appreciated.</P><Col N="799"/>
        <P>On International Women&rsquo;s Day, 8 March 2009, the Labour Party&rsquo;s leader, Deputy Gilmore, introduced a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, the Electoral (Gender Parity) Bill 2009, which would have required political parties to select a minimum number of women candidates.  This Bill or a version of it is essential to ensure change.  Experience elsewhere shows that unless some legislative quota is introduced, the position will not change.  The level of female representation in the D&aacute;il has remained stuck at between 13% and 14% for a long period.  The position in the Seanad, where the figure stands at 22% &mdash; 13 females out of a total of 60 Members &mdash; is better.  However, the ranking on which we are measured is based on lower or, where the system is not bicameral in nature, single houses of parliament.</P>
        <P>The measures put forward by the joint committee should apply not only in respect of D&aacute;il elections but also to Seanad, local and European elections.  Female representation in Europe fell from 38% to 25% following the most recent election.  A system of financial penalties based on the French model should be imposed in the legislation, which should have an in-built sunset clause which would lapse once targets were met.  The latter is an extremely reasonable proposal.</P>
        <P>When contributing to this debate, Senator Bacik put forward a concrete plan of action for the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Alexandra White, to adopt on foot of the joint committee&rsquo;s report.  I support the Senator in asking the Minister of State to commit to taking certain actions.  First, I ask her to propose a timeline in respect of adopting the legislation to which I refer.  We are aware that such legislation has worked in other European countries, particularly Belgium and Spain, where the rate of representation, which in 1990 was more or less equal to that which obtained here, has increased to such an extent that these nations are now ranked 12th and 13th in the world, respectively.</P>
        <P>My second request is that the Minister of State should convene a meeting of the general secretaries of all political parties.  This meeting could be facilitated by the National Women&rsquo;s Council and at it the recommendations contained in Senator Bacik&rsquo;s report, many of which are aimed at them, could be put to the general secretaries.  The Minister of State could ask that they revert to her within two or three months in order that a further meeting to determine what progress has been made could be held.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas cr&egrave;che is a useful facility and has great symbolic importance.  However, it may be more useful to city-based parliamentarians.</P>
        <P>I wish to request that the photograph taken at the Oireachtas women&rsquo;s event held in December 2008 be displayed in Leinster House.  It was very telling that on the occasion of Countess Markievicz&rsquo;s 90th anniversary and as a result of a special allowance made by the then Ceann Comhairle, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, we were allowed to hold an event relating to women in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  That was very much appreciated and the occasion in question incorporated a really historic element.</P>
        <P>We often talk about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and what a wonderful dancer he was but it must be remembered she did everything he did but she did it backwards and in high heels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the Minister of State and thank the Leader for the debate.  It is the first time that women&rsquo;s participation in politics has been debated in either House of the Oireachtas, which is significant.  I commend Senators Bacik and McDonald on the work they invested in this report, which is thought provoking and provides the basis for this significant debate to take place for the first time.</P>
        <P>I refer to participation in politics generally.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, I believe politics is in crisis and it is a struggle to get new people involved, regardless of whether they are women, because politics is becoming an increasingly unattractive career option.  There are many reasons for that.  We are held in low regard, there is a great deal of cynicism about politics and, as other <Col N="800"/>colleagues said, it is a tough life requiring a considerable commitment.  In examining why there is so much cynicism about politics and why it is held in such low regard, it is likely that equitable participation could play a role in improving the perception of politics given that the deficit in equitable participation has had a role in the crisis facing politics.  Politics is important but little else impacts on people&rsquo;s day-to-day lives as much as the decisions taken by politicians.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that Ireland continues to languish at the bottom of the international league table when it comes to women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  I was honoured to be the female Oireachtas representative at an interparliamentary union conference a few years ago.  Every country was required to have a female representative because, without one, we were not allowed to vote at the conference.  A table was produced and it was embarrassing to find Ireland was ranked lower than Iran and Iraq in regard to female participation in politics, despite our perception of ourselves as being an equitable country.  We were behind other countries that do not have a good reputation on women&rsquo;s issues.</P>
        <P>We should ask ourselves whether it is good to seek to address women&rsquo;s participation in politics and what it has to offer.  There is a significant body of research around the world which has shown everything has improved greatly in countries that have generated a higher level of female participation in politics.  There has been a shift in the legislative focus as a result of the increased participation of women and this benefits everyone in practice.  For example, the Nordic countries have experienced a shift in legislative practice to reflect a greater focus on social justice, education, family and gender issues.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to have better and balanced decisions and that can only happen if there is more equitable, gender-based debate on legislation.  Debates benefit from being better informed by varied experience and perspectives.  That is what female participation in politics can bring, everyone will benefit and they should support that.  It is a win-win scenario for everyone.</P>
        <P>The report mentions setting a specific target for the number of female candidates.  I would issue a word of warning on that.  If we compare what has happened around the world where a move has been made to run a greater number of women candidates with Ireland, it is frequently the case that a token woman is placed on a party ticket to run for seats that they never have a chance of winning, but this allows parties to say afterwards that they had an increased representation of women.  That issue arose following the 2007 general election.  There were never as many women candidates as there were that year, yet a reduced number of women were elected.  It was not only because people did not vote for them but when an analysis of the constituencies in which women were given the opportunity to run was conducted, it was concluded none of them was expected to take a seat.  Women were, therefore, asked to run on the ticket even though the possibility of taking a seat did not exist.</P>
        <P>It was interesting that when New Labour took power in the UK, Tony Blair followed a model through which he knew the seats his party had a good chance of winning and the Labour Party made a decision that a proportion of the constituencies should have female candidates.  As a result, his party achieved one of the greatest increases in female representation in the developed world in a single election.</P>
        <P>The report also mentions the need for support networks.  I was a little unsure about all-women networks and support groups.  My experience in Fianna F&aacute;il is the women&rsquo;s group.  I was often struck that we would be upset if a men&rsquo;s group was established and we were not allowed to join it.  It was proposed to abolish the women&rsquo;s group and I was not sure about my feelings in this regard.  I was approached by an older woman who said it was important that we would not abolish the group.  She said that, when she joined her local cumann, she never had the confidence to speak at a meeting but, having joined the women&rsquo;s group, she had the opportunity to get involved in policy development.  Through that forum she found the confidence to <Col N="801"/>return to the cumann to tell members what we had been doing because it became competence-based confidence.  I felt afterwards that if confidence was the one thing a women&rsquo;s support network could engender in other women to come forward with ideas, that alone made it a valuable network that would be worth retaining.</P>
        <P>The report also makes a recommendation regarding funding incentives to encourage women to become involved in political parties.  Politics costs money and is an expensive business, whether one is a man or a woman.  I would not like us to move to a point where if people do not have access to funding, they cannot get involved in politics.  While I was very fortunate in my career to have been able to access bank loans to fund my interest  in politics, that was only because I was fortunate to have a job which facilitated that.  We do not want to move to the stage of people being unable to become involved in politics owing to a lack of access to funding.</P>
        <P>As difficult as it is for politicians generally to get funding, especially if one must rely on loans, it is even more difficult for women to access loans.  I was very struck by my early experience when I was looking for credit and the bank manager said, in effect, that since I was a young woman, there was a chance I would get married, have children and not be able to make the repayments, so they could not extend me the loan.  He was only saying what we know everyone else was thinking, so I believe there is an issue around funding.  I do not know the answers because there are so many demands on a very limited public purse.  That being so, we are talking about funding democracy to try to ensure we get the best possible people to come forward and not relegate political representation to individuals with access to other supports.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Oireachtas education programme.  A couple of recommendations in the report refer to female role models and education.  The education being promoted by the Houses of the Oireachtas, whereby Members, along with other public representatives, have been visiting secondary schools, has been very positive.  This plays a significant role in education, and the feedback I have received from all-girls schools in particular indicates that when female Members of the Oireachtas have been able to attend, this has sent a very powerful message to secondary school girls that challenges the male politician stereotype.  That is very welcome and the personnel behind the Oireachtas education programme are to be congratulated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an interesting opportunity to speak about women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  I compliment Senator Ivana Bacik as the rapporteur on the report which I read some time ago.  This debate is an opportunity for me to discuss why I got into politics, why I believe women&rsquo;s participation in politics is important, the barriers they face and, perhaps, some ways to address them.</P>
        <P>I got into politics because I believed I had a contribution to make.  All we have in life is time and I do not believe in wasting it.  If I believed my time in politics was wasted, I would not be in this House.  My intentions were very good at the outset, but I have definitely experienced barriers.  Some of those arose in the most unexpected places, from men, women, parties and even in this House.</P>
        <P>I was fortunate in that my family gave me a good education and that I have been able to adopt two children.  In doing that, I wanted to give something back.  That was a major reason for me to consider politics.  I believe in change for the better and, having been a teacher and subsequently a lecturer, I believed the right area for me to make a contribution was in education.  For five or six years before I came into this House, when I had decided to run for politics first and got a good thrashing, in 2002, a bad year for Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="802"/>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I made a decision to resign my teaching post and set up a business to be able to commit myself to politics.  Previously, I had been travelling three hours a day from Galway to my place of work in Mary Immaculate College in Limerick.  My constituency was Galway West, spanning west from my home in Oranmore, right through the city to Connemara and the islands.  I knew I could not continue to be a lecturer in Limerick and run for politics, so I made a very significant decision and gave up a great deal.  I set up a business and was elected to this House with some expertise in education and enterprise as well as a strong sense of social justice.  Those are the issues I am committed to in politics.  My aim is to do good by my county and country.</P>
        <P>I did not enter the Seanad initially with a strong interest in local politics, rather a desire for change for the better nationally in terms of the direction of education and the development of creativity in children on foot of the gaps I had perceived in the system.  I had been a county councillor <i>en route</i>, had learned a good deal about local politics and came to realise I had much to contribute locally.</P>
        <P>All politicians, not just women, face a dilemma, namely, whether to be a parish pump representative or a national politician.  There is a flaw in the electoral system because while this recession will not be fixed by parish pump politics, the electoral system is such that, unless local issues are taken care of, the politician will not be elected and will not have the opportunity to contribute in a national forum.  As well as a debate on women in politics, we also need to look at the electoral system if we are to be serious about giving leadership.  People have lost faith in politics and in the Government.</P>
        <P>The other day in an all-boys&rsquo; school, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Patrician College in Galway, or &ldquo;the Bish&rdquo;, as it is known locally, a young boy asked me whether I believed our leaders in Government were insulted by the fact that advertisements were being taken out on television to say, in effect, &ldquo;Get thinking and come up with ideas to save your country.&rdquo;  I said I did not believe they were being insulted.  The teacher intervened to say that he believed they were being insulted because that had never happened before.</P>
        <P>I always believe there should be room for creativity.  While I do not beat the drum for women in politics, none the less I am a woman in politics.  What are the reasons for increasing women&rsquo;s participation?  It is valid that women should have a strong role in politics since we make up 51% of the population, yet our level of participation is something like 13%, less than sub-Saharan Africa.  Senator Corrigan said there were more women in politics in Iran and Iraq than in Ireland.  Those are countries in which women are being put down and have to wear a burqa.  Let us get a grip.</P>
        <P>Why should women be involved in politics?  The life experience of women is different.  This is seen in the way we profile issues such as breast cancer, the need for BreastCheck, ovarian cancer, cervical smears, etc.  We have had debates in the Seanad on stem cell research and, while men have a valid viewpoint, they will never experience the emotions women have in these areas.  It is a different type of experience and we should embrace this, cherish it and say it is welcome.  Women have a different viewpoint.  Our brains and bodies are made differently.  Let us take the male brain versus the female brain.  On the left side of the brain is the language centre, and men have a very small section compared with women.  The Senator is about to say perhaps that is why women like to talk more.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The report brings out well the barriers women face in politics.  It mentions child care, cash, confidence and culture.  There is also a big barrier to being a woman in politics.  While one may have strong views in one&rsquo;s own right as a citizen, to be a woman in politics presents a different challenge because &mdash; loath as I am to say it &mdash; one is in a man&rsquo;s world and surrounded largely by men.  I found myself at cumann meetings at which I was the only female present.  This was a frequent occurrence seven or eight years ago.  The men present at the meetings would turn around to face the other men because it was so unusual for a woman to be there that they did not know how to behave.  It takes much courage for a woman to enter the world of politics.</P>
        <P>Child care is a tough issue.  The day on which I first stood at a convention was the first birthday of my youngest child, but I did not dare to mention this because people would have whispered about why I was not at home minding my child.  On one occasion when my husband was canvassing on my behalf in 2002, he was asked who was minding my children.  His response was that I had a family, as well as a husband.  This is an example of the culture that must be overcome by women.</P>
        <P>In terms of making the Houses a more friendly place for women to be successful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;we need to consider the suggestion that Parliament sit two and a half days each week.  In addition, on occasion, women should be able to participate in debates using video-conferencing facilities.  We should not always have to be here in the House in order to participate, as there are means of doing this.  There should occasionally be opportunities to vote remotely, with appropriate validation.  While visiting Mountjoy Prison doing research for the Oireachtas education report which is being published next Tuesday, I missed a number of divisions in the House.  I was obliged to apply months beforehand for clearance to enter the prison.  There are plenty of examples of such difficulties.  Cash is an issue, as is confidence because, as I said, we are largely in a male world, but the greatest issue is culture.</P>
        <P>In terms of achieving a better gender balance in politics, I am not convinced quotas are the solution.  The one area in which quotas will make a difference to women is the selection process.  However, it is tough enough being a woman in politics without accusations being made that one is a quota candidate.  The solution might be to use a combination of figures for quota purposes; for example, women could receive a 20% leg-up at the convention, but the rest would be based on an open vote.  I would say the same about list-based electoral systems.  It should not be all list-based and it should not be all democracy-based; we should consider a combination of the two.</P>
        <P>The Leader of the House is a male, as are the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  The Leader has been corrected in the House on his use of language, for example, by Senator Eugene Regan.  How one speaks to women is important.  On many occasions, like others, I have felt put down by the Leader.  Within the last two weeks he mentioned that he had seen me on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; and that I was &ldquo;very meek&rdquo;.  Would he have said that to a man?  He would never have used the word &ldquo;meek&rdquo;.</P>

        <P>I must reply to the remarks made by the last speaker.  I treat every Member, male or female, equally in this House.  I am proud to say I have always done so.  I am the first Leader of either House to have allowed the issue of women in politics to be debated on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>I have worked well for many years with one of the great women of our time, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, in my local area.  I also worked well with M&aacute;ire Geoghegan Quinn who was the first woman to be appointed to the Cabinet since Countess Markiewicz.  I also worked with former President Mary Robinson who started her political career in this House.  The first lady T&aacute;naiste the country had, Deputy Mary Harney, also started her political career in this House and I have had a close working relationship with her throughout my political life.  I have known many excellent women who have made an enormous contribution to public life during the years.</P>
        <P>I worked with former Deputy S&iacute;le de Valera, an outstanding public representative, as well as the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin, and the first female Fianna F&aacute;il T&aacute;naiste since 1926, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  In my local area I have worked with the former Minister of State Deputy Mary Wallace, as well as Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady and my colleague in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath, Mae Sexton, who represented the area as a D&aacute;il Deputy when I was a Deputy between 2002 and 2007.</P>

	<P>I also worked closely with colleagues such as the former Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, and Niamh Bhreathnach who made great contributions when in government.  I have worked with my Fine Gael colleague from the midlands, Deputy Olwyn Enright, as well as her father, in the interests of the constituents of the area.</P>
        <P>Previously, 22% of the membership of this House were women; the figure is now 20%.  The 12 female Members are Senators Ormonde, Feeney, Mary White, McDonald, Prendergast, Healy Eames, McFadden, now my local colleague, O&rsquo;Malley, Corrigan, Fitzgerald, the Leader of the Fine Gael group in the House, Bacik and Keaveney.  These Members make tremendous contributions on the floor of the Upper House.</P>
        <P>There is a regulation in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party that at least 20% of the membership of the officer board in each cumann, comhairle ceantair and comhairle D&aacute;il cheantair must be female.  This has been the case for a number of years.  We are doing everything we possibly can to encourage greater female participation in politics.  As Senator Corrigan said in her excellent contribution on her experiences and challenges in getting off the ground as a female politician, <Col N="805"/>it is not an easy profession in which to participate; with no guaranteed tenure, it is extremely unattractive to many.</P>
      
        <P>If one is not motivated by the urge to give of one&rsquo;s time to public service, my advice would be to forget about it because the motivating factor must be to do good for one&rsquo;s parish, community, county and constituency.  That is what motivates most of the membership of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  They are men and women who are privileged to represent their constituents in the Houses.  In the minds of most the definition of a good politician, be it a man or woman, is someone who can bring the most to their area in terms of schools or other infrastructure.  Only a small percentage are fortunate enough to serve in Cabinet as Ministers or as Ministers of State.  Only a small percentage of those who are elected have that privilege.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This is probably the first of many discussions we will have in the House on how we can encourage women to participate in politics more fully.  Let me give an example.  In the 2002 general election the constituency of Westmeath had seven candidates, four of whom were women.  However, the electorate chose three men to represent it.  It corrected this on the last occasion after the commission had transferred part of my constituency to the constituency of Meath, but be that as it may, I can honestly say I have worked very well with Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke who has served her constituency outstandingly well.  I look forward to working with her in the future in the interests of our constituents.  Who the electorate decides should represent the constituency for the coming period has never been a problem.  As democrats, we have always accepted its decision.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Bacik on her publication.  I have always supported her calls and those of all female Members of the House for debates on what are considered to be urgent matters to be put before Members for their consideration.  I look forward to assisting all of my colleagues on a daily and weekly basis in that regard.  I acknowledge colleagues who were elected to serve on local authorities, including Councillor O&rsquo;Donovan from Tipperary who is in the Visitors Gallery.  He is most welcome.</P>

        <P>I found the story Senator McDonald&rsquo;s told on the previous occasion riveting.  It was about her progress through her own party and how her view had changed because she did not want women to go through what she had gone through to achieve what she had achieved.</P>
        <P>There is much in this debate on which individual parties should reflect.  In my constituency group three of the four seats my party holds throughout the county of Louth are held by women.  There are many other women within the group and if I do not see them coming through in years to come, I will be asking serious questions about the nature of our group, how it operates and the reason they are not emerging.  We must also use this opportunity to reflect on our own structures.</P>
        <P>I wish to expand on an issue on which Senator Corrigan touched, namely, the way in which the theme of politics changes when women&rsquo;s participation increases.  The Senator spoke about how the social agenda had been moved forward by the greater participation of women, but I believe the economic agenda would also change if there was greater participation by women in politics.  I say this because so much of what is economically valuable is not acknowledged or measured within our political discourse.  I owe a debt to the report put together by the policy officer who has identified four areas within the economy in which women work; of the four, two are unmeasured &mdash; work in the home and work in the sex trade.  These issues will remain unaddressed in many respects until the analysis and desire within the political system become sufficiently strong and incisive and the issues involved become sufficiently important to the political establishment.  I see many failings in that regard.</P><Col N="806"/>
        <P>Another interesting issue I came across in the context of the debate on the Female Genital Mutilation Bill was the way the asylum system appeared to favour male applicants for asylum over female applicants.  It is not gender balanced.  It does not recognise women&rsquo;s experience in their home countries as valid when it comes to the issue of potential persecution on their return home; therefore, their ability to achieve success in the processing of asylum applications is reduced.  That is another area in which outcomes could change with the greater participation of women in politics.</P>
        <P>The point I am trying to make is that political priorities change with the greater participation of women.  How we can get to that point has been discussed at length.  I wanted to outline some of the potential positive consequences if we could get to the point where we had greater numbers of women making legislative decisions on behalf of women and men in this country.  Politics remains a macho world.  Another area in which I would like to see change is that of the funding, corporate funding in particular, of politics.  It also discriminates against women&rsquo;s participation in politics because it is a boys&rsquo; club.  It is virtually Masonic in certain instances in that the funding of politics is controlled and regulated, so to speak, by a small group of men.  My perception &mdash; perhaps I am wrong &mdash; is that women do not want to be part of this world and generally are not part of it.  Another consequence of the greater participation of women in politics would be a reconfiguring of the way politics is funded to allow women to participate in an equal way.  I would welcome such an outcome.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate her on her appointment.  I have not had the opportunity to do so in the House since her appointment, but I am pleased to see her in the ministerial chair today.</P>
        <P>I will restrict my comments to the second report published last October by my colleague, Senator Bacik, on women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  Before I do so, I wish to make some comments on my experience of female involvement in politics in my area of County Meath.  In the last general election in 2007 I was struck by the fact that in one of the two constituencies, Meath West, of the ten candidates who had put themselves forward to the electorate for election, not one was female.  That clearly illustrates something is wrong with our system that must be addressed at a fundamental level, through legislation if necessary, and it is a position that is no longer tenable.  The position was not much better in the constituency of Meath East.  Of the 11 candidates, four were female, which constitutes a higher representation but still not equal.  It is an issue we must examine.</P>
        <P>In that regard, the report published by Senator Bacik has come up with some good conclusions and recommendations.  I will deal with four of them, the first of which concerns child care.  One of the findings of the committee was that the long hours involved in politics were not conducive to facilitating the involvement of women.  I know this to be true, for example, from the times at which party political meetings are held, something of which I am sure the Minister of State is well aware.  Last night, for instance, I attended a meeting at 9.30 which continued until just after 11 p.m.  Anybody trying to raise a family while involved in politics must make a simple choice.  Which do they put first?  Of course, family life must come first, but we must examine the way all of us involved in the various parties organise our business because meetings that finish at 11 p.m. do not allow the involvement of those with families.</P>
        <P>Another issue we must examine is that of child care supports.  It is clear such supports are inadequate as provided within the system.  This Parliament is not family friendly.  We must make changes to rectify this and make it easier for people to participate.  One measure we could take is providing more teleconferencing facilities.  One of the benefits of the eruption in Iceland will be that more people will use videoconferencing and, perhaps, that is the direction <Col N="807"/>we should take.  It would help overcome travel difficulties and help people become more involved without having to leave their homes and families.</P>
        <P>A second key recommendation of the report concerned pay.  The authors found that, on average, women received 22% less pay than their male counterparts.  This puts people at a disadvantage when it comes to running for election.  Senator Healy Eames made a valid point when speaking about funding.  We need to look at that.  We could consider providing some funding for women candidates through the national system or through a voluntary system whereby each party would provide more funding to female candidates to help them overcome any pay imbalance that might exist.</P>
        <P>We also need to look at the area of confidence and we need to encourage more people into politics through head hunting.  I had experience of this in County Meath in the lead-up to the previous local elections.  Before the local elections in Meath last year, only three councillors out of 29, just 10%, were female.  There was something fundamentally wrong in that.  As the director of elections for my party in Meath, I like to think we went out of our way to try to rectify the imbalance.  In conjunction with my colleague, Senator Bacik, we head hunted people and found an excellent candidate, Eileen Drew, who agreed to run for us in the Navan electoral area.  We also approached people such as Niamh McGowan for the Dunshaughlin area.  In all, we ran more female than male candidates in Meath for the elections.  We chose well, got good candidates, and out of four Labour Party members on Meath County Council, three of them, 75%, are women.  This is fantastic.  In terms of the proportional share of seats, we have the biggest representation of women.  This has helped to change the overall representation of women in Meath and we now have nine females out of 29 councillors, as opposed to three out of 29 before the previous elections.</P>
        <P>This is a step in the right direction but it is only achieved by finding good candidates and putting them forward.  This means parties and directors of elections must be proactive, find people and convince them to run.  They must convince them also that they will be able to do a good job.  People are often put off by the idea of politics because of the bad press it gets.  They worry they will not be able to juggle the balls.  The parties must provide them with confidence.  They must also provide a commitment and ensure people will be on hand to help when issues arise such as, perhaps, not being able to go to meetings because of a lack of child care.  They must commit to doing their best to move meetings towards more child-friendly times.  This might help convince people to run who might otherwise be lost to the body politic.</P>
        <P>The final area on which I would like to focus is on the culture that exists in society.  One of the recommendations that arises relates to role models in schools.  I am aware there is an education programme being run from the Office of the Ceann Comhairle which encourages both Senators and Deputies to visit schools to speak to pupils.  We need to see female Members visiting schools to convince girls that politics is a worthwhile profession and to encourage them to become involved.  I have two suggestions for the Government.  First, it should introduce, as soon as possible, the gender parity Bill produced by the Labour Party.  Second, some time ago a photograph was taken of all living previous and current female Members.  Would the Minister of State be able to organise for that photograph to be exhibited on the walls of this House?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add some comments to this important debate on increasing women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  I did the same recently in Strasbourg where the Council of Europe debated two reports on this issue, one concerning women in politics and the other concerning women&rsquo;s role in conflict and conflict resolution, an issue which is related to our debate.  I have been pondering the issues of child care and pay.  I may not be flush with money but I would not consider it a major issue and child care is not an issue for me.  The main issue for me with regard to the role of women is the culture that exists.  A significant difference I <Col N="808"/>already see in this debate is that more men have spoken than did in the Council of Europe debate.  In our last debate in the Council of Europe on the issue, only two men offered to contribute.  Most of them were not even interested in contributing.  The fact our debate was on a Tuesday at a prime time as opposed to Friday lunchtime or Friday afternoon was a big change.</P>
        <P>I have been a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas for 14 years and recognise how important it is that countries such as Ireland try to change the gender balance.  At this stage in the process, we need to introduce positive discrimination.  I used be a strong believer in the fact that the best person would always win but, unfortunately, that is not my experience.  This is due to the culture.  It is one thing to get through an election process to get on a ticket, but it is another thing to get elected.  The Irish electoral psyche is not convinced that because 50% of the population is female, women have a role in developing policy, channelling discussion and producing legislation.  They do not elect females.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking from personal experience.  I look to the experience of the Women&rsquo;s Coalition in the North, which played a major role in the peace process.  Every day women try to sort out rows in homes, etc. and have skills that are different.  What happened to the Women&rsquo;s Coalition and where is it now?  It is gone, although some of its members have important senior positions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole touched on the fact that the media want us to be in the Chamber five days a week.  During my time teaching in England an election took place and when I asked 67 teachers in the staff room who their MP was, none of them could tell me for certain.  The balance we have here, where we have half a life in the Oireachtas and half a life in our constituency where we can listen to our people, is an important aspect of our role.  We are not just national legislators, but are legislating for our people.  This aspect of the role applies also to politicians from the county councils.  County council meetings might start in the morning and continue all day, but people want certainty on time.  They want to know when the meeting will start and when it will finish.  The starting and finishing time, especially for county councils, should be adhered to.  The condensed short week of the Oireachtas suits the likes of me.  I am here for a certain number of days and if we were confined to working from 9 to 5, what would I do from 5  in the evening untill 9 the next morning that would be constructive?  The long working day suits me, but it might not suit Senator Bacik, because she wants to get home to the wee ones.  This illustrates why the issue is so difficult.</P>
        <P>The attitude of the outside world has an influence in this area.  I am on the Council of Europe and have attended meetings and been able to contribute.  I am only there because it threatened to throw us out because we had no female representative.  We now have eight members, of whom I am the sole female, but we comply with the minimum requirements of gender equality.  The same happened with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, IPU.  We were going to get kicked out of that because we were not sending female representation.  We need outside agencies to point out what is wrong and to tell us it is unfair not to have female representation.  Fulfilling the minimum criteria does not meet national requirements and sends out a message to the electorate that politics is still a male-dominated area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will not rehearse my personal experience over the past 14 years, because it would be too dangerous to tell people what female representatives face.  It is easier to say that the Women&rsquo;s Coalition dealt with men throwing chairs at them.  That happened to someone else and I can <Col N="809"/>say it happened.  There is a long way to go with regard to the culture here and the acceptance of females.  We can say they are treated as equals but, in reality, people do not even realise they are not treating females as equals in the real sense.</P>
        <P>Many women are involved in community work.  If we could get them to explain why they get involved in such work for such long hours and days but will not step into politics, we might find some answers.  We must have women on the ballots.  I do not subscribe to the idea that it must be a woman because a woman is better than a man.  I do not believe that.  However, the females who get involved in politics give their hearts and souls to it.  I accept I am preaching to the converted here given that the majority of Members present are female but this is not something that will evolve naturally.  I have watched and hoped.  My party produced a report on women in politics 12 years ago but the Senator&rsquo;s report has found that the situation is getting worse, not better.  The statistics are available but I will not quote them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that women excel in politics, and it is not anti-man when one seeks to be pro-woman.  However, the Senator used a particular phrase, which I cannot find to quote now, when she asked, in effect, when it would become illegal, immoral or illegitimate to advance Bills without incorporating the viewpoint of a proportion of women.  The question of legislation embracing more than one perspective is terribly important.</P>
        <P>There have been numerous reports.  Which of the four females present has not responded to every student who has ever studied women in politics and who have asked them about the battles they have encountered?  We have the reports and we know the issues.  Action is needed now, not more reports.  I do not know how all the difficulties will be balanced but we must start with this House and try to explain to people outside the House why women are needed in politics.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have spent a great deal of time listening to this debate.  The contributions from all parties have been fascinating.  There were heartfelt stories of how Members got to this House and, in some cases, of Members who were previously Members of the D&aacute;il and how they did not get into the D&aacute;il for many years.  Members spoke of how we must make the path easier for women to take part in politics.</P>
        <P>I will look back again at the contributions from all sides.  Many common threads are emerging from what has been said.  There is consensus on the need to increase women&rsquo;s participation in politics and speaker after speaker, male and female, stressed their commitment to this goal.  As I mentioned previously, politics is the one field of gender equality in which women in Ireland have made no appreciable progress in the past 15 years, unlike their European counterparts.  Women have advanced in all other areas of Irish society in this time period.  The discussion in the Senate suggests that Senators would welcome steps, and quick steps, to address this deficit and to move towards more balanced representation in political decision-making.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In my opening statement, I mentioned that all the multilateral bodies strongly urge governments to work to a 40% threshold for women in political decision-making.  The Government has ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW.  In so doing, the Government has committed itself to overcome discrimination in all areas, including politics.  I will keep a close eye on this.  It is in this context that I have agreed to chair the work of the national women&rsquo;s strategy sub-committee on women and decision making.  I look forward to the work of this sub-committee.  Women in politics is just one element of the work of the sub-committee, but it is an important element.</P><Col N="810"/>
        <P Just="Left">The sub-committee will review all previous work on the topic, including the report prepared by Senator Bacik.  It will also review the steps taken in countries which have brought women to the fore in politics.  Many of their women politicians have combined a political life and a family life.  I cannot believe there are valid reasons that we cannot achieve the same successes in Ireland.  I am hopeful the new sub-committee will have an opportunity to meet with a small number of focus groups, such as Deputies and Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, who might be prepared to offer some practical experiences to guide its recommendations.  I also hope the sub-committee will have an opportunity to engage with the political parties through their general secretaries and equality officers to find common ground on which they can collaborate to increase female involvement.  I hope this happens very quickly.</P>
        <P>Many Senators, particularly women Senators, stressed the difficulty of combining their work in the House with family life.  A similar situation pertains in the D&aacute;il.  There is no automatic pairing for women Members who have just had a baby.  One presumes there is no pairing arrangement for new fathers either.  The European Union actively encourages member states to promote the sharing of family responsibilities to foster gender equality and women&rsquo;s opportunity to participate in economic life.  It also actively promotes women&rsquo;s engagement in decision making.  The D&aacute;il and the Seanad should be models of good practice in this regard.  Therefore, as a priority, Members of both Houses must work together to introduce more family friendly practices as soon as possible.  Good practice recommends that women take a period of at least six weeks after childbirth to enable them to bond with their new arrival.  Perhaps the two Houses can consider an automatic pairing for newly delivered mothers.  Good practice also suggests that new fathers should play a supportive role after the arrival of a new baby.  Perhaps we could consider a week&rsquo;s automatic pairing for a new father.</P>
        <P>One issue on which there was less consensus was the role of quotas.  Some speakers consider quotas to be detrimental and tokenist; others actively foster them.  I thank Senator Mooney for drawing my attention to the report he prepared for the Council of Europe in 2004.  There has been a significant body of further research from Strasbourg examining all the factors which can foster female advancement in politics.  In addition, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is examining electoral practices in Ireland at present.  I will keep track of the contributions it receives.  A number of Senators who spoke on this matter pointed to the long family traditions which had fostered their interest in politics.  We must ensure that our political system is equally open and welcoming to highly motivated people &mdash; women and men &mdash; who may not have a long association with politics but have an interest in getting involved and can bring their many skills and opinions to the table for the better of all.</P>
        <P>Women are better educated than ever.  The number of women with primary degrees has increased by almost 150% since the 1996 census, while the number of male graduates has increased by just under 100%.  As a result, women now make up 53% of our graduates.  We must ensure we utilise the talents of all these women fully and in all facets of society.  Another clear thread which emerged from this lengthy discussion is that much of the onus for the advancement of women in politics rests with all of us, both men and women, as active members of political parties and as active Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il.  Together we must work for reform.  We must press our respective parties to espouse reform and the greater involvement of women.  We must actively encourage more women to step forward and engage with the political parties.</P>
        <P>I was the first woman to be elected by the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency since the foundation of the State.  I had to grind that seat out of granite with my bare hands.  I do not want other women to have to work as hard as I did in 2007.  It took me ten long years to be able to speak as a Deputy.  I am anxious to encourage women and to share my experience with other women <Col N="811"/>who have managed to get through the glass ceiling.  I will actively promote that for as long as I am elected to the House.</P>
        <P>We must be conscious too of the old stereotypes.  When I was first elected a political representative said to me: &ldquo;There are three things you need, Mary, when you get in.  They are a stomach for pints, for late nights and long days, and a great appetite for fast food.&rdquo;  I have learned about the long days but perhaps I can leave the others behind.  That is the general gender stereotype.  As Senator Hannigan said, late nights with late meetings do not contribute to good family life.  It is detrimental to young women entering politics, particularly those with families.  In response also to Senator Hannigan, I will ask the Captain of the Guard to find a space on a very prominent wall in the Houses of the Oireachtas to hang that wonderful photograph.  I will ask him to enlarge it so we can see every person who gathered on that memorable day. Let it hang in an historic place for all to see the wonderful women who have contributed over the years in both Houses so we can look at that with a sense of pride and look forward to at least doubling those numbers.</P>

    <Title>Ombudsman for Children Report on Children First Guidelines: Statements.</Title>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the recent publication of the report of the Ombudsman for Children entitled, Investigation into the Implementation of Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which guidelines were first published in September 1999.  They are the over-arching national guidelines that apply to all individuals and agencies which come into contact with children.  Their aim is to assist in the identification, investigation, assessment, reporting, treatment and management of child abuse.  The Ombudsman for Children has acknowledged that Children First is by far the most comprehensive and far-reaching document on child protection and welfare in the history of the State.  Since 1999 the guidelines have formed the basis for the many child protection guidelines and practices operated across a wide number of sectors, including education, sports, youth work, leisure, community and voluntary organisations.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report identifies many of the implementation difficulties highlighted in previous reviews of the Children First guidelines.  They include a comprehensive review conducted by my office and published in 2008.  The report acknowledges that planned and substantial steps were taken to implement the Children First guidelines.  The investigation finds that insufficient efforts were made by the HSE to drive forward implementation of the guidelines and identifies the failure of the former health boards to solve problems arising with Children First, including variable implementation.  The report is also critical of the degree of inter-agency oversight and the role of the Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for Children and Youth Affairs in this regard.  The adverse findings focus, in particular. on the period 2003 to 2007.  The report recognises the advances made since 2008 and the potential of these initiatives to realise effective change in the area of child protection.  This, in itself, should not give rise to complacency, as sustained action is required.</P><Col N="812"/>
        <P>In response to the publication of the Ferns Report in October 2005 a national review of compliance with the Children First guidelines was conducted by my office in partnership with all relevant Departments.  The key finding of the review, published in 2008, was that, in general, difficulties and variations in implementation of the guidelines arose as a result of local variation and infrastructural issues, rather than from fundamental difficulties with the guidelines themselves.  I stated at the time that the issues of consistency in implementation and the development of standards should be given priority and I am determined to ensure this will be the case in practice.</P>
        <P>The Children First guidelines have recently been revised by my office to take into account the findings of  previous reviews.  The revised guidelines were published on my office&rsquo;s website in December 2009.  Some textual amendments have since been made, including a response to issues raised by the Ombudsman for Children in the report being discussed in the House today.  Many of the broader recommendations made in the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report align with the Government&rsquo;s implementation plan arising from the Ryan report and the reform efforts under way across the HSE&rsquo;s child protection services.  The focus now has to be on sustained implementation, rather than further reviews, in order to ensure the systems for protecting children from harm are strengthened.  The newly revised guidelines will be supported by a detailed and comprehensive implementation framework which will apply across all sectors.  The framework will include particular emphasis on the need for robust implementation assurance systems, including, as appropriate, data analysis and reporting, spot checks, examination of case files, audit and complaints procedures.  I will be bringing proposals to the Government shortly in this regard.</P>
        <P>The implementation plan includes a number of specific recommendations relating to Children First, including the development of legislation to provide that all staff employed by the State and staff employed in agencies in receipt of Exchequer funding who work with or are in regular contact with children will have a duty to comply with the Children First guidelines; a duty to share relevant information in the best interests of the child; and a duty to co-operate with other relevant services.  The implementation plan also includes commitments to ensure compliance with the Children First guidelines will be linked with all relevant inspection processes across the education, health and justice sectors.  In addition, it commits to HIQA developing outcome-based standards for child protection services.  I particularly welcome the role HIQA proposes to play in the future framework.  The ultimate aim of all these endeavours and initiatives must always be to ensure the protection and well-being of those children who are being abused or are at risk of being abused.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the discussions on child protection generate further discussion on the issue of mandatory reporting of abuse.  The introduction of mandatory reporting has previously been considered by the Government which is not proposing to introduce any form of mandatory reporting at this time.  The 2009 report of the special rapporteur on child protection, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, advised against the introduction of mandatory reporting of child abuse on a legislative basis, citing international evidence which suggested mandatory reporting only served to overload child protection systems with high volumes of reports which often resulted in no commensurate increase in the number of substantiated cases.  I am in agreement with this view.</P>
        <P>Recent reviews of the Children First guidelines have found them to be robust and appropriate.  I am satisfied that the commitment in the Ryan report implementation plan in relation to the development of legislation to introduce a duty to comply with the guidelines is seen as the most effective way to ensure people will fulfil their obligations to protect children from abuse.</P><Col N="813"/>
        <P>Last year the Government accepted in full the recommendations made in the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse which revealed harrowing details of abuses perpetrated on children who had been placed by the State in residential institutions run by religious orders.  I was asked by the Taoiseach to prepare an implementation plan, drawing on experience from all relevant Departments and public bodies.  The plan is a very comprehensive response to Mr. Justice Ryan&rsquo;s recommendations.  It contains a total of 99 action points to address each of the commission&rsquo;s 20 recommendations.  I am chairing a high level group to monitor implementation of the plan.  The group includes representatives from my office, the HSE, HIQA, the Irish youth justice service, the Department of Education and Science and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It meets twice a year and a progress report will be presented to the Government each year.  The lifetime of the group will be a minimum of four years.</P>
        <P>Many of the actions outlined in the Government&rsquo;s implementation plan will have a direct impact on the operation of the child welfare and protection service, including implementation of Children First.  The Government is committed to implementation of the plan and &euro;15 million is being made available this year for the implementation of these actions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Successive Ministers have taken a series of initiatives since publication of Children First in 1999 to improve the quality of children&rsquo;s lives and protect children at risk.  The legislative and policy framework has been significantly strengthened through the passage of major pieces of legislation such as the Children Act 2001, the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007 and the continuing passage of new legislation through the Oireachtas, including the Adoption Bill 2009 and the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009.  Key policy initiatives include the agenda for children&rsquo;s services, the Irish youth justice service strategy, the youth homelessness strategy and the report of the working group on foster care.  Major developments have also taken place at service level including the establishment and expansion of the social services inspectorate under the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the development of national standards for children in the care of the State, the continued development of special care units for vulnerable children, the expansion of the Garda vetting services; the establishment of the children&rsquo;s services committees, the development of standardised service delivery and business processes in the HSE, the development of a knowledge management strategy for child welfare and protection services, including reform of the child protection notification system, and the development of a sustainable and cost-effective solution for the provision of out-of-hours services for garda&iacute; who remove children under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to building on the existing legislative and policy framework and to taking any additional actions deemed necessary to ensure greater protection for children at risk.  One key commitment of the Ryan report implementation plan is to ensure all children in care have an allocated social worker and care plan.  To this end the HSE has been given approval to recruit an additional 265 child welfare and protection staff, including 200 social workers, in 2010.  The recruitment process is under way and will continue until the additional posts are filled.  I have previously placed on the record of this House my appreciation for the work carried out by social work teams.  Any person who has followed any recent child welfare cases through the courts appreciates the often trying circumstances in which social workers operate.</P>
        <P>Approximately 5,700 children are in the care of the State.  Between relative and general foster care, in excess of 5,100 children are accommodated.  This reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring children are placed in a stable and loving family environment, allowing them to develop close bonds that nurture their emotional and physical needs.  It is a very positive development that of the children placed by the HSE with foster carers, approximately one third are placed with relative carers.</P><Col N="814"/>
        <P>While I recognise this is an important development for the benefit of children, I am aware of the challenges which face us in this area.  One area of concern to me is that 16% of these children do not have an allocated social worker.  The many actions set out in the Ryan report implementation plan were developed to assist me and the HSE in resolving problems such as this.</P>
        <P>Since 2003, funding for family support services has increased by 80%, with funding for foster care up by 34% and residential care by 7%.  The smaller increase in residential care reflects the positive steps taken to prioritise providing care in a family setting rather than in a residential setting.  The HSE budget for 2010 for children and families is &euro;53.6 million.  This covers a wide range of services which includes family support services, child protection services, youth homelessness services, children&rsquo;s residential centres, fostering and relative care services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recent days, weeks and months have seen much adverse reporting of various aspects of services provided to the most vulnerable members of society.  It may often seem as if the responses to the harrowing stories of abuse and neglect highlight only deficiencies and inadequacies in the services tasked with meeting such a range of challenges.  The initiatives which we are taking will result in better outcomes for children.  The problems we face are not insurmountable but we should be under no illusions about the environment in which we operate.  It is extremely challenging and we must recognise that there are no quick fixes in this area.  The problems will not be solved overnight.  To suggest otherwise is politically naive and foolhardy.</P>
        <P>Society must recognise it is the responsibility of each and every individual in Ireland to play their part in protecting children from harm.  Without such vigilance we risk placing all responsibility on our child welfare and protection services.  Like all public services, child welfare and protection operates with many resource constraints.  It is a continuing challenge to have both a proactive and responsive service.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to addressing the crucial challenge of protecting the most vulnerable members of society.  When children are failed for whatever reason, they must be protected by society and the State must live up to its statutory responsibilities and more in this regard.  As every parent knows, this is a complex and difficult task.  It requires an ongoing commitment, imagination and hard work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The context in which a debate takes place more often than not has a major influence on the outcome of that debate.  In the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan report last May, we were galvanised as a nation in our resolve to ensure no child would ever suffer the kind of horrific abuse described in that report.  We said: &ldquo;Never again and not on our watch.&rdquo;  We in the modern and enlightened Ireland would not tolerate such atrocities.  We laid the blame for this abuse at the door of generations past.</P>
        <P>Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the publication of the report yet what has really changed in the past 12 months?  While there has been much hand wringing with ambitious commitments made, not one Bill has been passed to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights.  Ultimately, it is all a question of priorities and protecting children but it does not seem to be a priority for the Government.  If protecting our children was not a priority in the immediate aftermath of the Ryan and Murphy reports or in the aftermath of the deaths of children in the care of the HSE, we must accept that child protection will never likely be a priority for Fianna F&aacute;il or the Green Party.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State continues to respond with assertions that he and his Department have either commissioned a report, are awaiting the publication of one or are about to act on one.  The saddest part of this whole saga is the conclusive proof that the Government is more than capable of swift and decisive action when it feels the need to take such action.  In September <Col N="815"/>2008, the House sat through one night to pass legislation guaranteeing bank deposits.  We drafted and passed in several months the complex legislation underpinning NAMA.  Despite this, we are seemingly incapable of affording the same priority through far simpler legislation to ensure the protection of children.</P>
        <P>The Children First guidelines were published in 1999.  Eleven years later these guidelines have yet to be put on a statutory footing.  For example, the guidelines require each local health office to draw up local procedures to give guidance on implementing the guidelines.  Eleven years later, half of local health offices do not have proper local procedures or have only recently drawn them up.  Eleven years later there is no 24-hour access available for garda&iacute; or social workers to the child protection notification system.  It is particularly shocking, in light of the revelations of the past decade, that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report documents the continuing failure of the HSE and the Garda to operate joint liaison and documentary arrangements in many parts of the State in respect of allegations of child abuse.</P>
        <P>Eleven years later, the rate of social workers in this country is one to every 1,800 persons while in Northern Ireland it is one to every 660 persons.  Even the social workers we do have are not allocated on a needs basis.  For example, the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report tells us that County Galway had the highest number of reports to social workers in the State while D&uacute;n Laoghaire had the 31st highest.  Despite this, both had the same number of social work posts.</P>
        <P>Eleven years later we learn that an industrial dispute which began in 2002 continues to affect the implementation of Children First.  It has never been resolved.  Not alone that, it has also been kept secret by the HSE and the trade union, IMPACT.</P>
        <P>So abysmal has been the HSE&rsquo;s and the Government&rsquo;s performance on this issue that when PA Consulting finalised its recent report on children in care, it felt obliged to give it the title &ldquo;Putting Children First and Meaning It&rdquo;.  Then we learned the HSE had no intention of making this report public.  This report and the Ombudsman for Children both highlight major inadequacies in our child care services.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is determined to address these inadequacies.  That determination must now be matched by swift action.  The Ryan report implementation plan commits to drafting legislation by this December to provide that all staff employed by the State and in agencies in receipt of Exchequer funding will have a duty to comply with the Children First guidelines.  The deadline for delivery of this commitment is the end of this year.</P>
        <P>If it is to be met, legislation must be drafted without delay.  It is now almost the beginning of June and time is rapidly running out.  The Bill should be published with enough time to allow for consultation with relevant stakeholders, including professionals working with children and non-governmental organisations.  If the deadline of December this year is not met, then whatever credibility the Minister of State has in this area and whatever trust is placed in his role will surely evaporate into thin air.    Earlier, I remarked that tomorrow is the first anniversary of the publication of the Ryan report.  Would it not be a most fitting marking of that anniversary if the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, were to announce a date for the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights?  Though he has 24 hours left to make such an announcement, I do not expect it will happen.  The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children has done the State some valuable service by providing the basis for the referendum.  The Minister has &euro;3 million in his budget to cover the cost of the referendum.  What more appropriate gesture of solidarity and love could we extend to our 1 million children than to enshrine their right to a happy and carefree childhood in our country&rsquo;s Constitution?  The Minister of State and the Government should recall their own human reaction to the publication of the Ryan report one <Col N="816"/>year ago.  They should recall their revulsion and horror, but above all they should recall their steely determination at that time to protect our children in the future.</P>
        <P>I recall the words of the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, in the introduction to the Ryan report implementation plan:</P>
        <P LI="1">There are many reasons why we were shocked by the Ryan Report.  Not least of these was the sense that more could have been done and that many of us ignored warning signs.  We need to challenge ourselves as a society to do more to protect children . . . The sense of indifference that was all too obvious in the 20th century needs to be replaced by a sense of engagement.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is now time to challenge and engage, but above all to act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  He is doing an excellent job ensuring the children of the country have a voice through the preparation of the legislation.  I refer to the remarks of Senator Cannon.  It is not long since he was involved with the Government on this side of the House.  He made little or no contribution on child care while on this side of the House.  Since he went over to the other side of the House it has been a case of empty drum banging and point scoring, which is not what we should be doing.  We should ensure the children of this country are No. 1.  The Government has appointed two Ministers of State in the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for child care.  The current Minister of State has done great work since taking over.</P>
        <P>The children of this country will have a voice for the first time and they will have protection under these new proposals.  We must ask ourselves what we have done in the past six or seven years.  I recall when I was on a health board there was no health care or child care policy within the health system.  The current and preceding Governments introduced legislation to ensure children would be on top of the agenda.  The current Government is the third in a row to take on board the importance of our children.</P>
        <P>What did we do?  We have come from a very low base to ensure child care and associated facilities are monitored.  What have we done in the areas of play centres for child care?  During the past 12 or 13 years, every county council throughout the country has ensured there are proper playgrounds and child care facilities throughout the country.  Regardless of where one goes now, one will see a playground for children.  There is a lovely playground in Graiguenamanagh, completed in the past year and a half or two years.  It is a credit to the local county council.  That represents true investment by the Minister of State, who ensured funding for facilities for young children would be included in the budget.</P>
        <P>How do we ensure the Ryan report and the various other reports are a thing of the past?  It was important to establish the problems that arose within the child care system.  We trusted various people to look after the children.  Perhaps the Governments of that time should take as much responsibility as the churches and other organisations which looked after our children.  We left it to those people to do the job but we had no way of checking it.  Now, we have a Minister of State in place and there will be legislation and child protection in place.</P>
        <P>We have come a long way and it is important not to rush the required legislation.  Proper thought and benchmarking should be included in the legislation to ensure that when we introduce legislation for child care and hold a referendum, the proper referendum is put to the people.  We should not rush the process because Senator Cannon and his colleagues on the other side of the House wish to include by-elections in any poll.  We all know what happened in the last by-election.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sticking with the statements but it is important to bear in mind that we should hear solutions in the House rather than criticisms.  Too many people are criticising various organisations but do very little themselves.  I would prefer to see a more hands-on approach and proposed solutions to matters under discussion in the House, whether legislation, guidelines or whatever.  It is important to take such an approach and to take responsibility for it.  The Minister of State has done this since he came to office and he has highlighted the importance of child care and what we are doing.  Much work has been done in this regard in terms of facilities for child care.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has funded the pre-school year during hard times, a very important first step to ensure we have good facilities in place and that our children can get a good start when they begin at school.  The pre-school year is very important.  The take-up of the pre-school year has been positive and we must ensure it increases.  I refer to the facilities on which money has been spent during the past 12 to 18 months.  The spending has taken place during difficult times and we had to borrow the money.  However, I believe it is an investment in our children.  We have borrowed the money to ensure they get better education and facilities and it is important we continue to do so.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman for Children has been critical of the Minister&rsquo;s office and that is no harm.  It is important that the Ombudsman does her job and examines what is taking place in child care to establish if there is any area not fully in line with how we should handle things in the HSE.  As someone with some experience in this regard, I maintain the HSE will need to tighten up its organisation in the area of child care.  There is a job for the Minister of State to do in this regard.  I refer to the figures quoted by the Minister of State of 5,100 children in foster care, which is very impressive.  If a child cannot live within his or her own family, foster care is one of the better options.  Foster parents are wonderful people.  They are the unsung heroes who take in children and ensure they have a normal life.  They make sure very few children are in the care of the State and that there are proper checks and balances within the care system.  I hear very few complaints about foster care.  It is probably the better way to go to ensure children are well looked after.</P><Col N="818"/>
        <P>An increase of 80% in the HSE budget for 2010 and an expansion of the child care service are commendable, when one considers the cutbacks that have had to be made.  That is a very important point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I welcome the Minister of State, for whom I feel great sympathy, as this is a very difficult brief.  I do not doubt his bona fides and desire to do his utmost to make sure children are protected in society.  The sympathy I feel for him personally is combined with a sense of asperity about the continuing failure of the State and State agencies to do the needful.  </P>
        <P>I recognise that it is extremely difficult to foresee all possible situations in which children might be harmed, take the appropriate actions and provide the appropriate resources to make sure children are fully protected.  There are few crimes more evil than the abuse of children, sexual or otherwise.  Once stolen, a childhood cannot be returned.  Sadly, we have learned that the abuse of children is far more common than once supposed.  The Ryan and Murphy reports in Ireland have opened many people&rsquo;s eyes, as has the Johansson report in Sweden, according to which 61% of women and 42% of men were subject to sexual abuse during their time in state-run foster homes and orphanages.  The reports make for horrifying reading.  It is incumbent on every organisation in the State, religious and secular, and the State to make sure we put in place whatever procedures are necessary to ensure children will be safe from harm.  There can be no exceptions or excuses for failure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report on the investigation into the implementation of Children First: Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  It is timely in that it deals with a matter of grave public concern.  If one strips away the polite public service jargon, the report is an indictment of the HSE and will lead people to question the extent to which Government responses extend beyond the commissioning of reports.  It concludes that, at times, child protection services were not given priority in the reform process.  It states, &ldquo;To date, there has been no shortage of analysis of what the problems are, but far less action to tackle them&rdquo;.  In the very next sentence it states, &ldquo;The HSE is currently undertaking a strategic review of the delivery and management of child protection services&rdquo;.  How many reviews do we need before something is done?  This is what many will feel entitled to ask.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that Children First was published in 1999.  It provides detailed guidance for HSE staff, the Garda and others involved in child protection.  Its goals are to ensure children are protected from abuse and that their welfare is promoted.  The fact that in 2010 we are still looking at reviews and investigations of this kind is an indictment.  Putting Children First on a statutory basis is only part of the solution.  There is a need for additional resources to make implementation possible.  There are significant issues which must be addressed in an implementation strategy, including communicating widely the revised guidance; development of a range of protocols related to information sharing; co-operative working between statutory and voluntary agencies and the church; and the development of strategic plans across the HSE.</P>
        <P>The report finds that half of local health offices either do not have proper local procedures in place or have only recently drawn them up.  The Ombudsman for children is greatly concerned that in most parts of the State there is no 24-hour access to the child protection notification system, despite the fact that such access is required by Children First guidelines.  This means the Garda and accident and emergency departments in hospitals cannot check, out of hours, on a child, about whom they have concerns.  Furthermore, in almost no part of the State are joint action sheets implemented.  These sheets are intended to record exactly who is responsible for what when a child protection concern being dealt with by the HSE is also the subject matter of a criminal investigation by the Garda.</P><Col N="819"/>
        <P>The report&rsquo;s investigation also confirms the finding of previous reviews that Garda and HSE co-operation is not working as required.  Although many links between the two are based on informal co-operation, this, too, is contingent on personal relationships.  There should be created a statutory duty to develop protocols which would allow for better communication between the key agencies and between statutory and other agencies.  The HSE and the Garda should co-operate to a much greater degree.  This would not, necessarily, be resource intensive.  It requires a greater willingness on the part of people to be less protective of their own organisations and more proactive about safeguarding children.  While the HSE and the Garda have statutory responsibilities, children would be safer if a more collaborative working relationship was built with other organisations working with children.</P>
        <P>All of these failings increase the likelihood of vulnerable children falling through the cracks.  They are described by some, euphemistically, as systems failures.  In plain English, this means no one is held responsible when a child in Government care dies.  It is not good enough.  No one would accept such an explanation from the church and one would be right not to.  Nor should we accept any such explanation from the State.</P>
        <P>The actual recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children contain some startling suggestions.  Recommendation No. 18, for example, states record-keeping should be sufficient to record decisions taken and guide future actions and that sufficient resources should be put in place to ensure this.  What health care organisation does not keep a record of decisions taken?  It is disheartening that such action has to be recommended in the first place.</P>
        <P>Part of the problem is attributable to the shortcomings of the Children First guidelines.  Clearly, Garda vetting is an important part of the recruitment process, but it is not helpful to refer to vetting without talking about proper recruitment procedures, as the guidelines do.  Vetting and the exchange of soft information need to be underpinned by legislation.</P>
        <P>Little attention is given to supporting the maintenance of a child&rsquo;s links with his or her family when such links are in the best interests of the child.  Outcomes for children in care can be catastrophic, as recent events demonstrate.  Given this, we would expect to see in the document more detail on the importance of family support, both at a strategic level and in care plans.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Children First guidelines do not adequately address the issue of oversight of the statutory agencies involved in child protection.  For example, it is their role to carry out child protection inspections.  I suggest to the Minister of State that a sign of genuine action would be for the State to appoint a Government equivalent of Mr. Ian Elliot who has been a godsend to the church who would ask the tough questions about child protection and name and shame those failing to do their duty.  It is evident that such a person is needed to fire a rocket of reform into the morass of systematic maladministration which characterises the health service on this issue.  Failure to do so will, in time, lead to further Ryan and Murphy reports.  The mere thought of this should be enough to fill us with horror.</P>
        <P>It is easy to point to all of the things that are going wrong, but I recognise that individuals nearly always mean well.  That applies to the Minister of State downwards.  In a recent debate in this House all Members subscribed to the idea that in the words of the Proclamation we should cherish the children of the nation equally.  I apply this to minors, not just to all of the children of the Gael.</P>
        <P>We should accept the difficulties faced by the Government.  I do not like to see this become a political issue, where one party accuses another of not caring enough about children.  That is not where the problem is.  There is a need for a wider analysis of the currents and trends in society.  The breakdown of family life, lack of access of children to father figures in their lives and the greater economic challenges we now face all make it harder for the State to do its duty by vulnerable children.  We must also recognise the limitations of the State.  There is no substi<Col N="820"/>tute for the functioning family in the welfare of children.  At best, the State will always be playing catch-up.</P>
        <P>Criticism is deserved.  I respect the fact that the Minister of State is taking advice and do not think he is being personally obdurate on the issue.  I speak as someone who has tracked it for a long time, from my time working in the press office of the church, in which I experienced at close quarters the pain of having to learn hard lessons about how situations had been dealt with in the past.  A particular debt of gratitude is owed to victims of abuse who were not silenced and were clear and sometimes relentless in their criticisms, necessarily so.  However, the Minister of State says the Government is not proposing to introduce any form of mandatory reporting at this time.  The reason given is that Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, with whom I was at college and for whom I have the highest regard, advises &ldquo;against the introduction of mandatory reporting of child abuse on a legislative basis, citing international evidence that suggests that mandatory reporting only serves to overload child protection systems with high volumes of reports, often resulting in no commensurate increase in substantiated cases&rdquo;.  While the Minister of State said he agrees with this view, I find myself scratching my head.</P>
        <P>We are talking a lot about the past failures of the Archbishop of Armagh.  I would hate to have to live with the thought that my not having gone to the police with knowledge I had at a particular time might have contributed to the context in which a person proceeded to abuse children.  That argument has been very well ventilated.  It is a personal story about which we are all hearing, yet the State is saying it still does not believe people should have to go to the Garda.  Perhaps I am missing something but I believe there is a disconnect.  The Minister of State says we should not make it a requirement for people to report crimes involving child sexual abuse to the Garda because it will not necessarily lead to more convictions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I very much welcome the Minister of State responsible for children to the House.  It is very important that there be a Minister of State responsible for children.  We are here to discuss the report of the Ombudsman for Children.  It is very important that there be an ombudsman for children.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen stated all the Government seems to do is produce reports.  That is always a criticism of Governments and can sometimes be valid.  I would like to refer to the renewed programme for Government.  Under the heading &ldquo;Children&rdquo; on page 19, the first sentence states, &ldquo;We will fully execute the Government Implementation Plan in response to the Ryan Report, including the improvement of children&rsquo;s services and a National Day of Atonement.&rdquo;  When reports are produced, their recommendations should be implemented.  The key item in the renewed programme for Government refers to the implementation of the recommendations of the Ryan report.  Implementation is crucial.</P>
        <P>I have spoken on the protection of the children of the nation before.  It is one of the most important issues that any of us can speak on in this House.  Clich&eacute;s apart, the children are the future of the nation.  How we treat, educate and raise our children very much frames how society will be shaped in the future.  It is crucial that any mistakes our generation made are addressed.  The Senators present are of a number of generations but common to us all is the fact that we are not children, most of us.  We are either middle-aged or older people.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we are all children of the universe.  I remember meeting the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, as a child.  He was not a Minister of State then.  He was a young fellow and I do not know whether he was in short pants.  I cannot quite remember that much.  I believe he was on the rugby field at the time.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon made a number of very interesting points.  He said the context of the debate frames the debate, and I agree.  The programme for Government refers to a day of atonement.  I urge the Minister of State to consider this.  A day of atonement is very important and would help us all.</P>
        <P>I previously called for a Seanad debate in a location such as Letterfrack, which I have investigated.  I have talked to the local community there.  It would be very proactive to bring the Oireachtas to places relevant to this debate.  We need to be proactive and work with communities.  There is nothing better the Oireachtas can do than work with the people who are relevant to this debate.</P>
        <P>It would be very poignant to have a debate in a place such as Letterfrack.  It is a very powerful place and a very suitable place for it.  Having discussed the matter with the local community recently, I noted there is a lot of hurt in that community.  Many children were hurt <Col N="822"/>there and the hurt remains today.  The people are very clear about the fact that the institution in Letterfrack, which is so notorious, no longer exists.  It has a new purpose and is now part of the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P>The people of Letterfrack say we must look at the matter from a past-present-future point of view.  We must recognise and accept what occurred in society and move on from it.  We must accept where we are in the present and the fact that child abuse has not gone away and will probably always be with us.  We need to minimise it to the greatest possible extent and put in place as many checks and balances as possible, including having a Minister of State responsible for children, which is very important, and an ombudsman for children.  It is also important to have proper institutions and checks and balances to ensure the blind eyes turned to child abuse in the past cannot be turned to it today.  We must always be vigilant.  We cannot just assume child abuse occurred in the past and will never occur again.  If we do so, we will leave ourselves very much open to its recurrence.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon stated the first anniversary of the issuing of the Ryan report is tomorrow.  It is fantastic that the report has been published.  It would not have been published many years ago.  Those who say the Government can do or has done nothing should note the report has been published.  The Government is seeking to implement its recommendations and that is very important.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators referred to the referendum on children.  It is very unfortunate that the debate on the referendum has got tied up with the debate on by-elections.  This is very wrong.  The referendum needs to be held at the earliest possible juncture and with all-party agreement.  I urge the Minister of State to proceed with full haste to hold the referendum as early as possible because it is crucial that children&rsquo;s rights be enshrined in the Constitution in a way that a large majority of the people can support.  This is important and achievable.  The referendum should be decoupled from the three by-elections which are to be held on the same date.  The debate on the by-elections is political and is hampering what is a very important referendum.</P>
        <P>The Seanad can contribute greatly to child protection and Members must work on an all-party basis.  Bringing politics and religion into the debate is wrong.  It is a societal and community issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in almost complete agreement with what has just been said.  However, politics enters the equation when we come to discuss the requirement to allocate resources, expand provision and fund changes and improvements to services.  At its heart, politics relates to the allocation of public resources and the setting of priorities.  As stated on previous occasions, I have never perceived debates of this nature as occasions on which to engage in party political contests.  I certainly did not perceive the two to two and a half years the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children spent discussing this matter as an opportunity to engage in such a contest.  However, that is not to state that politics does not enter the equation.  As already indicated, it enters the equation in the most general sense when we discuss the level of priority we ascribe to this subject and the level of priority we are prepared to attach in respect of the requirement relating to the provision of additional resources.</P>
        <P>We have debated matters of this nature with the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, on several occasions.  I have no doubt that he is obliged to watch his p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s.  I am not stating that he might misrepresent the position but he is obliged to defend the Government.  He is not going to inform us that he is pressing for additional resources but that his requests have so far been refused.  Nor is he going to state that attempts to employ the additional 265 <Col N="823"/>social workers that are required will be accelerated or that these people should be recruited forthwith.  I would be surprised if I was wrong in thinking that if it were left to the Minister of State, the recruitment of these social workers would be completed very quickly.  However, action in this regard has been no more forthcoming than that required, in the context of additional funding and resources, in the area of child protection.  Politics, therefore, enters the equation in that sense.</P>
        <P>Opposition politicians are not only entitled to criticise the Government but are under a duty to do so, particularly where it makes commitments on which it fails to deliver.  We would not be doing our job if we failed to engage in such a critique of the Government.  However, I am not, as already stated, seeking to obtain a party political advantage in respect of this issue.  I disagree with those who attempted to take such an approach to this matter in the past.</P>
        <P>This debate on the report of the Ombudsman for Children provides us with a good opportunity to reflect on what we are doing.  I accept we would not have time to do so but I believe we would be better served if we were to examine the report on a line-by-line basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>When discussing reports of this nature, Members tend to make Second Stage speeches and engage in something of a rhetorical analysis.  In circumstances where terrible tragedies have taken place and where undoubted gaps in provision have been exposed as a result of some of the awful events that have occurred, I am continually prompted to inquire as to what Opposition politicians can do.  The Ombudsman for Children has an independent and statutory role and I am glad this was not &mdash; despite Government attempts to the contrary last year &mdash; merged with the roles of any of the other ombudsmen.  The Ombudsman for Children retains a strong, independent and autonomous position in our system.</P>
        <P>In the context of my question with regard to what Opposition politicians can do, I am of the view that we can examine the report line by line and ask the Minister of State to identify the conclusions and findings with which he agrees and those with which he does not agree.  We can also ask him about the action he intends to take.  That is the only reason for engaging in a debate of this nature.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report identifying many of the implementation difficulties highlighted in previous reviews of the Children First guidelines.  They are not just implementation difficulties, they are failures.  Language is an important and essential tool in any debate.  I would love everyone &mdash; the Minister of State, the Government and Members &mdash; to use the English language in the way it is intended to be used.  What the Minister of State refers to as implementation difficulties are actually failings.  We cannot hope to change the system unless we are honest about the areas in respect of which it has fallen down.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on some of the findings of the Ombudsman for Children.  The third of these contained in her report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">[U]p until the establishment of a HSE Taskforce in February 2009, this Office concludes that insufficient efforts were made to drive forward implementation of Children First by the HSE internally, such as failure to ensure that Local Health Offices had local procedures, and that this involved unsound administration by the HSE in the period since its creation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The phrase &ldquo;unsound administration&rdquo; is slightly awkward.  However, it emanates from the statute under which the Office of the Ombudsman for Children was established and by means of which she is obliged to deliver her criticisms.  What efforts are being made by the Minister of State&rsquo;s office to &ldquo;drive forward the implementation of Children First&rdquo;?  During his contribution, he provided a commitment to the effect that certain things will be done and used language <Col N="824"/>which referred to the necessity for progressing matters etc.  Members on this side of the House could usefully insist that the Government establish timelines in respect of the making of progress with regard to issues of this nature.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated he will be bringing proposals to Government shortly in respect of the implementation of the guidelines.  He also stated that rather than concentrating on reviews, he wants to consider how a process of sustained implementation might be put in place.  When will the proposals to which the Minister of State refers be brought to Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>When they are ready.  A great deal of progress has been made in respect of this matter.  Senator Mullen was extremely accurate when he stated it is necessary to deal with the statutory aspects as well as those relating to implementation.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State indicated he intends to take action.  In such circumstances, it is not unreasonable for us to request that an objective timeline be put in place.  Everyone would be interested in there being a greater degree of clarity.</P>
        <P>The question of recruiting 265 additional social workers has been invoked on many occasions.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State indicated the HSE has been given approval to recruit an additional 265 child welfare and protection staff, including 200 social workers, in 2010.

	<P>Approximately one year ago, I heard that an additional 270 social workers were to be recruited.  How many advertisements have been placed in the newspapers in respect of this matter?  Will all of the posts be net new posts?  There was a suggestion at one stage that people within the system would be redeployed.  I expect the Minister of State will be able to provide information in this regard.</P><Col N="825"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State acknowledged the contribution social workers and those involved in child care make.  Those who work for NGOs and others state it is difficult to find people who work in this area who are not either burnt out or seriously overworked.  That is a fact.  The people to whom I refer are at the heart of the system and they are under enormous pressure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I simply do not understand the delay in bringing forth the so-called soft information in vetting, something which has been promised for a good 18 months.  In my presence the Minister of State indicated to the committee 18 months ago that this legislation was imminent.  I shall check the record.  It was to be produced by the end of January 2009.  That is what we were told in the committee.  Perhaps it was not the Minister of State.  It might have been his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who said it.  Even if the committee was not given that information with such clarity at the time, certainly there was an indication that this matter would be dealt with quickly and efficiently through legislation.  We have not had anything in this respect and it is unacceptable that this is the case a year and a half later.  The commitment we are getting now looks less clear than it was originally.  It is getting more vague all the time.  The job we can do on this side of the House involves actual specifics and actual commitments and it is a question of debating these with the Minister of State.  I do not, unfortunately, see anything new in what the Minister of State had to say about specific commitments to action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this very important debate and I acknowledge the work the Minister of State has undertaken in this area.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious the Minister of State&rsquo;s portfolio is not just about child protection, but covers many other areas.  It must seem to him, however, that at present his portfolio almost completely comprises child protection issues.  This reflects the fact that child protection is very complex.  It impacts on almost every aspect of our lives, but its function is unambiguous.  It is about keeping children safe, and that is the core message.</P>
        <P>We are reminded every day of the impact of child protection, the challenges we face in keeping children safe and the tragedy that overtakes us when that is not possible.  I am sure every Member of the Oireachtas as well as members of the public can recall numerous tragic incidents involving children such as that of Daniel McAnaspie and others whose protection was not fulfilled and who found themselves in danger.  In Daniel&rsquo;s case, unfortunately, this resulted in the loss of a very young life.  That brings a sobering perspective to us all when we engage in debates such as this.</P>
        <P>The report before the House from the Ombudsman for Children raises very serious concerns about the implementation of Children First: national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children.  That said, she points to some very positive developments and progress that has taken place in the area.  I acknowledge that progress.  It is very important it is placed on the record of the House.  I am sure, however, the Minister of State would not want us to dwell on this in the limited time available today.  Perhaps it would be much better to consider constructively how to address the issues raised by the Ombudsman for Children.  Her report has multiple findings of unsound administration by the HSE.  There are 11 findings under section 8 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  While it is not possible to address all these in detail today, I shall return to a number of them but not before I consider something else.</P><Col N="826"/>
        <P>I was very struck by the fact that throughout the report there are constant references to reviews, reports and investigations.  I am very conscious during the Order of Business that we hear calls for debates on various reports such as the Murphy report, the Ryan report or this report.  These reports merit a great deal of consideration, but there comes a time when we have to go beyond debate, when it becomes a question of the action to be taken.  I was very struck by a particular quote in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report to the effect that, to date, there is no shortage of analysis of the problems but less action to tackle them.  It is appropriate for us to bear this in mind.</P>
        <P>I want to propose to the Government that consideration be given to the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee for the protection of children and vulnerable adults.   A significant body of work needs to be undertaken in this area and there is a strong message to be delivered in terms of the priority the Oireachtas affords this area.  This should reflect the priority the Minister of State with responsibility for children has afforded this area.  It is unacceptable that the only role for the Oireachtas in this is to participate in endless debate but not to have a participatory role in any action taken.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children demonstrated the very real work that may be undertaken by an all-party committee.  It highlighted in the course of its work the many needs that are required to be addressed within this area.  Hunting for time among the Committee on Health and Children and the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights and settling for statements and debates is not the optimum way forward in providing an opportunity for the Oireachtas to make a contribution.</P>
        <P>All the reports and accounts published in recent years, such as those of Ryan, Murphy, the Ombudsman and the Minister of State&rsquo;s office, have pointed to the work that needs to be done as well as the challenges for inter-agency co-ordination and accountability.  The establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee specifically for the protection of children and vulnerable adults would provide a very clear focus for such disparate work.  It would provide an excellent forum for adequate consideration of policy, legislation and reports such as these.  The establishment of the Minister of State&rsquo;s office was a very positive step.  An Oireachtas forum such as a committee or sub-committee needs to be the next step.</P>
        <P>On the specifics of the report, perhaps I can ask the Minister of State about a couple of reports that are named.  The Ombudsman for Children has said a strategic review of the delivery and management of child protection services is under way.  If not already completed, when will it be finished and will it be published?  A second report mentioned is the national social work and family support survey.  It says this has been completed but has not been published.  Are there plans to publish it?  I was very struck by some of the findings the Ombudsman made available in the body of her report.  It would be very useful for Members to have access to the full report in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman pointed out that the HSE is obliged under section 8 of the Child Care Act 1991 to publish a report on the adequacy of services offered to children and families in each functional area and raised concerns that this had not happened in 2008.  She also spoke about the industrial action by IMPACT and the effects this was having on the administrative side of child protection in so far as outcomes or reports were not being lodged.  Has any progress been made in that regard or has this been addressed?  Will the Minister of State say whether there are any plans for the establishment of a child protection notification service on an all-country basis?</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the commitment the Minister of State gave in his speech this afternoon to the effect that his priority would be the sustained implementation of Children First and also that he would be looking into an audit of the case files.  What is very clear from all these reports <Col N="827"/>is that they have not looked at active case files.  The framework that will underpin this will play a very crucial role.  We must have training for people in the area, but this must be in tandem with support.  It has to be about learning.  Everyone who works in this area wants to keep children safe, but there is incredible anxiety and concern about getting things wrong.  This may result in paralysis which is of no use to anyone.  We must ensure people have the confidence and the competence to make the decisions we depend on them to make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report which is critically important.  Approximately 24 children have died in care, including Tracey Fay and Daniel McAnaspie recently.  We have had the Ryan report and an implementation plan, but I do not know what has been implemented or how much progress the Minister of State has made with it.  We have also had the Murphy and Monageer reports.  </P>
        <P>Child protection is in crisis and we must ask whether children&rsquo;s lives are more at risk in care than in homes that cannot cope.  I have come to the latter conclusion.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s office is under incredible pressure.  The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report is another damning indictment of the State&rsquo;s failure to provide for children at risk the protection to which they are entitled.  I welcome the report, but, as Senator Corrigan said, an implementation plan with commitments, timeframes and funding is needed.  Will these be forthcoming today?  If not, when?  We do not want other cases similar to those of Tracey Fay and Daniel McAnaspie.</P>
        <P>It is incredible that the HSE reviews have not involved an examination of case files to see how Children First is being implemented.  The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report points out that the findings of the audit were worrying.  For example, the screening of child protection reports took on average 21 days, which meant that urgent cases might not have been identified speedily.  The initial assessment took on average 95 days.  A child could die in that time.  What is the Government at?  Why was the HSE not fined?  What is the Government&rsquo;s response?  I know from previous experience that in Galway the HSE did not have sufficient social workers.  There have been improvements in the past 18 months, but this is appalling.  Furthermore, the audit revealed that 75% of files contained no record of the outcome of an assessment.  By contrast, Children First requires that outcomes should always be recorded.  These findings show why internal auditing involving examination of case files needs to be conducted across the State.  With the exception of counties Cork and Kerry, this has not happened.  If good practice is followed in one area, why is the model not replicated?</P>
        <P>This goes back to Fine Gael&rsquo;s requirement that child protection guidelines be placed on a statutory footing.  If that was done, behaviour would change.  I am also a supporter of mandatory reporting.  The report details the failure of the HSE to comply with its statutory obligations regarding the care and protection of children.  Findings of unsound administration and lack of clarity and consistency across the State against the executive raise serious questions about its capacity to provide a child care and protection service of appropriate standard and the report seriously questions the desirability of the executive retaining this statutory function.  What is the Government&rsquo;s response to this?  Does the Minister of State agree the HSE should retain this function?</P>
        <P>Recommendation No. 4 of the report refers to ensuring the focus on child protection services is not lost amid wider concerns about health services.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s office has been overstretched for a long time and he should highlight this issue because it is a challenge.  His office needs more help and resources.  There is also a crisis in adoption services.</P>
        <P>It is particularly shocking, in the light of all the revelations of the past decade, that the report documents the continuing failure of the HSE and the Garda to operate joint liaison and documentary arrangements in many parts of the State in respect of allegations of child abuse. <Col N="828"/> Immediate action must be taken to address this issue to ensure the successful prosecution of those who perpetrate child abuse is not thwarted by the failure of State agencies to comply with the Children First guidelines.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recommendation No. 16 which refers to joint strategy meetings between the Garda and the HSE must be easily implementable.  How difficult can it be?  For example, joint policing committees are in place to address anti-social behaviour.  Recommendation No. 14 is similar in that it addresses joint liaison structures between the Garda and the HSE.  It is clear from the report that radical change and reform are required.  It is also clear that the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the HSE have not yet recognised the need for transparency and accountability in child protection services.  The Ombudsman for Children makes reference to the executive undertaking a strategic review.  The Minister of State and the Minister for Health and Children must explain the failure of the Government to take all necessary action to ensure the uniform implementation across the State of the Children First guidelines.  Putting them on a statutory footing and introducing mandatory reporting would change behaviour.  In a former life, I taught in the United States and worked in a state in which there was mandatory reporting of child abuse.  Having undergone training, my awareness and behaviour were totally different.  I was involved in two cases at the time.  Mandatory reporting should not be dismissed, as it could save children&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>Having met in 2008, why did the high level group established by the Department fail to meet in 2009?  This failure was justifiably criticised by the Ombudsman for Children.  Is this not another example of bad practice?  Recommendation No. 2 mentions inter-agency work.  How difficult can this be?  The explicit nature of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations is helpful.  If designated persons are accountable and this is deemed important enough to ensure the inter-agency work is done, it will happen; otherwise, people will have questions to answer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recommendation No. 22 calls on the HSE to provide further training for professionals regarding their duty to report abuse.  Students in teacher training colleges need three days on the child protection guidelines before they enter a classroom, but that is not happening.  Every report has suggested this should happen, but this is the fault of the Department of Education and Science because the bachelor of education degree course should be of four years' duration.  Whole staff training is needed on the guidelines in primary and secondary schools.  Currently, only designated liaison person training is provided, but that is not adequate.  Every teacher must be a child protector.</P>
        <P>Recommendation No. 17 states a list of sex offenders in an area should be given to each local health office in order that the risk to children can be assessed.  When will this happen?  What are the blocks?  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s answers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt anybody.  Fine Gael and Labour Party Members said this issue was not political, but when there is a tragedy, every issue is political.  Senator Cannon&rsquo;s speech was good and worthwhile, but I smiled when I heard it because a few short months ago he was on this side of the House and agreed with everything that was being implemented by the Government.  Now, all of a sudden, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, can do nothing right.  This summed up for me the fact that everything is political, although I wish it were not, especially when it comes to dealing with innocent children.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is no stranger to my words.  I was critical of the State and the church when the Murphy report was published, using the phrase, &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s gulag&rdquo;, and I still feel that way about it.  I am astonished to see that no audits have taken place.  Cork and Kerry are the only areas in which there is an audit process.  I do not see why we can carry out audits in Cork and Kerry but not in the rest of the country.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman for Children stated in her report that all is not wrong.  There have been major improvements since 1999.  I thank the Minister of State for his dedication since he entered the office.  I do not think anybody works as hard as he does nor is anyone so dedicated.  Whenever I have gone to the Minister of State with cases, I have received nothing but co-operation and interest from him and his staff.</P>
        <P>The welfare of children is paramount and this and previous Governments have treated it as such.  The setting up of the groups that produced the Ryan and Murphy reports, although they were the most unsavoury and heart-rending of reports, shows the commitment of the Government in this regard.  The all-party Oireachtas committee of which Senator White and I were members did much good work, with many contributions from the Minister of State.  I would like to think that the result of two years of excellent work, cross-party communication and, most important, cross-party consensus, which is most rare in these Houses, will be a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  I hope the Minister of State will make progress in this regard.  Senator Butler went into detail on preschool education and the number of places that are set aside, which demonstrates the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to children.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames was a little upset to see me having a word in the Minister of State&rsquo;s ear because she wanted his full attention, and I would not deprive her of that.  I was just asking when the Office of the Minister for Children had first been introduced.  I think it was around 2000.  What struck me was that from 1994 to 1997, during the term of the rainbow coalition, we heard nothing at all about a Minister for children.  I am glad it was a Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government &mdash; the latter being Senator Cannon&rsquo;s former party &mdash; that established the office.</P>

	<P>I am delighted to see that the Department is now ready to recruit 200 social workers.  The Minister of State has highlighted his great concern at the fact that 16% of the children in State care do not have a social worker.  I hope the new allocation of social workers will address this.</P>
        <P>The existence of a Minister of State with responsibility for children is a major step because now the concerns and interests of children are ring-fenced.  The Minister of State sits at Cabinet, which is an indication of the weight of his Ministry.  He mentioned that 5,700 children were in State care, of whom 5,100 are in foster care.  The HSE tries to foster such children with their relations as far as possible.  The others go to unrelated foster families, which is working well.  We had an excellent debate a few months ago about foster care.  It was under the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government &mdash; that is, in my previous term in the Seanad &mdash; that the position of Ombudsman for Children was created.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has acknowledged, and I will acknowledge again, that there are wrongs in the system, but I know that with someone such as the Minister of State at the helm, things can be put right.  I acknowledge the large budget of &euro;53.6 million for children and families, the extra &euro;15 million the Minister of State has obtained for this year, as well as the 200 extra social workers and 65 extra child care workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The first thing that needs to be said is that we in the Oireachtas are indebted to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children for producing this report, which is a highly significant development.  It is not entirely adversely critical of the Government but it does provide a useful foundation for progress.  I hope it can be dealt with in a non-partisan way.  We must discuss this in the light of tragic events such as the death of Daniel McAnaspie, but I do not think we should make political capital out of it.  I was taken aback to hear the usual old ding-dong across the floor, into which the question of moving a writ for by-elections was introduced.  This is irrelevant and represents an attempt by both sides, but especially Senator Butler, to make capital out of the subject.  It shows that real concern for the welfare of children is not the priority people pretend it is.  We are still becoming bogged down by talk of by-elections and so on.  That is regrettable.</P>
        <P>I agree with the statement of Senator Alex White, whose contribution I watched from my office, that it would be useful if we had the time to go through the report line by line.  This is one of the occasions on which a lack of sufficient time is a problem.  We had 15 minutes of waffle from the Leader of the House this morning which was completely irrelevant to everything, but we get seven minutes each to talk about this report.  When we discussed the Ryan report, I went through the report line by line and had to gabble, as did Senator White.  We need time if we wish to take such reports seriously.</P>
        <P>I was interested but not surprised to hear the position of the Iona Institute being so articulately placed on the record by one of my university panel colleagues.  To drag a defence of <Col N="831"/>Cardinal Brady into this discussion is, to my mind, on the margins.  That said, I would welcome an opportunity to discuss that.</P>
        <P>The report is not unremittingly negative.  I notice the Ombudsman begins:</P>
        <P LI="1">Some of the conclusions in this report are positive.  It is recognised that substantial efforts have been made at various times since 1999 to implement Children First.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The interesting phrase here is &ldquo;at various times&rdquo;, which suggests a lack of consistency and raises the question of the priority attached to it.  The other aspect of the report I found helpful was the Ombudsman&rsquo;s references to the office of the Minister, rather than to a particular Minister.  She does not personalise the matter or make accusations against this Minister of State, who is in fact a decent, intelligent and caring person.  The Minister of State himself indicated, in the section of his speech that I heard in my office, that the majority of criticism covered the period 2003 to 2008.  It is recognised that efforts are now being made to implement the recommendations after a considerable time.</P>
        <P>There is a significant lack of what one might call joined up thinking in this area.  For example &mdash; this is critical &mdash; there is the lack of a 24-hour service.  This means people cannot find out if children are covered by the child protection notification service.  Unfortunately, crises do not neatly and obligingly arise during office hours; they will often happen in the early hours of the morning, or at some other very inconvenient time or at the weekend.  In this situation where we are often talking about crisis intervention we need a full 24-hour service.  I would have thought that this was inarguable.</P>
        <P>As a member of three trade unions who supports the trade union movement and the right of every worker to join a trade union, I was saddened by the comments of the Ombudsman for Children on the industrial relations issue involved.  There was such an issue because IMPACT was concerned about what it saw as an extra burden being placed on the shoulders of workers by the implementation of the Children First guidelines.  It became involved in negotiations with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and had a prioritisation work agreement, but it did not include implementing the Children First guidelines.  I have criticised politicians in this House for not having the welfare of children as their first priority and I am sad to say it seems some of the trade unions which I greatly admire also do not have it as a priority.  They should.</P>
        <P>Another issue &mdash; I am not sure whether it has been mentioned &mdash; is the disproportionate difficulty encountered by children of asylum seekers or asylum seeking children.  A much higher ratio of such children disappeared from the protection of the HSE.  I recall raising this issue on a number of occasions.  At least one of the children concerned turned up in a brothel, which is very worrying.  If a child was placed in the protection of the State and they were not sufficiently supervised to prevent them from ending up in a brothel, that is a serious criticism of what is happening.</P>
        <P>It could be said the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report is stating we are still failing in our responsibility to implement proper child protection systems.  It is 11 years since Children First was introduced.  It has been reviewed three times, but its recommendations and principles have never been consistently and fully implemented.  I find this worrying.  The most significant elements that are missing include a definition of abuse.  The structures to enhance inter-agency co-operation at regional and local level have not been put in place or are discontinued.  That is a classic example which indicates the lack of joined up thinking.  Poor record-keeping is also mentioned.  There was an analysis undertaken in counties Cork and Kerry which showed that 75% of files had no record of the outcome.  That is absurd.  Surely, the outcome is one of the most significant aspects.</P><Col N="832"/>
        <P>The Minister of State said in a statement picked up by the newspapers that he welcomed the statements &mdash; I would expect this gentlemanly Minister of State to say this &mdash; and that the recommendations made in the report would be reflected in an implementation framework which was being developed.  Can he give us any indication of the timeframe involved because it is important that we know when that it be done?  I was glad he mentioned that many of the findings were constructive and that he could work with them.  It is worrying that there are findings of unsound administration, bad practice and a lack of joined up thinking, but we have a decent Minister of State and if we can keep the partisan elements out and keep our minds focused on the welfare of children, we will get somewhere.</P>
        <P>It is not particularly relevant to drag in, so to speak, the Archbishop of Armagh, Cardinal Brady, but I accept it is not appropriate for any institution, be it the State or the church, to abuse children.  What is sauce for the goose is definitely sauce for the gander.  I have no difficulty with this, but that is a matter for debate on another day and there are other aspects which will not be so pleasing to the Iona Institute mentality when I raise them in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to discuss this issue.  Senator Feeney alluded to the work that had been done in this area, particularly since the Minister of State was given this job and his office was established, in increasing the awareness of child care and in terms of the way in which the issue has been pushed up the agenda, rightly so.  Part of what the report highlights is that if something is not measured, one cannot know what progress one is making or what is the extent of the problem.  What is highlighted in the report, as previous speakers mentioned, is the need to undertake a comprehensive audit throughout the country to ensure we know what is the extent of the problem.</P>
        <P>As previous speakers also said, our concern must be the welfare of children.  I have always been of the opinion that a poor person can only afford the best and that a poor person who is required to be in the care of the State can only afford and deserves the best.  I am sure it is a desire of the Minister of State, as I am sure it is of every member of the Government, to provide a service that is second to none, particularly for vulnerable children, but as we know, that is not necessarily the case.  Nobody can be proud of the services we provide while children are subject to mishandling and fall through the cracks.  It is our role and that of the Minister of State to provide a policy framework to ensure the cracks are filled in.  That is what we must do.</P>
        <P>A point I picked up from the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report concerns whether child protection services are best delivered within the framework of the HSE.  A brother-in-law of mine is involved in the legal profession and from time to time tells me about different cases before the courts.  Frequently &mdash; Senator Norris alluded to this &mdash; young girls around the age of 12 years in the care of the State are forced into prostitution.  It is heartbreaking to think that will be the fate of a young girl in the care of the State.  However, she might be coerced into it, which is appalling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The difficulty is that two State systems &mdash; the justice and health care systems &mdash; are involved.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s dilemma &mdash; ours also &mdash; is that we must create a service, but we cannot have one element almost hoping a child will commit a crime because he or she will no longer then be its responsibility.  That is the biggest challenge facing the Minister of State because we cannot have people in place who are not interested in the welfare of children, regardless of the reasons they are before the courts.  It may involve something as serious as prostitution &mdash; I mean serious for the victim, the young girl who has been forced into that way of life &mdash; or a young person charged before the courts with committing petty crimes because he or she is on the streets and stealing to feed himself or herself.  We must have an all-inclusive, comprehensive <Col N="833"/>system that will not treat them as criminals.  We do not want a system under which the people who are supposed to care for them will be hoping they will become a statistic or a problem for the other element of the service.</P>
        <P>We must examine how we can support those working in this area.  Senator Norris made reference to the industrial relations problem.  I realise it is a challenge for the Minister of State when staff are reluctant to do that extra bit because it is not necessarily included in their terms and conditions.  If there is one group for which I have sympathy, it is social workers because the buck stops with them.  If things go wrong, the question always asked is what were the social workers doing.  Time and again, when we hear about tragic cases, not only here in Ireland but also in the United Kingdom, the way in which social workers are vilified is disgraceful.  I once watched a documentary on the life of a social worker and they were reluctant to do that extra bit or become too involved because it might create a liability for them.  Therefore, they have a problem.  They must be very careful of their legal position on such issues because if they overstep their role, this may create trouble for them.  However, they are the very people about whom others ask why they did not foresee something.  We are aware of the burden and caseload so many social workers have.  As mentioned already, as with the health services, the service provided by social workers, which deals with people who are vulnerable, at risk or who come from chaotic lifestyles, cannot only operate on a nine to five basis.  It is a 24-hour service, is highly expensive to run and trying to man it is a problem.  We need to provide real support to social workers because the burden falls heavily on them.  I am glad, therefore, the Minister is making good progress in recruiting for the 270 vacant posts.  The sooner this process is complete the better.  I do not need to tell the Minister of State how difficult the situation is because the number of social workers per citizen is low.</P>
        <P>We all know what is wrong, but the Minister of State has work well under way to improve the services.  I wish him well in doing that.  He has an extremely important job and has made great progress, which is acknowledged in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report.  Any child in need of the care of the State deserves only the best and I look forward to us being extremely proud of the services we provide for children in the care of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am concerned about children who have been in care who are released into society at the age of 18.  What is our responsibility as a nation and State towards these children?  Focus Ireland has pointed out that these children are released from a protected environment into the great unknown without support or care.  Is it right that we consider that once children reach 18, they no longer have the same needs and requirements they had at seventeen and a half?  Focus Ireland has close contact with these young people and is aware of the pitfalls facing them, such as drugs, prostitution etc.  We need measures to protect them and keep them out of such situations when they are most vulnerable. </P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the responsibility of the statutory bodies, I welcome the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report.  I support my D&aacute;il colleague, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, in her call for a date for a referendum.  She chaired the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children of which Senator Alex White was a member.  We owe it to our children to set that date.  Many Senators have already mentioned how much we cherish our children, but let us see in practice how much we cherish them and set the date.  Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke said there is a budget allocated for the referendum, so why has it not happened?</P>
        <P>I would like to comment on a situation that has arisen in my area.  When children seem to fall between many stools where no statutory body wants to take responsibility, it is the child who loses out.  The situation in question concerns a child whose mother died and who at the age of 14 stopped going to school and was engaging in drugs and alcohol.  No family member was able to control the child and the social services were called in.  Garda&iacute; were also involved. <Col N="834"/> When the family sought a report on how social services were progressing with the child, a report was not provided.  The family has never been provided with access to a report, even though it was involved in all meetings and discussions.  The family has no knowledge of the outcome of the professional assessment of the child, who is still in a precarious and dangerous position.  I am sure, however, that if anything happens to this child, the finger will be pointed at the HSE.  This is preventable.</P>
        <P>Why does the HSE not provide families with information and make reports available to them so as to prevent situations arising, such as what has happened in the case of Daniel McAnaspie?  It is extraordinary to think he was probably murdered by children who have been neglected by the State.  He was knifed in the throat by his peers.  Why is the State failing these children?  They are allowed run riot without anybody taking care of them or responsibility for them.  While I believe the Minister of State is doing his best, we must do more.  I do not expect he will announce a date today for the referendum or promise more money etc., but the buck stops with him and he has a responsibility.  I urge him to expedite the date for the referendum and to include provisions for children who are over 18 and ensure they are not dropped from the system when they reach 18.  They have the same needs then as at seventeen and a half.  I also urge him to ensure that parents are kept informed.  Four sessions with a HSE team is not adequate when a child is in serious difficulty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the comments made to me with regard to the problems in this area suggest that some problems are surmountable and should be examined.  We need to examine, for example, how services are organised.  There is, for instance, an ongoing industrial dispute in the old eastern health board region which contributes to some of the problems raised with regard to how social workers deal with implementing the guidelines.  Counties Cavan and Wexford have some of the highest case loads, but they have fewer social workers than other counties to deal with the problems.  It is often easy for us on the outside to look in and see the problems and ask how such things could happen.  However, being a social worker is an incredibly stressful job.  It is fraught with emotional problems and fraught with the problems of families and individuals who need help from the State, but who are not grateful to the State for getting involved in their lives.  The job is fraught with the danger of litigation and violence and is not easy.  For that reason, we need clear guidelines for all those working for the State in the area.  They must know exactly what they are supposed to do in their job, but they must also get the sense from their line managers and people like the Minister of State that they stand behind them and give them their full support.</P>
        <P>Every time a crisis happens in the case of a vulnerable family or child, there is a knee-jerk reaction that blames the social workers.  However, we must look at the environment in which they work and the lack of supports.  Some of the best case workers suffer from burn-out and they are dealt with by putting them in what are essentially backroom positions.  Their experience is taken from the front line and more inexperienced staff are sent to do the work.  There is a need to examine that issue.</P>
        <P>I had hoped I would have more time, but I have made the essential points on this issue.  The people concerned are very vulnerable and there are huge emotional difficulties involved in dealing with their cases.  However, we must also consider those who are implementing the guidelines on our behalf and ensure they have our full support also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their reasoned contributions.  Clearly, they have engaged directly with the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report and the two hours have passed quickly.  It has been a very interesting debate.</P><Col N="835"/>
        <P>Senator Twomey has suggested I show support for social workers in view of the difficulty of the work they do.  Last year I had four regional meetings with social workers, something that had never been done previously by a Minister and for which I did not seek press coverage.  I did it because I recognised the points made by Senator Twomey and those made earlier by Senator O&rsquo;Malley about the difficult work done by social workers, issues of morale within the service, the need to show leadership and the sharing of risk as a society.  We try to drive that message in the reform process in which we are engaged.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden spoke about after-care services.  That is a matter for a separate debate.  We debated it when we discussed the Child Care (Amendment) Bill and I have made my commitment clear.</P>
        <P>The issue of holding a referendum has been raised, but it is not really relevant to this discussion.  However, to clarify, the referendum proposal made by the committee is not solely about child protection; it also relates to every aspect of the life of a child in Ireland, be it education, care in the health service, immigration, adoption or family law.  All of these matters are covered by the proposal and we must bear this in mind.  That is the reason it is taking a long time for it to be considered by various Departments.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley spoke about the conflict between the justice and health elements.  That is true, but there is an attempt to address the issue in the Child Care (Amendment) Bill.  It provides that if a special care case is before the courts, it does not necessarily mean it must be withdrawn from HSE consideration, that a special care order can continue to be pursued up to and including a sentence short of actual detention.  I hope that tension will be removed.  The HSE should not try to walk away from cases just because a criminal charge might be involved.  It is not the policy I would consider appropriate, as I have indicated to the HSE previously.</P>
        <P>Several Senators raised the issue of the child protection notification system identified in the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report.  There was confusion about whether it should be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, whether it should be just for ongoing child protection concerns or whether a closed case should also be contained within it.  There were also questions as to whether it should be accessible by people who were not social workers and not involved in the child protection system.  The HSE has included in its national child care information system a proposal to ensure all these areas will be covered.  The only issue that has not been settled is whether it should deal simply with ongoing cases or historical cases.  I am having that discussion with the HSE.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon started the debate and made a political point that we could legislate for the bank guarantee in a rapid manner but not for the holding of a referendum or to put the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis.  We made a commitment in the Ryan report implementation plan to deal with the Children First guidelines by the end of this year and we are committed to honouring it.  The referendum proposal emerged from the committee three months ago.  People have been calling for a referendum for almost 20 years, initially in 1993, then in the Constitution Review Group in 1996 and many times subsequently.  We have had the referendum proposal for three months and must give it due consideration.  I agree that we must remove it from the discussion about by-elections, deal with it on its merits and hold it, when appropriate.  We must get it right rather than do it in a rushed way for motives that are outside children&rsquo;s interests.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler paid tribute to foster carers.  As many have pointed out, they are ordinary people doing extraordinary work.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen expressed sympathy for me, given the brief I hold.  It will be no surprise that I consider it a huge privilege at this very difficult time.  He took issue with the point about Dr. Brady.  Both he and the church generally have to deal with a generalised institutional cover-up <Col N="836"/>that happened over many years.  I am not talking about Dr. Brady specifically, but it is an issue, of which everybody is aware and which emerged in the Murphy report.  The allegations arose at a time prior to the issuing of the Children First guidelines.  They are judged against the church&rsquo;s own standards and the law that applied at the time.  The Senator said it was hypocritical to call for Dr. Brady to resign from his position as primate while advocating compliance with the Children First guidelines.  This is illogical.  The Government has made no statement about Dr. Brady or his position.  Today there is no doubt that a failure to report a concern about child abuse would be in breach of the Children First guidelines and that if anybody were to fail to report such abuse, there would be no hesitation in condemning such inaction.  There is nothing contradictory in this.</P>
        <P>The issue of mandatory reporting was raised by a number of Senators.  Not only has Mr. Geoffrey Shannon said in his special <i>rapporteur&rsquo;s</i> recommendation that this is not a policy we should pursue, but Dr. Helen Buckley also said it in an academic paper I read six months ago.  Reviews of international literature show that in jurisdictions where there is mandatory reporting, it simply overloads the child protection system.  As I said in my opening remarks, it does not lead to an increase in the number of substantiated claims.  These are the facts.  According to practitioners in these other jurisdictions &mdash; Senator Healy Eames did some training overseas &mdash; it is a case of trying to put the genie back in the bottle.  One cannot do it.  We recommended that the Children First guidelines be placed on a statutory footing.  That was welcomed by the NGO community and those working with children as the right way to proceed.  However, as Senator Alex White said, it is not enough to place them on a statutory footing.  We must also put the implementation framework in place.  The Senator was concerned about when that would happen.  I indicated that I would bring recommendations to the Government and that will be done in the next few weeks.  I do not wish to pin it down further and give a hostage to fortune, but it is imminent.  There has been much progress and a great deal of work done in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>With regard to the national vetting bureau Bill which also emerged from the Oireachtas committee of which Senator White was a member, work on it is being done as a priority.  The heads of the Bill are in preparation.  The matter was complicated because the sharing of information across agencies was not simple and, initially, the view was that it would require a constitutional referendum.  Including the safeguards recommended by the Attorney General requires complicated legislation.  Where the bureau would be managed was another issue.  It will be managed by the Garda vetting bureau and will have a similar sharing of expertise as the Criminal Assets Bureau.  It will include the various sectors in one office which will have responsibility for driving this issue.  However, it will require a significant increase in resources for the Garda vetting bureau.  Hundreds of extra staff will be required to cope with the obvious increase in workload that will result.</P>
        <P>Many Senators mentioned the tragic case of Daniel McAnaspie.  I add my expression of sympathy to his family and friends on the tragic circumstances that led to his death.  Every care is taken with children in the care of the State.  However, as the Ombudsman for Children says in her report, it is impossible to protect all children from harm at all times.  The circumstances in which children come into the care of the State are usually very difficult.  Sometimes it is presented in a facile way that the HSE has harmed children who otherwise present without problems.  Invariably, where a care order is sought, every other intervention has failed.  This view was repeated yesterday morning on RTE radio by Mary Ellen Ring who said that in much the same way that no parent could guarantee the safety of his or her child, neither could the State give such assurances.  That is not to say, however, that we are diluting our responsibilities or seeking absolution for failures identified by the Ombudsman for Children in her report.</P><Col N="837"/>
        <P>I welcome the report, even though it makes criticisms.  However, we made the same criticisms in our review in 2008.  We acknowledge them.</P>
     
        <P>If we did not recognise the deficits in the system, we would not be embarked on a path of reform as detailed as we are.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I undertook to explain to Senator Alex White the position on social workers.  The HSE service plan for 2010 undertakes to recruit an additional 200 social workers for child protection services: 50 by the end of the second quarter, a further 75 by the end of the third quarter and the final 75 in the fourth quarter.  The HSE states that the first candidates have been interviewed and by the end of June, it expects to have an additional 50 social workers recruited.  When I say &ldquo;additional&rdquo;, I mean additional to the beginning number and not simply the replacement of staff who are leaving, on leave or anything like that.  I also note that the HSE, as recently as the last week in April, placed further recruitment advertisements in national newspapers with a salary scale from &euro;43,000 to &euro;56,000 per annum.  I am informed that the response to this particular advertisement was very positive.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames asked if I was not engaging with the HSE appropriately.  I have met with the leadership of the HSE in the child protection area every month since my appointment as Minister of State to drive the very issues that have been raised in this House.</P>
        <P>Senator Corrigan raised the question of whether an Oireachtas joint committee on the protection of children and vulnerable adults should be set up.  It is something to which we should give consideration.</P>
        <P>There are many other issues I would have liked to have reached but I hope I have addressed as many as possible in the short timeframe.</P>

    <Title>Construction Contracts Bill 2010: Second Stage.</Title>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I am pleased to present the Construction Contracts Bill to the House.</P>
        <P>This came about from a contact I got last month from Mr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher, better known from &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Den&rdquo; but also from Smarthomes, who drew my attention to a problem of which I had not been quite aware.  He explained the difficulty that presented and that is where the Bill has come from.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for a mechanism whereby prior notice of an intention to withhold sums from payments otherwise due to contractors must be given.  Otherwise, payments must be made in full and-or the payee may suspend the provision of works and-or services under the construction contract until payment is made in full.</P>
        <P>The Bill will improve payment practices in the construction industry by providing clarity and transparency in the payment of moneys due in construction contracts.  This will improve crucial cash-flow to those subcontractors working in the industry, thus helping companies involved in the construction sector to survive and keep people in employment.  It also aims to reform <Col N="838"/>dispute procedures in the construction industry to make them less costly and less time-consuming, and to relieve some pressure on the courts system.</P>
        <P>Before moving on to the detail of the Bill, I want to outline briefly some of the background to the Bill.  It is estimated that over the past two years 200,000 jobs have been lost in construction and its related sectors.  A further 100,000 jobs could be at risk in the future because of the reduced level of both public and private investment.  It is a devastating situation for those individuals and families whose lives depend on the construction sector.</P>
        <P>To give some indication of the duress that construction workers are now under, it was reported earlier this month that self-employed construction workers have been admitted to psychiatric hospitals due to their despair at having no social welfare payments on which to live.  Some of these workers, such as carpenters, tilers, plumbers and electricians, do not qualify automatically for unemployment benefit because they had set up their own companies.</P>
        <P>We all have seen how construction work on housing and other developments up and down the country is being halted because of the downturn.  For example, it was reported last week that construction at Waterford City Council&rsquo;s &euro;20 million 111 unit project housing scheme on the Carrickphierish Road at Gracedieu was halted due to financial reasons.  I was stunned when I got the following figures.  Some 500 property and construction companies collapsed during 2009, an average of almost ten industry failures a week or two each working day.</P>
        <P>The large developers can rely on NAMA to give them relief when things go wrong, but what about the smaller subcontractors?  Subcontractors include those involved in architecture, engineering, plumbing, electrical and mechanical work, kitchen manufacturing, painting, the supply of doors and windows, concrete and timber frame manufacturing, interior design, gardening and ground moving services etc.</P>
        <P>The scale of the downturn in the economy and the difficulty in securing credit has left many subcontractors who are involved in the construction industry facing huge cash-flow difficulties that are being compounded by the non-payment of debts.  For example, a developer buys a plot of land and gets planning permission to build 200 apartments.  He then may set up a separate building company and subcontract the building of the apartments to this company, which will likely have no assets.  Alternatively, he may hire a separate building firm to undertake this work.  That building firm, in turn, hires subcontractors to carry out the building work on the apartments.  In this way, the subcontractors are no longer working for the developer; they are working for the building company.</P>
        <P>Customers then buy these apartments and pay the developer rather than the building company.  The developer may then spend or invest this money on purchasing another building site elsewhere.  However, as he may have spent this money on a new plot of land, he has no money to pay the building company.  The building company goes into liquidation and is unable to pay the subcontractors.</P>
        <P>The subcontractors and suppliers who supplied the goods and services do not receive payment and because they have already paid their staff and suppliers, they are, in effect, forced out of business.  The people who bought the apartments now legally own them through what is known as &ldquo;right of title&rdquo;, and ownership of everything in them passes to the new owner as of right, even though the people who made, purchased, supplied and installed the goods have never been paid.</P>
        <P>As the developer&rsquo;s company and the building company are legally set-up as limited liability companies, their liabilities are limited to the assets of his or her company.  As many developers set up new and separate companies for each site, there is no redress to the assets of other companies that the developer owns, even when they may have significant assets.  The bottom <Col N="839"/>line is that a subcontractor&rsquo;s livelihood is at risk when a construction contract is halted and they are left in the lurch.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current legislation offers little or no protection to subcontractors.  This Bill addresses this unjust situation because it provides a mechanism where an intention to withhold sums from payments otherwise due must be given.  Otherwise, payments must be made in full and/or the payee may suspend the provision of works and-or services under the construction contract until payment is made in full.</P>
        <P>This is aimed at achieving a more equal balance in the construction industry.  Ideally, this measure would be linked to wider provision in respect of construction contracts including a more rapid and effective means of dispute settlement.  However, that aspect could be considered at a later point.  The Bill will also reform dispute procedures to make them less costly and less time-consuming.  Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole will describe the proposal in more detail.  It is very evident that disputes about contracts cause delays which have financial and economic costs which hinder opportunities to move forward.  Perhaps during an economic downturn there is an even greater shift towards disputes and thus court action, as companies struggle to survive.  It is hoped that adjudication will help the many SMEs who cannot afford the costs of going to court which includes the expense of employing legal practitioners.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains ten main sections.  Section 3 of the Bill defines construction contracts for purposes of the Bill.  This also applies to contracts which are written or oral, or partially written and partially oral.  There is also provision as to the territorial application of the Bill.  Section 4 details certain contracts which are excluded from the Bill and, in particular, a construction contract with a residential occupier.  There is provision for the Minister to extend the list of exclusions by order.  Section 5 of the Bill sets forth the meaning of &ldquo;construction operations&rdquo; which would be governed by a &ldquo;construction contract&rdquo; for purposes of the Bill.  Section 6 provides that the provisions of the Bill shall apply to all construction contracts, whether oral or in writing.  Section 7 provides for notice of intention to withhold payment.  This is the heart of the provisions included in the Bill to achieve a fairer balance within the construction sector  It requires for a payer to give notice of intention to withhold payment to a payee before any deduction from such payment can be made.  Section 8 of the Bill aims to encourage the developers or building companies and subcontractor to resolve disputes through adjudication.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole will talk about this aspect separately.  Section 9 provides for the right to suspend performance for non-payment.  The provisions in this Bill have been widely welcomed by those in the construction industry who have been in contact, including the Construction Industry Federation which represents and serves over 3,000 members covering businesses in all areas of the Irish construction industry.  The Bill, if enacted, will provide real and practical benefit to the construction industry in general and to those working in the sector, especially subcontractors, who are usually small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
        <P>This Bill is not designed to jump on the bandwagon of berating developers or blaming them for the situation we now find ourselves in.  They are mostly people of professionalism and integrity.  The Bill is designed to protect against the increasing numbers of those who do not act in this way.  Allowing the situation to continue as it currently stands will allow developers to walk away from developments, leaving those hard pressed subcontractors without payment.  People are losing their jobs because of the lack of protection available.  This Bill will afford them this vital protection.  Any business may lose some trade, but cash flow is crucial as it allows businesses to be sustained in the longer term.  That is because money allows overheads and costs to be paid and people to be kept in employment.  Allowing people to remain in employment is crucial in these straitened times.  Many subcontractors in the construction sector simply cannot continue in business because of the current situation.</P><Col N="840"/>
        <P>I firmly believe this Bill will play a significant part in updating how construction contracts are made, thus helping to keep people in employment.  We need to update our out-dated legislation in this area.  While I look forward to a full debate on the Bill, I also look forward and hope for its early enactment.  I am sure it is capable of being improved and I am sure other provisions could be added to it on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister of State to recognise the need for this legislation.  Many subcontractors and contractors need such a Bill.  I urge the Minister of State to accept Second Stage because the Bill is something the country is crying out for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Quinn for developing this legislation.  I welcome the Minister of State.  This issue was touched on many years ago.</P>
        <P>I refer to the system of buying and selling property in France.  The matter is dealt with by a notary public who is, effectively, a lawyer for the common interest.  The parties may also engage their own solicitors if required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The job of the notary public, for example, is if Feargal Quinn is selling a property to Joe O&rsquo;Toole, he has to ensure there are no encumbrances on the property, that all planning permissions or otherwise are correct, and that it is legally in a state in which it can be sold.  He must also ensure there are no encumbrances or liens on the seller.  He must ensure there is no form of relationship that might have a gain on the property, that nobody has any impact upon it.  Having dealt with all these matters, he must consider the buyer, in this example, Joe O&rsquo;Toole.  The buyer must show that he has the money and he must lodge the money with the notary before the sale can go through.  This is very similar to the provisions in Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a plumbing subcontractor recently.  About 18 months ago, he finished doing the plumbing work and installation of all the plumbing and heating in ten houses off the South Circular Road.  He did an honest and diligent job.  However, just as he had completed the work, the money stopped.  He does not know who went bust, whether it was the developer or one of the building contractors.  All his materials are in the houses which are unsold and which have not been connected to gas or electricity supplies.  He wonders if he will be able to access his materials.  This story could be replicated across the country 24,000 times.</P>
        <P>The system as it stands means that somebody can purchase a piece of land and having put together the money to purchase the land, can be granted planning permission to build X number of units.  The individual can then seek tenders from builders and subcontractors to build the houses.  With no money whatever, he can hope that the sale of those houses will allow him to pay off the builders and subcontractors, make a profit and pay for the site.  If something goes wrong along the way, if the business plan does not stand up, if the houses do not sell, then he does not have the money.  He loses nothing &mdash; he will still have the site &mdash; but all the contractors lose out and they are all small enterprises.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn has made the need for the Bill very clear.  It requires some form of commitment.  We need to ensure that if somebody invests time, energy, money and labour, they will get fair pay and reward for their efforts.  It is a provision to protect all sides.  Senator Quinn has explained the legislation in detail.  He has asked me to deal with section 9 which deals with adjudication.  Adjudication should be efficient, simple to understand and time bound.  These are the three crucial issues for any kind of effective adjudication, arbitration or mediation.  It must be able to be simply initiated and be concluded within a certain period of time.  Both parties can agree either to be bound by the outcome or to leave that until the end to agree or disagree.</P><Col N="841"/>
        <P>Irish people like to have their day in court.  Those of us who have been through the system know that a day in court can be the worst day of one&rsquo;s life.  People believe that a day in court will somehow solve all their problems but the rest of us know that what one gets in court is the law rather than justice, in many cases, and sometimes they both coincide, if one is very lucky.  People are losing all the time.  What is needed is a bond or a financial instrument to ensure certainty so people will be paid when they are employed.  This works both ways.  For instance, a buyer puts a deposit or staged payments on a property but the property is not transferred to him or her and the builder or developer goes bust and people are left with nothing.  This is about honesty and putting in place an instrument on which all parties have a lien and can make it happen.</P>
        <P>I understand the Government will table an amendment which will not lead to a division tonight.  Instead, it will recognise the developments in the area and that within five months the Bill will be read a second time.  The Independent Senators ask that this be entered into in an open and generous way by the Government, admitting there is a problem which must be sorted out in everyone&rsquo;s interests.  Senator Feargal Quinn has made a commitment to get himself involved and I will help in any way I can.</P>
        <P>However, we need to get a clear direction from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on what is needed to move on this legislation.  I accept the criticism made that the Bill needs more provisions.  Identifying the areas that need to be improved would help make the legislation more effective.  The UK model has worked well in adjudication and I accept this Bill needs to be more comprehensive in its approach.  I accept the Government recognises this as a problem and that it may need several months to go the whole nine yards, so to speak, on the legislation&rsquo;s provisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would be a disaster, however, if nothing were to happen with this legislation.  Many people in various areas affected by this legislation have shown much interest in it.  We need to harness their energy and experience to get this to work.  It would be positive if the Government were to expand the legislation, comparing it to the UK&rsquo;s and other jurisdictions&rsquo; models.  Will the Government indicate tonight that it will follow such a course of action and involve itself in rolling consultation with all parties which can make an input?  If this Bill, as drafted, has to be amended before a second reading, I am sure Senator Feargal Quinn will not be averse to having it changed so long as it deals with the objectives he set out.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Feargal Quinn on putting this legislation together and it has been my privilege to second it.  I welcome the Government coming around to supporting this legislation and look forward to its response to it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill&rsquo;s main purpose is to provide a mechanism whereby prior notice of an intention to withhold sums from payments otherwise due must be given, or payments must be made in full.  In addition, it proposes an adjudication procedure to deal quickly with disputes about payments.</P>
        <P>The Bill is described in its explanatory and financial memorandum presented by Senator Feargal Quinn as being &ldquo;in ease of persons along the chain in the construction sector who may suffer unduly where an entity under a superior contract would find itself withholding payment unilaterally without cause&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Government is sympathetic to the initiative taken by Senator Feargal Quinn, welcoming the general policy approach underlying the Bill and that it should be taken further as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is conscious of the difficulties encountered by many subcontractors in obtaining payment from main contractors for work undertaken.  This is a serious problem affecting all parts of the industry.  I know Senators from every part of the House are fully aware of the problem and of the need to take steps to deal with it.  Specific cases in a constituency context have also been brought to my attention.  I would be surprised to learn of any Senator who has not heard of a contractor or subcontractor not seriously affected by the issue and whose business and livelihood were not put at risk as a result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We do need to address the issue and draw on many of the ideas contained in the Bill.  Before taking its proposals further however, it would be advisable to consult the industry and professional bodies to see what additional legal, procedural and technical measures will allow us to deal with these serious problems.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully conscious of the importance of the construction industry in the economy.  Substantial efforts are being made by the Government to maintain a strong public capital programme with projects in the pipeline all the time.  This underlines the Government&rsquo;s <Col N="843"/>determination not only to maintain and upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure but also to provide real opportunities for the construction sector, both main contractors and subcontractors, to tender successfully for contracts.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Ireland continues to face challenging economic circumstances, both nationally and internationally.  The Government is meeting these challenges by taking tough decisions to stabilise the budgetary position, repair the banking system, restore Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness and invest in the creation of new jobs.  Nonetheless, the Government is conscious it must invest in the country&rsquo;s key infrastructure to position ourselves for economic recovery.  Our Exchequer capital allocation for 2010 amounts to &euro;6.43 billion.  At 5% of GNP, this programme compares favourably with those of other EU member states generally.  The main focus of the Government&rsquo;s capital investment programme is to ensure Ireland has the requisite public infrastructure to facilitate a return to growth, which will assist sustainable job creation in the longer term.</P>
        <P>In addition, this construction activity helps to maintain much-needed employment in the present difficult circumstances.  As well as allocating large moneys for the absolutely essential task of upgrading the national infrastructure, the Government has sought to achieve value for money in the operation of individual public sector contracts.  In parallel with the public capital programme, the Government has been advancing its public sector construction procurement reform.  The aim of this initiative is to achieve greater cost certainty at tender stage, better value for money and more efficient delivery of projects.  Greater cost certainty at tender stage requires that projects are comprehensively designed before going to the market.</P>
        <P>For service contracts, output requirements will also have to be fully detailed before tenders are sought.  It is acknowledged the preparation of comprehensive designs prior to tender will require a major change of approach by all those involved in a project.  However, this will lead to far fewer contractual disputes, particularly in regard to payments, as there will be less ambiguity about the value of the work that has been completed.</P>
        <P>As part of the detailed implementation of the construction reform measures, several innovative forms of public works contracts and conditions of engagement for construction consultants have been developed for use by public bodies.  These were published in 2007 after a detailed consultation process with the construction industry and the professional bodies which proved invaluable in settling the final form of contracts and conditions of engagement.  These now form an integral part of the Government capital works management framework which has been developed to ensure the Government&rsquo;s key objectives for public sector construction procurement reform are achieved, that is to bring greater cost certainty at tender stage, reduce overall costs and help improve budget planning.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the difficulties being encountered by businesses at present.  It is confident the fast-track dispute resolution procedure in the new public works contracts can alleviate problems when disputes arise regarding payment.  The Government fully accepts that all businesses must be paid on time for works satisfactorily completed.  In the present economic climate, it is vital that payments to all those in the supply chain are not interrupted by long, drawn-out disputes about payment, which may adversely affect the financial position of those concerned, especially small to medium sized construction firms.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>As Senators are aware, contract procedures require architects, engineers and quantity surveyors to approve stage payments to contractors when work has been done to the appropriate quantity and quality.  The contracting authority must always have the right to ensure that work is done to the required standard.  No contracting authority should be required to pay for substandard work.  However, the Government fully agrees there is a need for measures to be put <Col N="844"/>in place to ensure firms are paid promptly for work and services satisfactorily delivered.  The conditions facing the construction industry are difficult enough without unfair and unnecessary burdens also being placed on companies where payments are properly due but delayed to secure a cash-flow advantage.</P>
        <P>While I commend Senator Quinn for preparing the Bill and bringing it before the House, the Government considers that there should be a process of consultation with the key stakeholders to explore the legal, technical and procedural issues in this very complex area.  However, there is a need for as quick a response as possible to deal with the cash-flow problems the industry faces.  The Government and the professional and industry bodies must work together in the consultation process we propose to determine the nature and scale of the problem and then move on to establish what changes in private sector contract terms should be made and how these can best be implemented.  Therefore, I invite the Senator and the industry and professional bodies to contact the Department of Finance to start the consultation process.  It is likely that other Departments may have a significant input as well and they will also be invited to take part in the process.  This approach will allow us to explore and develop practical measures that can be tailored to meet the problems we face.  The fact that they can be discussed and developed with the professional and industry bodies will be a major advantage in helping to ensure the resulting measures will be effective.  There is a great deal in Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill which will be considered in the discussions I have mentioned as possible changes to contract practice.</P>
        <P>As I stated, we must be careful about legislation in this very complex area and there are several proposals in the Bill which must be carefully examined before they could be put into law.  My following comments are not intended to take from the Bill which, as I have stated, has a great deal to offer.  However, we need to be aware of the pitfalls that could be encountered if we move too quickly without proper consideration.  For example, many contract disputes are complex and the tight timeframe in the Bill of 28 days with an extension of a further 14 days by agreement may not be practical for disputes that require much longer periods to resolve.  Above all, adjudication may bring about another layer of regulation for an industry already subject to a stringent regulatory regime and the House will agree we must be especially careful before we introduce new statutory requirements affecting contract procedures.  The proposed Bill does not set a minimum value below which adjudication would not arise and there may be a danger that disagreements on cost would be referred to adjudication for a decision rather than the parties first trying to reach agreement themselves.  This latter course may clearly be preferable in several circumstances and we cannot ignore it.  Experience in the UK has shown that practical adjudication procedures must be carefully framed.  For example, adjudication costs have become a major issue in that jurisdiction.  It has emerged that a major disincentive for the use of adjudication has been the imposition of all costs on the party initiating the action, irrespective of the outcome.  I understand this has led to several abuses and has required amending legislation to correct them.  The question of adjudication costs is not addressed in Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill.  This is also a major issue that must be resolved if we are to avoid the problems encountered by SMEs in the UK.  Once again, these comments are not intended as criticisms, but serve to illustrate the intricacies of the legal and technical issues which must be examined before we consider legislation.</P>
        <P>The new forms of contract introduced for public works in 2007 and made mandatory in 2008 include a dispute resolution procedure which could be of benefit in private sector contracts.  This procedure amounts to fast-track conciliation and may have a stronger foundation to that proposed in the Bill, in that a bond is provided to protect payment if it should be overturned in arbitration subsequently.  The bond is linked to a binding recommendation made by the <Col N="845"/>conciliator.  Furthermore, there seems to be greater flexibility regarding time allowed for a decision on disputes which permits complex disputes to be adequately addressed.  This procedure is already operating to the benefit of both contracting authority and contractors and may also be of benefit were it to be applied in the private sector.</P>
        <P>The tabling of the Bill provides the Government, the Seanad and the professional and industry bodies with an opportunity to consider what steps can be taken to address these serious issues.  The Government is ready and willing to work with the relevant bodies in devising dispute resolution procedures which would be suitable for the private sector.  I believe that when the discussions with the Senator and the relevant bodies begin, the proposals included in the legislation will be fully explored as well as other legal, technical and procedural issues, including the fast-track procedures, which are working well in public sector contracts.</P>
        <P>To sum up, the Government is well aware of the difficulties being caused by the non-payment of sums due under private sector construction contracts and seeks to work towards a solution with the Senator and the professional and industry bodies.  It is essential that we do not allow the resulting cash-flow problems to undermine the financial position of firms large and small and their ability to retain employment.  To deal with the problem, the Government proposes that discussions begin with the industry and the professional bodies as quickly as possible and that the Bill be deemed to be read a second time this day five months.  Accordingly, I commend the Government&rsquo;s motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting to ask ourselves why this Bill is an issue now and why it has not cropped up in the past.  Subcontractors have been telling me horror stories for years.  I refer to the case of a subcontractor who informed me he walked off the site of a development where he was working because he was not being paid properly.  This was several years ago when things were still relatively good.  Next, he found that a former employee, who had initially started working on the same project with him, took up the job of finishing off that project.  One wonders whether the former employee believed he would be treated any differently than his former employer by that developer.  Such sharp practice has been going on for years.</P>
        <P>However, sometimes when it comes to the world of business there are two sides to every story.  All too often, one person&rsquo;s sharp practice is another person&rsquo;s practical business solution.  I recall hearing a story years ago of a leading retailer which ordered a significant number of dinner sets for a promotion.  When the promotion was not going well, the contract was re-examined by the retailer and, on the basis of that re-examination, the retailer was able to get out of the contract following a measurement of the plates provided for the promotion.  That retailer is now one of the largest in the country and the company providing the plates went broke.  Sometimes, that is the way business unfolds.  I recall when my father was involved in business in the 1980s.  He had to set a new precedent in retention of title law when a liquidator refused to pay him for products he supplied to a factory.  The case went as far as the High Court.  The liquidator was at no loss one way or another.  However, if we had lost the case my father&rsquo;s business would have gone broke.  It has always been very difficult to be involved in business in this country.</P>
        <P>We must question why we are discussing such legislation now.  Basically, the reason is billions of euro have evaporated from the value of property and property development in the country.  I am unsure whether we can do much about the fact that a project has gone bankrupt.  I do not believe certain firms will be able to pay anyone.  Certain banks will not be paid because properties have gone into NAMA.  Certain developers will not get paid and, unfortunately, certain subcontractors will not be paid.</P><Col N="846"/>
        <P>There is a role for such legislation and when we, as legislators, are exposed to it we should take it on board.  One cannot legislate for trust.  Unfortunately, this is frequently the problem with many such cases; there is a breakdown of trust.  One strong point in the legislation is the idea of adjudication and how we can make adjudication work between contractors and subcontractors.  The key point is that it is faster and cheaper.  The Minister of State appears to dispute this but I believe he is well-informed on legislation in the UK, where they have overcome many of these problems with regard to the costs involved and ways around legislation that would have occurred in other jurisdictions.  This could be a very useful process in examining how the adjudication process works.  Litigation is not a solution for many subcontractors, even at this time.  Many contractors have very loose contracts.  The prospect of legal costs means it is often easier for a subcontractor to write off his or her losses than to pursue a solution through the courts.  A good and tight adjudication process might allow subcontractors to secure proper payments from principal contractors.</P>
        <P>We must also consider matters from the perspective of contractors.  During the construction boom the vast majority of contractors were reasonable with their subcontractors.  The purpose in using subcontractors is often to avoid the legal obligations involved in employing people in the normal way.  A certain amount of sharp practice is always to be expected in this regard.  There is no doubt that many smaller subcontractors were abused by bigger contractors who were able to play off smaller firms against each other.  One cannot legislate for something like this, as it is simply the way business works.  What we need are supports for smaller subcontractors in order that they will not be ripped off in the future.  The Minister of State should give a lead in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is good and necessary legislation.  I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinion that it may run into problems when it is the subject of wider consultation.  However, the principle of the legislation is excellent.  In particular, adjudication and how it could work in this jurisdiction to resolve conflicts between contractors and subcontractors is something we should examine carefully.  We should deal with that issue in five months' time.  By that time I hope the Minister of State will have overcome some of the other problems to which he referred.</P>
        <P>Some of our difficulties arise from the fact that billions of euro have evaporated from the value of property.  There is no way around this problem.  Whether in good or recessionary times, it is very hard to legislate for those who play foot-loose and fancy free with their employees or subcontractors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House, I will share time with Senator Butler.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank Senator Quinn for bringing forward this legislation.  I have an interest of sorts to declare.  I am involved in the ownership of an auctioneering practice and, as is customary, declare that interest.  I also welcome members of the construction industry and its representative organisations who have taken the time to come to listen to the debate in the Visitors Gallery.  I congratulate Mr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher who, as Senator Quinn outlined, made contact with many Members in recent months in order to advance this important issue.</P>
        <P>There is nothing with which to disagree in the Bill.  The Minister of State has made this clear.  We are all in agreement with the main thrust of the Bill.  However, some of us would like to make additions to it to give maximum protection.  As Senator Twomey said, business is ruthless.  It is our responsibility, as legislators, to ensure the necessary, although not the maximum, regulations and guidelines are in place.  The fall-out from the construction boom and the down<Col N="847"/>turn has made it clear that the necessary protections of subcontractors are not in place.  It is a pity we cannot, with the benefit of hindsight, go back a number of years and put them in place.</P>
        <P>The non-payment of subcontractors in the construction sector is a huge issue.  It has put many people out of business and we must put measures in place to deal with it.  Thousands work in the sector and they are often the last to be paid, if at all.  The industry seeks to require contracts to have strict and fair provisions, to ban the use of pay-when-paid clauses and to have enforceable and prompt dispute resolution provisions.  That is very reasonable.  The Minister of State has mentioned that there will be a consultation process in the next period.  Senator Quinn, representatives of the industry and the rest of us can have an input to that process which I hope will be limited to a defined period of time.  I hope we will not have a lengthy period of consultation in which report will follow report and action will fall behind.  I hope the Minister of State will limit the consultation process to a period of five months and that we will be back here after that time with a wider Bill or an extension to the provisions outlined by Senator Quinn.</P>
        <P>The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is of the opinion that the Bill does not go far enough.  The United Kingdom Construction Contracts Act 2002 would form a good template which we might examine before we  make the necessary improvements to the Bill.  I know the UK legislation allows adjudication to happen very quickly.  Some 18,000 cases have gone to adjudication in the United Kingdom and only 300 have ended up in the courts.  This proves that the process is a good one.</P>
        <P>We all want to see the introduction of a right to payment by instalment, except for projects shorter than one month or thereabouts.  We would also like to see the introduction of a statutory requirement for agreement on the days on which payments, including final payments, will fall due, default periods such as five and 17 days, respectively, as well as the prohibition of payment conditions conditional on receipt of payment from others.  A wide variety of people, apart from subcontractors, are affected by this.  Other service providers such as architects and auctioneers are affected by delayed payments or non-payment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I worry that some items have been left out of the Bill.  What is the position on receiverships and liquidations?  Who takes less?  One hears of many receiverships and liquidations throughout the country where a financial institution takes control and appoints a receiver.  He or she then values the company at today&rsquo;s price level and the bank liquidates it and takes the current market value.  In that instance, how can we ensure subcontractors will be paid the maximum amount when the financial institution in question might be recovering less than 40% of their own interest?  That area needs further work, perhaps by the Attorney General.  As the Minister of State said, quite a few Departments would have to take a view on the Bill.</P>
        <P>There is nothing to oppose in the Bill.  I salute the initiative of Senator Quinn, Mr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher and others in the CIF and other representative organisations.  I wish we, as legislators, had taken the initiative a few years ago before the current difficulties arose.  Notwithstanding that, I commend the efforts of all those involved.  I support the Government amendment and hope we, on this side of the House, can be true to our word and be back here within five months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will be brief.  I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s proposal.  I myself made some proposals as to how we might make additions to the Bill.  In my other life as a developer and contractor I have had the best possible relationships with subcontractors.  I was a subcontractor myself at one time and, therefore, know the difficulties that can arise when contractors decide not to pay subcontractors.  That is very regrettable.</P><Col N="848"/>
        <P>The subcontractor brings great expertise and fast processes to the construction industry.  Everyone benefits from having a good subcontractor in place.  It is vital that the subcontractor would have a means of resolving disputes promptly.  The adjudication system is vital.  The Minister of State has decided that there is a larger dimension to this Bill than one might believe.  It is important we take five months to do something and that we do it once and do it right.  This House has the expertise and knowledge to ensure a good Bill will result from this process.</P>
        <P>It is important we set up a bond system in the legislation that would ensure subcontractors would have the security of knowing they would be paid.  The stock answer they are given in court is that they will be paid, only to find out that they are not paid, in which case they must return to court.  These circumstances are ridiculous and are what we want to prevent.  A subcontractor who has taken a case may have paid a fortune to get the client into court only to find he cannot be paid.  In this case, he is no longer in a financial position to return to court.  That is the problem and it is why subcontractors go out of business.  Subcontracting is now a total nightmare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred to practising politicians&rsquo; experience of discussing with subcontractors their difficulties and real dilemmas.  We are all very keenly aware of these.  We would have to be on another planet not to be aware of the very genuine and serious problems people face.  I refer, for example, to people who have abandoned their employment and whatever protections they had as employees to enter business in their own right.  They find they are in dreadfully serious circumstances in terms of their not having been paid, not having any protection for themselves, perhaps not having any pension provision and having little or no access to welfare protection.  They are caught between many different stools and are in dreadful circumstances.  There are very many people in that position.  For this reason alone, it is important and useful that Senator Quinn has raised this issue in the Seanad.  He has brought forward a practical proposal to address it and I commend him very much on his having done so.</P>
        <P>This problem is not confined to the construction industry and it is important we remind ourselves of this.  In commercial life generally, there are great difficulties encountered by people who are simply trying to be paid for the work they have done.  I am prepared to accept the construction industry has a peculiar configuration in terms of head contractors and subcontractors but it is not entirely peculiar.</P>
        <P>There are many areas of commercial life that involve subcontracting, be it from a printer to a printer, from a printer to a graphic designer, or from a graphic designer to another operator.  If something goes wrong and it affects the head contractors, the subcontractors encounter difficulty.  We must be aware that the difficulty is not nearly confined to the construction industry.  I do not make this point to undermine in any sense what Senator Quinn is saying but to highlight that we need a broader perspective on this undoubtedly terribly serious problem.</P>
        <P>It occurred to me while listening to Senator Quinn and some of my colleagues that, two years ago, people would have been appalled at the prospect of the Oireachtas being asked to intervene in what is essentially a contractual nexus, an area of agreement or disagreement between parties.  The system we have tends to leave those issues, including issues concerning one&rsquo;s being paid or otherwise for doing work, to the parties and to favour little or no intervention on the part of the State.  That has been the practice and history of the market.  We are now engaged in a turnaround.  There have been many turnarounds in our system.  We are now saying we need State intervention in what was traditionally an issue to be resolved between the parties concerned through the contract, including where there is very serious conflict.</P><Col N="849"/>
        <P>Section 7(2) states: &ldquo;A party to a construction contract may not withhold any part of a payment after the relevant payment date of a sum due&rdquo;.  A very familiar term of any contract is that a party may not withhold payment under that contract.  If one agrees to do work and there is a payment set for it to be paid by a certain date if the work is completed, that is already a requirement.  There is a mutual agreement between two parties.  One side says it will do the work and the other says it will pay once the work is done.  That is a familiar concept that does not require or should not require to be put into statute.  This is not a criticism.  We ought to take it for granted.  Even as a legal proposition it is already in place.</P>
        <P>Let me outline my central question on the Bill and the strategy proposed.  While Senator MacSharry is correct that there is little in the Bill one could criticise, I am concerned it may be giving the impression it would be achieving something although ultimately it may not do so.  That is the problem I have.  There are not really robust sanctions at the heart of the Bill.  This is one of the matters the Minister of State may wish to consider during the consultation he rightly suggests ought to occur.</P>
        <P>There is a provision in the Bill on adjudication but there is no proposal to have compulsory adjudication, nor could there be because it would introduce problems of a constitutional nature.  Can one compel people to enter into an adjudication process?  Section 8 states a party to a construction contract has the right to refer for adjudication a dispute arising under the contract.  While that is perfectly reasonable, what if the offending party does not wish to attend at the adjudication or participate in it?  Subsection 8(3) states &ldquo;The contract shall provide that the decision of the adjudicator is binding until the dispute is finally determined by legal proceedings&rdquo;.  There are very real constitutional doubts as to whether an adjudicator can make a legally binding decision in a case referred to him by one party when the other party does not turn up.</P>
        <P>Some of the employment regulation orders that have been challenged in the courts in respect of a slightly different field, the electrical contract area, for example, raise a very similar question.  Can one require parties to comply mandatorily with a particular regulation without their agreeing to do so?  Is it constitutionally permissible to impose a decision on them when they have not entered freely into the adjudicative process?  These are very complex issues pointed out by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey pointed out one cannot legislate for trust.  The idea behind a contract is that it is an idea between two parties.  Both sides intend to bind each other and to carry out what is specified in the contract.  The law of contract is quite well tested and old.  We must not try to reinvent the wheel.  Parties agree and if they break an agreement, they have recourse to the law.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With regard to recourse to the law, I agree very much with what Senators have said and with what Senator Quinn implied about the need for speedier and less costly resolution of disputes that arise in this area.  The Senators are correct.  With regard to the Bill&rsquo;s reference to promoting adjudication, I queried the extent to which adjudication can be made compulsory.  That can be dealt with.  Promoting alternative dispute resolution, arbitration and mediation mechanisms is a vital objective that I strongly support.  I declare an interest in that I have acted as an arbitrator and mediator, including in commercial matters.  From my experience as a barrister, I recognise how important and helpful it is to parties to have a resolution mechanism that is quick, accessible and cheap.  If this Bill does nothing else, it certainly does us a service in terms of reminding us about and proposing a statutory form for dispute resolution, which I believe strongly ought to be promoted at every opportunity.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I reiterate that the Bill does not provide an ultimate sanction.  Perhaps that is because those who drafted it were of the opinion that it was not possible to include such a sanction.  If a party <Col N="850"/>does not give notice of intention to withhold payment but, ultimately, does not pay, the Bill does not contain any mechanism which would act as a sanction in such circumstances.  That is one of the reasons the Minister of State was correct in stating that there should be a period of reflection in respect of this proposal.  Senator Quinn has done the House a service by raising this matter.  That said, I do not believe the legislation is as of yet in a format whereby it could be allowed to proceed into law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this legislation which, in the context of the constraints that exist with regard to the drafting of Private Members&rsquo; Bills, especially those relating to matters of finance and the imposition of possible costs on the State, is well put together.  In that context, what I am stating may address one of the difficulties outlined by Senator Alex White.  The Government amendment makes provision for a five-month period of reflection in order that some of those difficulties might be addressed.</P>
        <P>One of the groups which tends not to be discussed in the aftermath of the property boom &mdash; or property binge as it has been called &mdash; is that which comprises subcontractors who have found themselves well down the food chain in respect of the many developments where work has ceased.  Many of those to whom I refer are self-employed, do not operate within company structures, do not pay social insurance and cannot claim unemployment benefit, which places them in a particularly invidious position.  This highlights the need for legislation in this area.  Senator Quinn must be acknowledged for presenting such legislation to the House.</P>
        <P>There was an unacceptable practice whereby many building companies used the companies legislation in an extremely reckless way.  These companies regularly went into receivership and liquidation to avoid the payment of debts.  I recall, as a then member of Cork City Council, being presented with a monthly list of housing estates across the city which remained unfinished and the contractors who were responsible for these developments.  On one occasion, I noted that one such estate development had been undertaken by a developer known as O&rsquo;Sullivan Builders and that the next such development had been undertaken by Navillus Builders.  Of course, the name &ldquo;Navillus&rdquo; is &ldquo;Sullivan&rdquo; spelled backwards.  It was obvious the contractor involved had established one company, put it out of business, established the second and also put it out of business.</P>
        <P>There are many victims in this area and legislation has either been entirely absent or far too loose in its interpretation to make provision for subcontracted work &mdash; in respect of which local government picks up the tab &mdash; and consumers.  Certain of the latter who were involved in staged payment arrangements found themselves in limbo as a result of the inadequacies of the legislation.  Senator Coghlan introduced Private Members&rsquo; legislation in respect of such arrangements which were, at one time, extremely prevalent in the Cork-Kerry region.  Thankfully, the practice of making staged payments is no longer particularly prevalent.  The debate on this Bill has highlighted the position from which we have come and the type of legal constraints which must be put in place to avoid a recurrence of the type of situations to which I refer.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Alex White that we need to look beyond the confines of the Bill and ask what type of social protection we can provide to people involved in this area.  Such protection is not on offer at present.  In that context, there is a need for a wider debate on the issue of prompt payments.  I may be arguing against the intent behind the Bill but the legislation governing such payments that is already in place is relatively strong.  We must consider the fact that the 30-day rule that applies does not appear to be adhered to or enforced and that agencies of the State find it difficult to operate within the confines of the legislation to which I refer.  As a result, we <Col N="851"/>are in extremely difficult territory.  A level of certainty must be provided in respect of individuals, small-scale contractors and subcontractors.  The current environment in the area of construction does not allow for such certainty, nor is it underpinned in the context of the provision of protection by the legislation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate on the Bill.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s response to it was sufficiently guarded, especially in the context of the fact that provisions may have to be added and other areas may have to be considered.  There is a commitment on the Government&rsquo;s part that this legislation, which will remain on the Order Paper, should be addressed in the wider context to which I refer, strengthened and eventually placed on the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>On those grounds, I warmly welcome the Bill.  I am encouraged that the Government amendment will allow us to return to deal with the legislation very soon.  I am confident that legislative effect will be given to the principles contemplated in it within the shortest possible period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Quinn on the initiative he has shown in introducing this legislation, which is timely and important.  In light of current difficulties, everything possible must be done to facilitate the return of the construction industry to a state of good health.</P>
        <P>The Bill addresses a specific problem, namely, instances where main contractors or developers are paid but where those who subcontract with them do not receive payment.  It provides for notice of intention to withhold payment, a speedy and cost-effective dispute resolution mechanism which would operate on the basis of adjudication, and the right to suspend work for non-payment.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the Government amendment.  This is one of the occasions on which I am happy to see an amendment from the Government, particularly as it is positive rather than destructive in nature.  Too often at Private Members&rsquo; time we are obliged to engage in ding-dong battles across the floor of the House.  On this occasion, the significant element of the amendment is the final phrase which states that Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;resolves that the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 be deemed to be read a second time this day 5 months&rdquo;.  This indicates the Government is serious and intends to progress the legislation through the House.</P>
        <P>A practical and observable difficulty in respect of this matter arises from the fact that there is a kind of hierarchy of payment which exists.  At the top of the pile is the main contractor and then there is a series of tiers within the supply chain.  In positive circumstances, there is a trickle-down effect.  However, the money does not always reach the most vulnerable people in the lower reaches of the hierarchy to which I refer.  The very real problems people encounter include the improper retention of money.  Funds are often held back because the main contractor wants to massage its own cashflow.  This happens at the expense of those to whom it subcontracted work.</P>
        <P>Manufactured, false or spurious reasons are also often offered in respect of the withholding of money.  For example, a tiny defect which might not be significant in the context of the overall project might be used as an excuse and a justification for withholding payment.  Such behaviour is plainly wrong and unfair.  At present there is no provision for the making of proper staged payments and this, as Senator Quinn pointed out, can lead to insolvency and redundancies.  These are the last things that are needed in the current climate.</P>
        <P>Sections 7 to 9, inclusive, are the three most important in the Bill.  I did not rely on my own intuition or intelligence &mdash; which, in the context of this matter, could be weak &mdash; in identifying this fact.  I relied instead on a very good briefing document I received from elements within <Col N="852"/>the construction industry.  I am not sure but previous speakers may already have placed on the record that which I am about to say.</P>
        <P>Section 7 deals with the notice of intention to withhold payment.  It suggests that subcontractors should be placed on notice that the main contractor proposes to withhold payment in order that they might take whatever action they regard as being appropriate.  The section states that it should not be possible to withhold money without two key factors first being addressed, namely, that prior notice has been given and that sufficient, specific and justifiable reasons have been provided to the person at the lower end of the chain with regard to why the money is being withheld.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for adjudication, which is important.  It is different from the normal method of arbitration.  It is straightforward, simple and quick.  It is essential to have speed in deciding the amount that should be paid by one party on an interim basis.  This will have the benefit of helping with cash flow difficulties.  In most commercial contracts, if there is a dispute over payment, a party can go to the courts to seek enforcement, but most construction contracts provide for alternative methods of dispute resolution, including conciliation, arbitration and so on.  They may lead eventually to justice, but they have two cardinal difficulties.  They tend to be slow and expensive.  For example, payments can be delayed for several years while the matter is in arbitration and the contracts also give an opportunity to the main contractor to manufacture causes of dispute.  Once legal advice is sought, the reasons multiply.  Following adjudication, the parties can continue to conciliate, arbitrate or litigate the ultimate resolution of a dispute.  The adjudication is binding in the interim and enforceable and the parties can then go to the courts to seek enforcement.</P>
        <P>I am sure Senator Quinn has examined what happens in other jurisdictions.  The nearest is the United Kingdom which provides a good justification for such legislation.  It addressed this situation in legislation within the past few years, as a result of which cash flow throughout the entire industry has improved dramatically and 90% of disputes are settled at adjudication or shortly thereafter.  Since the enactment of the construction Bill in the United Kingdom, there have been 18,000 adjudications, of which only 300 have ended up in court, a small proportion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some provisions could be included in the Bill such as the right to payment by instalment, except for a project of less than 45 calendar days; a statutory requirement for an adequate mechanism for determining sums due, including default provisions where the mechanism is not agreed by the parties; a statutory requirement for agreements on the dates on which payments, including the final payment, will be made and default periods such as five and 17 days, respectively; and the prohibition of payment provisions which are conditional on receipt of payment from others, in other words, where the subcontractor is put in the position where he or she has to collect on behalf of the main contractor.  The Bill provides adequate protection.  Some Members said the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997 would be useful and could be applicable in this regard, but it is not for the reasons I outlined.  The construction industry is different.  Work is carried out in advance of payment and, as Senator Quinn mentioned, when the building is erected, it cannot be dismantled to recover the value of the bricks, the plumbing, the ground work and so on.</P>
        <P>The introduction of an independent, impartial adjudicator would be positive.  The United Kingdom has the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996; New Zealand, the Construction Contracts Act 2002; Malaysia, the Building and Construction Industry Payments and Adjudication Act, which is pending; Singapore, the Building and Construction Industry Security Act 2004; and five states in Australia have introduced similar legislation.  We are <Col N="853"/>moving in a direction in which the rest of the world has seen fit to move and I applaud Senator Quinn for his foresight in producing this valuable Bill.  In a week that is almost void of Government legislation, it is remarkable that a Senator from the Independent benches has introduced a Bill that has received a welcome on all sides of the House.</P>

During the boom times certain subcontractors had to wait or did not receive payments, sometimes for reasons that were not proper.  Notwithstanding this, now that we are experiencing more difficult times, there are serious problems.  Therefore, it is high time we regulated the industry.  It is proper that contractors should be notified if they are not going to be paid.  Banks and finance houses need to know the cash flow position of companies and some companies could lose out and not survive.  We all need to pay on time in every line of business.  Adjudication appears to work well and the system often leads to people agreeing terms before adjudication in the knowledge that it will result in a reasonable proposal and the right to suspend work if not paid.</P>
        <P>The Government is still investing more than &euro;6 billion annually to ensure our infrastructure is in good order and that we will be ready for the recovery that is around the corner.  It is particularly gratifying that our motorways are being completed.  The final leg of the motorway between Cork and Dublin will be completed this month, which is welcome.  When a contractor has to get to work and workers have to get to a production facility, for example, or tourists want to travel around the country, the same infrastructure facilitates them.  Everybody benefits and that is all down to the construction industry.  At a time when there is a great deal of commentary about problems in the construction industry, it is no harm to remind ourselves of the great benefits we have seen and that these will continue to benefit the economy, including through legislation such as this.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Hanafin for sharing time with me.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome to the Visitors Gallery the CIF delegation which includes Mr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher and Mr. Cathal Lee.  When I received notification from Mr. Gallagher about this legislation three weeks ago, it was timely because a week prior to that a neighbour of mine who had a plumbing company employing eight people had rung to tell me he had gone out of business because he had not been paid by major contractors.  That meant nine families had been put out of commission because of the non-payment of bills.  He said two types of people did not pay &mdash; the person who could not pay and the person who could but would not pay.  He had applied for social welfare but was entitled to nothing.  The community welfare officer gives him a few euro every week.  He has fallen into bad health in the meantime, mentally and otherwise, and does not go outside the door.  This highlights the knock-on effects of the failure to pay subcontractors.  The man to whom I refer was not able to pay his suppliers and so on.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Quinn for introducing the Bill.  He makes a good job of anything he tackles.  I take on board Deputy Alex White&rsquo;s comment that implementation is the key issue when it comes to legislation.  If it cannot be done, passing it is a useless exercise.  We should also examine the issue he raised about sanctions.  We should not rush the legislation, as there are many other issues which we do not have time to discuss.  The Bill is straightforward and I support it because it will make life much easier for the small player and ensure people will be treated in a respectable and decent way.</P><Col N="854"/>
        <P>We should liaise with the CIF, as we could have a good discussion on the construction industry.  It would be useful to exchange views on a regular basis.  Given the overheads that pertain to the construction industry, these are matters as well that must be looked at to enable people in that business to stay afloat.  These are all the issues and I believe we should have a programme to address these in future.  We could meet on a regular basis, as I have said, to discuss all these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Hanafin, and also Senator Brady for allowing me to participate in this debate in the time allotted.  I also echo the welcome to Mr. Sean Gallagher.  That was the first time I was made aware of this very serious difficulty, as illustrated by the story told by Senator Brady.  I am delighted that Mr. Gallagher is here, along with representatives of the CIF. </P>
        <P>I particularly want to acknowledge Senator Quinn coming up to the plate once again.  I hope he will be as successful if he decides to introduce a summer time termination Bill into the House, as he will be with this one, which is another example of his expertise.</P>
        <P>My main reason in contributing is that the story outlined by Senator Brady is similar to one that was brought to my attention.  Currently, the motorway system, as Senator Hanafin has said, has been completed.  However, subcontractors have suffered grievously <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>some main contracts.  I will not name the motorway in deference to the people involved, but in one particular instance over the last couple of months the main contractor was being paid the money after 30 days but was holding it for 50 days before paying subcontractors.  In the recent past, I understand, the subcontractors have renegotiated this time interval down to 40 days with the main contractor, but this still leaves a major gap, and as a result they have had to lay people off.  I do not believe that is acceptable and I am glad this Bill is going to address that issue.</P>
        <P>Although I know the Minister of State has repeatedly said in his very welcome contribution that the Bill will be read a second time five months from today, I ask him not to allow the permanent Government &mdash; I have the greatest admiration for civil servants and draftsmen &mdash; to delay this, because it is already causing inordinate difficulties for people.  The most extreme illustration of that is what we heard from Senator Brady.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State quite rightly highlighted that the Government was spending &euro;6.5 billion under the capital programme, which compares favourably with the rest of the European Union.  However, I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to a map which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> today showing the progress of motorway completions.  Once one passes Mullingar going north west there is space, nothing.  It is as if it were a desert.  Again, I make the plea on the basis of what Speaker Tip O&rsquo;Neill once said about all politics being local.  I hope there will be a revision by the NRA to include the N4 completion.  My friend and colleague, Senator MacSharry, will testify there is a section of the road past the Curlew mountains, going into Sligo, that has been lying there since Famine times, without anything being done to it apart from normal routine maintenance.  I shall make that plea to the Minister of State to ensure, if he has any influence with the NRA, that the north west is not forgotten.  Anyone from overseas who looks at that map today would believe there is nothing but rutted tracks and cow paths up to the north west.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senators Jim Walsh and Maria Corrigan, with the permission of the House. </P><Col N="855"/>
        <P>First, I congratulate my good friend, Senator Feargal Quinn, on the presentation of his Bill and his explanatory memorandum, for a job well done.  I welcome the Construction Industry Federation representatives and other interested parties in the Gallery, including the former Minister of State, Mr. Tom Parlon.</P>
        <P>This Private Members&rsquo; debate takes place against the background of a clear recognition of the need to address issues relating to payments under construction contracts.  This issue and related matters under construction contracts warrant attention, debate and suitable legislation.  The proposals contained in the Bill are very welcome, and seek to address some very troublesome issues under such construction contracts.  While a great deal is covered in Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill, the area is very complex and we all agree the proposals contained in the Bill can be strengthened and improved.  Like others in the House I have come across cases where disputes have arisen over the withholding of payments or over the quality of work done between contractors, subcontractors, quantity surveyors, engineers, architects and others involved in construction projects.  Some of these disputes are clear and can be easily measured.  Others manifest themselves in 100 different ways.  Such situations demand appropriate address and when such disputes arise they can cause serious destruction on some projects and can have real implications for others who are not necessarily involved as regards payment or in the actual disputes but who can still suffer from the fall-out.</P>
        <P>I welcome the widespread agreement and especially the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution as regards commencing a consultation process with industry representatives to address the issues with practical measures, as he put it, and to come back to the House within five months.  There are just two matters about which I seek a response from the Minister of State.  When will the consultation process begin, who will chair and co-ordinate it and how will interested parties be accommodated in making their submissions?  Will the statutory authorities be involved in the consultation process such as local authorities, Revenue and so on?</P>
        <P>While we approach this matter with a genuine desire to find suitable resolution and return to the House within five months with Government legislation, such legislation should contain the provision that after it is enacted it will accommodate a review and consultation process with interested parties who contributed to it in order to assess its success or otherwise and if necessary to amend it after this review has been carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others who complimented Senator Quinn in relation to the introduction of this Bill.  It is a short but nonetheless important Bill, and coming from a county such as Wexford where a large proportion of employment was based in the construction industry, and where there is a considerable number of contractors, large and small, this is obviously a very important topic for us.</P>
        <P>I know from speaking to many people involved in the industry that many of the problems which have been elucidated here in the debate reflect the difficulties they are experiencing at local level.  To some extent, we must close off the exploitation of legal loopholes.  Many people operate their businesses to the letter of the law while others do this while also operating to a high personal ethical standard.  That is where we need to get to.  We need the legislation to reflect that type of ethical standard as well.  The Minister of State indicated that many people here would have been contacted about large main contractors with a group of companies, one of which &mdash; effectively a paper company &mdash; was allowed to fold, and as a consequence all creditor subcontractors of that company receive nothing for work they have done.  This Bill sets out a mechanism for tackling that issue.  The experience in Britain is one that we could seek to replicate here.  I understand that over the past 15 years there have been strict provisions <Col N="856"/>on payment within the construction industry; it is claimed that this has minimised the effect of the recession on the construction industry in the UK, which is a not unimportant consideration in view of the difficulties we are experiencing here.  The idea of an adjudication process in which cases must be decided on within a time limit of six weeks and which would have the force of being temporarily binding is good.  The vast majority of cases, apparently, are concluded based on the recommendation of the adjudication process rather than being taken through the lengthier and more costly arbitration system.  I urge the Government to address all the issues involved to ensure there is a fair payment system.</P>
        <P>One item that is not provided for in the Bill is a requirement for a clause in contracts with subcontractors specifying that payments are to be made when they become due.  It should be the right of the subcontractor to withdraw from his obligations under the contract pending payment without any recourse for the main contractor to dismiss him from the works or the site.  This would create an imperative for the main contractor to deal with issues of payment.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White made a pertinent point about the application of employment regulation agreements across the board, including to people who were not party to them.  This is now an impediment to the restoration of progress within the construction industry and is adding to the problem of unemployment.  It should be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not need my eight minutes.  I missed most of the debate thus far and I am not long in the House, but I wanted to take the opportunity to commend Senator Quinn on his introduction of this Bill and to support it.  I remember the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who was then a Senator, was here five or six years ago when we discussed a Private Members&rsquo; motion in the name of the then Senator Jim Higgins, who is now an MEP.  He proposed a similar Bill applying specifically to electrical contractors in the construction sector, although it was voted down by the Government at the time &mdash; perhaps not surprisingly, as we were then in the middle of a housing bubble which later proved to be catastrophic and there were many voices on the Government benches who did not want to believe there would ever be a day of reckoning for construction and for the people employed in it.  Sadly, however, that day did come to pass, and many people in the construction industry have lost their jobs or are in financial difficulties.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the comments of Senator Jim Walsh, with whom I do not often agree but who was perspicacious with regard to the construction industry in the south-eastern region.  I spoke recently to a person involved with IDA Ireland who said he regarded the south east as a part of the country that had not seen anything from the Celtic tiger.  Construction was a major employer in that area, particularly in Wexford but also in Carlow and Kilkenny and perhaps in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency of Tipperary South.  Many of those jobs are now gone; some people have left the country to try to gain a livelihood and are not part of the live register figures any more.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State&rsquo;s decision to consider the issue for the next five months before returning to the House on Committee Stage.  It is quite likely &mdash; I read through the Bill before I came in &mdash; that some amendments will be necessary to improve the Bill; I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to introduce these.</P>
        <P>I wish to note a couple of items of correspondence that Senators received about the proposed Bill.  I was struck by the comments of the Construction Industry Federation, which I saw as a group that was more concerned with the interests of larger companies rather than subcontrac<Col N="857"/>tors; however, it certainly nailed its colours to the mast on this Bill.  Don O&rsquo;Sullivan was the county engineer in Kilkenny County Council when I was elected for the first time 11 years ago.  I was a starry-eyed young student and I can say with my hand on my heart that Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan was the most exceptional local authority official I have ever dealt with, although I have not dealt with him since he left the employ of the county council.  I take great interest in his support for the Bill as expressed in his letter.</P>
        <P>I am anxious that whatever sort of mechanism for arbitration is drawn up from the legislation, if it comes to pass, should not be too cumbersome.  It will need to be able to react quickly to difficulties that arise between contractors and subcontractors.  It is particularly important at this juncture, when so many small businesses, particularly those in construction, are having difficulty in getting their hands on credit from the banks.  Many people in my area were employed as carpenters and electricians during the construction boom.  Some of those businesses were quite viable and successful and could have continued into the future, but they were pushed to the wall because of difficulties in obtaining money from contractors and credit from our financial institutions.  Anything that can be done should be done to ensure a speedy flow of cash for work that has been done by subcontractors.  That is why I am supporting this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Corrigan has eight minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be as quick as possible.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State and commend Senator Quinn on his introduction of the Bill, which is much needed at a difficult time for subcontractors, be they small companies or sole traders.  As the Minister of State said earlier, we all have experience of being approached by people who are finding it difficult to obtain payment and whose businesses are on the line as a result, as are the livelihoods of any employees who work for them.  This has a knock-on effect on our communities and on the economy, and a devastating impact on the families of the employees.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister of State that he intends to start a consultation process with the industry and that he will come back to the House within five months.  The inclusion of a process for adjudication within the Bill is of particular value.  I ask the Minister of State, in light of instances of which I am aware, to consider some of the following aspects.</P>
        <P>One example is a situation in which a subcontractor has undertaken and completed work using materials he has already paid for.  This results in an end product from which somebody else derives a benefit, yet the subcontractor himself does not get paid.  In such a situation the person in possession of the product can operate it and derive a benefit from it while the subcontractor who has funded it through labour and materials finds himself going out of business.  Will the Minister indicate whether it may be possible to consider a mechanism by which the debt that has not been discharged would travel with a finished product, so to speak, and the person deriving a benefit from that product would be liable for it?  I would appreciate his consideration of that.  The parallel application of it would be in the case of someone buying a house on which there were outstanding debts that were not discharged prior to the purchase of the house.  That person would then become liable for any outstanding charges set against that house because they are deriving the benefit of residence in it.</P>
        <P>I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention also to international law in terms of the admiralty law whereby if one owns a boat and takes in supplies of food or fuel without paying for that fuel or food, it is possible for that boat to be held in limbo and not function until those debts are discharged.  That is something consideration should be given to in that if someone has a product that can <Col N="858"/>be operational but which has not been paid for, somebody would have the right to look for the function of that product to be halted until their debts are discharged.</P>
        <P>There is another point to which I would like the Minister to give consideration.  A trend developed in recent years whereby a shelf company would be established to oversee a particular project.  When the subcontractors or any other individuals associated with work on the project send in their bills at the end of the project, it would be announced that the shelf company no longer had any money to pay the outstanding amounts.  If the shelf company had no assets it would go into liquidation and there would be no recourse for payment, other than through the courts, for the people who had completed the work and paid for the materials.  In situations where companies overseeing a project have no permanent assets, will the Minister indicate whether consideration could be given to the establishment of a payment bond that would be set aside by the company?  I understand a similar process is followed in the United States in that somebody who is overseeing a project and commissioning out work must set aside a payment bond to ensure that if for some reason costs overrun and somebody cannot be paid, the money has been set aside to ensure no individual who pays for materials or gives their labour is left out of pocket.</P>
        <P>In terms of other mechanisms to consider, I am struck by the fact that if all else fails and the Minister must go to the courts, he is in a quandary.  The extension of the small claims court to small businesses was welcome but it is only for small amounts of &euro;3,000 or less.  If someone is owed &euro;1 million or more they can go to the commercial courts but if they are owed any amount in between, neither of those avenues are open to them and they must go through the regular court system where one can wait approximately two years for the case to be heard.</P>
        <P>If a small operator with nine or ten employees has an outstanding bill that he or she must pursue through the courts and it will take up to two years to have that debt discharged, by the time the case comes before the court that operator will be out of business and there will no longer be a debt to be discharged.  That is not acceptable.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to that because most of the people we are talking about in this debate are subcontractors who will fall within that band.  They will not have either of those two fast-track options available to them when it comes to court and will be obliged to endure the two year waiting process.</P>
        <P>I want to give an example of a company in my area that I was struck by and which raised questionable moral issues for all of us.  The company in question carried out some work in good faith for a hotel refurbishment project.  It paid for the materials and the labour.  It presented a bill at the end of the project and was told there was no money available.  It was a shelf company and the shelf company was going into liquidation.  That company has between nine to 11 employees who work for it full-time.  It tried to pursue the money but was unable to get it.  While the shelf company went into liquidation, the hotel for whom this company had carried out the work continues to operate and is deriving the benefit of this company&rsquo;s materials and labour for which it cannot get paid.  Within a few months that company with the nine to 11 employees will go out of operation yet the hotel will continue to operate.  In fact, it is operating at a profit as a result of materials and labour paid for by somebody else.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not an expert in this field but my interest was piqued while sitting in the Chair earlier and I asked a few people I know to provide me with some information on it.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Quinn because he has come forward with a Bill which will be accepted in the fullness of time, perhaps in the form of a more detailed Bill.</P><Col N="859"/>
        <P>I agree with Senator Alex White that the payment difficulties throughout the system are not exclusive to the construction industry.  Many people in my constituency are experiencing significant difficulties in that they cannot fill the orders on their books because they cannot get the money for the raw materials as they were not paid for their last job.</P>
        <P>That ties in to one of the issues that is pertinent currently, namely, the unwillingness of the banks to put money into the system and allow viable businesses continue in operation.  I commend the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, for bringing in representatives of the banking industry today and yesterday to question the reason the money that was put into the system has not found its way down to small and medium enterprises.  I know that is a slightly different issue but it is strongly related to the one under discussion.</P>
        <P>We know that in good and bad times delayed and an acrimonious flow of cash through the construction supply chain is a major difficulty in the industry.  It is leading to insolvencies and unemployment down through the supply chain.  That is pertinent now with the banking sector in its current state and therefore the cash flow element is significant.</P>
        <P>It is important to examine the example in the United Kingdom.  This issue was tackled 15 years ago in the UK with the introduction of the strict provisions on payment in the construction industry.  I understand that has been a major success and is one of the factors in minimising the effects of the recession in the construction industry in the UK.</P>
        <P>In terms of what we do here, we talk about an island economy and all-island viewpoints on certain issues yet we do not have laws that are mutually reciprocal.  That is one of the reasons this legislation is important at this time because there are many people in the construction industry here who have built in the North, and <i>vice versa</i>.  The construction industry has become a 32 county Ireland industry.  I am aware issues have arisen in Belfast with people who have built and others who were committed to buying but who did not buy.  All of those issues highlight the importance of more transparency and unity in our approach to legislation, if it is good legislation.  If there has been good practice in the UK, and it appears that is the case, it would be sensible in that context to ensure we move on this issue as fast as possible.</P>
        <P>I understand the intention is that the Minister will come back to the House in five months with a Bill having had many negotiations in that time.  That is important because whatever we do in terms of Government contracts and trying to stimulate the construction market it is important that everybody, down to the subcontractor, gets paid.</P>
        <P>I understand the issue is based around getting payment for work done.  I am told the solutions are based on banning the most obvious abuse, namely, pay when paid clauses; requiring contracts to have strict and fair payment provisions; and having enforceable prompt dispute resolution provisions, which is the issue of the adjudication.  The Construction Contracts Bill addresses the second and third points and partly addresses the first point.</P>
        <P>The adjudication aspect has been well tested in the UK in the past 12 years and it is said to be working well.  It was introduced in the Housing Grants Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, with a similar Construction Contract Order 1997 extending the same provisions to the North.  Recently the UK regime has been revised and strengthened.  If that applies in the North and is good practice, it might be sensible to adopt an all-island version of it.</P>
        <P>Adjudication provides for a dispute resolution process typically confined to no more than six weeks, in which a neutral construction professional will assess the claimant&rsquo;s claim and hear submissions from both sides.  I understand the argument made earlier, that one cannot force both parties to be involved.  Therefore, there may be difficulties with the process and it may <Col N="860"/>not be as simple as it sounds.  However, we must start somewhere.  Usually, the adjudication is done without the need for an oral hearing, which keeps costs down.  The adjudicator&rsquo;s decision is then temporarily binding on both parties.  If the adjudicator finds that money is due from one party to the other, that money must be paid and is enforceable by way of summary judgment.  Either party can then bring the matter to arbitration, which is a much lengthier and more costly process.  In Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the majority of cases are settled after the adjudicator&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>It is suggested that it is important to keep the statute law that will be introduced in the Republic of Ireland in the same wording and layout as that used in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  Some 400 cases have been decided on adjudication in the United Kingdom over the past 15 years.  Clearly, there is a great wealth of case law and if the Irish Act were to use the same wording, there would be much more certainty as to how the courts here might interpret it.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill explicitly removes consumers and residential homes from the provisions of the Act.  This is a welcome provision.  I note the Act does not favour any particular section within construction, but discriminates against those who have shoddy and or unethical payment practices.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is important debate on this issue is stimulated here.  This is the start of an important process.  People have asked why we are doing this now and why it is needed, because there is a wider picture.  I suggest we need to review the wider picture I mentioned at the start of my contribution.  If we are in a situation where bank lending stymies other sectors as well as construction we should, perhaps, look at the generality of people not getting paid for work done, which has a massive trickle down effect.  I know from my constituents this has been an issue within the construction industry and this debate should lead to good legislation.  We may already have good legislation to which we can refer and we can marry the two together.  I wish the Minister and his officials well with bringing this legislation to a positive conclusion and look forward to seeing it before the House.</P>

      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comments.  It does not seem like tautology for me to say his contribution and the others we heard have been very constructive &mdash; a good word to use on the Construction Contracts Bill.  I have been very impressed by the contributions and found them useful.  Senator Boyle said there is a need for this Bill and I believe there is.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said his comments were not intended as a criticism and I understand that.  He also said he was sympathetic to the aims of the Bill.  Everybody who spoke has been sympathetic to it.  Senator MacSharry said he did not disagree with any of it, but felt some additions would benefit the Bill and make it more effective.  I accept improvements can be made to any legislation and I hope this legislation will be improved.  Senator Alex White said the problem was not confined to the construction industry.  However, it is pertinent to the construction industry.  In any other business, if someone sells somebody something and payment is not made, the person can go and repossess the item.  However, that cannot be done if a person has supplied piping or wiring that has already been embedded in the product.  Senator White also spoke about the adjudication and dispute resolution and Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned the experience in France.  Senators Norris and MacSharry spoke about the British experience of adjudication, where there have been 18,000 cases, only 300 of which ended up in court.  What a success that is.  We can do more in that regard.</P>
        <P>One of the difficulties I had with introducing this Bill was the concern that it would create more red tape for Irish business and industry.  More red tape inhibits entrepreneurship, which <Col N="861"/>is something on which we will have to rely to a large extent in the future.  Hopefully, this will not happen.  I was impressed by Senator Corrigan&rsquo;s contribution.  She suggested that when people buy a house, the house should have a clean bill of health and should come with some sort of bond that would guarantee all bills had been paid, including construction bills.  We should look at that issue.</P>
        <P>I have a concern with regard to the five-month period mentioned by the Minister of State.  I have introduced two Bills in the past, one of which was accepted, the passports for sale Bill.  The Minister at the time, not unlike today, said he could not vote against it because he could not disagree with anything in it.  The Bill was not amended, but the Minister later introduced his own Bill and improved on mine.  I would like to think this Bill will be retained and that a new one will not be created.  Another concern relates to the second Bill I introduced, which had to do with presumed consent for organ transplants.  The Minister said at the time that he thought he agreed with most of it, but would like to consult on it.  That was in September 2008, which is the reason for my concern.  I have found that the difference between my experience in business and in the public sector is the lack of urgency.  I am concerned by the lack of urgency.  I am concerned that the period of time between now and 19 October could develop into a talking shop.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I urge the Minister of State to ensure that does not happen.  The Bill should not become a discussion issue but become something that will achieve what we set out to do.  I understand that Committee Stage for this Bill will take place on Tuesday, 19 October.  I want to ensure this House holds to that.  I understand that is the case and hope it happens.  In the meantime, the Department officials will consult the various bodies.  I know that consultation will include the Construction Industry Federation, which has 37 separate association members.  The federation has been very helpful to me in drawing up this Bill.  Mr. Patrick McGovern of Arthur Cox and company has also helped me a great deal and so too has my assistant Anne O Broin.  I mentioned earlier that Se&aacute;n Gallagher initiated this idea and had the experience to contact us to suggest it should be done.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the efforts of all of those who have been involved in this work.  I particularly appreciate the involvement and contributions of Members here.  I appreciate their input and the thought put into their contributions with the clear aim of improving the Bill.  The Bill can and will be improved over the next few months.  We need to keep up the sense of urgency because the Bill will not be retrospective.  We will not be able to go back and do anything about anything that goes wrong during the next five months waiting period.  The Bill will only apply in the future.  Therefore, let us ensure we do not delay it.  I am happy to accept the amendment and appreciate the work that has been put into the debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise the need for the Minister for Education and Skills to outline the process under<Col N="862"/>taken by her Department to date in considering and awarding patronage of a new second level school in Lucan, County Dublin.  There is ongoing confusion in Lucan and throughout the country about the process on which the Department embarks when considering the awarding of patronage of a second level school.  Perhaps the matter could be clarified in the House tonight.  What criteria does the Department operate when considering patronage of a school?  The process must be made more transparent than it is.</P>
        <P>In the past I have raised the need for the school building programme to be more transparent.  This also applies to patronage.  The process lacks transparency and there is a lack of public understanding.  This must be addressed.  I am aware that the D&aacute;il is due to debate the issue tomorrow.  I raise the matter with regard to the patronage of a second level school in south Lucan.  Will the Minister of State outline how the VEC was awarded patronage and then received notification that the matter was under revision?  Will he clarify whether it has been withdrawn or is under revision?  According to a reply to a parliamentary question on the matter in the D&aacute;il, the Department is awaiting the development of a new framework before the issue can be decided.  At what stage is the development of the new framework and when will the final decision be made?  A decision was made but then there was a change and a revision.  At what stage is the process now?</P>
        <P>I am concerned about this because there was general acknowledgement in the Department of the need for two new secondary schools in Lucan.  However, in recent replies to parliamentary questions it appears to have changed its view and now states there is only a need for one school.  This impacts on patronage and the issue of what bodies will be awarded patronage of the school.  I ask the Minister of State and the Department to look again at the figures and the demographics which led to a downgrading of the need for a second school in Lucan.  I believe the figures being used by the Department are outdated.  The Minister of State should examine the figures being used by the Lucan south secondary school action group which are available on its website and on which detailed work was done.  They have been revised again recently.  They clearly show an increase of almost 3,000 children of secondary school age up to 2019.  The Department should look at the figures again and give careful consideration to those produced by the Lucan south secondary school action group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a need for a new secondary school in the Lucan area.  There have been many problems at primary school level and we have no wish to see them replicated at second level.  Children from Lucan should not have to travel outside the area as they have had to do, sometimes on long unsustainable journeys, to access second level education.  This is a great opportunity to put in place two secondary schools in south Lucan.  The facts and demographic figures show that two schools are clearly merited.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to outline the Department&rsquo;s current position on the issue of patronage which has caused much concern, given that a decision was made and then withdrawn.  Certainly, parents are concerned about what is happening.  Fine Gael wishes to see patronage awarded to new bodies which are seeking it at second level.  However, there is a very strong demand in the area, particularly from the Lucan south secondary school action group, that the issue of patronage awarded to the VEC be clarified with regard to the Clonburris site.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter, as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current issues surrounding recognition and patronage in general.</P><Col N="863"/>
        <P>The Senator will be aware that section 10 of the Education Act 1998 deals with the recognition of new schools and sets out the factors that the Minister must take into account when considering such applications.  The previous Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, stated that, given the changing nature of Irish society and the projected need for a number of post-primary schools to open in the medium term, the Department was considering a number of broad policy issues regarding the establishment of new post-primary schools.  As part of this, consideration is being given to the setting up of a new framework relating to the establishment of new second level schools and their patronage.  New schools, where only very initial planning has taken place, will be considered in the context of this framework when it is established.</P>
        <P>The second level school in Lucan is the only such school where a VEC has been informed about patronage.  It is not the case that patronage of this school has been withdrawn from County Dublin VEC; the position is that the issue will receive further consideration in light of the new framework.  The consideration of the new framework is not delaying site acquisition or the planning, design and building of second level schools in any way.  In addition to County Dublin VEC, an application has been made by Educate Together regarding the proposed new school in Lucan.  Furthermore, a general application in relation to schools in developing areas has also been received from the Loreto Education Trust.  It is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s intention to finalise the matter and convey a decision to all relevant parties at the earliest date possible.</P>
        <P>The Senator had a number of other queries relating to figures.  I will endeavour to get the information required.  If there are any other queries, she might let me know about them now and I will follow up on them for her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Department the census work that has been carried out by the Lucan south secondary school action group.  The information is available on the group&rsquo;s website and I believe a copy was given to the Department.  In the light of the reply to a previous parliamentary question, I urge the Department to examine the figures and reconsider its decision that the area does not require two new secondary schools.  The figures prove beyond doubt that there is a need for them to cater for the group of children in the area approaching adolescence.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State conveyed that information to the Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief in outlining this very serious issue.  I welcome my good friend the Minister of State back to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I had a little lapse for a few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I had a simultaneous lapse.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State outline the funding and resources which will be provided to make Cregmore national school, Cregmore, County Galway, a safer location following the horrific accident that occurred there three weeks ago when an articulated truck ploughed through the perimeter wall of the school as the pupils were leaving?  I saw the closed circuit camera footage of the incident and it was unbelievable.  The driver of the articulated truck lost control because another car went through the crossroads and the truck tore into 11 vehicles as the children were leaving school.  A two year old child was strapped into one vehicle which was sent through the fields.  It is a miracle that the child is okay.  Simultaneously, 50 infants were being released from the school.  Only for the quick thinking and action of parents and teachers, there could have been carnage.</P><Col N="864"/>
        <P>The difficulty is that the school is located at a crossroads.  There were two other accidents prior to this in which vehicles came through the perimeter wall, but because there was no demolition of vehicles they remained under the radar.  Now it is a very serious situation.</P>
        <P>The second part of my question is this.  On the night of the accident, because it made the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo;, the office of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister, Deputy Coughlan, telephoned the principal to say the Department would do whatever was needed, and I am about to tell the Minister of State what is needed.</P>
        <P>I spoke today to the principal of the school, Mr. Joe Kennelly, with whom I spent an hour and a half approximately two weeks ago looking at the CCTV footage.  He has moved very quickly on this, further to the call from the Minister&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>As it happens, a planning application was submitted to build a new school gym and sports hall.  After getting health and safety advice and expertise, the school has been told that the teachers&rsquo; cars need to be taken away from the drop-off area where parents would normally pick up their children because that is accounting for up to 24 spaces.  Moving the teachers&rsquo; cars away from that location will enable traffic to flow more freely.  Therefore, the school has been asked to move the hall back, which means it needs to purchase more land, and there is the building of two classrooms, a new percolation area and a new car park for the teachers&rsquo; cars, including the realignment of walls.  The total bill will come to &euro;152,000 to make this a safe location.</P>
        <P>That application was sent by Swiftpost to the Department of Education and Skills in Tullamore on Monday last and I hope the Minister of State has up-to-date news for me.  Matters move quickly in the Department.</P>
        <P>There is a very active parents&rsquo; association and board of management in the school.  If any of our children were in that school, we would want action taken.  This is the third time there has been an accident at the location.  There are obvious engineering difficulties.  Galway County Council has moved to rebuild the wall, re-lay the tarmac and make it look like there was not an accident, but that is not a sustainable solution.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  I thank Senator Healy Eames for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity of outlining to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects, in particular the Department&rsquo;s position regarding the upgrading of facilities in Cregmore national school, County Galway.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in the existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The 2010 capital allocation for the primary and post-primary sectors is &euro;579 million, and this sum will facilitate the delivery of the school building programme through a range of projects and schemes.</P>
        <P>On 16 February, the then Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, announced the 2010 large-scale school building programme.  A total of 52 school projects &mdash; 37 primary and 15 post-primary &mdash; are to advance to tender and construction later this year and in 2011.  A total of 51 school building projects &mdash; 44 primary and seven post-primary &mdash; are expected to appoint design teams <Col N="865"/>this year.  Approval was given for seven new primary schools to open in September 2010 in rapidly developing areas.  Arising from earlier school building programme announcements, 30 large scale projects &mdash; 23 primary and seven post-primary &mdash; are under construction at present.  A total of 27 large scale projects &mdash; 19 primary and eight post-primary &mdash; are due to commence construction during the first half of the year with a further 14 projects &mdash; ten primary and four post-primary &mdash; due to go on site as soon as possible.  Payments will issue on fees for other projects in architectural planning.  Depending on the rate of progress of the various projects in the programme, adjustments may be made throughout 2010.  These adjustments may arise in the context of the ongoing monitoring of the programme undertaken by the Department in the normal course of events.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister, Deputy Coughlan, announced the successful applicants for the 2010 summer works scheme last month.  A total of &euro;122 million will see major improvement works carried out in 1,490 primary and post-primary schools.  The summer works scheme covers projects in school buildings such as gas, electrical and mechanical works, roof replacement and repairs, window replacement, toilet upgrades, structural improvements and access works.  This record level of investment through the summer works scheme has the potential to generate work for in excess of 4,400 construction workers during the summer period.  The projects approved under the summer works scheme have been assessed as priority projects by the individual schools themselves and the capacity of schools to take responsibility for delivering small and medium-scale projects is a key component of the summer works scheme.  That is just some background information for the Senator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Now the answer begins.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Cregmore national school has a current staffing level of a principal and eight mainstream teachers.  The school also has the services of two learning support-resource teachers.  For the 2009-10 school year, the school has an enrolment of 220 pupils.</P>
        <P>In 1999 Cregmore national school applied to the Department for extension and refurbishment works at the school.  In 2004, the school management authorities were offered a grant of &euro;200,000 to provide two additional classrooms, which they accepted.  In 2005, owing to increasing enrolments, it was deemed necessary to provide four new classrooms and the grant aid previously approved was increased to &euro;400,000.  A new pick-up and drop-off area and car parking were also provided at the time.  In January 2009, the school was sanctioned an all-in grant of &euro;100,000 to provide an additional mainstream classroom and, in March of this year, the school received a further sanction of &euro;30,000 to provide a new resource room at the school.  The school has also been allocated &euro;12,287 under the 2010 summer works scheme for a window upgrade.</P>
        <P>The Minister, as Senator Healy Eames confirmed, spoke to the school principal shortly after the crash and is thankful that no one was killed or seriously injured.  Following the Minister&rsquo;s telephone call to the school, officials have been in contact with the school principal and have discussed the option open to the school management authorities to repair damage done as a result of this accident.</P>
        <P>An application was received for works to the school yesterday, Tuesday &mdash; it took a day to arrive in the post &mdash; and this is being assessed.  The Department has also advised the principal that the school may apply under the Department&rsquo;s emergency works scheme to have improvement works carried out within the confines of the school site to make it a safer environment for pupils and teachers.</P><Col N="866"/>
        <P>I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the assistance available to Cregmore national school, County Galway, following the recent road traffic accident at the school.  We will certainly continue to assist the school in its endeavours.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I appreciate that he acknowledged that the Department received the application and is assessing it.  What is the maximum amount of funding available under the Department&rsquo;s emergency works scheme?  As this is a developing and rapidly growing area, with respect, there is more than repair needed.  The health and safety expertise have now confirmed that new land is required to make the school safe.  Will Cregmore national school be granted priority treatment for funding given the threat to life at this location?  Will it be given a band 1 rating?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department would be reluctant to give out figures on the emergency works scheme owing to tendering issues.  There is not a policy of giving out the figures involved.  I assume the school will make an application under the emergency works scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot confirm that.  The application has been made for &euro;154,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>That application was only received yesterday and is being assessed.  I will mention to the T&aacute;naiste the concerns Senator Healy Eames raised.  The school has been advised as well that it could make an application under the emergency works scheme and we will see how that evolves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the Glenties primary care centre.  I raised this issue quite recently with the Minister in the House, given the concern that has been expressed locally about the lack of development in the provision of the Glenties primary care centre.  The current facilities available include a GP surgery which could be described as cramped, out-dated and in very poor condition.  It is in need of upgrading or a new facility.  The local community and the Glenties parish council deserve credit for the work they are doing to progress the issue.  In the past two weeks there has been a number of meetings to discuss this issue.  The local parish council and the local community are more than anxious to see some development of this project.</P>
        <P>I raised the issue on 4 March 2010 and I was advised at the time that while the HSE capital programme for the period 2010-14 was not finalised or approved, the project would be taken into consideration.  This was a bland response but it outlined the project was still somewhere on the radar.</P>
        <P>I am very disappointed with the HSE and the Department of Health and Children with regard to this project.  I am deeply disappointed at the lack of progress at a national level.  In qualifying that comment, I recognise the significant contribution of the HSE team in County Donegal, led by John Hayes.  The team has taken this project as far as they can bring it, in other words, tenders are now being sought.</P>
        <P>The project is of critical importance to the Glenties area and would provide facilities for the local GP, the public health nurse, the community welfare services, the community physiotherapy services, social work services, occupational therapy services, dietician services, learning <Col N="867"/>disability services, minor injuries clinic, the mental health services, physical and sensory disability services, psychology services and many other additional services.</P>
        <P>The site has been secured from the St. Columba trust, at a knock down price of &euro;59,000.  The HSE paid the money to the local parish and recognition must be given to the local community for providing the site at a mere &euro;59,000 as it is worth many multiples of that figure.</P>
        <P>Planning permission has been secured for the project from Donegal County Council.  The building is to be designed as a single storey composition.  It will facilitate the integration of primary care services and individual local public health services.  Even though I raised this issue quite recently I raise it again to keep it on the agenda.  I am of the firm view that the HSE at national level is letting down the people of Glenties and the surrounding areas by not progressing this project to tender.  While there has been a number of false starts this can be forgotten on the basis that the project could go to tender.  All the preparatory work has been done locally.  The project has been given stage five approval.  The next stage would be to go to tender.  In the current climate of value for money, many projects are receiving lower tenders.  This project should be allowed go to tender.  Given that value for money could be obtained, it is a win-win situation for the HSE and the Department and it is a win-win for the local community which has been waiting for the new facility for a long number of years.  The site is there, planning permission is available and we need the approval to go to tender.</P>
        <P>While the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, does not have responsibility for that Department, I hope we can see some form of progress this evening on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  At the outset, I reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing primary care services at local level.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s policy document, Primary Care, A New Direction,the Health Service Executive is refocusing its services to give people direct access in the community to multidisciplinary teams, including general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, physiotherapists and occupational therapists.  This policy is designed to maintain people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, decrease hospital attendances and facilitate early hospital discharge and supported care at home.  The HSE plans to have 530 primary care teams and 134 health and social care networks developed by 2011.  Additional funding of &euro;52 million has been provided since 2002 for the development of primary care teams.  At the end of March 2010, there were 236 teams holding clinical team meetings on individual client cases and involving GPs and HSE staff.  In addition, a further 21 teams are holding clinical team meetings without GP participation.  A total of 3,414 staff have been assigned to teams.  Some 875 GPs are involved in the operation or development of teams.  As well as reassigning staff from primary, community and continuing care services to work in primary care teams, the HSE also intends to redeploy a significant number of staff from acute hospitals and corporate functions into the community.</P>
        <P>With regard to the development of a primary care centre in Glenties, the HSE has submitted its draft capital plan which sets out its capital investment proposals over the period 2010-14.  Consultations are ongoing between the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and the Department of Finance.  Details of the developments included in the plan will be published following its approval.  I hope the Senator will appreciate that the plan cannot be announced until it is approved.  However, his intervention this evening is timely.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I appreciate he is not in the Department of Health and Children.  However, I must put it on the record of the House that I am very disappointed at the Department&rsquo;s response on this issue.  The lack of progress <Col N="868"/>is annoying, to say the least.  This is exactly the same response I received when I raised the issue on 4 March and it does not come close to meeting the mark from my point of view unless the Department comes forward with some form of a substantive response.  I have been liaising with HSE officials on this issue since Christmas.  Obviously we must wait for the plan to be approved but the local community deserves to see some form of urgency with regard to this issue.  I am disappointed with the response of the Minister for Health and Children and her Department.  I will be working with the local community to bring about the required response.  A local community which lacks these facilities should not have to wait until a fatality occurs due to the lack of services.  This is no reflection on Deputy Haughey as he has other responsibilities but I am disappointed with the response.</P>
