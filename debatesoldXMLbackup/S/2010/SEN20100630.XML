	<P>I have received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure the entire &euro;378,000 required for pipe replacement purposes in Magheroarty, County Donegal is made available to the local authority as a matter of urgency in order that the necessary works can be carried out.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Ellis of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reason for the delay in progressing the care unit in Ballinamore, County Leitrim by the HSE.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to allow a travel pass to be transferred from a mother to a son (details supplied) who suffers from type 1 diabetes and has to attend consultant appointments in Dublin on a monthly basis.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the timescale for the promised upgrading of the meteorological service radio station at Malin Head, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to increase the extracted area of quarries to 5 hectares to enable compliant and legal small quarries to remain viable.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the provision of rest areas on major routes and motorways.</P><Col N="706"/>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Doherty, Ellis, McFadden, Keaveney and Healy Eames as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Doherty, Ellis and McFadden and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Buttimer, as the Minister for Transport has no official responsibility in the matter.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="707"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a little dictatorial of the Leader.  He runs the business of this House in a most disgraceful manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please, I call Senator Coffey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak to his leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I do not have a leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is obvious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Second, I am sure that Senator O&rsquo;Toole will give Senator Cassidy plenty to think about when he speaks as our group&rsquo;s representative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please.  I call Senator Coffey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is quite obvious that the ordering and scheduling of legislation in this House this week and next is both condensed and rushed.  This is a direct result of not sitting a couple of weeks ago when Members had the opportunity, as they had an entire week off.  Members on this side of the House sought the continuation of order and business in the Seanad but this was refused by the Leader and this is the result.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I was happy to be part of an Oireachtas delegation that met a delegation from the Australian Parliament in Leinster House.  It is clear that Australia&rsquo;s economy has not been hit to the same extent as has other countries.  The delegation was directly asked the reason Australia has survived the international recession to a large degree.  First, Australia has, and always has had, a strict banking regulatory regime.  Second, their budgets have introduced fiscal stimulus into their economy through the use of infrastructure projects to help to create and to sustain employment.</P>
        <P>I suggest these are similar policies to those the Fine Gael Party has been submitting to the Government for consideration over the past two years.  I note Fianna F&aacute;il Members have tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion this evening regarding a positive step.  While I will give credit where it is due, this measure again was suggested by the Fine Gael Party.  I refer to an initiative whereby PRSI breaks would be given to employers to take on employees.  Although Fine Gael suggested this two years ago, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are only implementing it now.  Faster responses to the challenges posed by unemployment and recession are required from the Government.</P>
        <P>In addition, last week I asked for a debate on youth unemployment specifically but was dissatisfied with the response I received from the Leader.  While Members are running out of time in this session, I will ask again.  A total of 56,000 students sat their leaving certificate examinations last week and it is to be hoped that most of them will enter third level education.  However, many people will graduate from such education this year with no real employment prospects, other than emigration, which no Member wishes to see.  A man who has three adult children in his house, all of whom are graduates with professional qualifications, contacted me recently.  He is in anguish and is concerned about their mental health and this must be of concern to this House.  I appeal to the Leader and to the Government to consider the issue of employment in respect of those who are under 25 and to come up with some ideas or plans that will return them to the workplace.  They are educated, talented and have something to <Col N="708"/>offer.  Local authorities and State agencies could take them on in internships.  Similarly, there are schools and community development projects that could be developed.  We must begin thinking about and implementing such measures fast, before the nation as a whole becomes demoralised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On the point raised by the Leader and my colleague, Senator Norris, during the earlier <i>contretemps</i>, had the House been sitting two weeks ago at least Members would not have had these problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am aware of all the external pressures, the Leader will note it was my view at that time that Members should sit and I changed my own arrangements three times to accommodate this.  This is the reality in respect of where we are going.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the issue of the single Bill on today&rsquo;s Order of Business but the fact that over the next two or three weeks, Members face great congestion.  I note the Leader shares this view but still it does not make life easier for Members who are trying to organise themselves to deal with the business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Moreover, Senator O&rsquo;Toole did not agree to this on behalf of our group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not the Senator&rsquo;s leader so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the question of where we are going, Members need to have time in which to tease out matters.  This really is the issue and the congested nature of the next ten days will make it highly difficult to do business.</P>
        <P>On the issue raised by Senator Coffey, I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to extend the Luas project and to connect the Luas lines and the entire inner city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is of great importance to take on those people who would wish to push us back into the dark ages.  If one considers the points expressed by the United States at the G20 and G8 meetings over the weekend on the importance of maintaining confidence in building and investment projects, this proposal is good in all sorts of ways.  Socially, it is highly attractive for the people of Ireland and for the people of the capital in particular.  Commercially, it is highly attractive to those who run businesses and from an infrastructural prospective, it is essential.  Moreover, Members on all sides agree on this point and Garret FitzGerald once devoted an entire television programme to explaining the daftness of not connecting the two Luas lines during their original construction.  Moreover, my colleague, Senator Norris, has made this point many times in this House.</P>
        <P>This is not a political issue and Members should stand together to make the point that this is an investment that also will have employment opportunities.  Moreover, it is commercially clever enough, in that it is a public private partnership and the Government will not be obliged to put its hands in this pocket until considerably later.  These are attractive measures that Members should welcome and this point should be conveyed to the Minister.  While Members <Col N="709"/>may have difficulties with aspects of the details of the project, as a general principle this needs to be done, should have been done previously and certainly it is highly welcome that the Government now has committed itself to so doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add my voice to those who have been critical of the last-minute change in the Order of Business.  It is most unsatisfactory that Members order of their business in such a chaotic manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It again emphasises the need for further debate on Seanad reform.  Any such debate must consider both the structures of the Seanad but also the manner in which Members organise their business.  I note that the former Minister, Michael McDowell, has stated publicly that he has moved from being an abolitionist with regard to the Seanad to being pro-reform of the House.  Members must consider the means of reform and how best to order their business in order that they deal with more legislation.  All Members would welcome this and would welcome having more time to deal with legislation in an orderly fashion.  Certainly, today&rsquo;s Order of Business strikes me as being unduly rushed in respect of dealing with the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill and the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill.</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on crime and on prisons in light of the horrific shootings in Dublin on Monday last.  While Members have debated legislation on organised crime in the recent past, a broader debate is required on how to deal with crime in a rational fashion, that is, in a manner that addresses the difficulties in prosecuting and investigating organised crime, rather than with the knee-jerk reaction of some commentators who have argued for the throwing out of the jury system, greater use of special courts and so on.  I note the Director of Public Prosecutions has not referred organised crime cases to the Special Criminal Court and perhaps Members should consider more supports for juries and better ways of dealing with crime.  In addition, prisons should be examined because it is clear that a massive overcrowding problem exists therein.  Far too many people are being sent to prison for short sentences for non-violent offences and groups such as the Irish Penal Reform Trust have offered some highly constructive ways of diverting offenders in order that jails can be freed up and used for those who are engaged in the most serious crimes, in violent crime and in organised crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>First, along the lines referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I equally warmly welcome the application for the railway order for the DART twin tunnel underground from East Wall to Inchicore.  This application and other transport measures, such as that mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, will greatly assist commuters in the Dublin area.  I ask the Leader to obtain from the Department of Transport their timelines and schedules for public transport infrastructural works such as the metro, the DART underground and the connecting of the green and red Luas lines mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  Such information should include the entire question of public transport connectivity and integration, which of course includes the introduction of a single fare for use on all such public transport services.</P>
        <P>If possible, I also ask the Leader to arrange for a progress report from the Minister for Finance on the NAMA process.  I understand that NAMA&rsquo;s aims are twofold.  First, it is to reduce construction debts and assist the financial institutions to recapitalise and second it is to work with developers over a ten-year period to find suitable work-out solutions on the various sites.  I was pleased to read in a newspaper today that one such project in Tallaght was mentioned.  I seek to find out whether Members can learn of progress in respect of the NAMA process, of which I am highly supportive.  I understand many of the people concerned have the <Col N="710"/>necessary financial expertise to assist.  I would very much like to receive a progress report on the work-out solutions proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the serious rise in the incidence of suicide, as documented in the report yesterday, and ask the Leader for a debate on the matter.  Perhaps we could include it in a debate when the Minister for Health and Children comes to the House.  Funding for suicide prevention measures has been cut dramatically.  There has been a 24% increase in the incidence of suicide.  Last year 424 people died by suicide and to date this year the total is 527.  There is a clear link between unemployment and the recession&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;and how people are able to conduct and manage their lives due to not having a job and job insecurity.  I urge Members to participate in the suicide ASIST programme which is useful.  It is a suicide first aid course.  I have done it and would highly recommend it.  One is equipped to deal with people.  In our daily work we meet many people who are down on their luck.  One could ascertain the signs, help people and give them encouragement.  I urge the Leader to highlight the matter with the Minister and ask that funding not continually be cut for mental health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is welcome that the Minister has published the legislation dealing with sunbeds.  We should consider other preventive health measures that could be taken.  As part of the programme for Government there was to be an annual health check for everyone in the country.  Prevention is better than cure.  It is less expensive to deal with people when diseases or illnesses are detected early.  One&rsquo;s mental health should be included in the annual health check.  There has been much controversy in recent days and probably will be in the coming days on the priorities set within the programme for Government.  The health initiative should be very much to the fore.</P>
        <P>In the context of the legislation dealing with sunbeds, a few of us have a good colour because of the recent sunny weather.  It is important, however, that we take preventive measures to look after our skin between now and the end of the summer.  The legislation is even more important, given that one can use totally unregulated sunbed providers.  One might have exposure to a sunbed for a few minutes while waiting to be served with a DVD.  It has been proved that in many instances there is such a lack of regulation that three times as much radiation is given off than in an average X-ray.  Therefore, it is important that the legislation is dealt with early in the next term.  I ask the Leader to bring it to the attention of the Minister that we would be more than delighted to address the issue of sunbeds and also the preventive measures to be encompassed in the promised health check which should include one&rsquo;s mental as well as physical health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I wish to comment on the ordering of business today.  I find it very difficult to operate professionally when we witness this kind of thing.  On the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, it is clear from the Order Paper that the Order for Second Stage is to be taken.  Without notice, we are suddenly told all Stages will be taken.  Senator Cassidy said I should ask my leader about the matter.  The implication is clear, that he had agreed to this.  However, we do not have a leader but a representative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very misleading.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="711"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I made that clear.  I asked Senator O&rsquo;Toole, our representative, about the matter and he said nothing whatever had been agreed.  When I pointed this out to the Leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order Paper only shows the Stage a Bill has reached.  It is a matter for the Leader to order business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I was talking about the way in which the Leader had dealt with the matter.  The Cathaoirleach said, very disingenuously, that I did not have a leader.  I never used the word &ldquo;leader&rdquo;.  We have a representative.  I will certainly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I know Senator Ross thinks he is.  I know he thinks he represents the Church of Ireland as well.  It would be very interesting to see if he ever attended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator say the Cathaoirleach had used the words &ldquo;your leader&rdquo;?  It was not me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg your pardon.  No, it was the Leader.  That was simply muddying the water.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the fact that the principle of the motion on the situation in Uganda and Malawi has been generously accepted by the Government side.  There has been a slight amendment to the wording.  Will the Leader provide time for a debate on it since it has been unanimously agreed to by Members of the House?  I gather it will be an all-party motion.  Perhaps the names of all Members could be added to it.  Given that there is unanimous agreement, the matter could be disposed of in half an hour or an hour.  I had a meeting with the bishop from Uganda who appealed desperately for such support and resolution.  He is a man of extraordinary honour.  For supporting the rights of gay people in Uganda he has been turfed out of his job, house and everything else.  He is a married man with ten children.  He is one of the most remarkable Christians I have ever met and deserves our support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my colleagues on the other side, I welcome the fact that an integrated travel system will eventually be provided in Dublin.  It is imperative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Eventually.</P>

	<P>Yes, eventually.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>The only thing I will say to Senator Buttimer is that we will soon have to get a silencer for him because whenever some of us rise to speak he has to jump up after us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please, Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

	<P>You are just like a turkey cock.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should speak through the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew Senator Ellis would get embarrassed.</P>

	<P>In the past month to six weeks I have raised the matter of discharges from treatment units for one-off rural houses where there are no guidelines from the Department and the EPA, both of which stated they were not in a position to do anything about the matter.  I am delighted that the Department has now informed me that it will be in a position to issue guidelines at the end of September or the beginning of October.  This will help to alleviate the problem we have all experienced in rural areas with one-off houses and the discharges from them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am anxious that the Leader will spell out for us what he proposes to do in the next two or three weeks.  We have had an admirable practice of not taking more than one Stage of a Bill, especially of not taking all Stages together.  I do not say that is what the Leader had in mind, but there is concern that there will be congestion.  We do not wish to see a kaleidoscope, so to speak, in the final weeks.  As we have always been anxious to do, let us have sufficient time to debate matters.</P>
        <P>Last week I asked the Leader about Dingle, but he did not give me an answer.  It is a long time since the people of Dingle spoke in the plebiscite.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, gave a commitment.</P>

	<P>I know.  I am here every day, too, and very much respect Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I agree with the remarks of Senators Coffey, O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik and Norris.  The Leader must tell us when the Dublin mayoralty Bill will be brought before the House.  It is supposed to be included in the list of Bills to be taken.  The people of Dingle are still waiting.  It is years since the matter was decided.</P>

	<P>Today I am not asking that any item be included in the agenda because it will be condensed between now and the end of the session.  However, I ask that at the beginning of the next session we have a long debate on Seanad reform.  There has been much discontent in the House in the past two sessions and it starts on the Order of Business.  At times we are told the ordering of business depends on whether a Minister can attend in the House, but I do not know whether that is a sufficiently good answer.  In the first week after we return in September or October we should have a long debate on Seanad reform, starting with the Order of Business and the structure of the Chamber.  I support Senator Bacik who has also asked for a debate on the issue.  I hope the Leader will grant permission to have such a debate on one of the first sitting days after the summer recess in order that we would at least know what the structure was and how we would do our business in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s call for a debate early in the next session on the banning of sunbeds.  In recent days we have all become aware that there is about to be a public debate on the slapping of children by their parents as a form of correction, but we should really focus on and debate the use of sunbeds by children.  There are parents of girls as young as seven and eight years who bring them to sunbeds in order that they will have a proper tan in receiving their first Holy Communion.  Children getting ready to be confirmed are also exposed and subjected to sunbeds.  I use the words &ldquo;exposed and subjected&rdquo; because a young child does not know the damage ultraviolet rays emitted by a sunbed can do to her young skin.  One would imagine parents should be more responsible in what they are exposing <Col N="714"/>their young children to.  The Minister for Health and Children will be in the House immediately after the Order of Business.  If the short Bill we are to deal with next is passed quickly, we might be able to have a word with her and ask her to ensure she will attend a debate on the use of sunbeds early in the next term.  The subject merits a lot more debate than the issue of correcting children by slapping them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in asking the Leader to outline the schedule for the next two and a half weeks.  It is important that we have a clear understanding of it.</P>
        <P>My question to the Leader is based on the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling this morning which I respect on my Adjournment matter.  Did the Cathaoirleach declare that my Adjournment matter was out of order on the basis that the Minister for Transport had no official responsibility for the provision of rest areas on major roadways and motorways?  Who is responsible in government?  The Minister for Transport is supposedly the person in charge, yet he has no responsibility.  The Leader is in charge of ordering business in the House, but he said this morning that he had no responsibility and that it was a matter for the leaders.  The Green Party, including the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, now has no responsibility for anything other than banning stag hunting.  Why did the Minister not accept amendments to the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill?  It is clear, on the basis of the comments of the Chief Whip in the D&aacute;il and the Minister, that there will be amendments made to the Bill in the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>Deputy Cowen has said he was not responsible for the collapse in the banking sector and the economic meltdown, yet he has held the positions of Minister for Finance and Taoiseach.  Is the Government in complete denial and not in charge at all?  Is it a dream and is everybody else at fault for the problems?  Who is in charge in this House?  Is it the Leader?  Is the Taoiseach in charge of the country?  If not, let us call a general election.</P>

	<P>I welcome the report issued today stating the Government will intervene in the matter of personal debt.  I welcome, in particular, the provision whereby the Government will preclude banks from preventing customers from continuing with tracker mortgages when renegotiating.  That is a good intervention.  We have had many on the issue in the House.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will there be a definitive announcement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>These are very important issues.</P>
        <P>The Government is seeking to prevent banks from charging penalty interest to those who, because of the unprecedented economic downturn in the past couple of years, are in arrears and unable to meet their commitments and covenants with the banks.  That is very much to be welcomed.  Many Members on all sides have spoken about taking a balanced and holistic <Col N="715"/>approach to these matters.  It is essential to rescue the banks from the predicament they have got themselves into, thus requiring us to rescue the economy.</P>
        <P>A report issued today states there has been a 25% increase in the number of suicides and that the increase is attributable to the difficulties in which people find themselves because of the economic downturn.  I very much welcome the approach of the Government and hope all sides will do likewise.  I ask that the Minister be invited to the House to discuss the issue.  Perhaps we can make suggestions on what can be done in order that people will become hopeful and pass through this cycle into better times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The outgoing governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. John Lonergan, is on record as saying his one regret is that he did not refuse to accept new prisoners when Mountjoy Prison was full.  The only solution the Government has to overcrowding is to release prisoners early.  That seems to be what it is doing.  Up to one in four prisoners was released prematurely in the past year or so.  This has dreadful consequences for victims, society and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The system of justice is breaking down.  Prison overcrowding will have to be addressed properly.  Senator Bacik and I have asked on numerous occasions in the past two or three terms for a debate on the issue.  I again ask the Leader to accede to this request and have the Minister for Justice and Law Reform come to the House to discuss the issue which is causing stress among garda&iacute; and victims of crime.  People who are given a prison sentence repeatedly commit crimes when on temporary release, which is causing havoc in the system.  The problem must be addressed.  We were told when Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue was Minister that there would be a system of zero tolerance.  The revolving door is revolving all the time.  It is worse than it ever was and the problem will have to be addressed.  I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come in to the House and specifically deal with this subject.</P>

	<P>I welcome the statement by the National Treasury Management Agency that a &euro;1.5 billion bond which was issued this week has been three times oversubscribed, which is an indication of the international confidence in our fiscal position.  I also note that &euro;1.4 billion was raised in the domestic retail savings market through prize bonds, saving certificates and the new national solidarity bond, which we promoted in this House.  The national solidarity bond is taking off.  It has been a considerable success.  If we can raise more funding within the State for projects such as the Luas extension, it would be far more beneficial to the economy.</P>
        <P>It is an endorsement that we have &euro;16.4 billion already borrowed and available to the State.  It is an indication of the confidence in the Government by the international agencies.</P>

I note there is a number of very unrepresentative debates in this House and, indeed, in the other House, and that political lobbying is what is running riot.  We need to be very careful.  There are rules in relation to referenda in terms of the funding for political lobbyists, but in the case of normal Bills that are passing through this House there also needs to be rules because quite often debates are extremely unrepresentative in their importance.</P>

	<P>One of the assets each of us have in this nation is an Irish passport.  One is reminded of the value of an Irish passport by the two recent incidents, one in Saudi Arabia and one, allegedly by Russians, in the United States.  Some years ago I introduced a Bill here banning the sale of passports.  I was happy to see it initiated in this House and a Bill, not mine, later became law.  It is a reminder to us of how valuable the passport is.  Will the Leader draw the attention of the Minister to ascertaining whether there is a need for better controls on the issuing of passports and for better passport technology?  I am not sure there is because the passports that were used are probably out of date or at least are passports issued previously.  There is now a tight control in many aspects of technology to ensure forgeries are not easily made.  It is a reminder to us of how valuable an Irish passport is and how the use of an unauthorised Irish passport damages each of us in the future.  I urge the Minister to ensure that whatever controls are needed are put into place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already asked the Leader for an urgent debate on the impact of alcohol on young people.  I refer to a document sent to me by Mr. James Doorley of the National Youth Council of Ireland, Get &lsquo;em Young: Mapping young people&rsquo;s exposure to alcohol marketing in Ireland.  Young people&rsquo;s drinking of alcohol is a serious issue in this country.  The figures produced in the research show that up to 37% of boys between the ages of 15 and 17, up to 41% of girls between the ages of 15 to 17 and up to 12% of girls between <Col N="718"/>the ages of 12 to 14 admitted to being drunk in the past month.  We got a promise in the programme for Government that the Government would bring in legislation to cut back on the amount of advertising of alcohol at sporting events for young people.  I have a serious problem with advertising of alcohol at sporting events and at music events for young people.  Young people, particularly young men, emulate their heroes who they see playing rugby, soccer, Gaelic football, hurling or whatever.  I really need to get the Minister urgently to let us know if she intends to deliver the legislation on this.  There is evidence that when people start to drink early as children and young people, their brains are seriously damaged.  They end up getting into trouble with the law, becoming addicted and many pregnancies occur due to alcohol.  I really want to get the Government to deliver on this exposure of young people to excessive marketing of alcohol at sporting and music events.</P>

	<P>Again it appears that a foreign nation has used Irish passports to pass off citizens as respectable and law-abiding persons.  The State wishes to have good relations with Israel and Russia, but we could not allow a situation to continue where Irish passports, which are universally accepted, would be abused in this manner.  It is something of a caricature to have the spy Murphy using an Irish passport with a Russian accent.  This is beyond the Pale.</P>

        <P>In recent weeks, there was a request in this Chamber for an apology for the economic situation.  An explanation was given and the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach dealt with the matter in an open and transparent manner, as requested by the Opposition.  In light of the statements by the IMF, OECD, EU and other commentators to the effect that the Government is handling the economy well, will the Opposition benches not do the country a service and leave time for the leaders of their parties to comment on how well the Government has handled the crisis?</P>

	<P>The House discussed Israel&rsquo;s abuse of Irish passports in murderous activities.  People were particularly appalled.  Senators Quinn and Hanafin have mentioned the issue of another Irish passport being used.  Ireland holds a particular status, in that we seem to be friendly with every country and every country is friendly towards Ireland.  One reason is that we never colonised another country and had no ulterior agenda in our interactions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>One could also state that Ireland has helped many developing nations.  Many Senators have raised the issue of Israel&rsquo;s use of our passports and, given that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, has been courageous where abuses in other <Col N="719"/>countries are concerned, I would expect him to report to the House on the responses Ireland received.  Some of Israel&rsquo;s spokespersons were arrogant when replying to the issues raised, which is not the sign of a friendly country.  After the summer recess, perhaps the Leader could allow for an all-embracing debate, not just on the specifics, but on the overall issue of security of passports.  If this situation continues, our international travellers will find themselves more scrutinised than previously, which would be a great pity.  The only way to approach the situation is to publicise our responses to the abuses.  Even if the replies are satisfactory, they should also be publicised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Coffey, O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik, Norris, Coghlan and Buttimer were anxious to know what legislation will be before the House ahead of the summer recess.  I remind colleagues that the details of which Bills and affairs will be discussed in the House are issued on the preceding Thursday.  On the first sitting day of each week, I meet the leaders of the various groups as a matter of courtesy and seek their opinion on the speaking times required for spokespersons and other Senators.  This is a good and open practice and I am grateful for the help I get from the groups&rsquo; leaders in ensuring the smooth running of the House.  Where Bills are initiated in the D&aacute;il, we must wait for them to be passed in the Lower House before discussing them.</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde and others referred to Seanad reform.  We should consider what we have achieved in our lifetimes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It used to be an achievement to have one or two Bills initiated in the Seanad every year, but we now initiate up to 30% of all legislation.  Like in the D&aacute;il, guillotining Bills was an old practice in this House, but they are not guillotined under my leadership.</P>

	<P>Under our Constitution, the Seanad is a distinct advantage for the people, in that they can feel safe in the knowledge that every line of every section of every Bill is discussed.  I thank colleagues for their great dedication through the years.  I also thank this Seanad for ensuring this is the case.  The House has achieved a great deal.</P>

	<P>I have been in discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, concerning EU scrutiny.  When the House returns for the autumn session, EU scrutiny will comprise the Seanad&rsquo;s entire business one Thursday every month.  I will discuss this with the group leaders and the Minister of State.  I ask those who represent this House in Europe for their help with the considerable amount of EU scrutiny work the Seanad will need to do in terms of the portfolios of Ministers and EU Commissioners.  I intend to invite Commissioners <Col N="720"/>to be present during our discussions on legislation that the House feels is of importance so that we can tease out our EU scrutiny role in the national interest.  These matters must be debated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coffey and others referred to how Australia and Canada are not experiencing an economic downturn because of their strict financial regulations, particularly on house loans and so on.  We can only learn from their experience.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Callely, I welcome the &euro;5 billion Luas project, the related activity, particularly in the north of Dublin city, the considerable employment it will provide and the public private partnership outlined.  It is a good deal for Ireland and the people in the north of the city.  As to the changes that will be made and the timeframe in respect of the public transport service, I will revert to the House and allow time for the Minister to update it on the proposals and progress to date.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik and Cummins called for a debate on crime and prison sentences.  I agree that the statistics regarding the one in four early releases is unacceptable.  I will see what I can do to arrange for a debate at the earliest opportunity, although a significant amount of legislation is before us for consideration.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris asked about No. 15.  Many of the leaders signed the all-party motion, which the Senator tabled for our consideration.  Signing it was a pleasure and it will be available to be put on tomorrow&rsquo;s Order Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we make provision for a brief discussion to pass it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I will allocate 30 or 45 minutes before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely referred to NAMA&rsquo;s progress and working out solutions.  I have given the House a commitment to ask the Minister to update us from time to time.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden and others referred to the increase in the number of suicides.  According to the latest figures, 527 people committed suicide in 2009.  This is alarming and one&rsquo;s heart goes out to the bereaved families.  I would have no difficulty in arranging a debate on this issue.  The Minister for Health and Children will be in the Seanad at least twice to table Bills before the summer recess.  Perhaps this matter could be brought to her attention so that we could see what funding is required.  I agree with Senator McFadden that this is urgent and needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senators Keaveney and Feeney discussed legislation on sun beds and health care for those who use them.  They also asked for positive measures in respect of mental health.  I have no difficulty with passing my colleagues&rsquo; strong views on to the Minister of State.  The Minister of State has always been forthcoming with his time in coming to the House as regards mental <Col N="721"/>health issues and I have always commended him in relation to the contribution he received in the budget and all he is trying to achieve in his portfolio.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney talked about the correction of children, slapping and the various issues that are being discussed in that regard.  I shall pass her views on to the Minister of State with responsibility for children.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis spoke about the EPA study as regards discharges from one-off houses.  I am pleased that the Senator has made progress in this area, particularly in relation to the serious concerns and the challenges.  I am glad that he will have the report in September.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan raised the matter of the Dublin mayoral Bill and the issues involving his beloved County Kerry, which he has to be complimented on.  We all support him every year by going there on our holidays.  I shall report back to the House in relation to the progress of this Bill, within the next few days.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Ormonde and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in talked about what we are doing in the Seanad and the useful work that is taking place here.  I have no difficulty in having this debated and discussed after the summer recess.  I hope that the Bill will make steady progress in relation to the Seanad reform proposals that were given to the Minister some time ago.  The other legislation had to take precedence, but perhaps this can now be given the priority it deserves.  In the event, we shall all look forward to the proposals submitted on behalf of the various parties being debated.</P>
        <P>I would say to Senator Regan that this House cannot direct the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as we all know.  The Cathaoirleach is already dealing with this in another forum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, to know that there was no political interference in the matter. </P>

	<P>No interruption, please. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Buttimer raised issues of concern he had on the dog Bill.  I note those.  Senators Walsh and Healy-Eames spoke about banking, matters affecting hard-pressed mortgage holders, and in particular the concerns of people with tracker mortgages.  I certainly welcome that, and they also dealt with the difficulties presented by additional interest being added as penalties.  This is completely unfair and it is unacceptable, particularly in relation to the demands of Members of the Oireachtas as representatives of the people who are funding the banks at the present time.  Anything to do with helping the hard-pressed mortgage holders, particularly those who are unemployed and are finding it very difficult for the first time in their life, is to be welcomed.  These comprise the future generation that we have to protect and assist.  All sides of the House are united on this and I certainly will pass on the strong views of the Seanad after the Order of Business. </P>
        <P>Senators Quinn, Hanafin and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; talked about the value of the Irish passport and noted how respected we are throughout the world as Irish men and women if we hold an Irish passport.  I certainly agree with everything that has been said this morning in this regard and will pass on the views of Members.  If the Minister wishes to update the Seanad on difficulties experienced with the Israelis involved in the use of Irish passports, I certain have no difficulty in making time available.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White called for an urgent debate on alcohol marketing.  The Senator outlined alarming and disturbing figures to the House this morning: some 37% of boys between 15 and 17 have got drunk in the past month; some 41% of girls between 15 and 17; and 12% of girls from 12 to 14.  These are shocking statistics being brought to the attention of the House this morning, and certainly this requires urgent action.  The Minister for Health and Children will come to the House on two occasions and this issue should be brought to her attention to see <Col N="722"/>how it may be dealt with in a responsible and urgent manner.  I thank Senator White for bringing this to the attention of the House.</P>
        <P>Senator John Hanafin stated that the IMF, the OECD and the various other respected organisations throughout the financial world recognise the way the Government is dealing with the challenge to our financial status in the world.  I certainly concur.  When we leave Ireland we find everyone is saying how good Ireland is at dealing with the issues head-on, and I should like to think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on Second Stage of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2010.  The Bill provides for charging modest fees in respect of prescribed items dispensed by community pharmacy contractors to persons who have medical cards.  It provides for a charge of 50 cent per item prescribed by a registered medical practitioner, dentist or nurse and dispensed by a community pharmacy contractor.  The maximum amount payable will be &euro;10 per family per month.  The charges are being introduced on foot of a budget decision last year to address the rising costs in the general medical services, GMS, scheme.  The scheme also seeks to influence demand and prescribing patterns in the GMS in a modest way.  We do not set out in the Bill to make the level of savings of the order of &euro;200 million and more which we are already achieving with regard to the prices of drugs and the cost of distributing and dispensing drugs.  Nor is it on the scale of the savings we expect to achieve in coming years by introducing reference pricing and generic drug substitution.  However, every saving and every contribution counts.  This charge should raise approximately &euro;2 million per month.  Every saving achieved by and for the HSE Vote will reduce, though not eliminate, the pressure on funding for front line services including hospitals, home help, home care packages, mental health and services for people with disabilities and their families.  Given our current financial situation, it is important that we take every step possible to provide public services efficiently, to limit costs to the greatest extent possible and to involve users of resources in better understanding of the value of those resources and their appropriate use.  We are doing this in a pragmatic way in the context of Ireland today, with regard to not only the national finances, but to our patterns of prescribing and use of drugs and the costs we face.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Almost 1.55 million people, or 35% of the population, have medical cards.  Payments to pharmacies under the GMS scheme increased from &euro;748 million in 2004 to &euro;1,279 million in 2009, despite a reduction in the fees paid to pharmacists from July 2009 and ongoing reductions in the prices of off-patent medicines.  The cost of the GMS scheme, including payments to pharmacists and general practitioners, in 2010 is projected to be more than &euro;2 billion.  The rate of increase, on average 12.5% during each of the past six years, in the cost of supplying drugs and medicines is not sustainable.  The number of prescriptions issued under the GMS scheme has increased by 4 million between 2004 and 2009 to more than 16 million.  The number of items dispensed during this period increased by more than 15 million to in excess of 50 million.  The average number of items per script has also increased from 2.74 in 2004 to 3.11 in 2009.</P>
        <P>I refer to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the amendment of section 59(1) of the Health Act 1970 which currently requires the HSE, Health Service Executive, to supply drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons with full eligibility without charge.  This is being amended by section 1(<i>a</i>) to provide that where prescription items are supplied by a community pharmacy contractor, they shall be subject to the charges as <Col N="725"/>provided for in subsections (1A) and (1B)(<i>a</i>) subject to the exemptions provided for in subsection 1(C).  Subsection (1A) provides that a person who is supplied by a community pharmacycontractor with a drug, medicine or medical or surgical appliance on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner, dentist or nurse who is entitled to prescribe shall be charged 50 cent per item.  It also provides that any variation in this amount may be determined by regulations subject to conditions set out in the amended subsection 59(4) of the Act, which I will outline.</P>
        <P>Subsection (1B) provides that the maximum amount payable by any person or his or her dependants in any month will be &euro;10.  In addition, provision is made for the HSE to refund, credit or otherwise relieve any amount paid in excess of the maximum aggregate amount.  Any variation in the maximum aggregate amount is to be determined by regulations subject to certain conditions set out in the amended subsection 59(4) of the Act, which I will outline.</P>
        <P>Subsection (1C) provides that two classes of persons will be exempt from the charges, namely, children who are in the care of the HSE under the Child Care Acts 1991 to 2007 and persons who are supplied with specific controlled drugs such as methadone.  The section also provides for the making of regulations to exempt other classes of persons from charges, subject to certain conditions as set out in the amended subsection 59(4) of the Act, which I will outline.  Prescription charges will not be payable by holders of long-term illness cards.  In addition, charges will not apply to persons who are covered by the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, that is, persons who contracted hepatitis C through the use of certain blood products.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subsection (1D) provides that, notwithstanding the contract between community pharmacists and the HSE, the amount paid to a community pharmacy contractor by the HSE will be reduced by an amount equal to the amounts collectable by that contractor in charges.  The amount collected in charges will be retained by the community pharmacy contractor.  Subsection (1E) provides for a definition of &ldquo;community pharmacy contractor&rdquo; and a definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; for the purposes of section 59(1).  Section (1E)(<i>b</i>) inserts a technical amendment relating to the existing section 59(2).</P>
        <P>I refer to the conditions for making regulations.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>)  replaces the existing section 59(4) and provides in the new 59(4)(<i>a</i>)(i) and (4)(<i>b</i>) that, in deciding whether to make regulations to vary either the amount of the charge per item or the aggregate monthly amount, the Minister will have regard to such of the following as is considered appropriate: information on the consumer price index, information on expenditure and the number of items prescribed to medical card holders, the medical needs and financial burden on persons who avail of the services and the necessity to control health service expenditure.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) also provides in the new sections 59(4)(<i>a</i>)(ii) and 59(4)(<i>c</i>) that, in deciding whether to make regulations specifying classes of persons to be exempt from the charges, the Minister will have regard to such of the following as considered appropriate: the particular medical condition, disability or medical needs of persons in that class, the number of the prescription items required in respect of those medical needs, information on expenditure and the number of items prescribed to medical card holders generally or in respect of the specific class, the necessity to control health services expenditure and whether the overall financial situation of the proposed class is worse than that of other persons who are charged for items supplied on prescription.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) also provides that the Minister may make regulations on refund, credit or other relief arrangements where he or she considers it necessary to do so.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides that any regulations made under section 59 shall be made with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 2 provides for Short Title, construction and collective citation with the Health Acts and commencement.  The Bill is part of a set of actions the Government has taken or is taking <Col N="726"/>to address rising costs in the GMS.  These actions include the introduction of off-patent price cuts, reductions in wholesale and retail mark-ups and the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in recent years to improve value for money in the area of pharmaceutical expenditure.</P>
     
        <P Just="Left">Off-patent price cuts have been implemented and wholesale and retail mark-ups have been reduced.  As a result of off-patent drug price reductions in February, the cost of prescribed medicines measured by the Central Statistics Office as part of the consumer price index reduced by more than 12% in that month.  Discussions are under way with manufacturers of generic medicines and lower prices for generics are expected to be introduced in September this year.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Despite these reforms, pharmaceutical expenditure continues to pose a challenge because of our aging population and increased use of medicines.  Further changes are required to secure a sustainable system of pharmaceutical expenditure while, at the same time, ensuring patients can continue to access necessary and innovative medicines.  On 17 June last, I published a report on the proposed model for the substitution of generic medicines and reference pricing.  Generic substitution and reference pricing represent significant structural change to the system of pricing and reimbursement of medicines in Ireland.  As more medicines come off patent, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing will ensure that taxpayers and patients will benefit from increased competition in the pharmaceutical market.  Giving patients more choice and promoting price competition between suppliers will help reduce the overall drugs bill without compromising the efficacy or safety of the treatment patients receive.</P>
        <P>Savings will be achieved by limiting reimbursement to the reference price, allowing patients to opt for less expensive versions of the prescribed medicine and promoting price competition between the manufacturers of interchangeable medicines.  The level of savings will depend on a range of factors, including the number of medicines included in the reference price system, prescribing practices, and the behaviour of manufacturers of interchangeable medicines.  The system will be introduced on a phased basis and, therefore, savings will be achieved on a phased basis.  An expert group will provide guidance on which medicines can be safely substituted.  Exemptions will be required in some instances for individual patients for clinical reasons, for example, if a patient has difficulties swallowing.</P>
        <P>Under the legislation, the maximum monthly amount payable is &euro;10 per family.  Payment of the maximum amount will only arise where a family receives 20 items or more in a month.  In 2008, just over 2% of medical card families had 20 or more items per month prescribed to them.  More than 35% of families had no items prescribed to them.  Almost 18% had one or two items prescribed.  It is expected, therefore, that only a small minority of medical card families will have to pay the &euro;10 per month maximum charge.  Based on trends in previous years, it is expected the prescription charges will yield &euro;24 million in a full year.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Fine Gael opposes the legislation, as we believe the introduction of the prescription levy will mean that some of the poorest and most vulnerable families and patients who have serious illnesses may have to go without their medicines.  The levy of 50 cent per medicine may not appear to be much but that will not be the case for many families, particularly those on low incomes.  The vulnerable in our society have been asked to bear a significant burden of pain, despite not being responsible for the banking crisis or the economic recession the country is experiencing.  From the point of view of social protection and caring for the most vulnerable, we will oppose the Bill.</P><Col N="727"/>
        <P>In addition, we oppose the legislation on health grounds.  Prescription charges were abolished in Northern Ireland in April this year.  Since 2008 prescriptions have cost &pound;3, prior to which the cost was &pound;6.85.  The Stormont health minister said on removing the prescription charge that, &ldquo;The move marked an end to the tax on illness&rdquo;.  Our Government is bringing in a tax on illness for the most vulnerable.  The Northern Ireland health minister said at the time the cost of abolishing the prescription charge would be met within existing health budgets and would not affect any existing health services in Northern Ireland.  He argued against such a charge on health grounds.</P>
        <P>I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s view on the deterrent effect of this cost on the most vulnerable and those with chronic illness.  Significant international research shows any disincentive for people to take the medicines they need should be avoided.  If there is a deterrent effect, people will end up needing more crisis care and inpatient or institutional care.  If diabetics do not take their medicines or those who are on a range of treatments for chronic conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other psychological and medical conditions, the outcome will not be good for them and they could ultimately cost the health service more.  Has the Minister examined the international evidence of the impact of a prescription levy?</P>
        <P>I refer to the Welsh Assembly report on helping to improve health in Wales.  This report found that there was no increase in the number of prescriptions dispensed following removal of the charge.  Clearly, this indicates that imposing a levy is not necessarily an effective way to tackle waste.  I agree with the Minister that waste, over prescribing and inefficiencies are significant issues and I accept she is examining other issues, such as those relating to generic products.  It is not correct that the first step is to opt for a prescription charge on the most vulnerable and on medical card patients.  For example, in England, the British Medical Association has long called for the abolition of the charge which it claims is &ldquo;outdated, iniquitous and detrimental to the health of so many patients by acting as a barrier to their taking necessary medication&rdquo;.  Why is the Minister going against the tide of international experience in this regard?</P>
        <P>She probably has spoken to representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation about the Bill.  They presented a plan to her last year, which they claimed would shave &euro;300 million off the State&rsquo;s drugs bill.  What progress has been made in this regard?  They said money could be saved by regularly reviewing patients to ensure they did not stay on expensive drugs for longer than necessary, establishing a system under which the State would only pay for drugs if they were going to be of clear benefit to the patient &mdash; that seems obvious but apparently that does not always happen &mdash; tackling the relatively high cost of generic drugs and by ensuring more generic rather than costly branded drugs are prescribed.</P>
        <P>Everybody has anecdotal evidence of drugs being much cheaper abroad than in Ireland.  That continues to be an issue and this raises a question about the influence pharmaceutical companies exert as opposed to people who struggle to make ends meet and who have a medical card but who will now be subject to a prescription charge.  It is easier to target them than the pharmaceutical companies.  Will the Minister spell out in her reply what action is being taken to address these companies?  Are they being held to account enough in the context of the challenges the country faces in reducing costs?</P>
        <P>I have had discussions with the Minister about breast cancer screening.  We have a superb system but the most vulnerable women still do not take up the screening even though it is free.  Low incomes, preventative health care issues and social factors often keep people away from the care they need.  International evidence, which we also discussed during the Minister&rsquo;s last visit to the House, highlights that higher incomes and better social circumstances lead to better health.  The people affected by this levy are under pressure socially.  This is a short-sighted decision, which may cost more in the longer term.  This is particularly true with regard to health <Col N="728"/>issues.  We ought to do everything we can to ensure those who are most vulnerable to chronic illness and the illnesses that arise from habits such as smoking receive the help and medication they need.  The Bill will act as a disincentive in that regard, which is the main point.  Given the pressure on people these days, if an elderly person must spend 5% of his or her income on prescription charges, it will become another disincentive to use the medication prescribed for them.  The direct adverse effects on health are a concern about the Bill.  The Minister is well aware that if patients do not comply strictly with their medicine regime, they risk medical complications which could require further expensive hospital care.  That cost might be greater than the money the charge will generate which, according to the Minister, is &euro;24 million.</P>
        <P>I have a number of other queries for the Minister, one of which always arises with regard to the HSE.  What will be the administrative cost of managing the scheme?  People will wish to know the answer.  According to the briefing notes, people will be able to claim back over-payments.  How will over-payments occur?  What systems will pharmacies have in place?  Will they require detailed administrative systems?  Let us say a person needs a prescription at the beginning of the month and needs more medicines later in the month.  They have paid the &euro;10 maximum charge and pay again when they get more medicines.  Will a costly administrative system have to be put in place to deal with the matter?  What number of staff will be required?</P>
        <P>Obviously, pharmacies will have to make their own arrangements, but in the case of the HSE, will extra staff have to be recruited to administer the scheme or are staff being relocated?  What exactly will be involved in the administration of the scheme and does the Minister have any costings?  One of the issues with the HSE, among many others, is that it has many administrative staff.  The Fitzgerald report issued last year showed that there were issues and a lack of clarity surrounding people&rsquo;s job descriptions.  Perhaps the Minister will outline what sections will deal with the scheme, the number of staff and the cost involved.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister had discussions with the Irish Pharmacy Union?  Pharmacists are opposed to the prescription levy for similar reasons to those I have outlined.  They are also concerned about the administrative task of collecting the levy and the change in the relationship between them and their patients and in the contractual relationship with the HSE.  What arrangements has the Minister made with the pharmacy sector?  There are people who just do not have the money to pay this charge and obtain their medicines and they might pressurise pharmacists.  There is probably no answer to how that matter can be dealt with, but it is a possibility.</P>
        <P>There is the question of reference pricing and tackling the cost of generic drugs which the Minister said could probably save about ten times the costs she is saving with the Bill.  The generic drug prescribing rate in Ireland is low in comparison with other EU member states which have generic drug prescribing rates in excess of 50%.  By contrast, the rate of generic drug prescribing in Ireland fell from 22% in 2000 to 19% in 2007.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm if she has the relevant figures for 2008 and 2009.  I do not have them, but the rate was falling.  That is very disappointing, given the efforts being made to increase the rate of generic drug prescribing.  In that seven year period it actually reduced rather than increased.  Following the actions the Minister has taken and the discussions she has had, did the position change in 2008 and 2009?</P>
        <P>The agreements have kept the price of generic medicines in Ireland high.  It is hard to believe but in some countries savings as high as 90% have been achieved on generic medications.  It just shows what is possible and the amounts of money involved if progress could be made on the issue.  Am I correct that legislation on reference pricing to permit generic drug substitution by pharmacists is due to be introduced next year?</P>

	<P>Is there any possibility that legislation could be brought forward in 2010 to ensure savings are made?  How will the Minister reduce the price of generic drugs?  How much will be saved through reference pricing?  What drugs will be excluded?</P>
        <P>The international trends and advice on prescription charges have not been taken on board by the Government in introducing these prices for people who are struggling to cope in Ireland today.  The Minister should be tougher on the pharmaceutical industry rather than taking this approach.  This target is far too easy and I am very concerned about the health implications.  If the Minister insists on persevering with this legislation which also gives her the power to increase the charge &mdash; therefore, this might just be the beginning &mdash; I urge her to consider other vulnerable groups for exclusion from its remit, particularly those with certain chronic long-term conditions that affect mental as well as physical health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and thank her for giving the House so much of her time.  I am also delighted to welcome the Bill which is a very workable measure.  It reminds me of what happened in my last term in the Seanad when the Minister promised reforming measures in the pharmaceutical sector.  This is a start.</P>
        <P>This is not a political point, but there is opposition to the Bill for the sake of it.  The main aspect of the Bill, on which the Opposition has focused, is the 50 cent per item charge.  I do not know what one could buy for 50 cent; I do not believe one could buy a bag of crisps with it, or that one could buy any food item for less than 50 cent.  I have the height of respect for Senator Fitzgerald and agree with many of her comments.  However, she has said that if one charges 50 cent per prescription item, it will somehow lead to people not taking or not being able to afford their medication, that subsequently their health will fall into disrepair and that they could die.  If that is what she is worried about, does she advocate asking the Government to give free food to people to ensure they will live and be able to feed themselves?  I do not believe she would do this.  It is worth pointing that out.</P>
        <P>This is a good Bill.  It is the start of the Minister&rsquo;s reform of the pharmaceutical sector, which I welcome.  She said 2% of families with medical cards had more than 20 items per month being prescribed to them, while 35% had no items, leaving 18% with one or two.  That works out, roughly, at a family having to pay perhaps &euro;2.50.  Considering the savings of &euro;24 million that will be made, it is a small charge that might cause some pain, but those who are most vulnerable will be exempt from it.  I have always found the Minister to have a heart, and she relates almost every measure in terms of the way it might affect her family to determine how it will affect families.  It is in her nature to know how people will be affected by measures she might introduce.</P>
        <P>On the category of people the Minister has exempted from the charge, it is right to exempt children who are in the care of the State, particularly with the Health Service Executive.  They will not be affected by this measure.  I am very pleased the Minister has exempted patients on methadone because as we have discussed in this House previously, anybody who has gone through the scourge of drug addiction and is brave enough to come off drugs and use methadone should be supported, and the Minister is rightly supporting them.  I smiled, however, when I read on the Irish Pharmaceutical Union website that it was rather critical of the Minister for not doing more and referred to its customers as vulnerable patients.  A little over a year ago I was very critical of the IPU when it closed its doors on vulnerable people reliant on methadone and older people who could not have their prescriptions filled.  That responsibility was put on the shoulders of the Minister and the HSE to deliver the service the private community pharmacies failed to deliver.  Some pharmacists had grave misgivings about the conduct of some of their colleagues but if the cap fits, wear it.  Now, when it suits them, they talk about vulnerable <Col N="730"/>patients but they were still vulnerable when the IPU was waving the stick and closing its doors to them.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated earlier that long-term illness cards will be exempt from the charge.  She might indicate when replying to the debate the illnesses covered by the long-term illness card.</P>
        <P>There is a cohort of patients, mainly palliative care patients, who have their medicines changed on a daily or weekly basis.  The Minister might examine that because as we are all aware, palliative care of any age group &mdash; young, middle aged or elderly patients &mdash; rightly pulls at our heart strings.</P>
        <P>The Minister might examine also the position of people in institutional or long-term community care who may find it difficult to meet that cost.  I do not know what 50 cent would buy but it is not an excessive charge when the Minister has outlined to the House the number of items being prescribed for patients in receipt of a medical card.</P>
        <P>The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but Senator Fitzgerald pointed out that Northern Ireland has lifted its charge on prescription charges but I believe that will now be reviewed, with the possibility of the charge being reintroduced.  If it is reintroduced in Northern Ireland I am sure it will be reintroduced in Wales also.</P>
        <P>I stated that I felt the IPU was somewhat high-handed when it referred to vulnerable patients.  Every patient is vulnerable.  The IPU was concerned also about the way this measure would work and the negative effect this charge might have on its relationship with patients.  That is being disingenuous because I cannot understand how it would have any effect.  I am open to correction but I understand this charge will be levied by a computer system the Minister has already put in place on which information is held on every medical card patient.  It will be done by computer rather than having a person in a pharmacy or manpower from the HSE take time out to do it.  The Minister might confirm when replying to the debate that there will be no cost to the pharmacy or the HSE, and that a computerised system will be used.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s plans regarding generic drugs.  More than any other time in medicine, patients now have the upper hand in terms of their own care.  The Internet has opened up the market greatly for patients, regardless of whether it is a good or bad thing.  If we complain of some illness or have been diagnosed with a condition we immediately look it up on Google.  Many patients visit their general practitioners armed with information they never had previously, and I am sure doctors wonder why they spent half their lives at college studying medicine when patients are almost telling them what is wrong with them.  However, I welcome the fact that when patients visit doctors and consultants, particularly those who do not have a medical card, they will readily prescribe the generic form of a drug if it is available.</P>
        <P>As we are aware, a pharmacist must prescribe exactly what is on the prescription.  The doctor has the right to prescribe what he or she wants but I was happy to hear the Minister say that after September she will ask doctors, in cases where a generic drug is available, to prescribe that or to write prescriptions in such a way that if the original item is not available, a generic drug would be given in its place if the patient agrees.  I look forward to that measure.</P>
        <P>I have spoken about this issue previously.  We were being health and safety conscience when we introduced a quota on the number of pain-killers that could be bought over the counter.  One is not allowed purchase more than 12 Panadol, Disprin or whatever in a supermarket or pharmacy yet I have seen and heard of medical card patients being prescribed 100 pain-killers a month on a prescription.  I am aware of a lady who went to clean her mother&rsquo;s house after she had passed away and found 600 Panadol.  I hate to think what could have happened if those Panadol had got into the wrong hands.  There was enough Panadol in the House to take the <Col N="731"/>lives of ten people.  That is where the waste is, and I support the Minister&rsquo;s Bill in trying to clean up what has been going on in that regard.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the introduction of prescriptions for generic drugs.  We can all go abroad and buy pain-killers for a fraction of the price they can be bought here.  One can buy 100 Panadol in France, Spain, Portugal or wherever for as little as &euro;2 but we pay &euro;3.50 here for 12 Panadol.  The Minister gave an undertaking when she took on the health portfolio that she would reduce prices and she has kept her word on that.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to the debates on the remaining Stages later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The Labour Party is opposed to the proposed charge as it represents hardship for people with long-term illnesses.</P>
        <P>Will the projected savings of &euro;2 million per month mean there will be a review of cuts to respite care, home help hours, special needs assistants in schools and home care packages?  A total of 467,926 people are aged over 65 years, with 8,959 in receipt of home care packages.  I question whether this proposed measure will have positive implications at local level because different areas of the country have differing medical needs.  For instance, people in some areas are more prone to chest conditions.</P>
        <P>I refer to the point made by Senator Fitzgerald.  Patients requiring medication may become reluctant to ask for the medication because of the charge.  Senator Feeney referred to the 2% of families with prescriptions for more than 20 medications.  The important word is, &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo;.  One has to allow for the fact that doctors, pharmacists and nurses can prescribe and no patient will be prescribed medication which they do not need.  Medications are reviewed constantly to take account of changing needs of the patient or as new medications become available.  If a patient requires additional medication because of a developing condition, this may necessitate a review of all pharmaceutical effects of his or her combined medications.</P>
        <P>This charge is a tax on illness and is an extraordinary measure.  How was the charge arrived at?  I have some questions about some of the aspects of the Minister&rsquo;s contribution.  A total of 80% of prescriptions are written for the branded form.  Will the Minister change this practice?  Drug companies make patent drugs to retain their exclusivity.  Will there be a change in manufacture?  I question why the end-users must pay this charge when this charge could best be levelled higher up the chain rather than on the people who need the medication.  A charge of 50 cent could easily be absorbed higher up the chain without affecting the people, the end-users.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald made the point whether there is an administrative cost to this charge.  I question whether it will involve form-filling and whether there will be a review or appeals system if people believe they have been unfairly levied.  Will the implementation of this charge require additional staff or will staff be relocated from other work?  This is what happened with regard to the cervical vaccine and the H1N1 vaccine programmes where nurses have been reassigned to implement these programmes and child developmental assessment clinics have not been held.  The moratorium on staff recruitment has prevented the filling of 120 public health nursing positions and is having a significant impact on primary care.</P>
        <P>I refer to subsection (1A) of the Bill:</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Subsection</i> (1A) provides that a person who is supplied by a community pharmacy contractor with a drug, medicine or medical or surgical appliance on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner, registered dentist or nurse (who is entitled to prescribe) shall be charged 50 cent per item.</P><Col N="732"/>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Will the Minister comment on the fact that where crutches are given to people requiring them and for which there is currently no charge those crutches cannot be used again by anyone else.  Will the Minister clarify why this is the case?  I researched the cost of a pair of crutches.  I could only find a price in England where they cost &pound;16.99 a pair.  I presume this would translate to &euro;50 a pair, given the difference in VAT and the fact they may be used on rough terrain here.  I know from personal experience that many households have crutches which cannot be used again.  It seems extraordinary that it this seems to be the policy not to recycle this genuinely reusable medical appliance.  For instance, there are currently three sets of crutches in my house and I would be very happy to bring them anywhere they are needed if there is a crutch amnesty.  I tried to return them but they were refused.</P>

I suggest there should be a more appropriate means of raising funds without putting a tax on people who can least afford to pay it.  This charge would be levied on people who are already at a disadvantage, even a charge of 50 cent.  This is not about the level of the charge; it is the fact that vulnerable people who are already feeling perhaps low or depressed or sick or just not well are being charged a charge which, rightfully, should not be levied on them.</P>
        <P>In my work as a midwife I am aware of the high costs associated with some treatment programmes, for instance, the treatment of endometriosis can cost more than &euro;700 a month.  I speak sensitively because quite a number of pharmaceutical companies are located in south Tipperary and they provide significant local employment.  I do not speak against companies but I suggest if the Minister is proposing to levy a charge on the end-users who are already suffering disadvantage, it seems extraordinary that this cost could not be charged elsewhere, by some means.  The Minister is most innovative in how she is able to broker agreements or disagreements so there should be some better means of covering this cost so that it is not levied against the disadvantaged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This measure may have an implication for prescribing practice and I agree.  Patients will know a drug with a different name has the same effect and qualified people can offer advice in this regard.  Has the economic cost of private patients in public hospitals been analysed? Has the role of tax reliefs been examined?  How much is being expended on the National Treatment Purchase Fund?  I await the Minister&rsquo;s response to these questions.</P>
        <P>With reference to crutches, I used this as an example.  I note that walking aids or commodes are often left in houses when the user has passed away or as a result of other changing circumstances.  As I do my clinics, door to door, I am very aware that many people could benefit from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate we are in difficult times and that we need to look at everything but a levy of even 50 cent on people who are the end-users is not the right way to go about it.  I acknowledge it is a small sum but for some people it is too much and there is scope within the system to influence a change in prescribing practices or the use of generic drugs instead of proprietary drugs.  We can review other waste in the health services.</P>
        <P>I am interested in what the Minister said about crutches because my house is full of crutches.  I am sure many people who worked in the health services, not just those in the same role as me, could advise the Minister of other waste in the health services.  Targeting vulnerable people with a charge such as this is not the way to go about it.  She would find greater savings if the HSE had not lumped together all the grades of staff, which has taken away from or diluted frontline services.  This has created an additional load and means that everyone in the HSE is proving they did not do wrong in the first instance.  There is good analysis of how the HSE is not functioning and it is mentioned in this House most weeks by Members on both sides.  The point is made by Members of all parties and none who have certain reservations about aspects of care and where quality is not met or a good outcome is not provided.  Much savings can be made in the HSE.  This charge is not particularly good for patients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill allows for the imposition of charges on medical card holders for prescription items dispensed by community pharmacy contractors.  The proposed charge will be 50 cent per item dispensed, to a maximum of &euro;10 per month.  The Bill allows for the possibility of higher charges in the future and lists two classes of people exempt from charges &mdash; children in care and methadone users.  It also provides for further exemptions in the future.  The Minister&rsquo;s intent is that this will be consistent with patient safety and continuity of supply of medication.</P>
        <P>I have admiration for the Minister for Health and Children in her determination to address rising health costs.  Most agree that the expenditure of nearly &euro;20 billion on health services does not provide a reflective service.  There are many areas where expenditure could be curtailed and this would not have an impact on the provision of services or take money from people on low incomes.  Let us not lose sight of people who qualify for a medical card and are deemed to be on low incomes.  Other speakers referred to these as the poorest and most vulnerable in society.  Now, we want to impose a charge for required medication.  Senator Prendergast expressed her view on crutches and if others have views on other areas, the Minister needs to clarify the safeguards for those who are not listed as exempt users in order to ensure consistency in respect of patient safety and continuity of supply of medication.  What safeguards are in place if a person has a medical card, is on a low income and is fond of a pint or a pound on the horses and cannot afford regular medication even though this will have an impact on his or her medical and mental well-being?</P>
        <P>The public is aware of the state of the national finances and looks at the performance and delivery of our health services when we speak of these issues.  The public has a legitimate concern that, on one hand, people are being asked to contribute more and, on the other hand, the question of value for money in the delivery of health services arises.  It is a legitimate <Col N="734"/>question and the public are asking the question.  I record the tremendous commitment of administrators, doctors, surgeons, consultants, dentists, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and all therapists.  Most give an amazing commitment and are dedicated to the delivery of services.  Most will also let one know of the shortcomings in the system and the need for improvement.  They can indicate where money can be saved and where improvements in services for patients can be obtained.</P>
        <P>For example, Senator Prendergast referred to the elderly.  The Minister has been down the road that I am currently on with my mother.  One asks why families are put under immense pressure where an elderly person is occupying a bed in a general hospital and has been assessed as requiring long-stay accommodation.  Why do so many family members have difficulty understanding what is happening to their elderly parent or relative?  People will jump to say that this is emotion but I do not believe it is.  I suggest the Minister creates a one-page document to make available to family members detailing the procedures.  The Minister referred to the holistic approach to the appropriate provision of care of the elderly.  The message is getting lost at some stage.  The families are put under pressure.</P>
        <P>One questions productivity and value for money in so many other areas.  Why are patients normally given the same time to attend a hospital consultant?  Some 30 patients all arrive at 10 a.m. and they complain about queuing and the lack of other facilities.  Where is the connectivity between the patient&rsquo;s doctor, the patient&rsquo;s regular pharmacist, the local hospital, the local HSE health centre, the regional HSE office, patient care, the occupational therapist, the social worker, the public health nurse, the home help organiser, the home helper and the family of the patient?  The vast majority of people regard connectivity in these situations as unsatisfactory.  This does not only involve patients and their families but also those working in the services, who are also frustrated.</P>
        <P>There is a major demonstration of positivity on all sides and we should tap into it.  It could have enormous beneficial consequences.  One simple suggestion is to increase the use of modern technology between service providers.  This could bring significant benefits.  The Minister knows my view on the HSE as a single entity of service provision.  I have covered that ground before.  There is a lack of confidence and demoralisation arising principally from a feeling that there is no connectivity between service providers and that the HSE is at a loss and unable to cope.  There are no insurmountable issues that should prevent us from realising our best effort in the delivery of health services.  I support reform of medicine supply and price.  The key is to achieve best value for money for patients and the taxpayer.  We need to have a broader debate on the current structures and agreements.  I am at a loss as to what these are but I know agreements and structures are in place between the Government, the Department of Health and Children, the HSE, manufacturers, wholesalers, the IPU, the IHCA and pharmacists.  This is what sets the cost of medication in Ireland.  Members will be aware that I had an interest in the pharmaceutical industry as an employee and I am delighted to record I brought one of the manufacturing companies which operates from Arklow to Ireland in the late 1980s.  I note that only four of the top 20 manufacturing companies in Ireland with a turnover of approximately &euro;100 million manufacture generic drugs.  Pharmaceutical companies have made an immense investment in Ireland, in the process providing huge employment.  I would love to know how all of this will be sorted out, in producing generic products, as well as continuing to attract the blue chip research and development activities of pharmaceutical companies to Ireland.</P>
        <P>I do not suggest I have the answers, nor do I suggest there is a magic wand with which one may resolve all the issues.  However, there is waste.  Senator Feeney mentioned the quantities of medications to be found in people&rsquo;s homes, while Senator Prendergast made a simple point regarding crutches.  The same point could be made about wheelchairs.  Moreover, the Minister <Col N="735"/>is aware of the provision of a tremendous service by the HSE, when a person who had been ill for some time with cancer was provided with an array of equipment and medications but who sadly died in January.  Members must again ask about the issue of connectivity.  They must ask about the best use of the resources available and where best value for money is being obtained.</P>
        <P>I do not wish Ireland to lose the aforementioned 20 pharmaceutical manufacturing companies which are creating blue chip employment and investing hugely in research and development.  They are the companies which have been identified as the ones we should be chasing to create employment.  While I acknowledge there is research and development activity in the generic drugs sector, it is not being done to the same extent.  All Members know how the system works; when a patent runs out, a company will jump on the bandwagon and create a generic product.</P>
        <P>While I wish the Minister well, I am unsure whether taking what could be considered as the low hanging fruit route is the answer to the problem.  Moreover, I do not believe the Minister believes this to be the case either, as she is aware of the bigger picture.  While I would love to come up with the answer, unfortunately, I am not in a position to do so.  The Minister is in such a position and this is the option she has chosen.  Given all the mechanisms and ingredients she might put on the table for consideration, I hope she will answer a fundamental question.  What safeguards will be in place for those who will be unable to afford the charge to ensure continuity of supply?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>More preventive measures such as this might save massive amounts of money.</P>
        <P>The number of items dispensed under the GMS and long-term illness schemes increased from 35 million in 2004 to 48.2 million in 2008, a very significant number.  Like other Members, I accept that we are in very challenging economic times, but a 50 cent charge per prescription item, subject to a monthly ceiling of &euro;10 per family, constitutes a serious expense for those who have absolutely nothing.  While the Minister expects to raise a sum of &euro;50 million in 2010 and &euro;25 million in 2011, Fine Gael believes the prescription levy will mean that some of the poorest and most vulnerable patients with serious illnesses may be obliged to go without their medications, despite what Senator Feeney said.  While the levy of 50 cent per item may not appear much to the Senator or me, if one is in receipt of a weekly social welfare payment of &euro;160 and must budget for everything from that small amount of money, it constitutes a great sum of money.  Senator Feeney should note that it can mean the difference between food on the table and medicine.  International research shows that any disincentive to take medicines should be avoided, as some patients inevitably will end up in hospital or in care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One parent families are seriously threatened in this regard.  I refer to the intention in the budget to cut the single parent family allowance when the child concerned reaches the age of 14 years.  Such persons are in the category most at risk in Ireland of being in consistent poverty, which means their basic necessities cannot be obtained.  They will forgo medicines either for themselves or their children.</P>
        <P>I accept there is huge waste and that methods must be figured out to avoid costing the Exchequer lots of money.  However, I note that in other jurisdictions the prescription levy has been abolished.  Senator Feeney suggested consideration was being given in the United Kingdom to the reintroduction of such a levy.  However, I find this to be strange.  As the levy <Col N="736"/>was only abolished on 1 April, I hardly imagine the authorities there plan to reintroduce it so quickly.  The British Medical Association has called for the abolition of prescription charges because it claims such charges are outdated, detrimental to the health of patients and, as I pointed out, act as the barrier to taking necessary medications.  I wonder why the Minister is going against the tide of international experience in this regard.</P>
        <P>As I stated, I accept savings must be made.  However, the assessment of Cochrane Collaboration, a United Kingdom-based organisation, is that charges do not reduce the cost of the drugs bill in the short term.  Moreover, some reviews and studies have shown that there are increases in admissions to accident and emergency units and hospitals because patients who cannot afford to take their drugs stop taking them entirely.  Consequently, this will have an adverse effect on people&rsquo;s health.  In particular, I refer to the health of patients on long-term medications such as those with mental health issues.  There is a psychological impediment in respect of such vulnerable patients, as a number of speakers noted.  They may stop taking their medications altogether.  Having worked in this area, I know this to be the case.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of the Bill contains room for exemptions.  In common with other Members, I ask whether the Minister intends to exempt patients with cancer or pregnant women.  Alternatively, a patient who has recently presented with diabetes and is being regularised may be obliged to obtain different drugs to establish a regime.  Will the Minister consider an exemption in that regard?  I do not advocate that one should support pharmacies because they are a well organised profit-making body, but last year their representative organisation introduced and suggested a great number of ways of prescribing generic drugs.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Has the Minister considered any of their proposals?</P>
        <P>The other question relates to pharmacies having to collect the money.  What will happen where a patient refuses to pay?  Has the Minister considered this possibility?  If patients exceed the figure of &euro;10 in a month, how will the amount overpaid be paid back.  How will the scheme be administered?  In a 12 month period the cost could amount to &euro;120.  What system will be put in place to refund any moneys overpaid?  The Minister tried to introduce a system to take back the medical card from the over-70s and now she is introducing a levy on prescriptions.</P>

	<P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to reference pricing and the cost of generic drugs.  Senator Feeney made a good point about GPs being mandated to prescribe a generic drug alternative, as should pharmacies, rather than the more expensive branded drugs.  I am in favour of monitoring repeat prescriptions.  People have massive quantities of medications in their homes which are returned when, sadly, a patient dies.  These can only be disposed of as, legally, one cannot do anything with them.  The monitoring of repeat prescriptions should be considered and GPs encouraged not to prescribe so many medications in the first place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know.  Sometimes it is important to look at what people are watching on television.  The episode in question was interesting.  The doctor was talking to a patient for whom he did not have much time and with whose views he did not agree.  He went to the canteen to get sweets from a sweet dispensing machine which he gave to the patient in a bag.  The patient went away extremely happy.  The use of placebos is well known throughout history.  They have an effect and work for many.  There is a tendency for patients to feel cheated when they leave a doctor&rsquo;s surgery if they have not been prescribed something.  If I am correct, that could to some extent be behind the Minister&rsquo;s thinking on the Bill.  I would be interested to hear her views on the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have talked to various people and heard differing views on the 50 cent levy.  I accept the Bill is not purely about the levy.  However, we should consider whether it will stop people from buying medications.  We must examine whether the introduction of the legislation will act as a deterrent to people who would previously have bought medications.  I do not know if that is the intention behind the Bill, but I suspect there is an element of such thinking behind it.  It is certainly a revenue-raising provision.  Some believe it will stop people from seeking unnecessary prescriptions, but the issue is whether it will stop those who need medications from getting them.</P>
        <P>There is an overuse of antibiotics, especially to treat viruses or illnesses.  We need to change our culture in this regard.  We must consider measures not only in terms of the financial considerations but also in terms of working with those involved in primary care to ensure doctors consider it acceptable not to prescribe.  People should be educated at school to the effect that it is not always necessary to take medicine to cure an illness.  The response to some illnesses should simply be going home, resting and taking care of oneself and perhaps having a nice cup of tea or TLC.  There is nothing wrong with a person being told by his or her doctor to go home, have a hot drink and go to bed for a few days and for the doctor to write a certificate of illness.  However, I would be concerned if the imposition of a 50 cent levy meant people who genuinely needed medication were prevented from getting it, but I do not believe that will happen.  Perhaps a review mechanism could be built into the legislation.  Being a responsible Minister, I am sure the Minister will do this.  The levy should be examined over time to see what effect it is having on patient care and whether people are struggling in not taking medication because the levy is acting as a deterrent.</P>
        <P>It was pointed out to me that a number of categories were exempt from the charge.  It might be more useful if that was a matter for the Minister to decide.  Other groups may emerge in the future which we have not thought of who could be exempt.  I favour expanding the categories of persons exempt rather than limiting them to the two groups referred to in the Bill and giving the Minister discretion in that regard.</P>
        <P>I was intrigued by the comment made by Senator Prendergast on crutches.  I am not aware that it is especially relevant to the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is related, therefore, in a roundabout way.  There is much waste in the health care sector.  In these difficult times we should consider ways to reduce costs.  That is one possible way.  We could improve the provision of wheelchairs.  The issue of prosthetics was raised with me recently.  It is my understanding there is a possibility that prosthetics will be imported from now on.  Work in that regard is ongoing.  It is important that the cost of prosthetics is kept down through increased competitiveness, of which the Minister is very much in favour.</P>
        <P>Overall, the Bill is an interesting one.  My main point is that a review of the effect of the measures proposed should be built into the Bill, perhaps in a year&rsquo;s time.  Members of the Opposition have suggested the introduction of the levy might prevent people who need medications from getting them.  Therefore, it is important that there be such a review.  There is a need for empirical evidence in health care.  I commend the Minister for being innovative.  She will continue to be so.  The provisions of the Bill are certainly worth exploring.  As such, I will be supporting the Bill.</P>

        <P>The prescription charge in the Bill will not make the healthy choice the easier choice, particularly for vulnerable groups.  We must remember it is doctors who prescribe, not patients.  Perhaps the Minister should target the doctors rather than making patients pay.</P>
        <P>Let us look at the facts.  I am basing all my points on evidence.  Thirty per cent of the population currently hold medical cards.  There will be a charge of 50 cent per item prescribed and a maximum charge of &euro;10 per family.  Those who will be most affected will be the vulnerable, including the elderly, patients with chronic illnesses, the homeless and people in sheltered accommodation.</P>
        <P>The Minister has justified the charge on the basis of the need to raise money and to discourage over-prescribing and the overuse of medication.  Although she is discouraging over-prescription and overuse of medication, it is the doctors whom she should educate and target.  Patients do not prescribe; it is doctors who do.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the effects on people&rsquo;s health if they stop taking medication.  Senator Feeney said 50 cent is very little.  While I accept that, it does depend on whether one is in one of the vulnerable groups.  One never knows what will prevent a person from obtaining his medication.  Consider what occurred in respect of warfarin, for example.  Warfarin is an essential blood-thinning drug for people with particular heart complaints.  Since the affected had to go to a general practitioner to get their blood levels checked, they did not do so.  The cost of going to the general practitioner mitigated against their doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are warfarin clinics all over.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Not in Galway.  Galway is unique in not having a warfarin clinic.  This is because of the glut and the need to get it into the community.</P>
        <P>The health promotion evidence is all about making the healthy choice the easier choice.  Cochrane Collaboration, an international drugs review body that assesses health systems and the effectiveness of drugs, found that introducing prescription charges reduces the cost of the drug bill in the short term.  However, it found that introducing charges for people on low incomes, and even high incomes, leads to a reduction in drug use for life-sustaining drugs.  These are the drugs that count, not the ones Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in referred to, which drugs would not be necessary if one simply went to the doctor, went to bed, had a hot drink and got some rest.  I refer to life-sustaining drugs for chronic illnesses, diabetes, asthma and psychological conditions.</P><Col N="739"/>
        <P>The Cochrane Collaboration report found that those with mental health conditions are more likely to stop drug use for financial reasons.  The Cochrane Collaboration is an international drugs review body that assesses health systems internationally.  It found there was an increase in admissions to accident and emergency departments, hospitals and nursing homes because patients had reduced their intake of drugs because they could not afford them.</P>
        <P>The Minister is imposing a charge of 50 cent in the short term but it will cost the health system more in the longer term.  Six years ago she said she wanted a world-class health system.  This is not the way to do it.  She will clog up accident and emergency departments further.  Her approach is not workable because there are no primary health care centres in the communities.</P>

	<P>We have heard that before.  I was involved in health promotion with the Midland Health Board from 1998 to 2002.  I was at that point involved in a review of primary health care units.  We still do not have one in Galway.</P>

	<P>The review also found that the failure to take prescribed medicine has a direct adverse effect on health and results in increased use of health care services and higher health care expenditure.  All my points show that the 50 cent charge is short-sighted and is merely a Band-Aid to a bullet hole.</P>
        <P>The conclusion of the Cochrane Collaboration review is that &ldquo;increasing cost-sharing may present a financial barrier to poor households for patients with chronic conditions who need high volumes of pharmaceuticals&rdquo; and that pregnant women, children and older people are particularly most likely to be negatively affected.  Harm is less likely if charging is introduced for non-essential drugs and if exemptions are built in.  There is some sense in bringing in the 50 cent charge for non-essential drugs.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously not introducing it for drugs that are life sustaining and drugs for chronic illnesses.  Has she considered this?</P>
        <P>The journalist Sara Burke states: &ldquo;In most European and OECD countries, there are some charges for prescriptions, but not for the poorest 30 per cent of the population.  In Wales, there have been no charges since 2007.  In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, certain groups are exempt from charges, such as people on low incomes, people with chronic diseases, pensioners, pregnant women, children and cancer patients.  In England, more than 85 per cent of the population is exempt.&rdquo;  Northern Ireland and Scotland are phasing out charges for everyone in the next two years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The British Medical Association chairman stated: &ldquo;Abolishing prescription charges is the fairest and the simplest option [...] if all patients could get the treatments they needed via free prescriptions it may reduce hospital admissions and costs for the health service in the long run&rdquo;.  While the Minister will save a certain amount for the Exchequer in the short term, she will impose a cost on the health system in the longer term.  Her record and reputation in the health system are not strong; they are notably weak.  Why do more damage and harm further her reputation and that of the Government?</P>
        <P>The amount expected to be raised through drug charges this year is &euro;42 million and it is expected to be &euro;52 next year.  Medical card holders comprise the poorest 30% of the population and increasing charges from &euro;100 to &euro;120 per month will hit those on lower incomes the hardest.</P>
        <P>The Minister says she wants to discourage over-prescribing, for which I applaud her, but I reiterate that patients do not prescribe drugs.  If one wants to change prescribing and dispensing <Col N="740"/>practices one must speak to doctors and pharmacists, not the patients.  This very point was supported in last week&rsquo;s article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> by Sara Burke.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well but ask her to think about those with chronic illnesses and those on low incomes, whose lives she may be risking.  That is what we want to prevent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Stop it&rdquo; is right because we are at the core of what the Bill is about.  It is about the imposition of a fee on people.  The Bill, its explanatory memorandum and the Minister&rsquo;s speech all state this.</P>
        <P>The charge is 50 cent i dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire.  The Members opposite, as former members of local authorities, will know well that what starts small can increase incrementally.  I remind them that the charge will be imposed on the elderly and the vulnerable.  Thanks to the policies pursued in the main by Fianna F&aacute;il, ably assisted by the Green Party and the former Progressive Democrats, there is a new poor in society, the middle class.  It is expected to pay for everything.  It is, in many cases, in trouble financially because of no fault of its own other than that it bought property at the peak and has lost jobs because of the financial crisis and the lack of employment opportunities in this country.</P>
        <P>We in Fine Gael have put forward a model called FairCare the basic principle of which is that the money follows the patient, but we have also advocated a role for pharmacists in the treatment of minor illnesses.  The bottom line here is it is about the safe, timely and efficient delivery of services.  In this case, I am concerned we are accentuating a divide in society.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister to a point that there is a need for reform and change.  I have no difficulty with that and I admire the Minister&rsquo;s bravery in many ways in what she is doing and trying to do.  However, this is an unfair imposition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listen to people talking about what is best for society and what is best for people.  I canvas four days a week and I meet people more than most Members of this House.  I say this not in an adversarial manner at all, even though I could.  I have seen women and men, predominantly elderly, making the choice whether to skip taking tablets.  They have shown me half tablets and quarter tablets.  I have seen them going to their general practitioners who, to their credit, have given them free samples&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>What?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because they cannot afford to pay for them from the pharmacy.  I have seen pharmacists giving prescription medication on tick or letting people pay back so much per week.  These are not living on Aylesbury Road.  These are not people living in big flash mansions or those who have vast amounts of money.  These are people who have worked hard and who are on pensions, such as retired teachers, who are struggling.  Is the Minister seriously saying here that we are making people make choices regarding their medication?  I agree with what Senator McFadden stated earlier, that we are frightening people and the Department is doing a bad job of explaining and communicating.  I fully agree with the Minister regarding waste.  I am with her 100% on that, but the way to avoid that is not to come in here with this prescription levy and penalise people.</P>
        <P>I listened to the arguments being put forward by the other side.  It is unfortunate the two Members opposite are here because I do not want to aim my fire at them.</P>

	<P>There is a responsibility on the HSE and I do not know if it understands the word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;.  This morning in this House I sought an Adjournment debate regarding the NRA and I was told the Minister has no responsibility and cannot come in.  I have sought Adjournment debates here regarding the HSE and I have been told the Minister, Deputy Harney, has no responsibility.  The line Minister, in the case of the HSE or the NRA, is either responsible for the body concerned or not.</P>
        <P>We speak of cutting costs.  God bless Mr. McCarthy, but he does not seem to understand the concept of society, which should be people centred.  Where I have a fundamental disagreement with the Minister, although I inherently believe she is an honourable, decent and caring person, is on the ideology she is pursuing which does not put the patient first, which does not put people first and which puts profit and reduction in expenditure before anything else.  I ask the Senators opposite if they seriously believe this Bill is the correct way to go.  How will we make assessments?</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware that every day of the week there is a reduction in the number of medical cards and in GP medical cards.  She might shake her head but I can give her a file of people who have had their applications refused and who are not millionaires or rich people.  I genuinely want to hear an answer to that because the reality is there are ever more people now being refused, not getting access to services and having to wait longer.</P>
        <P>I do not want to see this country having a dependency on prescription drugs &mdash; far from it &mdash; but we need to look at the implementation of reference pricing and tackle the cost of generic drugs, which Fine Gael states will save ten times as much.</P>
        <P>The Minister, despite her protestations to the Members opposite, states the Bill is the way to go, but it is not and no amount of statistics or spin can prove otherwise.  I am disappointed we are here debating this Bill.  Fine Gael will oppose this Bill and we will call a vote on Second Stage.  The savings are at a cost, which is quality of life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.</P>
        <P>There are three aspects to this Bill.  First, it is a significant attack on the poorest people in this country; second, it places an extra burden on the pharmacists; and third, it increases the workload of the HSE.  Those are the three areas into which I have broken up this Bill.</P>
        <P>No doubt it is an attack on the weakest and poorest in society.  The Government has stated over the past two years that with the financial crisis, into which it has led this country over the past 12 years, it would protect the weakest and the most vulnerable.  This is an attack on them.  To those people, &euro;10 is quite an amount of money.  Those people, in most cases, are hard done by in any event and they are the weakest and poorest in society.</P>
        <P>Second, it puts an extra burden on the pharmacists who must keep extra records and take on extra staff.  I would ask the Minister to state how this will affect their businesses.  Over the past year and a half, the Minister put her own views on pharmacy and pharmacists on the record.  They have been severely hit financially.  Some of them have been in a terrible financial crisis over the past number of years.  However, this places an additional burden on them.</P>
        <P>In addition, new regulations state that pharmacists must have interview rooms.  Some pharmacists throughout the country have premises with small square footage and to put in interview rooms will be difficult in some cases.  It would be okay for big outlets such as Boots but for small family-run pharmacists, who provide a significant service, particularly in rural areas and who know the people and know what they want the minute the come in the door, to have to <Col N="742"/>put in a private interview room will place another burden on them.  I ask the Minister to get whoever is responsible for this to have a fresh look at it because it is unwarranted in many cases.</P>
        <P>Third, the Bill puts an extra workload on the HSE to keep all of these records and go through all the costs and savings the Minister states will be associated with it.  Will it require additional staff for the HSE?  Will the HSE have to take on more staff or will it redeploy staff from within the Civil Service or the HSE?  No doubt it will involve a good deal of bookkeeping and record holding, and probably visiting pharmacists and going through their books.  That will require additional staffing.  I hope the Minister will not employ extra staff and that staff will be redeployed instead.  Several initiatives introduced by the Government in recent years have entailed expansion in the Civil Service and its various offshoots.  This places a sizable burden on the businesses associated with them.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us the Bill will not lead to further employment, but that staff will be redeployed.  We all know there is waste within various sections of the Civil Service, the HSE and other bodies.  I hope the Minister will outline the situation before we adjudicate on the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to respond to our debate on this Bill, the purpose of which is to impose a prescription charge.  As to the administration, a number of Senators seem to be under the illusion that a host of people in an office will go through various files to ascertain how to collect 50 cent.  All payments for items through the general medical services, GMS, are computerised.  If one uses a medical card in a pharmacy, this computerised transaction is sent to the HSE for payment.  The HSE knows how much medication every medical cardholder gets each month.  This is the basis on which I gave the figures.  The number of prescriptions has increased by 4 million and the number of items prescribed has increased by 15 million in recent years to nearly 60 million.  Notwithstanding our aging population, there is no correlation between these figures.</P>
        <P>Through computerisation, the HSE will know when a family hits the &euro;10 mark.  If someone goes to &euro;10.50 or &euro;11, it would be sensible to repay the amount every two months, for example, instead of sending people cheques for 50 cent.  We are discussing a computer transaction, so a host of people will not be employed at the GMS payments board or in pharmacies.  When someone with a medical card visits a pharmacy for medication, it is not unusual for him or her to buy something else as well.  The pharmacist is used to engaging with people.</P>
        <P>Last year, I was in the Seanad when we discussed reducing the wholesale margin and fees to pharmacies.  Members, including the Senators opposite, predicted that 300 to 400 pharmacies would close in the coming period.  I am happy to say there are more pharmacies now than there were before we introduced the changes.  This is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Some have closed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>A number are under pressure, but not because we are not paying them much.  By international standards, we are paying them a great deal.  However, many pharmacies, particularly in urban areas, got caught up in the property boom.  Some of them paid an exorbitant amount to enter a business that the health service cannot sustain or be expected to sustain.  I have considerable sympathy for those pharmacists, but that is a separate item from the manner in which the State reimburses pharmacies.</P>
        <P>Reimbursement under the GMS increased from &euro;748 million in 2004 to &euro;1.2 billion in 2009.  It is because of my great respect for pharmacists that there will be a regulatory body under the new legislation.  Until we passed the 2007 Act, pharmacies were effectively unregulated.  They operated under an Act that was 180 years old.  The pharmacy interests, particularly the profession, were beating down my door and the doors of many of my predecessors because we <Col N="743"/>needed modern legislation to regulate their profession, as they did not have the capacity to take action where there was inappropriate behaviour in the profession.</P>
        <P>The regulatory body has decided that pharmacists should have a separate space in which to talk with patients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>A good idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Pharmacy is unlike any other retail business.  Patients are entitled to engage on a confidential basis with pharmacists.</P>
        <P>I attended a recent meeting with Dr. Barry White, the new director of clinical care and quality at the HSE concerning the roll-out of new clinical care pathways.  Some 24 clinicians, all leaders in their fields, have been appointed to roll out a new clinical care pathway through which things will be done differently in their respective fields.  The money saved will be invested in new services.  The clinicians are a fantastic bunch, some of the best in the country.  Professor Peter Kelly in the Mater Hospital will lead on stroke, Professor Kieran Daly in Galway will lead on acute coronary syndromes and Professor Michael Turner, a former master of the Coombe, will lead on obstetrics so that we can have standardised care across the country.</P>
        <P>There will also be clinical leads at general practice level because we badly need protocols for prescribing.  As the House knows, 63% of prescriptions in the UK are for generic medicines.  In Ireland, the comparable figures are 18% on the GMS and 12% on the drug payment scheme, DPS.  There is no justification for the difference.  Pharmacists should be involved because they are an under utilised resource in the health care system.  They must be among the brightest in their classes to get into pharmacy school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>True.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They have considerable potential that we have not tapped.  Sometimes, we seek to include new professionals in providing services.  For example, I have provided for nurse prescribing in terms of X-rays and medication and for the involvement of nurses in the forensic examination of sexual assault victims.  These initiatives are greatly enhancing the role of nurses and make more sense, as nurses comprise 35% of health care professionals.</P>
        <P>The new legislation on generic substitution and reference pricing will provide pharmacists with the opportunity to substitute.  For example, if a doctor prescribes the branded name, the pharmacist will be able to substitute and will only be paid where there is an appropriate substitute.  That legislation will be before the House later this year.  While it will enhance the role of pharmacists, I want it to do more.  They could play an important role in the management of medication.  For instance, they are equipped to administer vaccines.  At a time when there is a recruitment moratorium and staff shortages in the public health care system, we need to avail of expertise in the most sensible way possible.  I intend to do so and we had a good meeting with Dr. White on these issues.  When one engages with professions about new services, people sometimes raise the question of additional money.  In this case, it must be a question of switching the money around so that it can be provided elsewhere.</P>
        <P>There are a number of exemptions and the Minister has the power to award further exemptions.  There are few places in western Europe, North America or Australia where co-payment is not found.  For many years, Senators told me there should be a small charge for going to a general practitioner.  Senator Feeney made an interesting point.  If we say that people will not take their medication because they must pay 50 cent and the amount is capped, it is like saying people will not eat food or drink water if we begin to charge for those.  This aside, there are a number of exemptions.</P><Col N="744"/>
        <P>As to the 50 cent, Colm McCarthy recommended &euro;5 per prescription, but that would have been too much.  A small amount would collect for us &euro;2 million per month.  Putting this in perspective, we were able to invest an extra &euro;10 million in home care packages this year.  Would it not be great if we could have invested an extra &euro;24 million?  Some &euro;12 million is not an inconsiderable amount, although it looks small alongside &euro;15 billion.  It is amazing what this type of money can do.  We will probably deal with this matter on Committee Stage.  Senator Healy Eames cited the literature, but literature is like statistics, in that there is plenty around to support both sides of an argument.  The literature equally shows that people do not reduce essential medication and that the charge will change prescribing behaviour.  Clinicians will take into account costs in respect of the number of items being prescribed.  There is no doubt that we have a high level of antibiotic prescribing.  This has contributed to our high levels of MRSA and other health service-acquired infections in recent years in comparison with the Netherlands, where the level of prescribing is relatively low.</P>
        <P>Everyone on a long-term illness card will be exempt, including diabetics, people with mental illness, people aged less than 16 years, people with a mental handicap, haemophiliacs and people with cerebral palsy, phenylketonuria, PKU, epilepsy, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson&rsquo;s, acute leukaemia and so on.  I will also exempt children in care and people on methadone.  If the evidence suggests we should exclude other categories, I will be more than happy to do so.  We will discuss homeless people later.  It is not for me to be to be able to distinguish when somebody has a medical card whether he or she is homeless.  There are practical difficulties around some of the amendments that have been tabled.</P>
        <P>On crutches, I have had discussions recently with the HSE around how appliances may be used.  Obviously, they have to be sterilised.  In some appliances there are safety issues, as well as the question as to whether the manufacturer will guarantee them if they are passed on.  We are trying to address these issues because every single saving matters.  Not alone does it matter from a money perspective, but also from a perception perspective, if people believe there is a non-utilised pair of crutches, wheelchair, chair for stroke patients or whatever.</P>
        <P>Many years ago after my father died, I gave a chair to a neighbour which I thought would be very comfortable for him, as we no longer needed it.  This was before I had become aware of all the infection and sterilisation issues, prior to coming to the Department of Health and Children.  However, that neighbour was very grateful for that chair, for which we had no use, and it was great.  I felt very good about it and the neighbour felt very good as well.  We need to do more, and much of it has to do with points of collection, sterilisation and so on.  In an environment where we are constrained, we have to look at all these issues.</P>
        <P>I will not address Fine Gael&rsquo;s FairCare programme, except to say that I look forward to having it costed.  I wish Fine Gael would submit it to the Department of Finance to be costed, and then we could have a real debate.</P>
        <P>If we were not constrained by the financial environment, would we do this?  Probably not, to be honest.  We have looked at all aspects of the pharmacy chain.  We have reduced the wholesale margin, from 17.6% last year to 10%.  We have reduced the manner in which we remunerate pharmacists, from a 50% mark-up to 20%, and we have changed the manner in which we pay for prescriptions in the GMS.  The first 20,000 are paid at a higher rate than the subsequent number.  We have reduced the off-patent price paid to the producers of medication by 39% this year.  That alone is &euro;100 million.  The irony now is that generic products are dearer in Ireland than the off-patent products.  That contract comes up for renewal in September, and we intend to drive further reductions there.</P><Col N="745"/>
        <P>The reason the generic market is small in Ireland is that the products have not been prescribed, or dispensed.  With the changes we are making, the market will grow, and we should get better value.  The whole market is only worth &euro;300 million, although I have heard people argue that  if we opted for generic substitution, we would save &euro;300 million.  We could only do that if we got them all free.  That is the total size of the market.  However, the market will grow when we bring in reference pricing and generic substitution.  A bigger mark-up obviously leads to additional savings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the debate on Second Stage and I look forward to Committee Stage.  I hear what the Senators opposite are saying, to the effect that they will not support it.  However, and I say this very genuinely, it is important that all of us think about the medication we take.  Doctors frequently tell me that if they do not give prescriptions, the patients believe they are not doing their job, although that argument has not been advanced by the professional organisations <i>per se</i>.  Sometimes as patients we believe we need things that we do not.  Often I am amazed at the number of items people get on prescription, and the amount of medication they are holding as a so-called &ldquo;crutch&rdquo; in the event of needing it.  Most of that is wasted, and subsequently dumped.</P>
        <P>On medical cards, Senator Buttimer is incorrect.  Some 140,821 new medical cards were issued between June 2009 and May 2010, and an extra 16,336 doctor-only cards.  More people now are on medical cards than ever before in the country&rsquo;s history.  There are 1.622 million on full medical cards, until the end of May and 115,900 on doctor-only cards, equivalent to 1.7 million cards.  Some people are losing their cards as we centralise medical cards.  There was one case where somebody had something like &euro;3 million in the bank, and for some reason, under the old health board system, that person managed to get a medical card.</P>
        <P>We are adhering to the criteria.  Whether one lives in Donegal, Galway, Dublin or Kerry the same criteria are used.  That is fair.  That is what happens with the welfare system and there is no reason the health system should be different.  Clearly, hardship cards are given in genuine hardship cases, particularly to people with difficulties that cannot be defined in legislation.  Some 70,000 hardship cards are given on the basis of the particular circumstances at the time of an application.</P>

      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 not moved.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her replies to the various queries raised on this section earlier.  Will the Minister clarify a matter on the administrative side?  The Minister appears to be suggesting that the system is already set up to capture a significant amount of data and that there will be no difficulty incorporating these new expenses and costs into this data system.  Will the Minister clarify if this is the case?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to cases involving long-term illness cards.  The Minister indicated anyone with a long-term illness card will be exempt.  Will the Minister comment on the position of cases of palliative care and whether they would qualify as one of the exceptions?  I assume people with cancer would be covered if they have a long-term illness card but not otherwise.  Will the Minister clarify this?  Some confusion has arisen of late with regard to the position of people suffering from cancer and medical cards.  There have been situations in which many such people had access to medical cards but that appears to be changing at the moment.</P>
        <P>The Bill gives the Minister powers to introduce extra charges.  It is effectively a <i>carte blanche</i> to introduce extra charges.  The Minister referred to the range of criteria she would use to do so.  This can work either way.  The Minister can exempt people who have a particular medical condition or disability or the medical needs of persons of that class.  Will the Minister indicate what lines 46 and 47 mean exactly?  They refer to one of the criteria the Minister may use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister can also use the criteria of medical needs and the financial burden on the persons who avail themselves of services under subsection (1), which is rather wide.  It seems to give the Minister wide powers to increase charges arbitrarily and to exclude certain groups.  Will the Minister address how she intends to proceed in this regard?  How does the Minister envisage this working within the Department and what actions does she intend to take?  What data would be collected to inform that decision and other decisions under subsection (4) and what criteria apply in such cases? Some of the criteria are straightforward such as the consumer price index but others are rather wide.  I call on the Minister to address these issues.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="747"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I have similar questions.  Who will arbitrate on the individuals who wish to make a case if they are included or excluded and if the charge does not apply to them?  Who will decide on this?  Will it be such a person&rsquo;s medical doctor, a community welfare officer or a doctor at the Department&rsquo;s expense?  How does the current system of payment operate and how will it incorporate the new charges in a seamless way without additional charges or staff costs?  When the HSE tried to apply the PPARS system, it could not accommodate all the various grades, types and rates of payment for people.  What sort of refinement of the system will allow this to be imposed seamlessly and to accommodate increases in future?  How will that operate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">All community pharmacy contractors have a contract with the HSE which involves their being paid.  In the case of the GMS, general medical services scheme, they are paid a particular fee for the first 20 items prescribed and a different fee thereafter.  The payments systems are linked by computers and technology.  The HSE has good data in respect of each person, what he or she gets each month and what he or she pays for.  Patients pay for these as they do under the drugs payment scheme.  The system will have to be adapted as it was last year when we changed the payment regime.  I accept there may be a cost involved in adapting the system to deduct the 50 cent per item prescribed.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of whether this legislation would involve additional administrative staff and the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  By centralising the administration of medical cards we are reducing the work load in that area and taking many personnel out of the application and administrative processes, in line with what most people want, and applying them to other areas where they are required.  Significant savings will come from this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments concerning the basis on which I will make decisions.  I have considered sympathetically several categories I would have preferred to exclude from the charge.  However, it was not possible in every case.  For example, one cannot define palliative care in such a way as to make it easy to determine when someone has a medical card for drugs for palliative care.  I refer to the powers in page 5 of the legislation.  I envisage asylum seekers who live on &euro;19 per week will be excluded.  The idea was to give the powers without referring to them in the primary legislation, which would be extraordinarily difficult and complex in cases involving palliative care, asylum seekers, those suffering from thalidomide and other cases where I would take a sympathetic view.  Earlier, I referred to the areas covered by long-term illness cards.  In particular, issues were raised about diabetics.  Currently, diabetics have a long-term illness card.  No Minister with responsibility for health has added anything to long-term illness cards since the 1970s.  Anomalies exist and the long-term illness card together with the review of eligibility legislation for entitlement to health and social care services are being urgently reviewed in the Department.  I will bring proposals to the Government later this year because we must have clarity in law about the entitlements of different groups of people.  The groups covered by a long-term illness card are excluded.</P>
        <P>I was asked about the basis on which I would increase the charge.  I am introducing it at a modest level.  Almost every country in western Europe, as well as Australia and the United States, provides for co-payment.  I visited New Zealand recently and there is co-payment both in respect of the doctor&rsquo;s fee and the drugs payment for every single person who uses health services.  This has been contradicted by somebody who is supposed to be a health analyst, but she is incorrect.  I accept some do not agree with this proposal, but a small co-payment for prescription items is not unreasonable in the current environment.  We probably would not do this if there were no financial constraints, but there are.  Therefore, we must examine every possibility to maintain the level of funding for health services.  Given that there is evidence to <Col N="748"/>suggest a small charge changes prescribing behaviour, I hope this will affect usage behaviour, particularly where antibiotics are concerned.  It will be open to the Minister under the provisions of the legislation to alter the charge or the categories excluded from it by way of regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On Second Stage I mentioned the proposals IMO representatives had made regarding cost savings and the range of activities they considered could be engaged in to address prescribing and usage behaviour.  They were of the view that these proposals offered a better alternative to opting for a prescription charge.  Did the Minister make progress with them on the proposals made?  Does she believe other categories of patients should be exempt such as asylum seekers, thalidomide and polio victims and those in receipt of palliative care, not only methadone users and children in care?  Why did not she not provide exemptions for these groups in the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is impossible to define in legislation what palliative care means and to identify it with the medical card.  That is why there is a need for specific regulations because these are complex and difficult issues.</P>
        <P>With regard to the IMO proposals, essentially, we need doctors to prescribe differently.  The clinical care pathways being rolled out by Dr. Barry White will include prescribing protocols.  In addition, the reference pricing and generic drug substitution I will introduce later this year will mean we will be closer to the position in the United Kingdom than we are.  In the United Kingdom 63% of the medicines prescribed are generic; in Ireland the equivalent figures are 18% under the medical card scheme and 12% under the drugs payment scheme.  Reference pricing and generic drug substitution will greatly increase the volume of generic drugs dispensed.  That is an effective way to do it.  The IMO suggestions would have involved the investment of money to make this happen.  In the current climate we do not have additional resources to apply.  It is best done, therefore, by way of protocols laid down by the lead clinicians, including those involved in primary care, and through reference pricing and generic drug substitution.</P>
        <P>To achieve savings, we have to examine every aspect of the pharmacy chain, including producers, distributors, whom we addressed last year, and the community pharmacy sector, as well as examining this modest prescription charge.  In his report Mr. Colm McCarthy said it should be &euro;5 per prescription, which would have been substantially more severe.  Instead of raising &euro;24 million per year, we would have raised more than &euro;90 million on the basis of 16 million prescriptions.  The proposed levy is modest in comparison with what was recommended in the review of public expenditure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have any reservations about the charge in the context of the deterrent effect of such charges on people who are most vulnerable from a financial and illness point of view?  Is she concerned that we may end up spending more on the health budget because people will not look after themselves in the way they should and that they will end up in crisis?  I acknowledge patients with diabetes are excluded, but we have mentioned other illnesses.</P>
        <P>An bord snip nua made many recommendations and I take the Minister&rsquo;s point that Mr. Colm McCarthy recommended a more punitive prescription charge, but it would have been disgraceful if we had gone down that route because it would have had an enormous impact on individuals who had recently lost their jobs, the elderly and social welfare recipients on limited incomes.  Mr. McCarthy recommended that &euro;55 million be saved through transport scheme efficiencies among CIE companies and suggested that by merging various agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S and the IDA &euro;87 million in savings could be generated.  The Govern<Col N="749"/>ment, therefore, had choices in raising the sum of &euro;24 million it proposes to generate under this legislation.  It made the choice to target this group on medical cards with a prescription charge.  With regard to decision-making, did the Minister have any reservations about targeting this group and the impact it could have from a health perspective?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>If we compare this jurisdiction with Northern Ireland, we have similar demographics, a similar cultural experience and a shared history.  In Northern Ireland the number of items per prescription is 1.7 whereas it is 3.7 here.  If we compare two populations on the same island with similar demographics, doctors here prescribe much more than their counterparts in Northern Ireland.  Any Minister for Health and Children would have to be concerned about this.</P>
        <P>I seriously examined the evidence and the literature and it is mixed.  One can make as many strong arguments against doing this as one can in favour of it, but it will be an experience for us to see what the measure will do for prescribing practice.  International evidence suggests essential medicines are still prescribed and consumed.  According to one statistic, half of those who need blood pressure tablets are not on them and half of those on them should not be on them.  That is a poor use of a limited resource.  We need to do much more with patients, which is why the clinical pathways being rolled out by the lead clinicians in dealing with diabetes, coronary care and neurology will be of benefit.  They will put in place appropriate protocols for prescribing and appropriate reviews of medications, all of which have a part to play.</P>
        <P>In the United States insurance companies entered into agreements with Merck, Sharp &amp; Dhome which meant it was in the interests of the pharmaceutical company to make sure medicines were prescribed and that it was in the interests of the insurer to make sure they were prescribed to the right people and both were able to achieve savings in working together.  These measures are being implemented by health financiers all over the world because the cost of medications is increasing.  The increase in Ireland has been greater than in any other OECD country, at 12.5% annually for the past six years.  We must, therefore, consider every measure to contain the cost, while recognising that this measure must be kept under review because it is new.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If there were no financial pressures, we would probably not do this.  It was by no means the first item on my agenda, which was why I addressed the distribution and wholesale margin last year, the retail payments and the payments to manufacturers.  We are doing this as a contribution to saving money and I hope it will make all of us think about the medication we are using and, in particular, encourage doctors to discuss with their patients whether they need a prescription just because they have visited their doctor.  The evidence suggests that many patients feel let down if they do not get a prescription.  We have become a little obsessed with drugs always being necessary to help the recovery process and in many instances they are unnecessary, certainly as far as prescribed medication is concerned.</P>
        <P>We must keep this legislation under review and watch its impact on a constant basis.  We must hear about its impact from the professionals and analyse its impact in terms of prescribing practice.  That will be done by me and my officials and, no doubt, by the HSE.  We will be able to get data quite early because it is one area where we have fantastic data, due to the manner in which we pay for medication.  The HSE can literally tell what each person with a medical card is on per month.  As Senator Feeney said, the average payment will be approximately &euro;2.50 per month.  Even in the current constrained environment in which many families operate, it is not an undue burden.  Senator Callely asked about people who have their pints and back horses.  I do not know if he suggested that we should not take a prescription charge because of that.</P><Col N="750"/>
        <P>We must consider all the options to achieve good prescribing practice and to reduce the unsustainable and growing cost of medication in the health system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned that half the people who are on hypertensive medication should not be on it.  I agree with her.  What was very common during my time in active nursing was what was called &ldquo;white coat syndrome&rdquo;, whereby if one went to the doctor and one&rsquo;s blood pressure was taken immediately, the blood pressure was bound to be high as the nature of the visit to the doctor caused it to happen.  If people who are on medication had frequent check-ups in the primary care setting by utilising the public health nurse system more effectively, it would give rise to a review of people&rsquo;s medication.  A series of estimations of blood pressure taken over a series of days would allow that.  If there is a track that shows blood pressure within relatively normal limits, is that down to the fact that the patient is being visited by a public health nurse specialist or to the fact that they are on medication?  If the blood pressure is down, should they try to only have the medication every second day?  There is scope, therefore, for examining best practice with regard to how people are monitored.</P>
        <P>It is also widely acknowledged that if people make lifestyle changes, their need for medication reduces.  In the case of somebody who is overweight and suffering from hypertension, for example, reducing the weight could reduce the blood pressure as well.  There is also diet, exercise, reducing salt intake and so forth, all of which is well known.  The issue is trying to tailor the medication needs of individuals.  If there is a primary care team operating effectively and people on medication are regularly checked by public health nurses, it would be a far better system because, in fact, people&rsquo;s need for medication would reduce.  The fact that people would be able to make changes and perhaps stop taking medication is a positive thing, rather than a visit to the doctor resulting in somebody having to continue or increase their medication.  That is a far more depressing scenario than somebody telling them there is no need for it because they have made a number of changes in their lives.</P>
        <P>The moratorium in the recruitment of public health nurses and the fact that 120 posts are not filled are having a major impact on how people are treated.  There is scope within the system to make the savings other than through imposing a charge on prescriptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made the point I intended to make.  On Second Stage, I pointed out that, based on the figures the Minister gave us this morning relating to families, the cost works out at roughly &euro;2.50 on average per month, per family.  Even if it was &euro;2.50 per week per family, it is still a very small charge.  If Senator Fitzgerald really believes people will do without medicine because they cannot afford &euro;2.50 per month, those people obviously fall into a net where other moneys and supports are put in place for them.  I do not accept the Senator&rsquo;s point that people&rsquo;s health will fail as a result of a 50 cent per item charge.</P>
        <P>We are losing sight of the ethos and value in this legislation, particularly with regard to the generic content and what the Minister said this morning about where she wants this to lead and what she intends to do in September.  There are people who will not object to paying 50 cent per item.  Many old people might be glad to pay it.  They will see it as their way of contributing towards something they are glad to have.  Everybody knows the income level for the medical card.  The Minister said this morning there are 1.66 million people with a full medical card; I forget how many have doctor-only cards.  People will understand what the Minister is trying to do and there will not be objection to the 50 cent charge.</P>
        <P>Other points were made this morning and I hope the Minister takes them on board.  I am glad to hear Senator Prendergast&rsquo;s contribution.  Let us see what we can do with this to move the issue forward in the best interests of patients.  Continuing prescriptions should be reviewed. <Col N="751"/> Where there are continuing monthly prescriptions, including for medication such as painkillers, one will have cases such as the one I mentioned where 600 or 700 Panadol tablets were found in the house when the old person died.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Looking for revenue from those on the GMS is hitting the worst off.  That is the point.  Some people will pay the &euro;10, and it might well be the elderly who will be hit most frequently.  The elderly often have a very complex range of medication.  I do not know if the Minister has the figures but it is not unusual for elderly people to be on a great deal of complex medication into older age and towards the end of their lives.  In that context a charge of 5% of their income is not to be spoken of as if it would have no impact, particularly at a time when there are such financial pressures on people.  I am not inventing this information.  Eamon Timmins of Age Action, who has much experience working directly with elderly people, has said it will create hardship for sick people.  He said patients do not decide what medication they take and the change would punish them for the decision of doctors.</P>
        <P>The Minister made a very important point about the education of the patient.  There is much educating to be done with regard to the demands of people for medication and the pressure experienced by doctors to prescribe.  Obviously, however, the behaviour change must come from doctors as well, not just from the patients.  This legislation, however, targets the patient and the medical card holder for the behaviour of doctors who prescribe.</P>
        <P>The Minister said she will review this and that the data will come in quite quickly, as the system is set up to collate that type of data.  I ask her to bring a review of what happens with this to the House.  She comes here regularly to discuss the health service so perhaps she might give an indication of when she might be able to do that.  We should be given that information.  Also, what plans does the Minister have to inform the House if she decides to exclude other groups, as she has the authority to do under this Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I supported the Bill on Second Stage, not because I am in favour of a charge for prescriptions but because when the an bord snip nua report was published, I was appalled at the figure of &euro;5 proposed.  The position taken by the Minister in the legislation is not unreasonable from that point of view and is a major improvement following the shock we got at that stage.  I take on board the point made by Senator Fitzgerald and others that this measure might cause hardship and that is my only reservation about it.  I am not sure whether the Minister can make regulations in a later part of the section we are discussing to vary the position on the basis of a financial burden or hardship being imposed.  The answer is to review the measure and come back to us with the results.  Also, there should be an appeals mechanism which I understand may already be in place for those experiencing hardship and poverty.  Senator Feeney has made the point that there are other support structures in place that could be made available to help those who will find themselves in difficulty because of this measure.</P>
        <P>I have stated many times in the House that there is overuse and abuse of medications, not in the sense of people shooting up but misuse.  I have argued with the Minister many times about the money being wasted.  Often the things people get for nothing are regarded as having no value.  I realise that is the speech made by my grandmother, but there is an element of it in this instance.  The perfect solution would be for the Minister to hold the charge and have an appeals structure in place.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, the last thing we want is people to damage their health for the sake of 50 cent but on the other hand the Minister questions whether people would damage their health for the lack of 50 cent.  A balance can be achieved in that respect.</P>
        <P>At the weekend I spoke about aspects of the matter to somebody who works in a hospital.  I was cited the example of someone living 40 or 50 miles from Dublin who had genuinely lost <Col N="752"/>their child&rsquo;s medication.  The person concerned telephoned to get a repeat prescription.  It took much effort to find it and the person concerned insisted that it be sent by taxi, even though they had a car.  That is the other side of the story.  I am not using this story to undermine the valid arguments made by my colleagues on this side of the House but to support my position that there is a number of people who take the health service for granted and do not recognise that it is taxpayers&rsquo; money.  It is our money and the way it is spent is important.  It is important that it is spent properly.</P>
        <P>My point to the Minister is that it is not unreasonable to have a charge.  Neither is it unreasonable to respond to the point made by Senator Fitzgerald that there be a review of the charge and that there be in place a fail-safe mechanism to ensure nobody&rsquo;s health will be compromised in a manner not contemplated by the legislation and certainly not by the Minister.  This is a tricky one because it is about striking a balance.  I would like to say I am opposed to the Bill on principle because it imposes a charge, but I find that to be an unreasonable position in terms of where we are.  Rather than aiming to eliminate the charge, I hope people will be better off in the future and better able to cope with it.  I, therefore, support the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The things that receive attention in the health service are the things that go wrong, but I am happy to say many things are going right.  Among them is the decision to allow nurses to prescribe.  Although we do not yet have definitive research, the findings from other countries and the anecdotal evidence here suggest nurses are much more conservative in prescribing.  They put much more thought into it than, say, doctors who are busy in general practice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must do much more to educate patients.  I recently opened a new primary care centre in Leopardstown.  That team undertakes some fantastic pioneering projects, as do many other primary care teams, one of which is on the management of diabetes and another on smoking cessation.  They have told me that those who stick to the smoking cessation programme &mdash; I accept many drop out after the first or second week of what I believe is a ten week programme &mdash; have a 70% success rate if they come to the centre every week to participate in what is effectively counselling.  That is a fantastic result.  It is amazing how one to one contact and group therapy has a huge impact on the way we behave.</P>
        <P>Equally, many diabetics &mdash; I know this from experience in my wider family &mdash; sometimes feel they are fine and do not need to take their medication.  It is estimated that 45% of medication is not used appropriately and that 20% of people do not use it.  It is clear that this does not make sense from a cost and health outcome perspective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A medicines usage review is under way, involving pharmacists and 16 primary care teams, for which the training was done in May.  The pilot scheme is being run in the months of June, July and August and we will know the outcome in the autumn.  Some pioneering work was done last year in Cork with 500 chronic illness patients and the results showed that medications some patients were on conflicted with others and that there was over-prescribing and overuse of certain medications.  Data are important, but we must find a way, whether it is through using the public health nurse, the general practitioner, the pharmacist or a combination of all three working together as part of a primary care team, to talk to and educate patients on the use of medicines because the rate of prescribing of medications is high here in comparison with other countries.  As I said, nearly twice as many medications per prescription are prescribed here than in the North.  There appears to be no reason for this.  We have a long way to go, therefore, in dealing with the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the fail-safe mechanism referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, that is the reason the Minister will have the power to make regulations to exclude categories of patients.  If a case is made to <Col N="753"/>me &mdash; a case is often made to me about mental health patients &mdash; and there is evidence to support it that patients are not taking their medication, I will not stand over this.  That is the reason I have introduced the modest sum of 50 cent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When this measure was placed before the Government and the wider political system around the time of the budget when it received more attention, the one comment most people made to me was: why is the charge so low?  It is low because we are starting something new.  We are moving into unknown territory; it is pioneering work, and we want to keep the matter under constant review.  I will report back to the Seanad, the D&aacute;il and the Joint Committee on Health and Children on the regulations made.</P>
        <P>Regarding the person who lost medication and looked for a taxi to bring a repeat prescription, I know Senator O&rsquo;Toole said that was the exception, but when something is free, people sometimes adopt an attitude that is not appropriate.  I am told by some doctors that patients often ask them to prescribe a particular medication in case they need it.  We do not need to prescribe medication in case people need it.  We want to make sure everybody obtains the appropriate medication, that he or she takes it and is educated on how to use it.  We do not want to spend money unnecessarily at a time when many services are under pressure.  There has been a rise in the cost of drugs in Ireland, notwithstanding the changes made last year.  We have reduced the cost base by approximately &euro;250 million, but because the level of prescribing is increasing we are not seeing the reductions we should be seeing, nor will we.  This is about halting the rise in rather than reducing the overall cost.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendments were ruled out of order on cost grounds.  Senator Fitzgerald is opposing the section which effectively gives the Minister the power to implement this modest charge which, as I said, will be kept under constant review.  I repeat what I said. The international evidence is mixed, although I accept arguments can be made both ways.  Our experience in Ireland seems to be very different, particularly in terms of the numbers of items prescribed, from that in other jurisdictions.  We have a relatively young population, yet the rate of prescribing seems to be increasing at a level that is unjustifiable in terms of cost, the number of items prescribed and the number of new prescriptions.  There has been an increase of 4 additional million items in a short period and 15 million items in a five-year period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will make a final point.  The health data for life expectancy and illnesses show clearly that those who are least well off financially, those dependent on social welfare and those with medical cards, make up the most vulnerable group which this legislation is targeting.  The Minister states the evidence is mixed.  I refer to the international evidence on the impact of a prescription levy; it indicates that it places a financial burden on the poorest in the community and that any charge has a negative effect on the health of that population group.  That is my concern about the Bill.  While it is the case that the Minister will come back with the data, the evidence on those most likely to be affected by the charge may be hidden and difficult to access, which means this group will become more vulnerable and monitoring will be difficult.  For these reasons, I oppose the section.  It would have been fairer and more socially cohesive to introduce reference pricing.  There should have been a greater attack on the pharmaceutical companies before the Minister decided to go after this group.  She had a wide choice available to her and the Government as to where savings could be made.  I regret that she has decided it should be this group who will provide the revenue saving of &euro;24 million because the levy has the potential to have a serious impact on their health and that of their families.  I refer to the international evidence which supports that position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I again clarify that no old person will pay 5% of his or her income; the maximum percentage such a person will pay is 1.25%.  The maximum amount to be paid will be &euro;2.50 a week, if they have more than 20 prescription items a week.  The charge is capped <Col N="754"/>at a sum of &euro;10 a month or &euro;2.50 a week.  As the old-age pension is slightly more than &euro;200 a week, this amounts to a figure of 1.25%.</P>
        <P>The international evidence is mixed.  There have also been significant reductions in the pharmaceutical sector.  As a result of the contract agreed with it three years ago, Ireland was placed in the group of countries with a cheaper basket of prices with countries such as Spain.  We had been in the group of countries with the most expensive basket. That, together with the reduction of 39% this year in the cost of off-patent products, is leading to us saving a couple of hundred million euro.  In addition, we have reduced the margin in the retail pharmacy sector from 50% to 20% under the drug payment scheme.  We have changed the manner in which we pay for items prescribed under the medical card scheme and reduced distribution costs from 17.6% to 10%.  We are, therefore, doing a lot and the next step in the process is the introduction of reference pricing and generic drug substitution.  We have completed Mr. Mark Moran&rsquo;s work.  He chaired a group of experts from my Department and the HSE.  They have completed their task promptly and it is an excellent piece of work.  The legislation is now ready to make this happen as quickly as possible in 2011.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P><Col N="755"/>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister outline the date for this Act coming into operation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The intention is to bring this Act into operation as quickly as possible.  However, it is the intention of the HSE GMS payments division to have discussions with the IPU.  Subject to any time constraints that may be involved in administration, it will be done as quickly as possible.  I hope this will be by 1 September.  The intention was for this to happen earlier in the year but unfortunately banking and other legislation took precedence in the Office of the Attorney General.  The legislation has been somewhat delayed.  Subsequent to the passing of the legislation, my officials will enter into discussions with the HSE and representatives of the pharmacy profession as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the content of these discussions concern the administration of the scheme?  In that respect, the Minister mentioned the need for some adaptation to the computer system in operation at present.  How extensive are the required changes?  Can the Minister provide any information on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The system is being adapted all the time.  It was adapted last year when we changed the level of payments.  I do not believe the change needed is substantial.  It is relatively straightforward and should not delay matters.  We would like to have discussions between the contractors, namely the retail pharmacists, and the HSE.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>In my earlier contribution, I mentioned connectivity and modern technology.  Can the Minister indicate whether the HSE, the regional offices, pharmacies and wholesalers have connectivity in respect of software and their computer systems?  As for the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the timeframe for implementation, can she indicate to Members the timeline that will be required to conclude the discussions between the HSE and the pharmacies to facilitate implementation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not believe there is any connectivity between the wholesalers and the HSE because the latter&rsquo;s contract is with the retail pharmacists, rather than with the wholesalers.  There is connectivity in respect of the retail pharmacists because that is how they are paid.  As all data with regard to GMS and drug payment scheme patients are transmitted from the pharmacies to the HSE for payment; they are connected.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">As the intention is to start this process on 1 September, the adaptation of the payment system should be possible within that timeframe.  Clearly, when legislation of this kind is enacted that results in a change; it is normal practice for discussions to take place.  However, I do not envisage that such discussions should delay implementation of the charge.  The sector already is aware of the charge, which has been flagged since last year&rsquo;s budget.  It was a Government decision related to the budget and consequently there were no surprises.  Moreover, the legislation was made available to the Irish Pharmacy Union on its publication last week and clearly, the HSE also has been kept informed of developments regarding the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Minister expect to be in a position to have a meaningful assessment of how much this measure is liberating into the coffers and helping her case?  Does she envisage it will take six months or a year or what kind of timeframe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, if it becomes operable on 1 September, it will raise &euro;2 million per month from then onwards.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="756"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>During my contribution, I also mentioned the safety net that might be in place, apart from the two exemptions to which the Minister referred, to ensure continuity in people&rsquo;s ability to obtain their required medication.  I mentioned people who may have a particular habit, such as a packet of cigarettes, a bottle or a pound on the horses.  I refer to the case of people with restricted incomes, who qualify for a medical card and who are on required medication but who, on foot of increased local authority rents, waste charges, dietary or clothing requirements or whatever are the personal issues, are not in a position to pay the required charges.  Is there a safety mechanism for such people to continue to receive required medications?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As for patients, I mentioned earlier on Committee Stage that at present, the HSE is involved in 100 medication usage reviews involving 16 primary care teams nationwide, as well as the local pharmacists.  Its purpose is to acquire good data on the use of medication.  It is known that 45% of medication prescribed and dispensed is not appropriately used and 20% of people do not take their medication at all.  It is clear that none of this makes sense from either the patient safety and outcomes perspective or the cost perspective.  In future, health care professionals, including pharmacists, doctors and nurses will engage more fully with patients on the significance of medication usage.</P>
        <P>On the question of exemptions, I have provided for children in care, as well as for those who are on methadone.  In addition, there is provision in the legislation that is about to be passed for the Minister to make regulations excluding other categories of people from being obliged to pay the charge.  This will be based on the evidence as it emerges.  Clearly, anyone with a long-term illness card, which includes all diabetics, will not be obliged to pay the charge.  This also is true in respect of mental health patients under the age of 16 and a whole category of others that I read out previously.  There are approximately 20 different categories of patients to whom this charge will not apply.</P>
        <P>However, everyone will be expected to pay the charge when he or she presents his or her prescription to a pharmacy.  Senator Feeney made the point, which I now reiterate, that it is unlikely there will be much evidence of people failing to receive their medication for the lack of paying 50 cent.  I acknowledge that such charges were abolished last April in Northern Ireland and do not apply in Wales.  However, in virtually every other country throughout Western Europe, as well as in Australia, New Zealand and North America, there is co-payment, even for very poor people, in respect of prescription charges or doctors&rsquo; visits or both.  This is new territory for Ireland and the Department will keep this charge under constant review.  I gave a commitment to report back to this House and to the Oireachtas joint committee on any significant issues that may arise in the context of implementation of this charge.  Were any category of citizens not taking their medication because the charge was prohibitive, clearly that would be something that any Minister for Health and Children would be obliged to take on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>If the scheme seeks to influence demand and patterns of prescription in the GMS, does she envisage a reduction in the amount saved other than the aforementioned &euro;2 million per month?  I refer to the intention to dictate prescribing practices or perhaps generic substitutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for her response.  My concern is that some people believe that Members do not know what happens in the real world, where people may experience rent increases, have particular dietary requirements or face unprecedented waste charges or other such demands on their restricted incomes.  A small number of people may be affected.  I acknowledge the Minister has made the point that this is a relatively small charge but nevertheless, it constitutes yet another charge.  Moreover, I am aware of the applications regarding people with diabetes, long-term illness and so forth.  My suggestion to the Minister is that rather <Col N="757"/>than waiting for something to happen, a memorandum should be issued to community welfare officers.  While community welfare officers are rigorous in their application of the rules, perhaps the Minister would see fit to put a safety net in place should anyone need it.  This would not be abused.  I do not expect the Minister to respond to this point now but simply ask her to consider the suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator Prendergast&rsquo;s point, if fewer items are prescribed even more money will be saved because we will not be obliged to pay for the medication and it will not merely be a question of saving 50 cent.  As we would not be obliged to pay for the medication in the first place, clearly, the savings would be greater.  I assure the Senator that very few items, if any, are prescribed that cost 50 cent or less.  Perhaps my officials might indicate whether any such medications exist but I am not aware of them and at the kind of prices I see, the cost is far from 50 cent.  Clearly, were fewer items prescribed because of this measure and were better prescribing practices to be enforced, then even more money would be saved.</P>
        <P>Although Senator Callely did not expect me to respond to his last comment, I make the point that I have thought carefully about this legislation.  The recommendation in the McCarthy report was to impose a charge of &euro;5 per prescription.  The community welfare system in Ireland is very good because it is flexible to the needs of individuals in circumstances that can never be predicted to be enacted in law.  Therefore, the community welfare officers respond to needs on a daily and weekly basis.  I recently heard of a case of what could be broadly regarded as a woman who was connected with a very well-off person but whose circumstances were such that she required assistance for a temporary period, which was greatly appreciated.  There must be a flexible system so that citizens can have access to the essentials, such as medication, food or whatever.  This is the reason this system is in place.  Although the officers in the community welfare system are attached to the Department of Health and Children, they are moving to the welfare system.  This is long overdue because it constitutes genuine welfare support at ground level.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">Seanad &Eacute;ireann welcomes the Government&rsquo;s new Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme which will help to create jobs and get people back to work.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  This motion in the name of the Government side welcomes the Government&rsquo;s new employers&rsquo; job PRSI incentive scheme which will help to create jobs and get people back to work.  I appreciate that the detail of it will be discussed over and back, and no doubt the Minister of State will elaborate on it, and therefore I will not go into that other than to state that the Government expects this initiative to create some 10,000 new jobs.</P>
        <P>I am particularly pleased that in small and medium-sized enterprises it applies to those who have a maximum of five workers and that the scheme will save an employer in the region of &euro;3,000 from the annual cost of employing an additional worker.</P>
        <P>I agree with the analysis of the reasons it has been introduced now.  One of the reasons is that those who are short-term unemployed are more likely to join the workforce than those who fall into a longer unemployment pattern after six months and then, consequently, become social welfare dependent.  Obviously, the Government has recognised the dangers of this happening and that is one of the reasons it has introduced this initiative.</P>
        <P>Of course, employers will not be allowed to substitute existing employees to avail of the scheme.  This also limits the maximum participation rate to 5% of their existing workforce or for smaller companies, a maximum of five new jobs.</P>
        <P>One of the things that has interested me during my time here is the regular criticism from those who oppose the Government that there is never a plan.  It has always bemused me somewhat because there has been and will continue to be a plan which is coherent, effective and that will work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is well hidden.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is totally committed to getting people back to work.  It is the number one priority of the Government.  I fail to understand why there is criticism even outside of the body politic.  I doubt if there is one Member of either this House or the other House who is serving as a public representative who is not aware of the acute trauma and pain being experienced by families who find either the breadwinner or his or her siblings unemployed, particularly those who are coming out of second and third level education.  Equally, I doubt if there is any Member of this House or the other House who does not want to see the unemployment rate brought down as quickly and as effectively as possible.  Let us get rid of the canard straight away that the Government does not care about unemployment or that it is not establishing a coherent and effective plan.</P>
        <P>We know the best way to create and sustain employment is firstly to get our own house in order and we are doing that by fixing the banking system, restoring order to the public finances and regaining our competitiveness.  We have maintained a very significant capital investment programme which is of the order of &euro;6 billion, which is going towards infrastructural development going into the next year and which is higher than the European Union average despite the severe cutbacks in our budgetary and fiscal policy.  We have introduced a wide range of innovative proposals aimed at creating and maintaining jobs, of which this is one of several.  This year we are also providing almost 160,000 training and work activation places.</P><Col N="760"/>
        <P Just="Left">To focus on what the motion is about, I will describe what I refer to as the ten key areas for job generation that the Government has identified.  Confidence is No. 1 and is central to our economic recovery and job creation.  It is the confidence to lend, spend, invest and hire.  International confidence in Ireland has been increased by the difficult decisions we have taken while consumer confidence is improving.  These are economic facts.  Like those who criticise Government policy, I am somewhat reluctant to refer regularly to international commentators on our financial and fiscal policies.  While it is welcome, our initiatives have emerged from sound Government thinking.  They have not been created by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> or the <i>Financial Times</i>, although those critiques and articles are welcome because they tend to sustain an air of confidence among international investors that Ireland is doing the right thing.</P>
        <P>It is amusing that, while these respected international economic and financial commentators seem to be singing from the same hymn sheet, the Government is doing nothing or its actions are wrong according to the domestic political environment.  It does not make sense, particularly where credit is concerned.  This is a bugbear of mine and the banks have questions to answer.  I do not believe everything I hear from the banking sector on lending, in particular to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  Banks are spending a great deal of money on radio, television and newspaper advertising telling us how many people they have lent to and how much they have lent.  Senators opposite will agree that the evidence on the ground is that lending is not at the rate it should be despite it being one of the key drivers for the economy.  Access to credit is required if SMEs are to grow and create jobs.</P>
        <P>I would like to believe the recent banking announcements, including an independent credit review process, and obligations on banks to meet specific lending targets for small firms will work, but it seems that banks are being brought kicking and screaming to the table.  No one has sympathy for or empathy with the banks.  We know what they did to this country.  For years, these people were supposed to be our financial betters.  They were surrounded by an architecture of financial and economic advisers and experts.  They were supposed to know everything that was occurring.  To our country&rsquo;s detriment, we have seen how shallow their knowledge was.</P>
        <P>Another key area for job generation is cost.  To create and sustain employment, we must ensure we price ourselves back into the market.  Although it has been difficult, we have been determined to drive down our cost base by tackling public pay and other barriers to competition, such as energy costs.  It was with some sorrow I read the recent EUROSTAT report referred to by all sides of the House yesterday.  It indicated that we were the second most expensive country in Europe.  On further examination, I came to understand the survey was nine months out of date.  Those nine months have been significant.  All sides of the House will agree that those who are providing goods and services have successfully been making strenuous efforts to ensure the reduction of our cost base.  Our placement in the next EUROSTAT survey will be interesting because the recent report, which examined the situation nine to 12 months ago, was an unfair and inaccurate depiction of the competitiveness of our current cost base.</P>
        <P>The Government has committed to investing a total of &euro;40 billion in infrastructure during the next six years.  This year, we will invest &euro;6.5 billion, providing up to 70,000 jobs.  At 5% of our GNP, this is twice the European average, so the gainsayers should not claim that the Government is not acutely aware of how important it is that we maintain a significant capital programme and look after the most vulnerable in society.  The simple facts bear repeating.  We are accruing approximately &euro;30 billion per year in taxation, but we are borrowing a further &euro;20 billion in light of the country&rsquo;s running cost of more than &euro;50 billion.  Anyone who runs a household knows that, if one is spending more than one is earning, one must find the rest of <Col N="761"/>the money somewhere.  That we have moved from a situation of budget surpluses in the early part of the last decade to one of severe budget deficits is sad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">International investors are showing so much confidence in the Irish economy and not just in the financial pages.  When the last borrowing requirement for Ireland was put on the market recently, it was three times oversubscribed.  This clearly states that those who have money still see Ireland as a safe bet.  The sad reality is that borrowing is costing us more than it did 12 or 18 months ago.  The cost is 2.5% or 3% greater than it would have been two years ago.  I cannot understand the markets&rsquo; logic in this, but as a financial adviser told me recently, there is no logic in the money markets and one should never believe otherwise.  They are lemmings, do not think and follow the trend of the day.  People should view the stock market as a barometer of the economic reality in this or any other country.</P>
        <P>Innovation is another of the ten key areas.  We are committed to developing Ireland as a global innovation hub.  The innovation task force estimated that more than 110,000 jobs can be created through supporting innovative business.  Foreign direct investment, FDI, which has been the bulwark on which this country has not only survived, but flourished during the past 40 or 50 years under successive Governments, will continue being an important source of new jobs.  I praise the IDA.  In the most difficult of times, it is still out there battling and competing.  Major international firms still have confidence in Ireland as being somewhere they can locate jobs.  The new IDA strategy, Horizon 2020, is targeting 105,000 jobs nationwide by 2015.  In the past six months, the IDA announced more has 1,200 high-quality jobs through FDI.  These are not base line, service-centred or assembly jobs.</P>
        <P>Small business has rightly exercised the minds and rhetoric of this and the Lower House.  Being from rural Ireland, I know the importance of SMEs.  They are the most significant element in the job creation strategy and should receive all the support they need.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s objective is to create 40,000 new jobs in the next five years.  Last year, the enterprise stabilisation fund supported more than 7,500 jobs.  The employment subsidy scheme is estimated to maintain 80,000 jobs.  The PRSI job initiative scheme is expected to generate 10,000 new jobs.  The car scrappage scheme, the catalyst for the turn in consumer confidence earlier this year, is expected to safeguard 2,000 jobs.</P>
        <P>The last three elements of the ten key strategies include green enterprise.  The green enterprise action group published proposals on creating 80,000 new jobs in the coming years.  To date, 15,000 jobs have been announced.  As well as 120,000 primary producers, the Government-supported agrifood sector employs more than 45,000 people in more than 800 companies.  A new &euro;100 million fund has been established to improve the food industry&rsquo;s competitiveness during the coming years.</P>
        <P>Most importantly of all, the tourism and hospitality sectors support in excess of 200,000 jobs.  The overall tourism budget has been increased this year while investment in visitor attractions has trebled to &euro;22 million.  The tourism industry is going through a challenging time, but we should remember that we now have a Minister who is innovative, creative and imaginative.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  The two years between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of this year have <Col N="762"/>been traumatic for those who have lost their jobs and for businesses trying to survive in the face of recession.  The number of people in employment peaked at 2.1 million during the first quarter of 2008.  According to the most reliable indicator, the quarterly national household survey, the tsunami of the recession has since led to a decrease of 250,000 in the number employed.  Thousands have emigrated during this period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">After these two traumatic years there are some indications confidence is returning to consumers and business, as measured in various sentiment surveys.  The SME business owners who have survived &mdash; survival has been a mega achievement &mdash; are more confident that we have reached the bottom, whereas even one year ago most of them believed they were in free fall.  As confidence returns and businesses gradually find themselves on a better financial footing, firms are cautiously considering taking on extra staff.  They are cautious because in most cases they had to lay off loyal staff in the past two years and naturally do not want to rush into recruiting before they are sure this can be justified.  The PRSI exemption scheme which encourages the recruitment of a person who has been on the live register for at least six months may provide the necessary encouragement and stimulus employers need to make the move and recruit that extra person or persons in 2010.  As businesses are acutely conscious of cost, the PRSI saving of some &euro;43,000 in the first year will provide a significant boost for small companies.  Up to five additional staff taken on in 2010 can benefit from the PRSI exemption and up to 5% of the base workforce in the case of larger companies.  When SMEs look at the range of persons unemployed eligible to participate in the scheme, they will discover there are many willing and capable people to meet their needs.  I urge all Members to publicise the scheme and bring it to the notice of businesses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &lsquo;&lsquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;&rsquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />condemns the Government&rsquo;s handling of the economy with more people now on the live register than at any other point in Irish history;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />criticises the scale and nature of the Government&rsquo;s banking bail out while still not having any significant jobs plan to get people back to work;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges that Fine Gael first proposed the policy of an employers&rsquo; PRSI holiday to promote new job growth in December 2008 and that since then there has been an additional 150,000 people added to the live register;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises that the jobs crisis now requires a greater response from Government;</P>
        <P FLI="0">and calls on the Government to implement Fine Gael&rsquo;s Hope for a Lost Generation and NewERA policies to make an immediate impact in the labour market and return the economy to a sustainable and competitive position.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  I do not intend to criticise her personally in saying there are many Ministers of State in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the Department of Finance who could be present.  I know the Minister of State has an important job to do in the Department of Health and Children.  For a long time I have been asking the Leader to get her into the Seanad to speak on the issue of care of the elderly.  We should have one of the Ministers of State from the relevant Departments present.</P>
        <P>It is ironic that we are having this discussion tonight, as we had a debate on job creation eight days ago.  We are often correctly criticised by people outside the House in this regard. <Col N="763"/> To debate the same issue a few days later seems to make no sense when Senators are making suggestions about issues we need to discuss.</P>
        <P>Of course, I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce the employers&rsquo; PRSI incentive scheme, as this proposal was first mooted 19 months ago by Deputy Leo Varadkar on behalf of Fine Gael.  The Government failed in that 19 months to introduce the measure but better late than never.  An extra 150,000 were made unemployed in that period.  I do not want to personally criticise any of the previous speakers, but I have a few things that I want to get off my chest about unemployment.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the efforts made by Senator Mooney over many years to reach out to Irish emigrants overseas.  I do not believe anyone in the Oireachtas has done more than he has.  However, the sad reality is that his party has ensured there is a new generation of Irish emigrants overseas, people who have had to leave Ireland because they cannot get work here.  From the policies recklessly pursued by the Taoiseach when Minister for Finance and other Members of the Cabinet we are reaping an horrific dividend for the population.  Very few families do not have members who have either emigrated in the last couple of years or are not considering doing so.  A shocking number of my friends have left, mostly to Canada but some to Australia and New Zealand.  This is not just a disaster for the economy and their families but also a personal disaster for them.  It is the one thing Fianna F&aacute;il and its friends in government can never answer &mdash; post the Celtic tiger, Ireland once again has to export its people in order that they can earn a livelihood.  The Government failed miserably in its years in office to ensure that when the rainy day came, we were prepared to deal with it.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Government has made some efforts.  When the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Kelleher, was in the House last week, he outlined what was happening in South-East Asia.  That is a shining example of a good news story in the sense that we are now exporting more to China than we are importing from there.  There is huge potential in that market.  This indicates that there are other avenues open to the Government and its agencies which they must pursue to get out us out of the difficulties we are facing.</P>
        <P>Touching on what Senator Mooney had to say about the banking crisis, while I have never held a candle for the banks, the political reality is that many of our financial institutions were very close to the Government in the past 13 years.  Some are still very close to it.  We are investing billions of euro in the nationalisation and recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, virtually none of which we shall see again.  Put simply, it was there for the benefit of developers, their friends and those of Fianna F&aacute;il.  This was a political decision.  The bank is not of systemic importance to the banking system.  The Government is now looking at the Fine Gael proposal of an orderly wind-down of the bank, in which we are investing &euro;22 billion.  Will the Minister of State say what we could do with that money in terms of job creation measures?  Senator Quinn always makes the point &mdash; he is correct &mdash; that too much emphasis is often placed by Opposition speakers on the role the Government can play in creating jobs.  It is not the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to create jobs, but it is its responsibility to ensure the conditions are created in which jobs can be created.  What could we do with that &euro;22 billion, or even a fraction of it, if it had not been thrown down the drain of Anglo Irish Bank?  What has happened is completely unjustifiable.</P>
        <P>The unemployment statistics are shocking.  We have the third highest rate of unemployment in the European Union.  It is touching 14%.  One in three men under 25 years is unemployed.  While the figures are stark, they are masked slightly by the fact that so many have emigrated.  Many immigrants, mostly from eastern Europe but from other areas also, who came here to <Col N="764"/>work when the economy was flourishing have also left.  It is estimated that somewhere in the region of 17% or 18% have left at this stage.</P>
        <P>I challenge the notion that we have turned the corner.  I am glad that neither Senator Mooney nor Senator Mary White used this expression, as there is widespread disagreement on the issue.  According to the best economic predictions, while there will be growth, it will be growth in the numbers who are jobless.  The worst analyses indicate that we have not yet hit the bottom and that there will be further hardship inflicted on the economy and taxpayers in the course of the next year or so.</P>
        <P>We are speaking about the employers&rsquo; job incentive scheme.  This issue was last raised in May by Deputy Varadkar in the other House with the Minister for Employment, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who deflected it to the Department of Finance.  He did not indicate that the Government was prepared to do anything about it.</P>
        <P>Something interesting happened a little more than a year ago when the vice president of Pfizer, one of the country&rsquo;s largest employers, pleaded with the Government to introduce measures to protect and create jobs.  A couple of months ago Pfizer announced that it was laying off nearly 800 workers.  The Government had not acted on the plea of Pfizer&rsquo;s vice president, so the company had to take the action it did.  That is a shocking indictment on the Government&rsquo;s slow response to this issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has had four gos at trying to correct the difficulties in the banking sector through recapitalisation.  It is clear to all at this stage the only way to ensure a resumption of credit flow to individuals and businesses is through the establishment of a national recovery bank.  This was championed several years ago by Deputy Richard Bruton but was never acted upon by the Government.  It is acknowledged by most independent observers now that some institutions in the existing banking system will never be able to lend again.  Will the Government reconsider the setting up of a national recovery bank, the one mechanism that will lead to cash being injected into the economy once more?</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has come up with several job creation proposals.  I disagree with the lack of priority given by the Government to tackling unemployment.  The State has had fiscal and banking difficulties with the Government placing all its emphasis on resolving the banking one.  The only way we can resolve falling tax receipts is through getting people back to work and therefore into the tax net.  I have still not heard any realistic proposal in this regard from the Government.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy documents on youth unemployment, Hope for a Lost Generation, produced by Deputy Leo Varadkar, and job creation, NewERA, specifically outline several measures the Government could take in job creation.  Hope for a Lost Generation proposes a national internship programme with placements in the public sector for people leaving college, second-chance education, an apprenticeship guarantee scheme to be operated with the Office of Public Works, community employment schemes and work share programmes.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced the Government has a clear policy on job creation and how to overcome current employment difficulties.  I cannot support such a self-congratulatory motion as the one tabled tonight.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in embracing Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy on PRSI 24 months after we first announced it.  Can the Government Members imagine the numbers not unemployed if they had taken on board this policy 24 months ago?</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney gave a fine and commendable speech except for one element of it.  The fact is the Government does not care or have a plan.  That is why the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation is not here for this debate.  Senator Mooney gave less than a ringing endorsement to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan&rsquo;s time as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mary White spoke of 2008 as if a wall had been erected then.  Life did not end then; it got infinitely worse for many of our fellow citizens.  Unemployment figures disguise that many of our fellow citizens have had to emigrate to Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Asia, locations that will replace those synonymous with Irish emigrants such as Cricklewood and the Bronx.  Today, 7,500 people applied for 500 jobs at Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>The Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s recently published first 2010 quarterly national household survey contained headlines such as, &ldquo;Employment falls by 5.5% in the year&rdquo;, &ldquo;Full-time employment declines by 115,700 over the year&rdquo;, &ldquo;Number of unemployed increases to 275,000&rdquo;, &ldquo;Long-term unemployment rate increases to 5.3%&rdquo;, &ldquo;Decline in labour force driven by falling participation&rdquo;, &ldquo;Number of people not in the labour force grows by 3%&rdquo; and &ldquo;Non-Irish national labour force declines by almost 16%&rdquo;.  That is an indictment on the policies of a failed Government.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, Fine Gael is a party ready to govern with job creation policies, independently costed, that will get Ireland back to work.  Today, it was announced 444,900 people are unemployed, the largest number ever on the live register.  Every month, this figure reaches another high.  When will this end?  The Government has bailed out the banks and introduced its budgets to cut public spending but when will rising unemployment end?  The Government cannot show us a jobs plan because it does not have one.  The consumer confidence referred to by Senator Mooney is not there.  Senator Mary White is wrong because more and more small businesses are not taking on new employees or opening on Saturdays and Sundays.  Senator Dearey, himself a small businessman, knows well what I am talking about.</P>
        <P>Nineteen months after Fine Gael published its job creation plan, the Government decided to take one of its ideas and run with it.  It is a pity the Government did not listen to us over the past ten years instead of trying to buy the people with money.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The sad part of all of this is that the people, not the Fourth Estate for which I have no regard, do not see the Government as having the ability or competency to get them out of this mess.  More and more people, particularly young families, are living in hardship and poverty faced by large personal debts.  When I canvass four days a week, I meet qualified and trades people struggling with economic hardship while the friends of Fianna F&aacute;il, even though they have not got the champagne anymore because it has gone off, are getting away with it, blowing cigar smoke into their faces.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s motion is a disgrace.  Some 444,900 people are unemployed.  Why has it taken 19 months to take on board the Fine Gael plan?  As Senator Phelan stated, we have put together a plan to bring people off the live register and into work.  This includes a national internship programme, a second chance education scheme, apprentice guarantees and a work <Col N="766"/>share policy.  We have plans and we will do it.  Not only will we take over the reins of power, but we will take action.  We will be men and women of action who will get Ireland back to work.  Confidence will be reinstated and people will have hope.  It will not simply be a case of rhetoric or the Taoiseach on the steps of the D&aacute;il talking about getting these people in to talk to them.  There will be leadership and a Government of people committed to our fellow citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us consider the number of people under 25 years who are unemployed.  I am a former teacher.  I refer to the leaving certificate applied programme.  We offered opportunities to students who were academically not so bright but who were very academic in their own way and very innovative.  However, the Government has cut it.  Is the Government serious about reaching out to all our students and people to get back to work?  I do not believe so.</P>
        <P>We need jobs.  This is the only issue on the political, economic, civic and civil tables.  Alas, we do not have a Government that will get people back to work.  The best thing we can do now is to give this Government an unemployment ticket and give another Government the chance to work.  I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>A job is a very precious thing.  It underpins people&rsquo;s lives and provides a bedrock for family stability.  It generates a sense of self esteem for the person holding the job and it creates wealth and spending power in the local economy.  All of these features are significant pluses in any individual&rsquo;s life.  I say as much to underscore my understanding of how important jobs are.  Senator Buttimer should note that we care about preserving jobs on this side of the House.  It is our first task, followed by creating new jobs and this is where the economy is poised to start to deliver.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Buttimer for his kind comments on my situation and he is correct in this regard.  I am a small employer and there is no question but that it has been difficult to hold on to staff with reducing revenues and shorter hours.  People have had to go on short time, not full unemployment.  If we are to be honest, that distinction must be made.  We are not only discussing the employed and unemployed in all cases, varying shades in between arise as well.  I do not make little of anyone who is suffering because of short time employment but for some people it is a choice they are pleased to make and take.  A combination of work and welfare works for some people.  The figures do not tell the whole story.  To summarise, these points refer to what jobs really do and to how they have been affected by the recession.</P>
        <P>One key impact of a recession is the reduction in the amount of money in the economy, the confidence of people to spend it and, therefore, the number of people needed to provide goods and services in that economy.  These are the underlying principles which a recession erodes and they affect job numbers.  The corollary is that in recovery confidence begins to return, credit begins to flow and more people are needed to provide the goods and services called for within the economy.</P>
        <P>Despite some of the assertions made on the other side of the House to the effect that no attempt is being made to restore jobs in the economy, the underlying assumption behind everything being done is that the grand prize will be job creation.  There may be glowing tributes from abroad and statistics which show that from today we are officially out of recession.  These are welcome indicators but that is all they amount to.  The real satisfaction and joy for any Government will be derived from unemployment numbers coming down rapidly.  This will happen eventually if the conditions that allow competitiveness to return to the economy materialise.  Figures released recently from the EUROSTAT agency indicate we are not there yet.  Ultimately, measures that allow competitiveness to return will pave the way for jobs to be created.</P><Col N="767"/>
        <P>I acknowledge that the Celtic tiger economy was unsustainable, including the 240,000 construction jobs it provided.  It was inevitable that when the credit boom went bust, jobs would follow suit.  This was neither sustainable nor wise but the job of this Government has been to address that reality and to begin to put right the inherent instability of that economic model.  Although it provided good times for a decade or more, it led to an acutely severe bust and recession.  We were first into recession and only now are we coming out of it.  To say this Government is not focussed on jobs is simply untrue.  The ultimate prize will be when our people are employed again and when people return to Ireland, I hope, sooner rather thanlater.</P>
        <P>I refer to the specific measure that employer&rsquo;s PRSI should be waived for every job created in 2010.  This applies to an employer which employs someone who has been unemployed for six months or more and it is decidedly welcome.  There is almost a philosophical case to put that an employer should not be penalised for taking on someone at the moment.  This is the principle which the motion acknowledges.  There should be no penalty in this regard.  Although PRSI has been a valuable and in some respects a targeted source of income for many years, it has also acted as a disincentive to employers to take on an extra person.  A given employer may make do with the staff in place and stretch them further rather than consider taking on an extra individual or individuals to provide the services a company needs.</P>
        <P>This measure is to be welcomed.  It is estimated that it will save approximately &euro;3,000 for an employer per employee in a year, which is not to be sniffed at.  It is remarkably difficult to try to generate &euro;3,000 through increased revenues in the current climate.  I welcome the specific measure but it also contains recognition that in the longer term, employment must be encouraged job by job and employer by employer.  To some extent, employer PRSI has acted as a barrier to employment and this must be addressed in a long-term way.  This approach must be embedded in our employment philosophy.  There are other ways in which revenues for social insurance can be generated which would not necessarily act as an impediment and I am keen to see the possibilities explored in more detail in future.  I welcome the measure.  It holds out long-term prospects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the assertion that the Government has finally woken up to the Fine Gael idea on the PRSI proposal.  One thing that struck me about the NewERA document was the number of ideas in it which are already being enacted.  These do not necessarily relate to job creation but to strategic energy supply, broadband infrastructure and so on.  Many of the ideas in the NewERA document are already in action, although perhaps not in the aspirational way in which Fine Gael presents its case.  However, I would rather an ounce of reality than a kilo of aspiration.  There is too much aspiration in the NewERA document and it is not grounded enough.</P>
        <P>The wholesale bank proposed in the document would compete against the Exchequer for funds on international markets and, in all likelihood, would drive up the cost of borrowing to the State.  This, in turn, could mean higher taxes and less money for vital public services.  The proposed bank would also compete against existing banks and could reduce the availability of credit to small businesses, as opposed to increasing it.  That might seem slightly tortuous but we need to consider this potential scenario when we debate a new entrant to the wholesale banking market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the House on this important initiative.  On Sunday, 20 June, my colleagues, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection, whom I represent, launched the employer job PRSI incentive scheme, which we expect to play a significant role in helping to create much needed new jobs.  This scheme works by exempting employers from <Col N="768"/>a liability to pay their share of PRSI contributions of wages for one calendar year.  This amounts to a saving of 8.5% on wages up to &euro;356 per week or 10.75% where pay is above &euro;365 per week.  On this basis, an employer paying the average industrial wage will save more than &euro;3,000 from the annual cost of employing an additional worker.  We hope this saving will tip the balance in favour of job creation for a significant number of employers.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware that employers are wary of taking on new staff in these difficult times.  Many have been forced to let staff go in recent years to reduce costs and protect the long-term viability of their businesses.  Even though the economy is stabilising, employers will continue to be averse to incurring additional costs, even where sound business opportunities exist.  In this environment, it is important that we do all we can to make the decision to employ new staff easier.  The decisive action taken by the Government since the current crisis broke has resulted in stability being restored during 2009 and into 2010.  The latest indicators are consistent with our expectations of returning the economy to growth during the course of the year.  We have to turn this economic stability and growth into jobs.  Job creation is the No. 1 challenge facing our society.</P>
        <P>This PRSI incentive scheme will play a significant part in meeting this challenge by supporting new jobs.  Everybody will win under the scheme.  The State will benefit from reduced social welfare costs, employers will get a break on their costs of employment, and, most important, people will be saved from the slide into long-term unemployment and given the dignity of a job once again.  The scheme is part of our ongoing work to support job creation and to deal with the difficulties that unemployment creates for people in their daily lives.</P>
        <P>In its Employment Outlook 2009, the OECD highlights that where employment creation subsidy schemes are heavily targeted, they can be effective.  The scheme is specifically targeted at those who have been on the live register for six months or more.  Many people in this category are highly skilled and capable and, therefore, I expect this scheme to have wide appeal across a range of employment sectors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Schemes of this nature must be carefully targeted to avoid deadweight issues.  Deadweight is where a scheme supports the creation of a job that would have been created anyway.  We need to avoid this as much as possible and use Government expenditure in the most effective way.  The proportion of people who return to employment after a short period out of work remains relatively high.  However, after six months on the live-register, there is a danger that people will drift into long-term unemployment and welfare dependency.  This is why the scheme will only be available for new employees who had been unemployed for six months or more.  Another potential issue with schemes of this nature is substitution, where an employer might let a current employee go in order to take on a new employee who would qualify for the exemption.  Under the terms of the scheme this will not be allowed, as the employment being created will have to represent an increase on the employer&rsquo;s total workforce over the three months prior to its application.</P>
        <P>The scheme is only available for full-time jobs that are wholly new and additional.  It is not open to employers operating in seasonal industries or for employees on short-term contracts because the particular focus of this scheme is on supporting the creation of jobs that will be sustainable over the long term.  The scheme criteria provide that if a qualifying job ceases within six months of the granting of an exemption then the employer&rsquo;s PRSI exempted under the scheme will have to be paid.  However, flexibility is built into the scheme so that these amounts may be deemed not to be due where the cessation is for genuine reasons such as the employee moving on to another employment or the failure of the business venture.</P><Col N="769"/>
        <P>The full scheme criteria are as follows: the employee must have been in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, one-parent family payment or disability allowance for at least six months or on the work placement programme of more than three months; the job must be full-time &mdash; 30 hours or more per week; it must be new and additional &mdash; employers will not be allowed to substitute existing employees to avail of the scheme; the employer will be required to furnish an up-to-date tax clearance certificate; employers will be limited to a maximum participation rate of 5% of their existing workforce or, for smaller companies, a maximum of five new jobs; and the job must last for six months or more &mdash; if it does not the PRSI exempt amounts will have to be paid by the employer but this provision will not be applied if the job ends for genuine reasons.  The scheme will run for 2010 only but the 12-month exemptions will run into 2011.</P>
        <P>Any job created in 2010 that meets these criteria will be eligible for the scheme.  For example, if a job was created in February, employers will have paid standard employee and employer PRSI since hiring the new worker.  They should apply for an exemption but continue to operate PRSI as normal.  When their application is approved, they will be granted an exemption from employer&rsquo;s PRSI for 12 months and will be given a date from which to apply the exemption to their payroll.  On this basis if an exemption is granted in July, it will run until July 2011.  The scheme has been set up in this way to avoid having to refund PRSI, which is administratively cumbersome for the employer and the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>Over the past year, we have increased the supports for people going back into education and training and unemployed people can expect more opportunities for work activity in the coming months.  This scheme is about also offering them their No. 1 choice, which is the opportunity of new jobs being available.  We expect that this scheme will support significant numbers of employers, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, in creating the jobs that will add momentum to economic recovery and restore people to the dignity of paid employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her interesting views.  I always have a difficulty with Private Members&rsquo; debates.  The Government usually tables a motion, as it did today, stating &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann welcomes the Government&rsquo;s decision...&rdquo; and the Opposition, in turn, tables an amendment, stating &ldquo;To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following &ldquo;condemns the Government&rsquo;s decision...&rdquo;.  However, both sides are anxious to succeed in creating jobs.  The hearts of Senators Mooney and Dearey and Opposition Senators are in the right place but the question is whether they will succeed.</P>
        <P>I am slightly worried about the term &ldquo;job creation&rdquo; coming from the Government because the Government is not engaged in job creation.  The Minister of State will have heard me say this previously.  When I met the Labor Secretary of the previous US Government, Elaine Chao, she said, &ldquo;My job is to create the environment so that private enterprise can create the jobs&rdquo;.  Approximately 30 years ago I was chairman of a hospital as a job creation programme was put in place.  We received letters every month asking how many jobs we had created and how many new nurses and porters we had taken on.  That is what caused problems in the 1980s.  Jobs were created that were not viable and that is what got us into difficulty back then.</P>
      
        <P>We created costs which were far too high and made the State uneconomical.  We created jobs that were not needed.</P>
        <P>There are several things we can do which can establish the conditions that make it easier for businesses to employ people in viable jobs.  We should do our utmost to avoid putting unnecessary burdens on businesses in terms of red tape.  It stifles business in general and entrepreneurship in particular.  Perhaps we could introduce a sustainable employment test to block new regulations that will cost jobs.  We talk a great deal about this but doing it is the difficult <Col N="770"/>issue because every time something goes wrong people call for more regulation.  More regulation means stifling the entrepreneurship we must encourage.</P>
        <P>I visited Panama some years ago.  The people there told me that in their efforts to encourage job creation and to create new enterprises they set the target of having the least red tape for creating new companies.  I asked them what they managed to achieve.  They said they looked at countries throughout the world, including Singapore and Hong Kong, and managed to beat them all because a new company can be created with the necessary paperwork in seven hours.  Recently, however, all the concerns about deregulation and regulation are such that we are probably going in the opposite direction.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>All new proposals should be subjected to rigorous audit.  We should also give businesses a chance to highlight where regulation has been poorly designed and to suggest ways to improve it.  We must address reductions in the cost of utilities and services for small and medium enterprises.  In that regard, recently there was a Government initiative to get rid of legislation that was more than 100 years old.  What about legislation that has been passed in more recent times?  Perhaps we need a system to reconsider all old legislation that is hindering business and job creation.  Interestingly, a few days ago we discussed the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act.  Its provisions must come before the Houses every year to be renewed.  That is understandable, and when the Minister was in the House discussing it we talked about whether this should be considered with regard to other legislation we have passed.  Perhaps all legislation should have to be renewed every ten years.  It might mean we will find that some of the legislation passed ten or 20 years ago is out of date and imposing a burden on job creation by private enterprise.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that in Spain, workers on full contracts are entitled to severance pay of as much as 45 days pay per year worked, one of the highest levels in Europe.  As part of the government&rsquo;s employment reforms, it is planned to reduce this to 33 days for some contracts.  The thinking is that if the Spanish Government makes it cheaper for businesses to let employees go, employers will realise that it is cheaper to hire workers, since a worker&rsquo;s cost includes the price of his dismissal.  In other words, if one takes on a worker, one must include in one&rsquo;s calculations that one must pay him 45 days per year worked if one lets him go.  Reducing that might appear to be the wrong way to go but I understand what it means.  It might seem harsh and Machiavellian to some, but we must realise there is no easy way to make businesses start taking people on again.  We can only set the conditions that might encourage them to do so, for instance, the cost of hiring employees and letting them go.</P>
        <P>Although it is most unpopular, somebody must mention the elephant in the room, the minimum wage.  Ireland has the second highest minimum wage in Europe and while we want to be competitive, some jobs do not exist at that minimum wage.  I have talked to businesses that want to create jobs and take on people but they simply cannot at the current rate.  If somebody does not want to work at that minimum rate, they do not have to do so, but if we have a minimum wage that must be paid at a particular rate, and the job does not exist at that rate, it is up to the State to do something about it.</P>
        <P>I mentioned some time ago in the House that the state of Colorado in the US had reduced its minimum wage.  It did this because the wage was linked to inflation; therefore, when deflation occurred, as it has been occurring here, it automatically reduced.  That does not apply here.  While there are a number of jobs that could exist, they do not exist due to our minimum wage rate.  Learning from the mistakes of the boom, can we not in future link the minimum wage to deflation as well as inflation?  It might appear wrong to think or say this but there are jobs that do not exist at the minimum wage rate, and our rate is the second highest in Europe.  A new survey of more than 500 accountants, from the Institute of Certified Public Accountants, <Col N="771"/>showed that 60% of respondents believe the current minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour is making Irish business uncompetitive.  It is interesting to note that half of the respondents also said that they did not expect to employ more people in their company even if the minimum wage level was reduced.</P>
        <P>We must do our utmost to address high levels of long-term unemployment.  Over time, people get discouraged and may not seek jobs.  Ex-workers gradually lose their skills and their motivation and it is quite likely that they may never work again.  Older and less-skilled dislocated workers, who are most likely to have difficulties landing comparable, or any, jobs should be identified early and receive additional services.  In this respect, I welcome the new Government scheme to give employers PRSI exemptions for taking on new workers who have been unemployed for six months or more.  I hope the measures included in the scheme will cut costs for business and will encourage businesses to take on the people they need.  The Minister explained the scheme very well tonight.  If it can create anywhere near the figure of 10,000 new jobs, it will be a great success.</P>
        <P>I hope the overall conditions in the global economy for Irish businesses will help job creation.  The fall in the value of the euro, for example, is very encouraging for Irish exports because companies here benefit more than those in other eurozone nations from the currency&rsquo;s weakness against the dollar and sterling.  Also, some people believe that a strong sterling will boost Irish, so-called indigenous exports.  Ireland will gain, too, from the fact that it has a higher percentage of its exports in services than any other western economy.</P>
        <P>We must recognise that if we are to create jobs, most will come from the State removing barriers to enable entrepreneurs to start businesses and to create those jobs.  I hope the Government will take on board some of the ideas put forward today from both sides of the House and play its part, however small, in creating the conditions for business to employ people.</P>
        <P>I read an interesting book recently entitled <i>Start-Up Nation: The Story of Israel&rsquo;s Economic Miracle</i>.  The figures are just fascinating.  The country has the highest number of start-up companies in the world.  There are 3,850 start-ups, one for every 1,844 Israelis.  That is huge compared to other countries.  A country of 7.1 million people attracted as much venture capital as the United Kingdom, with 61 million people, or the 145 million people in Germany and France combined.  The book is interesting because it asks what it is about Israel that got entrepreneurs starting businesses.  There is no single easy answer but something, be it the psyche of the Israeli people or whatever else, made Israelis believe in start-up companies that will create viable businesses.  One can read about some of the innovation businesses.</P>
        <P>I hope that what will emerge from the recent Your Country, Your Call competition initiated by Dr. Martin McAleese will be similar innovative ideas to help Ireland and to create new viable start-ups and entrepreneurial jobs that will solve our huge unemployment problem.  However, consider what has happened over the years.  We still have a large number of people working, more than were working 20 years ago.  There are 800,000 more people working now than in 1990.  We did succeed.  Let us not dampen our enthusiasm by saying that because we got it right for 15 years and got it wrong for the past four or five years, we should throw everything away.  We can achieve.  We can set out to achieve what we need but we must do so with a belief in ourselves.  If we can believe in ourselves, we can be as good as those countries that have managed to do it elsewhere.  We can do it not by paying lower or cheap wages but by investing in the enterprises we have.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Buttimer talk about the education system.  Senator Buttimer and I were involved in the leaving certificate applied some years ago.  The leaving certificate applied does not just measure people&rsquo;s academic ability but what I call their other intelligences.  They may be called skills, talents or whatever but I prefer the word &ldquo;intelligences&rdquo; <Col N="772"/>because those intelligences help make sure the people who might otherwise have been left at the back of the class and who may be left without jobs are able to show what they can do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sir Richard Branson is one example of those who would have been regarded as a failure at school.  Sir Bob Geldof is another.  I can think of others who would have been regarded as a failure at school.  These were people who did not pass the academic examinations but when they were let loose and they discovered their talents, skills, abilities and intelligence in a different way, we all saw what they were able to do.  The danger is that we are likely to take our eye off the ball by not encouraging the leaving certificate applied.</P>
        <P>One of the areas in which leaving certificate applied students always worked very well is the hospitality business but they are no longer given the CAO points they now need, which they did not need previously.  It is in the Government&rsquo;s hands to make sure that those who decide not to do an academic leaving certificate but the leaving certificate applied can go on to third level education.  It might not be university level but the sort of education that will give them the chance to develop further.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by the Minister&rsquo;s words earlier but also by the words of the Opposition speakers.  We must all put our heads together to determine what we can do to ensure this becomes the country where we have start-up operations, and that those start-up operations create jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the sentiments expressed by Senator Quinn.  He made sensible suggestions and observations.</P>
        <P>During the Celtic tiger years a large number of people were drawing unemployment assistance; I believe the figure was well over 100,000.  These were people who never worked at any stage.  It is wrong to keep doling out money to somebody who has no intention of seeking work.  It is bad for society and for the person, and we should never encourage that.</P>
        <P>People should be at least 20% better off financially working than on the dole.  I will give the Minister of State an example.  Colm McCarthy gave us figures for that in the an bord snip nua report.  Someone on the dole can get payments ranging from &euro;25,000 up to &euro;50,000.  Why would anybody bother looking for a job in that case, especially if one has a medical card and so on?  That must be examined.  We must motivate people to work and give them incentives and as Senator Quinn said, we must be competitive also.  Why would someone start a business if their overheads are too high and they cannot be competitive?</P>
        <P>I spoke to a business person last week who had a small caf&eacute; in a service station.  These people are the backbone of the economy.  Senator Phelan would know the place I refer to because he visited it also.  It is in Cavan.  I asked this person how business was and he said he was over-regulated.  Representatives of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, were calling.  If an employee is pregnant there are about eight forms to be completed.  He told me one would need a full-time clerical officer to deal with all the forms.  If the caf&eacute; is open on a Sunday he has to pay staff treble time.  In hotels NERA representatives call in the middle of the night and query all of that while the staff themselves are happy to work at the normal rate to keep their jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what is happening, and it is mitigating against people in business who wonder if they should bother continuing or shut the doors and stay at home.  The local authorities charge people exorbitant prices for water connections.  Rates are very high.  The local authorities must get their act together in this regard as well.</P><Col N="773"/>
        <P>Senator Quinn made the point about the Government and he is right.  It is not the Government&rsquo;s job to create jobs.  We must create the environment to enable people create jobs.  I asked a person about that one day.  People do not start a business with the primary purpose of creating jobs.  They start a business to make a profit for themselves but jobs are involved in that.</P>
        <P>There are various incentives that can be given to workers.  The minimum wage is an issue but there are various incentives available.  I know an employer who has a bonus scheme for workers.  The more he takes in at the till, the more the worker gets.  That is a very good idea.</P>
        <P>Some people are involved in worker participation where the workers are involved in management decisions.  They bring them in around the management table and ask them their views.  It is a good idea to involve workers in that way because it gives them a great interest in their job and shows that the employer values them in every possible way.  There are many areas we could examine in that regard.</P>
        <P>Another system we all know about is where one wants to check one&rsquo;s PRSI or tax information.  A business person made this proposal and it is very sensible.  He said there should be one personal database for every citizen.  In other words, if someone wanted to inquire about their PRSI, tax or whatever the information would be on one database.  The person should not have to go all over the place to get information about themselves, nor should an employer have to do it.  There is too much bureaucracy in that regard.  One&rsquo;s business is not competitive and therefore there is no incentive to continue.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I welcome the PRSI initiative by the Government but we must do much more than that.  The main point, and it is being said by people everywhere, is that people should not be better off on the dole than working.  There are people getting up at 6 o&rsquo;clock every morning to go out to work and the person living beside them does not get up until 1 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.  They are in pubs and so on and they have no regularity about their lives.  That is bad for society.  It is a burden on the health service also because it creates social problems, mental problems and various other problems.</P>

	<P>I wish to share one minute with Senator Norris with the agreement of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

	<P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach might remind me when I have two minutes remaining.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is an important debate but it should be a rolling debate and not only up to the end of this term.  We should continue to debate any incentives that will help employment.</P>
        <P>As an Opposition spokesperson I will always give credit where due.  I welcome this initiative by Government but as my colleagues have said already, this proposal was put to Government by the Fine Gael Party over 19 months ago as a positive incentive to create employment.  However, I am glad the Government has adopted that position.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has many more positive proposals to which Government should listen.  Senator Brady spoke a great deal of sense.  I agree with 99% of what he said regarding the over-burden of regulation, especially for small businesses and companies operating here for many years which are struggling in the current climate.</P>
        <P>I too met a restaurateur two weeks ago in Waterford who was almost tearing his hair out.  He employs seven people, all of whom are very happy with their employment terms.  He wants to remain open at weekends to try to attract people into the city and support the tourism trade <Col N="774"/>but he is over-burdened with regulation.  He has NERA, the employment rights authority, breathing down his neck and sending him all kinds of threatening letters.  The man does not have the time to correspond with all the information coming to him.</P>
        <P>I have written to the Minister on his behalf to outline this man&rsquo;s concerns, and the concerns of many like him.  The very least State agencies should do is back off those people who are trying to stimulate employment and growth in the various cities and towns throughout the country.  These agencies need to be hauled in somewhat because it appears they are trying to justify their existence.  Many of them were recommended for the snip in the Colm McCarthy report.  They are going to great lengths now to show their muscle but all they are doing is putting these businesses out of business.</P>
        <P>The man I refer to has told me that if heavy pressure comes on him he will have to close the business and let go the seven people he employs.  That will be another restaurant closed and boarded up in a city, which is disgraceful.  We must start listening to these people who are working hard at the coalface to stimulate our economy.</P>
        <P>There are other related charges that have been increasing in the past.  The local authorities have done their best to keep the rates down but Government charges have been rising while all other charges are dropping.  I agree with Senator Brady and with Senator Feargal Quinn that we need to have a competitive economy so that businesses and entrepreneurship are not smothered.</P>
        <P>My family has employed people over many years in a small business.  My father employed almost 20 people in a small leather factory; my brother has a small sheet metal manufacturing company that exports as well as creating product for this country.  We cannot neglect manufacturing and we cannot give up on manufacturing in this country.  Competitiveness is one of the biggest issues but there are areas of innovation and new product development and if the colleges and third level institutions work with small businesses and assist and support them and if there is a better co-operation between Departments and support agencies, we can rescue the situation for manufacturing.  I, for one, believe we should not give up in this regard.</P>
        <P>I have been vocal with regard to youth unemployment.  Highly qualified young graduates have very few job prospects.  It is important to try to offer those people some credible reason for getting out of bed in the morning, to go to work and to put their good talents and education to use.  We need to find positive ways of engaging those young people.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has proposed initiatives such as internships with the likes of local authorities, the OPW or other State agencies so young engineers, quantity surveyors or others can be given the necessary work experience.  This is a win-win situation.  Such a scheme takes them off the dole queues, gives them a reason to get up in the morning and to put their talents to good use.  We have projects such as schools and community development facilities to build and also infrastructural facilities.  It should be possible to introduce some kind of flexible system in the employment legislation to allow people and agencies such as the OPW and the local authorities to take on these young people.</P>
        <P>I will give an example for the Minister of State.  Significant numbers of local authority houses are boarded up because local authorities do not have the resources to refurbish them and people on the housing lists are using rent supplement in the private rental sector.  There must be a way we can find to engage with F&Aacute;S to take apprentices on the dole out of that situation and put them in with a master craftsman who is also on the dole who could lead a team of apprentices to refurbish these houses.  This would be a very simple exercise that could get people off the dole and back to work.  It is a win-win because local authority houses would be refurbished &mdash; they do not have the resources to do so &mdash; and people would be taken off the <Col N="775"/>housing lists with a saving on rent supplement.  This is how we need to think.  We need to think of tangible ways to get our young people off the dole queues and into productive employment again.  This is the way it has to be.  I appeal to the Minister of State to carry the message she is hearing in this House because, as Senator Quinn said, there are good signals from all sides and we are trying to be helpful because there are people who support Fine Gael as much as people who support Fianna F&aacute;il, who are unemployed.  If we work together we can certainly help.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of older redundant workers.  In Waterford city alone, more than 600 people have been made redundant in the past year from Waterford Crystal and many more were made redundant from ABB, a transformer factory that closed in Waterford and a pharmaceutical factory, TEVA, which will have 315 redundancies this summer.  Many of the people employed there are older and may not want to go back to college.  The only courses these workers are being offered are fork-lift training or computer licence courses through F&Aacute;S.  We need to be more flexible with these people and get them back into tangible work such as craft work or landscaping or some options to give them an avenue and an incentive to go back to education and back to employment.  Not everybody wants to go back to do a third level degree.  We need to come up with practical measures that allow people who may have left school at 15 or 16 years of age &mdash;&mdash;</P>

They may not necessarily want to go back to college and we have to find new ways of engaging with them.  I will conclude as I would like to give that minute to Senator Norris.</P>

	<P>The Senator is most gracious and I thank him very much.  I listened with great interest to his passionate contribution.</P>
        <P>I refer the Minister of State to what I believe is a contradiction in her speech.  She says on the first page she is aware of the difficult times, that employers are wary of taking on new staff and that many have been forced to let staff go over the past few years.  There is a suggestion there they will take them back or re-employ them but on the next page she states the scheme is only available in relation to full-time jobs that are wholly new and additional.  This suggests very clearly that they cannot re-hire in the same area and in the same job and they certainly cannot re-hire the same people.  I ask the Minister of State to provide an explanation.</P>
        <P>This is a very valuable motion and I find I can agree with both sides.  It seems the Government is saying the PRSI incentive scheme is a very good thing and Fine Gael is agreeing and saying it was actually its idea and that the Government has stolen its clothes.  In that case, I wholeheartedly support this because it is shocking to think that 450,000 people are unemployed.  This is a vast figure and it is a reproach to all of us and it is a particular reproach to people who have not chosen to speak in this debate, which I find astonishing.</P>
        <P>I remember the bad times.  I remember the last recession and we are still 800,000 jobs ahead of where we were then, partly because the population has increased.  What will happen small businesses and people who are self-employed?  They do not seem to be covered in this scheme.  I refer to very small businesses with one person.  Many of these have crashed all over the country.  These people have invested in a business and have worked extremely hard.</P><Col N="776"/>
        <P>I note there are some good indicators.  I am delighted to hear that, technically, the recession is over.  We should be trumpeting this.  However, there is a caveat and that caveat is this refers to gross domestic product and not gross national product, or whatever it is.  The difference is that in one, the multinational companies are included and they frequently repatriate a great amount of their profits.  We have to be careful that we are compensating in our calculations for this leakage.</P>
        <P>We should also be aware that there are some other good news stories in which this House has played a significant role.  We had a debate on bio-fuels in which Senator Coffey took a very important part and so did Senator Phelan, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and Senator Cummins.  As a result of that debate, there has been the development of a very significant industry in the Waterford region, which I know is very close to the Senator Coffey&rsquo;s heart.  I learned yesterday that this company, which without the assistance of Seanad &Eacute;ireann would possibly have had to go out of business, has been awarded a major award in recognition of its work in the area of green industry.  Just last week I drew the attention of the House to the fact that a young man was outside the gate getting publicity for a company in County Clare where he has produced a biodegradable plastic bottle.  This is potentially of huge significance because plastic bottles are used all over the world and virtually no one else, to my knowledge, has cracked the nut of making them biodegradable.  We should be proud of this achievement.  There is lots of energy, lots of initiative and lots of talented, young, educated people and we need as much support as possible.  I am not normally a fence-sitter.  It will be some wrench of my conscience to decide on which point in this debate I will come down but having been graciously granted time by Senator Coffey, I feel I shall have to vote with Fine Gael on this motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The employer job PRSI incentive scheme was announced in the 2010 budget.  The scheme is a job creation support scheme.  The objective of the programme is to counter the drift of people into long-term unemployment and welfare dependency by exempting employers from liability to pay their share of PRSI contributions &ndash; 8.5% or 10.75% of gross pay.   The scheme will run for the calendar year 2010.  However, any qualifying employment created in 2010 will be eligible for the scheme, which will be structured so the employment created prior to the launch can participate for 12 months from the time of launch and employment created later in the year will participate for 12 months to the corresponding date in 2011.  For example, in the case of a qualifying employment created prior to the launch of the scheme, standard employer and employee PRSI will be paid but following approval for the scheme the employer will benefit from a PRSI exemption for 12 months from the date of approval.  Rebates of PRSI will not be a feature of the scheme.  Some 500 employers have signed on since the <Col N="777"/>scheme was proposed in budget 2010 and this has given us 3,000 jobs.  This speaks for the success of the scheme.  I welcome sustainable funds, employment subsidy funds and the other initiatives of the Government to create up to 5,000 jobs up to July.</P>
        <P>We all know that it is not the public sector or the Government that will bring the economy back from where it is today.  The self-employed and those who give employment through the years will do so.  Looking back on the 1987 recession, there were 1.1 million people employed in the country.  Today, some 1.78 million people are employed.  That is a major amount of work done by the Government over the past number of years and particularly the Governments over the past 20 years.  They have worked to create 700,000 new jobs on the island of Ireland.  A great deal has been achieved and we have gone through a difficult time.  I welcome the &euro;6 billion committed in the last budget from the two major banks over the next two years.  This will be a great help to people who can give employment and who are employers with a good track record.  I call on the Government to ensure the watchdog monitoring the &euro;6 billion for new jobs to be created reports to the Government on a bimonthly basis.  This House intends to be the watchdog of that committee and intends the Minister to be answerable and present in the House to update us on the situation, the moneys made available and the employment generated from the investment of the &euro;6 billion.  Some 1,200 new jobs were announced by the IDA this year, 20,000 jobs promised to be created in the next 12 months and 35,000 jobs in the following 12 months.</P>

We must work together, with Opposition and Government, because no one has the definitive share of expert knowledge on keeping the country going and getting back to work.  I welcome the proposals from the Opposition and am working with the party leaders to ensure we bring this to the attention of all Ministers in all portfolios so the Government can have the benefit of all of this, not just colleagues on either side of the House.</P>
        <P>The family of Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady has a track record in public life <i>par excellence</i> that is second to none.

        <P>The employers job PRSI incentive scheme is only one of the initiatives to help people over the current dilemma.  The banks are giving employers, large and small, very little help.

Senator Quinn gave tens of thousands of people jobs and in some small way I assisted by doing likewise through my family business.  While recognising those who made a contribution in other fields, the return of our economy will occur in the credit line.  The credit line must be freed up.  If it is not available, how can we operate without the tools of the trade?  I refer to getting the credit line flowing.  We can have no commerce if there is a continuous credit crunch.  The &euro;6 billion allocated by the Government in the budget is of crucial importance and should be made available as soon as possible to sustainable projects with a job creation value.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senator Cassidy that one of the reasons we are in trouble is the lack of initiatives from the Government.  Fine Gael pointed out the PRSI holiday to the Government in 2008.  Fine Gael proposed it in the budget of 2008 and that is over two years ago.  It is only now the Government sees the benefit.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish her well.  Senator Brady referred to local authorities and how they must get their act together.  Local authorities are responsible for water and sewerage charges and rates but are starved of cash.  There is little they can do about it.  On several occasions I called for a debate on the funding of local authorities.  This debate must take place.  How will local authorities be funded?  There is little scope for change so local authorities can get their act together.  Benchmarking has taken its toll and there is a high cost base for manufacturing in this country.  That is one of our problems.</P>
        <P>I have referred to our tourism industry on numerous occasions.  Only 8 million tourists came to this country, a reduction of 10% over the past number of years.  This happens at a time when we never had a better product.  We have never had better access through regional airports and Dublin Airport.  We never had more hotels in this country, with hotels in every village.  We were never better fixed for roads and a rail network.  The tourist board has fallen down over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>Thousands of young people from this country have gone to Australia in the past number of years.  In order to get a visa for Australia, all a young person has to do is go to the travel agent and get the visa.  Thousands of Chinese people want to come to this country to work, for tourism or for educational purposes.  However, getting a visa to come from China to Ireland can take up to nine or ten months, which should be contrasted with how we operate when sending people to Australia.  An unbelievable number of measures could be taken to attract people to this country.  I suggest the Minister of State should examine the obstacles confronting both ordinary and educational tourism, as Ireland has a great product.  It is evident from the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution that one major obstacle in this regard is the cost to an employer who has to make a contribution of &euro;3,000 to employ someone on the average industrial wage.  As this constitutes a major disincentive to employing people, I welcome the Government&rsquo;s initiative in introducing what has been described as a PRSI holiday.  At the same time, however, the figure of &euro;3,000 that applies to all workers is a huge cost.</P><Col N="779"/>
        <P>On foot of Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments that he could opt for either the motion or the amendment, I ask the Minister of State to consider seriously taking on board Fine Gael&rsquo;s amendment.  As Senator Cassidy remarked, we all must work together because otherwise we will not get out of the mess we are in.  As Senators Phelan and Coffey noted, Fine Gael came up with the idea of having a PRSI holiday two years ago but the Government has only now introduced it.  Consequently, I ask that the amendment proposed by this side of the House be taken on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I welcome the introduction of the PRSI incentive scheme that exempts employers from their liability to pay their share of PRSI for certain employees for 12 months.  It is open to employers who create new and additional jobs in 2010.  Frankly, this is a no-brainer and my only criticism of the scheme, to echo Senator Burke&rsquo;s remarks, is that I cannot understand the reason the scheme was not announced two years ago when the economic crisis first hit.</P>
        <P>I agree with those commentators who believe we have turned or are in the process of turning the economic corner.  However, I must disagree fundamentally with anyone who might suggest there will be a rapid return to growth.  It may be the case that there will be as many as 70,000 additional job losses this year.  It has been reported today that 5,800 people have been added to the live register in June.  The seasonally adjusted figure now stands at 452,882, a shocking figure, while the unemployment rate now stands at 13.4%.  While hearing such depressing news, it is worth noting that the rate of increase in unemployment, that is, the level of increase, is lower than last year.  However, the overall figure is still moving in the wrong direction.  Moreover, various indicators show that although economic output is higher, this also must be put in context and one must be highly cautious</P>
        <P>This year we have seen 652 firms go to the wall, of which 194 were construction firms, 83 were in the hospitality sector and 78 in the retail sector.  Unfortunately, the only real growth industry is the insolvency industry.  In this context, I urge Members to examine <i>Insolvencyjournal.ie</i> because it is both a source of useful statistics and a horrifying account of the broken dreams of far too many Irish entrepreneurs who have been annihilated in the economic downturn.  Moreover, we are far from being out of this trend because international experience demonstrates that insolvencies and the associated job losses tend to take place at the end of a recession, rather than at the beginning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As for the threat to jobs, there is massive over-capacity in a number of key industries.  Hotels have been mentioned.  There are simply too many hotels and golf courses for the size of the country.  Even if everyone was to go on a permanent holiday, I greatly doubt whether we could fill all the hotel beds now available.  Every developer thought it necessary to build a hotel solely for tax purposes and it now appears as though NAMA will be the biggest hotel owner in the country.  This has massive employment implications.  In addition, banks are not lending.  Even if one has a business which is a going concern, banks are not lending but are hoarding cash to rebuild their balance sheets.  Cash flow is the lifeblood of business, but credit is not flowing and Irish businesses are struggling as a result.  If the Government is serious about getting people back to work, it must address this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>All Members should be wary of excessive enthusiasm in the cutting of Exchequer spending.  Tough decisions are not always the best ones.  Cutting Exchequer expenditure entails taking even more cash out of the economy and may not be the best course of action.  Members will recall that it was Churchill who stated it was not the end, not even the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning.  For the foreseeable future the Government has nothing to offer the people but blood, toil, tears and sweat, as we struggle to pay Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s enormous debts and balance the budget.</P><Col N="780"/>
        <P>I ask Members to urge the Government to do something to ameliorate the plight of the self-employed who have lost their businesses and livelihoods.  In the good times their taxes paid for our services and their energy created employment.  Consequently, we should not abandon them now.  Mar achoimre beag ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite agam, is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil d&uacute;shl&aacute;n romhainn.  N&iacute;l deireadh na troda in nd&aacute;n d&uacute;inn.

        <P>The Minister of State has noted that this is a win-win for everyone.  There are serious questions to be asked about allowing employers to take a PRSI holiday at a time when the Exchequer and the Department of Finance must bolster the social insurance fund because of the demise of the latter.  However, if the Minister of State really believes this is a scheme in which everyone wins, that is, employers, employees and the State, why has it taken so long for the Government which is meant to be focused on job creation to come up with this simple and basic measure to save, create and retain jobs?  Why has it taken until now when we have reached the point where 450,000 people are unemployed to come up with such a simple measure?  The answer to this question is that the Government does not have a job creation strategy.  This is a feeble attempt by it, on a night when the CSO figures have been published, to portray the image that it is doing something about the problem.  Regardless of whether one agrees with the PRSI exemption scheme, its impact will be tiny in the face of the current massive crisis, the effects of which are felt in every street, village and townland.  I come from County Donegal, in which one third of the workforce is unemployed.  I challenge the Minister of State to inform me of any other county in which one third of the workforce is unemployed or on the live register.  It is an absolute disgrace and the legacy of the Government.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Government is wasting two hours in the Seanad debating a job retention scheme that only deals with a tiny part of a massive puzzle that must be put together to get the aforementioned 450,000 people back to work.  It must get to come back the people who have left the country because they no longer have hope the Government and the country&rsquo;s leaders are providing solutions to enable them to use the academic or technical skills they have acquired through third level courses or the institutes of technology to build the economy.  They have given up and left the country.  What is happening in the House tonight is a farce.  It is a charade aimed at trying to fool the public and showing that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government have a job creation strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not support the Fine Gael amendment.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s NewERA policy is flawed.  The only people who would be put to work in the next year under that policy are the NewERA board of directors.  However, that is not my major concern, which is that Fine Gael would sell off State assets such as Bord G&aacute;is.  I come from a county in which there is no gas supply, as is also <Col N="781"/>the case in many rural areas in the west.  I do not wish to be in the position we are in today with Eircom where the Taoiseach and Ministers have to go down on one knee to beg it to provide basic services such as broadband connectivity for rural towns and villages.  We do not wish to see that happen in the supply of gas.  I hope areas such as County Donegal will be connected to the gas network in the future.  That is my major concern with the NewERA policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That said, the amendment has many aspects.  It mentions the reality of the Government&rsquo;s handling of the economy and its injection of our money time and again into zombie banks instead of getting people back to work.  I have said many times in the Chamber that everyone who becomes involved in politics does so to better society and improve the country to the best of his or her ability.  However, sometimes people are out of touch.  I saw this clearly on Tuesday when I attended the protest organised against the cuts in funding for services for people with intellectual disabilities.  Respite care services are being reduced.  Given the scarce resources invested by the Government in the past and now being withdrawn, it was heartbreaking to see people in wheelchairs outside Leinster House, while at the same time being aware that in the coming days or weeks I would be debating legislation in the House to put billions of euro into zombie banks and collapsed institutions at their expense.</P>
        <P>There is no way I can support the Government&rsquo;s proposal because it does not go far enough.  If one really wants to deal with the crisis, one needs to look at the various options provided.  As a party, we have provided detailed, costed proposals to get the country back to work.  One of the proposals involves a youth jobs fund to create 20,000 jobs which was costed by the Department.  Another proposal involves producing an individual plan covering the long-term prospects of every person under 25 years of age on the live register.  More than 86,000 in that age category are unemployed.  Why are we not looking at their long-term prospects?  Shifting them from here to there on courses is not good enough.  We have argued that 2,000 places should be provided under a &ldquo;one more language scheme&rdquo; to give young unemployed people a chance to learn a foreign language.  That would help to support the export-driven economy which we must create.  We have argued that 10,000 additional community employment scheme places should be provided, with 1,000 places on conversion courses, to help third level graduates who have acquired skills that are no longer in demand to acquire skills more in demand.  Another proposal involves a national development scheme to employ 2,000 people directly on public works projects.  If the Minister of State had come to the House with such a series of proposals, we would have considered them.</P>
        <P>As a party, we have costed our proposals, showing where one could receive the finance and generate the income for the stimulus injection for which we are calling to put people back to work and give hope to those calling to my office and those of other Members in both Houses looking for help in seeking passports and organising their farewell parties as they head off to Australia, America or other far-flung destinations, some perhaps never to return.  It would only be in that context that I would support a Government initiative.  Whether one agrees with the proposed scheme, the reality is that it does not go far enough.  This debate is nothing more than a charade.</P>

        <P>On a day when the CSO statistics were published it is important to reflect on the situation.  Even if the recession is technically considered over, that is not the case for the many who remain unemployed.  It is not a happy day in any home in which there is someone unemployed. <Col N="782"/> That is the major concern of the Government, as it should be.  It has created the environment that will allow jobs to be created.</P>
        <P>I wish to resume where Senator Quinn finished.  Other speakers also referred to him.  He is a man who has created many jobs and knows how to conduct business.  I do not wish to single him out, as the same is true of many others in the House.  Senator Brady also said the Government needed to create an environment in which jobs could be created.  However, we cannot have a situation where everyone is dependent on the Government to create jobs.  That is something we need to make clear.  I appreciate the initiatives proposed by the Government because they are part of the enabling environment being created.  We need to ensure we listen at all times to those involved in the small and medium enterprise sector because it is the backbone of the economy to learn how we can assist them to create more jobs.  That is where we will build sustainability.</P>
        <P>We all need to do our bit.  For example, last year it was apparent that many were travelling to the North to do their shopping.  When I was at school, my school supported the guaranteed Irish campaign.  We should aim to keep jobs in local towns.  If we support local businesses, they, in turn, will support us.  That is always the way it was and communities thrived as a result.  We must get back to that principle, whether it is in the local shop in a city or rural area.  We must remember that we must be consumers of services.  There is growth in the economy, which means we can loosen the purse strings and spend a little.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>An interesting point was made on the news this evening, that while we should not forget the unemployed, we should also not forget the under-employed, those who are highly qualified but not doing the work they are qualified to do.  The Government will not rest until the unemployment figures come down again.  We got it right previously.  Through tax incentives and other measures we have managed to create strong and viable industries.  We must return to that goal by means of the Government creating the enabling environment and cutting down on red tape in order that jobs can be created.  I, therefore, welcome the scheme, as one of the initiatives needed to achieve that goal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members on all sides of the House for participating in an interesting and incisive debate.  I am the first to acknowledge that just because public representatives, Deputies or Senators, are in opposition they are not devoid of ideas.</P>
      
        <P>Democracy works through the pooling of ideas.  If one has an effective Opposition, it should be in a position not only to criticise and call the Government to account but also to bring forward viable and positive proposals to help the generality of the population.  I would be the first to acknowledge the comments made on the Opposition side.</P>
        <P>Once again, I am somewhat disappointed with the Sinn F&eacute;in representative, Senator Doherty.  I appreciate that Sinn F&eacute;in is the party of protest but to make the speech the Senator made in the House without making even one solid proposal to resolve the issues we have been debating gives an insight into the way the party thinks in terms of its contribution to the democratic institutions of the State.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in is a party of protest and I suppose one must forgive it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A point I made was repeated by speakers on all sides of the House, namely, that what this country now needs, apart from specific job creation proposals, is confidence.  We must have confidence to proceed towards generating more work to get those on the live register back into employment.  Already consumer confidence has kicked in.  I referred to the scrappage scheme as a possible catalyst for change.  Having spoken to people in my part of the country and Senators from all sides of the House, I note there has certainly been a positive upturn in business and consumer confidence since the earlier part of the year.  The Minister of State has <Col N="783"/>said we are now officially out of recession.  This is only a statistical conclusion and we must realise there are still people who are hurting.</P>
        <P>I want to nail again the suggestion that the Government does not care.  If it means re-emphasising this to the point where it sounds boring, I will do so because it does care about unemployment.  One must accept that we are all human and live in our own environments, towns and villages.  Not only are people in our own families facing the trauma of unemployment; so, too, are friends and neighbours.  It is churlish to suggest that, collectively, the Government has somehow taken its eye off the ball and is looking in directions other than the main focus.  The theme running through this debate has been how we can reduce the number of unemployed and get more people back to work.  That is why I, with others on the Government side, have outlined several proposals and actions to reduce the number.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the number on the live register has again shown a monthly increase.  Behind the statistics, there are several thousand people who were working last month but who are not working this month.  One must reach out to them in the best way possible and understand how difficult it must be for them and their families.  However, the number on the live register rises every June, without exception, owing to seasonal factors.  I have no doubt this trend will be reversed in the autumn.</P>
        <P>A significant number of those who have been on the live register since the beginning of May are people who have been supported in a return to education and training through the back-to-education and training allowance.  Recipients of the allowance qualify for the jobseeker&rsquo;s payment during the summer break.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that, despite the global downturn which is not confined to this country, we have still managed to retain 1.8 million in the workforce.  This point was repeated in the debate.  In 1997 there were a little under 1 million in the workforce.  The number reached a high of 2.1 million or 2.2 million during the height of the Celtic tiger.</P>
        <P>As a result of the downturn and recession in recent years, primarily but not exclusively in the construction sector, and the breakdown in consumer confidence, whereby the savings ratio reached its highest value ever, people just did not want to spend money.  They are now beginning to loosen the purse strings.  If this confidence continues to ripple through the economy and is coupled with the Government&rsquo;s initiatives, particularly the PRSI initiative, I have no doubt that there will be a significant drop in the number unemployed.  I will not be a crystal ball gazer and predict a particular figure, but I have every confidence that the Government initiatives are working their way through the economy and creating and maintaining jobs.  I have every confidence also that by the end of the year there will be a significant reduction in the number unemployed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, for being present for the debate and for her very positive and upbeat contribution.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to table the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2010 before the House and I look forward to an informed debate during its passage through the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The renewed programme for Government includes a commitment to introducing legislation to prohibit the practice of deer hunting with packs of dogs.  This short Bill provides for the banning of that particular hunting practice.  In addition, I have taken the opportunity to increase the maximum fines for wildlife-related offences, which were last increased in 2000, and to resolve an issue that arose recently in regard to licences to shoot wild game.</P>
        <P>Section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976 provides that I, as Minister, may grant to the master or other person in charge of a pack of hounds a licence authorising the hunting of deer by that pack during such period or periods as specified in the licence.  However, the 1976 Act does not provide criteria for awarding or refusing a licence.</P>
        <P>There is only one stag hound pack in the State, which operates in County Meath.  Since becoming Minister, I have had concerns from an animal welfare and public safety point of view relating to the operation of the hunt meetings operated by the hunt club in question.  These concerns were shared by some of my predecessors.  The hunt club maintains a herd of domesticated red deer in purpose built deer parks that adjoin their hunt kennels and normally holds approximately 50 meetings between October and March.  I do not consider it acceptable in this day and age to allow a hunt with hounds and horses of what is essentially a farmed animal.  We do not consider it acceptable to set dogs in pursuit of any other farmed animal.</P><Col N="785"/>
        <P>Public safety issues are also involved, as it is not possible for the hunt to prevent deer in flight from leaping through hedges onto public roads.  Senators may be aware of an incident last December during one hunt meeting when a deer needed to be put down after leaping onto a road and colliding with a car.  While there were no injuries to the occupants of the car, this incident was unacceptable.  This is not the first such serious incident.  A few years ago, a deer being chased by hounds leaped into a school yard just as the school day was finishing.  At the time, there was a great deal of disquiet about this type of hunting, with much adverse media coverage given to the incident.</P>
        <P>These are not isolated incidents.  I have much anecdotal evidence of further incidents.  Were there to be an accident with serious implications, there would be political repercussions.  The Opposition would be asking serious questions of the Minister because he or she is the one who licenses the activity.  There have been suggestions that I should impose further conditions in the licence to address these issues.  I attempted to take this route, but concluded that solving the animal welfare and public safety issues was not possible under the Wildlife Acts.  Therefore, the Government decided the animal welfare and public safety concerns relating to stag hunting could only be addressed by banning this hunting practice.</P>
        <P>The Bill is short and simple.  Section 2 provides for the deletion of the section in the 1976 Act that allows me, as Minister, to grant a licence for the hunting of deer with a pack of hounds.  Section 3 of the Bill redefines &ldquo;deer&rdquo; for the purposes of the legislation so the term includes any deer that is not a wild animal.  This expanded definition has been incorporated into the Bill to ensure there is no argument that the hunting of captive bred deer might not require a licence under the Wildlife Acts.  The Bill makes it an offence to hunt deer with two or more dogs, but makes an exception for licensed deer shooters hunting on foot or persons with a specific permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Bill addresses a problem that arose recently in regard to licences to shoot game during the open seasons.  The Wildlife Act requires a hunter to have a licence to hunt certain birds, such as wildfowl, and hares and made provision that this would be obtained as an endorsement on the hunter&rsquo;s firearm certificate.  The hunting licence and the firearm certificate were issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the form of a shotgun licence with the appropriate endorsement for hunting.  However, when a new computerised procedure was introduced in 2009 for the issuing of three-year firearm certificates, the facility for issuing the endorsement as a wildlife hunting licence was omitted.  As a result, new firearm certificates do not provide for a hunting licence attachment and do not meet the legal requirements of the Wildlife Acts.  Consequently, hunters who had been issued with new certificates would not be able to hunt legally.  I understand that, by the time the oversight was identified, it was not practicable to recall the certificates issued nor to change the licensing process then in train.</P>
        <P>This matter should be borne in mind.  As Senators know, it has been suggested that this legislation is somehow the thin edge of the wedge and that we will stop shooting etc.  The Bill contains the provision to allow the shooting of deer and wildfowl.  I ask people to bear this in mind when making allegations across the floor, which were flying in the D&aacute;il yesterday evening.</P>
        <P>To address the certification problem, the Bill amends the Wildlife Acts so a new section 29(5)(<i>a</i>) is created whereby a firearm certificate issued for a shotgun between 1 August 2009 and 1 August 2012 will be deemed to be a hunting licence for game species such as wildfowl and hares.  In the interim, arrangements will be made between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to revert to a situation in which the hunting licence is endorsed on the firearm certificate.  This will not affect the current system of issuing licences for shooting deer.</P>
        <P>Sections 5, 6 and 8 of the Bill are technical consequential amendments to section 4.</P><Col N="786"/>
        <P>I will turn to the part of the Bill relating to the increase in penalties for wildlife-related crime.  Section 7 provides for increased penalties for offences under the Wildlife Acts.  I have decided to increase these penalties, as they have not been increased since 2000.  I am increasing maximum fines so that, on summary conviction, the maximum fine is increased to &euro;1,000 from &pound;500 for a first offence, to &euro;2,000 from &pound;1,000 for a second offence and to &euro;5,000 from &pound;1,500 for a third or subsequent offence.  In addition, the maximum fine for conviction on indictment is increased to &euro;100,000 from &pound;50,000.  There are no changes in maximum times of imprisonment.  It is important the State should use every means at its disposal to ensure our natural heritage, including our wildlife and habitats, is protected.  The new penalties proposed in the Bill are proportionate and I am sure the House will support the increased fines.</P>
        <P>Turning to the general reaction to the proposed legislation, I reject the notion that the Bill is an attack on country pursuits or will lead to an urban-rural split.  The legislation&rsquo;s passage will not impact on other country practices.  There are a great many people from and living in the countryside who wish to see an end to carted stag hunting.  Propaganda has been put out in an effective campaign on behalf of Rural Ireland Says Enough, RISE.  It knows well that the hunt in question is a small one, so it must scaremonger and try to get as many people on board as possible.  It has been successful in this regard, but the propaganda has been put out in an irresponsible way and I hope Senators will not continue with it.  Let us have the truth in this debate.</P>
        <P>Some hunting organisations have cited the Bill as a clear sign of an all-out attack on the hunting fraternity.  As the Bill will affect the last carted stag hunt in the country, this hardly constitutes an attack on what are known as &ldquo;traditional field sports and rural pastimes&rdquo;, as claimed by a recently formed organisation.  The vast majority of people involved in legal hunting in this country will have nothing to fear from the enactment of this Bill.  My Department will still be issuing licences for deer hunting and fox hunting is not affected by the Bill.</P>
        <P>Turning again to the hunt, some of the debate in the D&aacute;il concerned its economic contribution to the economy of Meath and north Dublin.  This was examined in the regulatory impact analysis which accompanied the Bill.  While I appreciate the hunt has been in operation for over 150 years, the banning of stag hunting does not mean its members will give up equestrian or hunting activities altogether.  Accordingly, the study carried out recently on the economic benefit of the hunt pointed out that it was not possible to say what economic impact, if any, would arise from the cessation of stag-hunting.  Furthermore, it is nonsense to suggest the cessation of this one activity will have an impact on Ireland&rsquo;s bloodstock or horse racing industries, or indeed on the supply of national hunt jockeys, of whom Ireland is rightly proud.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has been said this Bill along with the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill is evidence of an attack on rural Ireland.  This charge is being levelled all the time.  I am aware that Members of both Houses have concerns with regard to certain aspects of the dogs Bill and as I stated in this House on Report Stage, I will be bringing forward amendments to this Bill during its passage through the D&aacute;il to address these concerns.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I reiterate that the Bill has three main purposes: to ban the practice of hunting deer with packs of hounds, to increase the various fines for wildlife related offences and to resolve the issue of licences to shoot wild game.  The vast majority of people engaged in hunting activities will continue to enjoy their pastimes following the enactment of this legislation and most will in fact benefit from it.</P>
        <P>I look forward to engaging in productive debate on this legislation and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="787"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Along with many people in this House and beyond, I have been closely watching the debate in the Lower House.  Neither I nor my party, Fine Gael, welcomes the Bill because we believe this is, essentially, trophy legislation which the Minister&rsquo;s party has won as part of its programme for Government.  We see this as the thin end of the wedge as regards banning stag hunting, initially.  We are very concerned this trend will continue and the debate will go on.  Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, who I admire and respect, has referred to the power of lobbying and the Minister has mentioned the power of the RISE lobby.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The RISE lobby engaged with stakeholders right around the country.  It did not do anything illegal.  It brought the terms of this, and indeed other legislation such as the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, to the attention of the stakeholders who are directly involved and on whom this legislation will impact.  I certainly do not see anything good, bad or indifferent wrong with that.  The Minister should note also that ten local authorities resolved to oppose the legislation.  That resolution encompassed members of diverse parties and I remind Members opposite that those same local authority members vote for Senators to elect them to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  RISE was not engaging in anything illegal, but rather engaged in the debate in a fair and competent manner, which it is entitled to do.  In any debate one is entitled to hear opinions from allsides.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Criticism has been levelled at the Minister from many quarters to the effect that proper consultation and engagement with stakeholders did not happen.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and I have heard agencies involved in deer stalking express their concerns at the lack of engagement and the consequences of this Bill for their activities.  Only very late in the debate, when the Minister was literally forced into amending the legislation, has he allowed deer stalking to continue.  This is just an example of the lack of consultation to date on this legislation.</P>
        <P>I admire much of the Green Party&rsquo;s ideology and principles as regards renewable energy, climate change and many other areas.  However, I do not agree with the path it is pursuing as regards animal welfare.  There are ways of regulating and monitoring in the event of genuine concerns about animal welfare, without affecting traditional rural and country pursuits.  Indeed the Ward Union had a good monitoring and regulatory system in place in which both it and the State invested large amounts in resources to ensure stag hunting was a safe and proper practice.  It is legitimate to say this is the thin end of the wedge if the Minister wants to ban that style of hunting.  What is to stop the Minister from widening the debate further to introduce bans as regards fox hunting and other areas?  That is a real concern.</P>
        <P>The Ward Union has been around for more than 150 years and all these points have been made clear to the Minister.  Many Government Deputies spoke in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in a very passionate and emotive manner on how they are opposed to the legislation.  Unfortunately, the Whip of Government reined in most of them, apart from one or two, but that is the way of politics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Hunting, I remind the Minister, is the stuff of Irish legend and folklore.  It is the stuff of Irish rural tradition.  I mentioned the other day the stories of C&uacute;chulainn as well as Fionn and the Fianna.  The Minister might smile, but that is our legend and our heritage.  That is where much of our basic human hunting instincts come from.  I do not see any reason why, if they are properly regulated and monitored, those hunting practices should not continue.  I include stag hunting by the Ward Union in that.</P>
        <P>We have legitimate questions to ask as regards why the Government is prioritising legislation such as this in very difficult recessionary times.  These are times of rising unemployment, with families in distress with mortgage repayments, redundancies, lack of supports in social welfare, <Col N="788"/>and in care and respite packages.  We have heard the outcry among the public as regards why so much time and effort is being dedicated by Government to ensure legislation such as this is being prioritised, when other areas such as the last item on the Seanad agenda tonight, on incentives for employment, are not being given the same priority, compass and muscle they deserve from Government.  People cannot understand why this is the case.</P>
        <P>The Green Party has a narrow focus, to which it is entitled, but also a very limited support base that is out of kilter with the party&rsquo;s strength in Government as regards legislation.  It is getting enormous support from Fianna F&aacute;il, very reluctantly I suggest, for such legislation.  I want to put on the public record that there is real concern in rural Ireland that fox hunting, greyhound racing, coursing, shooting and fishing and indeed, horse racing will be the next targets for many of the lobby groups and people the Minister listens to.  It seems to be Green Party policy too to oppose live animal exports.  That is another area which farmers are very concerned about.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I should not be fulfilling my obligations as the representative of a rural constituency and carrying out my responsibilities if I neglected to highlight these genuine concerns to the Minister at times of legislation such as this.  We shall be engaging next week on the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, when it comes back from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Again, I want to put on the public record the fact that Fine Gael submitted very reasonable amendments to that legislation, concerned as it was about the impact it would have on the future of greyhound racing and hunting.  It was an insult, and I do not say this lightly, that the Minister was not willing to accept any of those amendments, and yet he was willing to take them into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in one form or other and accept them there.  That is an insult to Senators and I ask the Minister not to carry on such a practice in future legislation.  It is a slight on this House and it should not happen.</P>
        <P>As an example of how the debate has widened, I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to a letter in <i>The Munster Express</i> which is circulated in Waterford, around the whole area of firearms and guns.  The Minister has mentioned that this legislation will put right some of the wrongs and slackness that has been introduced by Government with regard to firearms.  Many legitimate users of firearms for hunting and shooting did not have correct firearm certificates for the past year which section 4 will rectify.  It is a disgrace the Government introduced earlier legislation which exposed genuine and legitimate firearms-users in such a way.</P>
        <P>I referred earlier to a letter published in <i>The Munster Express</i> on 18 June 2010.  While I will not give the writer&rsquo;s name and the attendant publicity, it was from one of the anti-bloodsports brigade which has lobbied the Minister and has his ear.  The letter stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">While the tragic shooting in Cumbria is upsetting, the reality is that there are thousands of people in this country of the same ilk who carry out the same homicidal tendencies but instead of a human target direct their lethal firepower towards animals and birds.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is not a great leap from aiming at a live animal to aiming at live human[s].  People who are violent towards animals rarely stop there.  Constant exposure to animals and birds been abused destroys the viewer&rsquo;s moral barriers.  Those who hunt and kill animals for recreation are a viable danger to society.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are the crazy crackpots the Minister is listening to and about whom we in rural Ireland are genuinely concerned.  Letters such as this, comparing legitimate firearms-users carrying out age-old traditional rural pursuits of hunting and shooting to insane criminals, display the twisted logic of those who claim they are anti-bloodsports.  As an Oireachtas Member I will certainly <Col N="789"/>be standing up against such twisted logic.  Letter-writers such as this are the insane ones.

        <P>The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill has generated quite an amount of debate over the past several months.  Initially, there was some fear about the legislation, which I understand as a countryman living in a town.  Unfortunately, in this debate there has been much fanning of these flames of fear by some.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has given reasonable and sincere assurances, however, to assuage these fears.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I received much correspondence from many sources, such as the RISE organisation and the reasonable people involved in rural pursuits, outlining their concerns about the legislation.  I accept, however, the undertakings given by the Minister which he reiterated tonight.</P>
        <P>The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2010 was published on 20 April.  The ban on stag hunting with hounds has been introduced as an amendment to the existing Wildlife Act.  The Government has decided this particular hunting practice should cease for animal welfare and public safety reasons.  The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to give legislative effect to the commitment of the renewed programme for Government to ban the practice of stag hunting with a pack of hounds.  The Bill also provides for increases in penalties for breaches of various provisions of the Wildlife Acts.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has made it clear that this legislation will not have any implications for other country pursuits such as fox-hunting, hare coursing, deer stalking or angling.  The Taoiseach also made it clear when he commented on some indications that the legislation represented a wider issue in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 April 2010:</P>
        <P LI="1">There isn&rsquo;t an issue between the coalition partners on the fact that there is a Bill, as you know, coming forward in relation to stag hunting, which in no way affects the wider issue of country pursuits generally.  I&rsquo;d like to make that clear.</P><Col N="790"/>
        <P FLI="0">The Bill provides for the repeal for section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976 which enables the Minister to grant a licence to the master of a pack of stag hounds to hunt deer.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides for a new provision making it an offence to hunt deer using more than two dogs.  This provision includes the hunting of deer by any holder of an appropriate hunting licence or permission granted under the Wildlife Acts.  For the purpose of this section, deer includes deer which are not wild animals.  It shall not make it an offence where the person has been granted permission under section 42 of Wildlife Acts to use dogs to drive deer off lands in which they are causing serious damage to tree plantations or crops, i.e. deer stalking.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to several incidents involving public safety and deer hunting.  On one occasion, a deer found its way on to the R152 Kilmoon to Duleek Road and was hit by a Mercedes car.  It had to be put down soon after.  In November 2008, a pair of stags were released, one of which lay down on the Trim road for seven minutes while the other crossed the unopened M3.  There was also an incident in which a pursued stag entered a schoolyard during a school break and in which children could have been seriously injured.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the past several years urbanisation has increased in east Meath and north County Dublin, areas where stag hunters operate.  Opponents of stag hunting argue that hunting domesticated animals is irreconcilable with animal welfare legislation and that satisfactory alternatives exist.</P>
        <P>Some of the greatest conservationists are members of gun and angling clubs.  Some species of wild bird would be extinct in this and other countries if it had not been for the actions of gun club members.  I always remember gun club members in the Mullingar area rearing pheasants and releasing them into the wild to ensure stocks were maintained.  Angling clubs did much work in protecting flies&rsquo; habitats to enhance fish stocks.</P>
        <P>The Minister earlier said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Turning to general reaction to the proposed legislation, I reject the notion that this Bill is an attack on country pursuits or will lead to an urban-rural split.  I will state here again that the passage of this legislation will not impact on other country practices.  There are a great many people from the countryside and still living in the countryside who wish to see an end to carted stag hunting.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I want to see more people living in the countryside because its population is being denuded.  I will be supporting the legislation and I am delighted by the assurances given by the Minister.</P>
        <P>I wish to put on record that I would appreciate if Ministers took on board the views expressed by Members when they come to the House.  While I welcome the tabling of amendments in the other House, and better late than never, this House should have been considered in the first instance given the Bill was initiated here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to support the Minister, who has sometimes fought a rather lonely battle on this issue, but I believe it is a battle of principle.  I acknowledge my own background.  My mother loved the idea of the hunt.  As a result of arthritis she was unable to hunt herself exactly, at least not foxes.  However, she was a pretty good woman for hunting mice and rats in the back garden.  I eat meat, fowl and fish.  As long as they have a reasonably natural life and do not meet their end cruelly, that is fine by me.  However, I deplore factory farming and the obscenity that has been revealed, especially in the United States, where the people engaged in this noxious practice are so ashamed of what goes on that they will not permit proper and impartial inspections.  I am a meat eater but I also eat lettuce.  I am quite entertained by some of the slogans that are fired around about sandals and lettuce <Col N="791"/>and so on.  I wish I had long hair but, alas, I can no longer sport it.  These are the stereotypes bandied around.</P>
        <P>With regard to crackpots and cranks and with due deference to my good friend on the Fine Gael benches, Senator Paudie Coffey, their existence in support of an idea or principle does not discredit either the principle or the idea.  Otherwise, there would be no religions or political parties because there are crackpots everywhere and we must separate the crackpots, cranks, extremists and fanatics to one side and then look clearly at the issue.</P>
        <P>On this point, I have been lobbied.  I have seen the posters outside and I have spoken with those involved.  Some of them expressed disappointment with my position and some of them are friends of mine.  They behaved in a thoroughly gentlemanly fashion, to me at least, quite unlike the real crackpots, lunatics and fascists who belong to organisations such as C&oacute;ir.  Although one or two of these sport family names such as Greene, they cannot bear to belong to the Green Party.  That is where there is a real situation of a threat to freedom of speech.  For example, last week the five spokespersons on health from the principal parties were violently assaulted and had a poster about AIDS, which they were trying to publicise on behalf of all the parties in this House, violently taken, ripped up and thrown back at them.  I have not met such behaviour from the hunting fraternity.</P>
        <P>I understand a certain sadness when a tradition apparently comes to an end such as the Ward Union Hunt, which is a very famous hunt.  However, having listened to them, it seems they could achieve their objective just as well with a drag hunt.  They maintain the release of the stag is not actually seen by the hounds and that there is no physical contact with the hounds.  If this is the case, if they do not see it, smell it or otherwise observe it, what is the point of frightening the poor thing to death?  The stag must be frightened.</P>
        <P>I have the greatest respect for Senator Hannigan, who sits in front of me and who represents the Labour Party.  However, he astonished me when I heard him say on the radio recently that they might be &ldquo;a little tired&rdquo;.  He has shown a remarkable gift for litotes or understatement for the sake of emphasis.  They are a good deal more than &ldquo;a little tired&rdquo;.  Of course, there is a political dimension to this.  There is a scent abroad, to use the hunting metaphor, of a possible election.  People are doing Swiftian somersaults and other acrobatics to position themselves as well as they can for the next election.  Some of them are trying to satisfy both sides simultaneously which is why there is a lot of negotiating here in the lobbies getting pairs for this, that and the other, such that they do not actually have to come out and make their position clear one way or the other.  RTE made its position fairly clear on the news yesterday.  I heard no less than three people speak, all on the same side.  They were all against the Minister&rsquo;s position.  It seemed to me even the interviewer appeared to have a certain favouring of that side but perhaps that was because he was emotionally overwhelmed by the fact the three people speaking were all committed against the Bill.  This begs the question of where lay the balance in the debate.</P>
        <P>I understand this Bill is narrow and the Minister has said as much.  There has been some squawking about why we do not address the real economic issues.  Why do those people who squawk not take part in the major economic debates that take place here sometimes?  There was a notable absence here during the debate that has just concluded on employment.  Those of us who spoke were rather disappointed that those who were concerned that we were wasting too much time on animals did not see fit to waste some time on this economic debate.</P>
        <P>It is not a very wide-ranging Bill although I wish it were.  However, it is important to address the principle.  There is some case to be made for fox hunting and I will explain why.  There are occasions when the fox population reaches maximum density and, therefore, a cull becomes necessary.  This is always practised, no matter where.  There are various methods of killing <Col N="792"/>foxes.  One can shoot them but the problem is due to the biology of the fox and a difficulty with the composition of its blood, it is an extremely painful death.  Another alternative is gassing them, a pretty nasty way to go.  If one runs a hunt, first, the fox has a chance to escape and second, it operates on the Darwinian principle of the survival of the fittest.  It means the weakest, stupidest or slowest of the foxes are taken out of the population pool.  It is an open question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the emotional association with the prints of Surtees and the stories not only of Somerville and Ross but also the late, wonderful Molly Keane.  Even in her novels, there is an acknowledgement of the horrible cruelty of some aspects of hunting which should be removed such as cubbing, digging out and so on.  I have an open mind with regard to fox hunting.  However, stag hunting is wrong and dangerous but I wish the Bill was broader and I will explain why.  I realise I will lose votes for this view.  I will shed them, like the hairs I have already shed, all over the countryside by saying this: coursing is a nasty and inexcusable practice.  Those people, including members of the clergy, who indulge in the practice should listen to the wise words, first printed in 1516, by St. Thomas More in his <i>Utopia</i> written first in Latin but not translated for 50 years.  Referring to hunting and hawking in his ideal State of Utopia, he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Or what delight can there be and not rather displeasure in hearing the barking and howling of dogs and what greater pleasure is there to be felt when a dog follows a hare than when a dog follows a dog?  For one thing is done is both, that is to say, running, if thou hast pleasure therein.  But it is the hope of slaughter and the expectation of tearing in pieces the beast doth please thee.  Thou shouldst rather be moved with pity to see a silly, innocent hare murdered of a dog, the weak of the stronger, the fearful of the fierce, the innocent of the cruel and unmerciful.  Hunting is the basest part of butchery among the Utopians and yet this is now the exercise of most noblemen.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We are aware of course that reaching right up to our soon to be anticipated visitor, Queen Elizabeth, the royal family slaughtered thousands of birds and other animals very happily.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad to hear it but it is still fairly frightening.  Although that is an improvement, they are sometimes killed.  I will leave the rest of St. Thomas More, except that he suggests an alternative, which is burning frankincense, lighting candles and dressing up in scented robes, a wonderful alternative.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Ward Union Hunt, we know it does not use wild animals.  These are domestic animals.  Few people would allow their own domestic animals to be hunted in this manner and there are examples of packs of stag hounds accidentally coming across such animals and hunting them to death.  The accident that occurred where a frightened and terrified stag was being pursued by hounds and escaped by jumping over a wall into a school car park precipitated many complaints to the Joe Duffy show and, ultimately, this legislation.</P>
        <P>Much is said about public opinion, the country versus town divide and so on.  I listen to many programmes on the wireless and the balance seems to be in favour of the action the Government is taking.  I am absolutely unconvinced that the overwhelming majority of people either in the country or in towns are in favour of continuing these practices and, particularly, the practice of hare coursing, which is cruel and unjustifiable.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to a number of the more outrageous and wayward assertions made by Senator Coffey in his contribution where he invoked the ranting of the &ldquo;crazies&rdquo; as he described them and tried to pin them on the Minister as a philosophical backdrop to what the Bill is trying to achieve.  It was utterly dishonest of him to try to do that.  Just because the <Col N="793"/>comments were reported in <i>The Munster Express</i> does not in any way mean the legislation or any thinking within the Green Party regarding animal welfare is informed by such extremism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>Some might take the invocation of the traditions of Na Fianna as a justification for the continuance of the Ward Union stag hunt as a crazy argument.  Na Fianna was a brotherhood that for initiation required the throwing of nine spears at an individual, according to legend.  If injured, one did not qualify to join.  I do not do down the myth or the legend but to drag that into a modern debate in a parliamentary democracy, of which the Senator is a proud member, is ridiculous.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Various other canards uttered over the past few days regarding this issue also need to be debunked.  The first is that we should deal with more serious matters.  This is routine legislation, which ought to have required a few hours debate, given its basis is in the agreed programme for Government between ourselves and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Any unintended consequences could have been flushed out in the debate.  The fact it has dragged on and dominated the airwaves has nothing to do with the legislation or the programme for Government but it has everything to do with lobby groups, predominantly RISE, which have been readily joined by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in.  That combination has led to this becoming the dominant issue.  We should have moved in public discourse days ago on this issue but instead the debate has been stoked by untruths and wild exaggeration and it is time to finish it.  It is curious that Members want it both ways.</P>
        <P>The second canard is this is the thin end of the wedge, which is dangerous.  RISE and others have attempted to drive a wedge between urban and rural dwellers and between conservationists and bird watchers and hunters who get on with each other on the ground.  Conservationists, bird watchers and so on recognise the important role played by the fishing and hunting communities.  Their members walk the rivers and so on and they witness pollution, illegal dumping and coastal erosion, which they report to heritage officers and local authorities.  As a Green Party councillor in County Louth, I received as many calls from members of those communities as I did from members of BirdWatch Ireland because they knew we shared a common interest, which is the preservation of the countryside.  Their involvement is different from mine, as hunting is not my interest, but we have common cause regarding a healthy countryside that sustains wildlife and the attempt to portray the supporters and proponents of the legislation as being at one end or another of a crazy gang is disingenuous and dishonest.</P>
        <P>With regard to the banning of other rural pursuits, the programme for Government lists three items in the animal welfare section.  Nothing else can or will happen in the lifetime of the Government in the context of the changes the people who oppose the Bill say will happen.  This is scaremongering, which I resent.  I also resent the wild exaggerations about the removal of guide dogs, which was the most offensive comment by a leading member of RISE.  I took exception to that comment, which does nobody any good.  It was an attempt to prolong and politicise the debate and to score some class of a political victory.  It has not, and will not, work.</P>
        <P>On the issue of animal welfare, I refer to an extract from a report on the BBC website by a journalist who observed the County Down stag hunt in 2005.  I am removing the issue from this jurisdiction to take the heat out of it.  It is a factual account by a relatively disinterested party.  As a BBC journalist, we must take it he is reputable.  He describes the hunt on a frosty day near the Dromara hills in County Down, stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">If it is to escape the hounds, it must use this early speed to give the dogs the slip.  And indeed its early speed is too much for the pack.</P><Col N="794"/>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Head raised like a steeplechaser, it clears a tall hedge cleanly. The deer gallops across a grass field, opening up a gap with the chasing pack.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">But the advantage proves short lived.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Ten minutes later and the stag is already flagging.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The pack is running it down and once again the deer tries to out-jump the dogs, clearing [this time] a fence into a garden.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">But the pack pours over and through the wire as it continues its pursuit.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Now there is the bizarre sight of stag and following pack running across a lawn, within. . .  yards of someone&rsquo;s front door.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Back into open fields now and the stag&rsquo;s early speed has gone. The hounds arerelentless . . .</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Exhaustion of the quarry is their primary hunting strategy.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Surrounded, the deer forces itself through a narrow gap in the thorns [on to a road].</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The spectacle draws crowds of onlookers &mdash; the narrow roads are jammed as people vie for the best view.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The stag was not injured but was brought back exhausted.  There is an animal welfare issue, which we are addressing in this legislation.  I am happy and proud to be involved with a party that is championing this issue.  I do not want it segued into a variety of fanciful fears that have been stoked up around the country and that serve nobody any good.  Let us deal with the truth.  I commend the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate the legislation.  I welcome the Minister of State.  There has been much debate about the need for this legislation.  The Ward Union Hunt has been around for more than 150 years.  Over the past few decades, people have rightly asked whether the practices of the hunt were fair to animals.  When my party was last in government, we examined this issue.  Bloodsports are abhorrent to many of my colleagues and we sat down to find a way forward, which would ensure the continuance of this rural tradition and which would be fair to animal and human alike.  Rather than unilaterally impose a fatwa on one group of people, we recognised that the best way to deal with this issue was by involving all the relevant stakeholders.  We sought to strike a balance on the issue which, I agree, is difficult.</P>
        <P>At the time, our Minister with responsibility for this issue was Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  He sought to find a workable, sensible solution to the issue and he introduced a series of regulations, which meant the WUH had to seek a licence for its activities.  The licences governed the operation of the hunt and included limits on the amount of time the animal would be let run, the amount of free-running time the animal would have and the checks in place to ensure the health and fitness of the animal.  Most importantly, it took the kill out of the sport, in the process removing the blood sport element from this rural pastime.</P>
        <P>Since then, the hunt has operated very well.  Others will no doubt mention the various services the hunt performs.  It has a benefit to the local economy in Meath of over &euro;1 million every year.  It provides a fallen animal service and ensures the continuance of the Irish red deer, a species that would otherwise be threatened with extinction.  Of course, there have been some instances that have caused irritation to local dwellers, for example, stags being hit by cars and the like.  I agree that is very worrying but the way to deal with these issues is through regulation, not an outright ban.  I will use the analogy of a car accident.  If we decide a crash <Col N="795"/>has been caused by faulty brakes, we replace the brakes or we introduce regulations to specify a better braking mechanism.  We do not ban driving.</P>
        <P>The current Minister operated under the existing system until last year, when the revised programme for Government was introduced.  At that time the senior partner in Government, Fianna F&aacute;il, needed to get its bank bailout, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, through the Houses so it agreed to give the Green Party trophy legislation, a ban on the Ward Union Hunt.  Let us recall those days of last autumn for a moment.  At that stage there were worries that the Government was about to implode.  There were concerns that the Lisbon treaty referendum would not pass, that the budget would not get through or that NAMA would be voted down.  This triple whammy of legislation worried Fianna F&aacute;il so much that it decided to pay any price to keep the Green Party on board.</P>

	<P>Of course, the Green Party of late 2009 is very different from the Green Party of early 2007.  Many people who canvassed for the Green Party, who were members of the Green Party, are long gone since the party leaders joined Fianna F&aacute;il in Government.  Many now say quite openly that the rank and file membership contains a disproportionate number of the type of people mentioned by my colleague, Senator Coffey.  It is shocking that such a small, unrepresentative minority of our country can have such a grossly disproportionate impact on the laws of the land.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has given them trophy legislation to keep them on board and to keep his political career in intensive care for another few months.  This is no way to run a country.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>If legislation is considered necessary, the Minister should legislate around the existing regulations, and do it in conjunction with the stakeholders because he cannot dictate to them.  I heard him say on the radio last week that his officials have been talking to the stakeholders.  That is not good enough.  He must talk to them directly.  Perhaps then he would understand their concerns, learn about the fallen animal service they provide and understand that without the Ward Union Hunt there would be no obvious way to ensure the continued existence of the Irish red deer.  He might also learn something about deer stalking and about how his legislation fails to take account of the justified concerns of dog owners, deer stalkers and the like.</P>
        <P>This is rushed legislation.  It contains many errors.  It has not followed best practice of involving key stakeholders.  It is the use of a hammer to crack a nut, and it is deeply concerning to rural Ireland.  On balance, it does nothing to improve the welfare of Irish red deer.  For those reasons, we will oppose this Bill.</P>

	<P>Any legislation has a context and, of course, a subtext.  Much of the debate we have heard surrounding this modest legislation, comprising five paragraphs, has been vastly over-blown.  I recall my early days as an elected public representative in Cork city, where the novelty of having a Green Party representative was felt not only in the city area but in the immediate surrounding area, from which I received many representations seeking a response to incidents of pollution and the like, which had not been responded to adequately by other political parties or their representatives.</P>
        <P>One such representation was from a gun club in Watergrasshill in Cork.  It was one of the more surreal experiences of my life as I walked around the grounds of the gun club.  It was a woodlands that was located near a river and a meat processing plant.  The club&rsquo;s difficulty was that the hunting grounds were being contaminated by pollution from the meat processing plant.  I responded to this and the incidence of pollution was ameliorated, with the meat processing plant subsequently paying a fine.  I wonder how that would play out as a rural-urban debate in modern Ireland.  A hunting club had asked that a pollution incident be resolved.  It involved a meat processing plant, which has an economic relationship with the farming community.  Who would be right or wrong in such situations?  The idea that there is a black and white vision of Ireland, and a black and white vision of rural Ireland, is one of the biggest myths to emerge from this debate.</P>
        <P>It saddens me.  In its 80 years of statehood this country has changed from being 80% rural to 80% urban.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not quite.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yet, regardless of where one lives in this country, there is a rural link in the folk memory or within the generations of each family.  My father was an islander.  Not only was he rural in that sense, his family and community were cut off from the wider world by a body of water.  The idea that somebody can have a monopoly on the concept of rural values and life is offensive.</P>
        <P>In addition, rural life has changed in Ireland because of what we have created through the unco-ordinated planning policies of the last 40 years.  Ireland has an urban, suburban, mini-urban and rural context.  What is now defined as a rural community is not a mass of people who have a single-minded view of the life they lead or the communities in which they live.  Whether that is a good or bad development must be addressed in a wider debate but one of my better experiences in my employment life was when I worked as a community development officer for Muintir na T&iacute;re, a body founded by Canon John Hayes in the 1930s in Tipperary.  My area took in east and north Cork, one of the biggest geographical areas in the country.  I learned much from that particular experience, including the difference between community involvement in an urban and a rural context.  As a volunteer I had experience of organising public meetings in a city and if 30 people turned up in a community of 5,000, one was delighted with oneself.  Working for an organisation like Muintir na T&iacute;re I found that if 30 people turned up in a community of 600, people would ask what was wrong and the reason people were not attending and interacting with each other.</P>
        <P>The idea that there is another Ireland that is not understood or that should be fossilised somehow is something this debate, in a positive sense, is helping to crystalise.  Many myths, untruths and half truths have been uttered in the name of defending something that in the 21st century is beyond defending.  It cheapens the idea of rural life.</P><Col N="797"/>
        <P>I wish those who are participating in this debate would think of a context 20, 30 or 40 years from now when they are trying to explain to their grandchildren the reason they put up such impediments and made such strong arguments about minor legislation that needed to be changed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of the legal context, the existing legislation gave the right to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to issue licences to hunts involving carted deer but it did not give the Minister the right not to issue the licence.  What is the point of having legislative power if it is not also a power to say something should not be issued?  The concept is as simple as that.  It is the House putting trust in the Minister of the day to decide whether this particular activity can be continued and condoned in modern Ireland.</P>
        <P>In its activities in the past four to five years the Ward Union Hunt has given ample reason such licences should not be issued.  I refer to the incidents in the school yard.  Anyone who listened to the RTE &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme the other day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;, and I will quote from it although it is far from my favourite radio programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we have come to now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because it usually represents the type of demagoguery we have heard in this debate and the lies and half truths about which I have already spoken.  However, if the Senator listened to the parents of the children who were affected by the visit of the unwanted stag that day, which was pursued by hounds, he will understand that this is a public safety issue.  If we consider the stag killed recently having run into traffic in what is increasingly becoming a built up area, the Senator will understand there is a public safety context to this issue.  That is before we get to any philosophical argument about blood sports and the concept of animal against animal.</P>
        <P>Would I like other legislation to be introduced?  Yes, I would.  Do I believe it will be introduced?  Increasingly, probably not.  Getting this type of agreement in a programme for Government has been difficult enough and listening to the performance of both main Opposition parties tells me that further progress in this area is nigh on impossible.</P>
        <P>I hear the canards about the reason we are debating an issue like this instead of adoption or some health related issue, and we are told about the great economic problems we face as a country, but in a preceding debate in this House members of the Labour Party did not even turn up to participate in or vote on a debate on an economic issue.</P>
        <P>I heard the r&aacute;im&eacute;is from Senator Phil Prendergast earlier.  I challenge her to make the same speech at a Labour Party convention when next that party meets nationally and to have it televised.  I challenge her to have the question asked of every Labour Party member in the country and see whether the game they are playing is one they are prepared to play for generations to come for cheap political point-scoring and capital on a Bill that has been magnified out of all proportion which seeks to change something the majority of people believe should have been changed a long time ago.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy White.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I want to take up a number of points made by Senator Boyle, who always manages to bring out the worst in me.  I am not sure I agree with his analysis that the vast majority of people want stag hunting to be banned.  There may have been some <Col N="798"/>opinion polling on that question but there has not been a declaration by the public that stag hunting should be banned.

	<P>A poll is a poll.  It has got nothing to do with what the general public might do if they were asked a direct question on a specific issue and asked to vote on it.  That is the point I am trying to make.  Senator Boyle should be a little less defensive.  I do not disagree with everything the Senator said; I just disagree with most of it.</P>
        <P>There has been an abject failure in this discussion on the part of the Government to consult with people who are concerned about this issue.  I understand that people from throughout the State are entitled to have views on every issue and I am delighted that Senator Boyle&rsquo;s father is from an island, but I live in a rural area in south Kilkenny.  I am a rural person.  Senator Boyle lives in a city.  He is a city person.  That does not mean that Senator Boyle should not comment on rural issues or that I should not comment on urban issues.  We are all free to express our opinions on those issues, and I have not heard anything from the people opposed to this legislation to the effect that people should not be allowed express their opinion.  However, there is a very vocal group of people in the animal rights movement in this country who have dangerous ideas about the future of farming in particular, and they are driving Government policy in this area.</P>

	<P>The Senator spoke about lobbying.  There has been extensive lobbying for and against this issue but most of it has been regular lobbying.  Compared to some of the lobbying that went on outside the gates today and yesterday on this issue, the lobbying I saw was very reasonable.</P><Col N="799"/>
        <P>It is my responsibility to represent the views of the people in my part of Ireland, and I have no doubt the majority of people who live in Kilkenny do not see this as a significant legislative advance, and would like to see other issues debated in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>There is a central error in many of the animal rights arguments one sees taking place outside this House.  I believe many of the people involved in those movements would prefer to see more rights given to animals than human beings.  I have read some of the comments posted by people on websites, some of whom are involved with the Green Party but some of whom are not.

However, the Bill was not presented by the Opposition but by the Government.  We did not make it into something big.  We have been lobbied extensively from both sides and our in-boxes are clogged with e-mails on the issue which is obviously one that is close to the hearts of people on both sides of the argument.  However, the notion that the Opposition is responsible for bringing the Bill before the House is just ridiculous.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I listened to the debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  Deputy Tuffy spoke about the culling of deer at certain times of the year  &mdash; something of which I was not aware &mdash; and the potential damage this inflicted on young deer.  The Minister of State might be able to outline what, if anything, will be done about culls.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole made one of the best speeches that I have heard on the issue.  He lived in north Dublin for over 30 years and said that, to his knowledge, two deer had been killed during Ward Union stag hunts &mdash; it might have been more but he remembered two instances only.  One was killed by a car, while the other was shot when it went into a farmer&rsquo;s yard.  Far more deer are killed on the roads throughout the year, whether it be in the Phoenix Park or certain other parts of the country, than by the Ward Union Hunt or any other hunt.</P>
        <P>I am sorry to say but I subscribe to the view that this legislation is the thin end of the wedge.  I have never hunted or got on a horse to follow anything in my life.  I have never fished or fired a gun, but I absolutely believe in people&rsquo;s right to hunt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator introduce it when he is in government?  Is that the thin end of the wedge?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Dearey has mentioned the attempt made by the RISE! campaign to drive a wedge between urban and rural people.  In many cases the people involved in that campaign are from urban areas. Many people in towns and cities have dogs and hunt.  I have met many such people in my constituency who believe in hunting and are hunters.  Senator Boyle said that this was a myth and contradicted what Senator Dearey had said.  The rights of human beings are superior to those of animals.  I have read extensively from other sources on the Internet on the issue of speciesism.  The day we enact legislation to give equal rights or equality to animals will be a very bad day.</P>

	<P>Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a thabhairt don Aire St&aacute;it.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy White.  It is a pity the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not present, but I understand he will return to bring the debate to a conclusion.  </P>
        <P>This is a very contentious issue.  I represent a constituency which is both urban and rural in character, that is, Louth-Meath East.  Contrary to the perception held in parts of rural Ireland, this legislation will have no implications for other country pursuits such as fox hunting, hare hunting, hare coursing, deer stalking and fishing or for gun clubs.  It is not the thin edge of the wedge, as Opposition speakers have claimed.  It draws a line in the sand that no other country pursuits will be targeted.  That is the view of many Members on the Government side of the House.</P>
        <P>I also listened intently to the contributions made in the D&aacute;il last week.  Many speakers from north Dublin and County Meath constituencies spoke very passionately on the issue.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the animal welfare and public safety reasons this legislation <Col N="801"/>has been introduced and reiterate the point made that no other country pursuits will be tackled in legislation in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This legislation deals with a specific hunt in one part of the country.  It is true the Minister will not be popular in rural Ireland for introducing legislation which is feared.  Fear is a dangerous emotion in politics and it is dangerous to hear talk of governments collapsing.  However, as Senator Dearey said, in the grand scheme of things, this is not a critically important measure.  Therefore, the Government needs to be united.  We must get the economy back on a stable footing and put in place the foundations to avoid future collapses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I spoke this morning on my local radio station, LMFM, about the stance adopted by many other groups.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s U-turn, a complete 180 degree turn on the issue, is truly extraordinary.  I listened to Deputy Broughan speak on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  He absented himself from the vote in the D&aacute;il last night.  I am horrified that Deputy Gilmore, the wannabe alternative Taoiseach, who actually submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on 26 September calling for, in effect, a ban on stag hunting, last night voted for its retention.  He could be called &ldquo;U-turn Gilmore&rdquo;.  He needs to show credibility and some backbone if he wants to put himself forward to the people as an alternative Taoiseach.  If he stood for something two years&rsquo; ago and now stands for something the complete opposite, one has to ask if he is for real.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the statements made by Deputies Broughan, Costello, McManus, Higgins, Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, Rabbitte, Quinn and Stagg opposing stag hunting.  When Deputy Stagg was last in government, he said it was imperative that the Irish Council Against Blood Sports continued its campaign, yet the flip-floppers who make up the Labour Party in 2010 now say they see nothing wrong with stag hunting.  They chickened out in voting on the legislation last night, just like they chickened out in voting on other legislation.  They said they wanted to smash gangs, but they did not vote in favour of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009.  I also refer to the stance of the Labour Party on education, transport and the new &euro;1 billion jobs fund.  It cannot tell us how this fund would operate and how it would be implemented.  It seems it is prepared to abandon long held policies for short-term gain.  The media and other public representatives should shine a spotlight on it.  I regret that there is no Labour Party Senator present in the Chamber because I would like to hear the party&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>I accept that it is in the nature of coalition Governments that sacrifices have to be made.  Fianna F&aacute;il is making this sacrifice for the Green Party, but I know the Green Party has also made sacrifices on other issues.  That is the nature of coalition Governments, there is give and take on both sides.  Neither side can take the other for granted.  There is a perception that some were not fully listened to or that their views were not taken into account.  This needs to be heeded because it is very important that the Government continues for the next two years.  We all want it to continue and to achieve its aims as a mature, robust coalition Government.</P>
        <P>This legislation is a line in the sand that hunting, fishing and gun clubs will not be attacked by the Government.  The Government focus is on the great issues of the day.  In the budget in December it will aim to take &euro;3 billion out of the economy.  That will be a tough challenge because, as someone described it earlier, we are not dealing with as fat a cow as we were 12 months ago.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Dealing with that will be a major issue that will lead to many contentious matters.  Deputy Mattie McGrath voted against this Bill but we were presented with the toughest budget in history last December and Members voted for it.  We must keep our focus and keep our mind on where we are going as a community and, above all, as a society.  This Government has not made enough of the virtue of taking grossly unpopular decisions for the <Col N="802"/>good of the country.  We could play the game the Opposition played when in government in the early 1980s and mid-1980s of avoiding and continually deferring tough decisions.  This would not be of service to the country, whether we are here for two years or five years.  For Members on the Government side, it is imperative to take the tough decisions because it is the right thing to do for the country.  That is why I support this Bill.</P>

There are more important things to be done.  There are always issues to be dealt with but I wish I saw the same depth of feeling, concern and involvement in other issues.  I do not have a problem with parties doing a U-turn.  My biggest problem with politics is that people cannot change their minds often enough.  I do not know whether the Labour Party is right or wrong.</P>

	<P>They collectively changed their minds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Government side is making a great sacrifice of supporting the non-sacrificial nature of stag hunting.  I have held my view consistently on the matter, that stag hunting, fox hunting or harriers should be dealt with at a subsidiary level.  We should pass legislation enabling decisions at local level by local authorities.  Decisions should be taken by local authorities and landowners.</P>
        <P>I have lived on the border of Meath and Dublin for the past 40 years.  Senator John Paul Phelan referred to what I have seen over the past 40 years.  Nobody will hunt on my paltry three acres.  I would not allow them on my land but if the guy next door wants to allow them it is not my concern.  I have gone through different phases in the argument.  Recently, I was looking at eight pheasants behind my house and if someone had come to shoot the pheasants, I would have throttled the person.  However, there was a time when I shot pheasant and I still eat pheasant so there is a complete contradiction in my position.  The arguments for and against hunting are imperfect.  One can demolish arguments on both sides.  The arguments are imperfect in many ways.  What concerns me is that there is an element of the urban view of the world imposing itself on rural society.  I do not believe that to be the position of the Green Party.  I have great time for Green Party policies and politics.  I disagree with them on this issue but I do not think they buy into that view.  They are taking their position from a considered viewpoint of the world and they are entitled to do so.  I do not attempt to demolish the reasons for coming to their position, which is not unworthy.  However, it reflects a view, although not necessarily a Green Party view, that the centre of Dublin can make decisions for the centre of County Dublin.  This does not wash with me.</P>

	<P>I have lived in the middle of this for 40 years.  I have never followed the hunt or hunted on horseback in my life.  I am always uncomfortable taking a populist view.  The populist view among those who vote for me would be to support this Bill.</P>
        <P>I do not honestly believe cruelty is involved in stag hunting.  The stag does not get caught by the Ward Union Hunt.  We are talking about a young, healthy stag with a half hour start <Col N="803"/>followed by 20 stone men on small horses.  If there is an element of cruelty involved, I suggest that the Green Party looks at the horses involved.  If one was to examine the number of horses that have had to be put down in a hunt over the number of years, it would amount to dozens.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I must continue the argument.  Senator Boyle will not like any of this.  He should relax, calm down and listen to my argument.  If it was an issue of cruelty, we would examine the horses rather than the stag.  This is the case, no matter what statistics are examined.  That is not the case so we will consider the stag.</P>
        <P>The other aspect of this that bothers me is the doctrine of attractivism.  Stags are beautiful animals, deer are gorgeous, Bambi on wheels, lovely antlers and we can hug it, run after it and admire it.  However, no one cares about rats or mice or other animals like that.  Nobody cares that we are still selling rat traps.  Rats spend all night dying with a leg stuck in a trap.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew Senator Boyle would not like the argument.  Should we ban rat traps?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be in the next wildlife Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>People are still selling rat and mouse traps and we should examine this.  People are culling deer.  That is part of what we are.  I have been living in Dublin for over 40 years and I lived near the Phoenix Park for a good number of years in the early part of my life.  The deer there are culled in all sorts of ways and I do not see the difference.  My colleague, Senator Norris, is opposed to stag hunting but in favour of fox hunting.  That is an intellectual position that I fail to accommodate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>What about drag hunting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the same ground the Ward Union Hunt chases a stag it never catches, the Fingal Harriers chase hares they regularly catch.  We differentiate between the gorgeous little red squirrel and the horrible grey squirrel.  This is a case of attractivism.  Nobody cares about crows, everybody cares about robins and other animals we need to protect.</P>
        <P>There is an issue to be examined but the game is not worth the candle.  We should not pass this Bill.  All it will do in my area is create unemployment and more difficulty in respect of knackery services and get rid of people but it will not save the life of one stag.  People will find the following aspect contradictory but it is part of the imperfection of the argument.  In my experience of game associations, those who go out hunting and shooting tend to be the most caring towards the environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>More pheasants, woodcocks and grouse are released in north Dublin every year by game associations than are shot.  I was paying particular attention when this debate began during the last shooting season.  The season begins, as Members will be aware, on 1 November and continues until 31 January.  Normally, one hears quite a number of shots on 1 November.  However, the weather was particularly bad on 1 November last year and consequently, I did not hear anyone out shooting.  I heard a few shots that weekend and while I believe I heard a few shots during Christmas week, I heard very few thereafter.</P><Col N="804"/>
        <P>I cannot argue with the position the Minister of State has put forward in the sense that I acknowledge, respect and support her right to hold that position.  However, my experience leads me to believe this is a bad decision to which there are no upsides, except for a perception to the effect that this is doing the right thing for certain people.  Nevertheless, there are no winners from this legislation.  It gains nothing for the countryside and does not protect it in any way but will remove from active involvement with the environment people who care about wildlife and put more into it then they take out of it.</P>
        <P>I do not understand the reason the Bill refers to wildlife if the deer in question are stall-fed in the first place.  Moreover, I do not know how this will be implemented.  If 30 people decide on the same day to go out hunting separately with a dog each and happen to meet in a field along the way, there will be great fun in the High Court if someone must decide whether that is in breach of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been done in Northern Ireland.</P>

	<P>I think they should do that.  They should do a Daniel O&rsquo;Connell on it, if I may take a County Kerry view on this issue, and test every piece of this legislation.  I do not believe it will stand such a test.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a few points to make.  I was greatly taken by Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s speech because he has put his finger on many key points in this regard.  This is a pathetic excuse for a Bill because there was no need for a Bill of this nature.  This undoubtedly is a Bill directed against rural activities, not because of its intrinsic contents but because of where it can lead.  I reiterate that the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill is directed against rural activities.  Moreover, the Green Party has gone for it and has fallen for a Fianna F&aacute;il trick in this regard, because ultimately this is a political issue.  This is a political ploy to give the Green Party political impact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator suggests that Fianna F&aacute;il asked the Green Party to put forward the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The renewed programme for Government that was agreed in October 2009 includes a commitment to end deer hunting by stag hounds.  However, it appears from the renewed programme for Government that this goal originally was envisaged to be part of the forthcoming animal health and welfare Bill.  However, the proposal to prohibit stag hunting now has been introduced as the stand-alone Bill that is before Members.  Moreover, further amendments are due to be published later this year and consequently, in response to Senator Carroll&rsquo;s remarks, I do not believe for a minute that this constitutes a line in the sand.  He should not fool himself because Senator Boyle has let Members know that the Green Party is not finished yet.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is steering through this legislation.  Fine Gael is defending rural activities and rural Ireland.  I heard Senator Boyle state that Ireland was 80% urban.  I really question that assertion.  First, his statistic is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>

	<P>Second, does he suggest that rural Ireland is not important?  Might I remind the Senator that he comes from one of the greatest point-to-point and horse breeding areas in the country and he should think about that.  The entire role of Members as public representatives is to serve the public well.  Ultimately, Fianna F&aacute;il is responsible for this Bill.  This is because both the Bill under discussion and the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill that will be taken next week both emerged from the programme for Government.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Of this there is no doubt but the Green Party Members must wait to see this.  I reiterate this is an attack on the freedom of country people to partake in rural pursuits that have been in existence for more than 100 years.  Would the Green Party Members prefer us to be involved in the urban pursuits of boy racing or perhaps gangland crime?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>What about cockfighting or badger baiting?  They once were traditions.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Order, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should think of the young people who are productively engaged in such rural pursuits.  In tandem with the comments made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I refer to the benefits derived from learning about conservation, care of the environment and natural culling.  This is the way of nature and the way of the world in a natural way.  The Ward Union contends that hunting with hounds is part of Irish culture and that the proposed legislation will result in the loss of &ldquo;a unique flagship sporting event&rdquo;.  The prohibition also will undermine the capacity for many jockeys to develop their riding skills, for example.  As I mentioned this morning, whips have been removed from Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and Deputy Mattie McGrath.  Next, it will be whips taken from our jockeys.  This is the kind of ludicrous <Col N="806"/>path the Government is taking and it is forgetting about the benefits of horse racing to Ireland and about its great tradition and reputation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>They have horse racing in England.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but guess where they come to buy their horses.  They come here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>They have horse breeding in England too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I will hand over to my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, but I remind Green Party Members that they are fodder for Fianna F&aacute;il, which is using them on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest that the Members opposite take on board and seriously listen to the points made by Senator Healy Eames.  They should be aware they are being given this pig in a poke, this supposed flagship legislation, at a time when getting this sop entails complicity in so many actions against the poor in a Government that is doing nothing about unemployment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that is throwing &euro;22 billion to Anglo Irish Bank.  The price of Green Party support for this is an acquiescence in the most monstrous policies in the history of this State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Members opposite should reflect on Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s cautionary comments to them in this regard.</P>
        <P>I will revert to the issue by noting that I come from and represent rural Ireland.  There is a way of life in rural Ireland that is part of what we are as a people and my submission is that it is as legitimate as any other way of life or subculture in this country.  There are a number of integral parts of rural Ireland in which I passionately believe, value and will defend.  Among those parts are the Gaelic Athletic Association as Gaelic football games are central to rural life.  They were central to the childhood in which I grew up.  Also central to my childhood was sport, by which I mean people going out to shoot in November, people going coursing or various forms of outdoor sport with beagles.  Regardless of whether one likes it, the Ward Union Hunt is an integral part of rural society and rural life.  The deer is not at risk in the physical sense.  It should be noted that if the hunt is got rid of, there is a risk it will lead to the loss of a herd of pure-bred Irish deer.  These unique red deer may become extinct by virtue of the departure of the hunt.</P>

	<P>Why?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael believes this is because if one accepts the inherent logic of this Bill, which I do not as I am in favour of the Ward Union Hunt and have no quibbles about that, by extension one moves on to coursing, shooting, fishing and angling.</P>
      
        <P>It is an illogical position to stop at the Ward Union Hunt.</P>

	<P>No.  I grew up across the road from a GAA ground.  Fine Gael is absolutely correct in what it says.  The Green Party is very much using this as the thin end of the wedge.  We will introduce all manner of fantastic legislation.  We will ban the GAA, horse racing, motherhood and apple pie.  I am being slightly facetious when I say that.  The reality is that ridiculous nonsense is being spoken.  The only conclusion I can come to on the message coming from Fine Gael is that the Green Party will be in Government for a long time to come because otherwise I do not know when we will introduce all that fanciful legislation.  It is clear that the Fine Gael Party believes we will be in government with Fianna F&aacute;il after the next election because it will not accept all that wonderful legislation itself.</P><Col N="808"/>
        <P>Deputy Phil Hogan has made it clear that the Labour Party and Fine Gael will repeal the legislation come the next election.  I do not understand why Fine Gael members are getting so animated.  They seem to think it is acceptable to go against the vast majority of public opinion.  It is extraordinary that we do not seem to take public opinion into consideration at all in the debate.  We do not seem to focus on cruelty to animals.  That is what we are talking about.  We are talking about a deer whose antlers have been lopped off, who has been farmed, which is being chased around the countryside by not only a pack of hounds but by a pack of middle-aged men on horses.  I do not know where the wonderful young people to whom Fine Gael referred are coming from.</P>
        <P>I previously used the analogy of a rugby match where Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll is playing against England and Wales at the same time.  One man, the stag, up against the pack of hounds, let us say the white of England and the red coats of Wales, 30 men running around.  The object of the exercise is to play the man and not the ball.  I find that barbaric.  It is outlandish.  I accept animals cannot be confused with people but it is the most unfair and abusive pursuit I can imagine to hunt a deer that has been raised on a farm.  It is incredible that people can justify that.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>What I find most incredible of all in the debate is that a large number of public representatives have very much misrepresented public opinion.  I listened to &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; with Joe Duffy the other day.  The callers were four to one against stag hunting.  What I found incredible about the show is that those who were in favour of hunting were people from Dublin and those against it, almost to a person, were from rural areas.  That is not coming across in the debate.  People have been lobbied by an extremely expensive PR campaign being run by a recently formed group called RISE!.  The debate is being determined by the Countryside Alliance.  We are allowing that UK group to determine the agenda here.  We need to debate the issue seriously, which has not been the case to date.  The Green Party has brought the issue to the table seriously.  We did not believe this would turn into the big circus that has ensued.  It is sensible legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik introduced sensible legislation on female genital mutilation, which the Green Party considered and on which we worked with her to try to find a solution to the problem.  I commend her enormously on introducing that legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We must work together to come up with decent compromises.  I am disappointed with the Labour Party which I consider is running with the hare and hunting with the hounds.  I am sorry to say that but I am surprised at what has happened.</P>
        <P>Oscar Wilde described hunting as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible.  There is a long history here of animal welfare and people who care about good animal husbandry.  I have heard people refer in the debate to C&uacute;chulain but when one uses phrases such as &ldquo;Tally ho&rdquo;, that is nothing to do with C&uacute;chulain; they are from a different tradition.  The country where it is traditional to use such phrases has banned not only carted stag hunting but also fox hunting.  No jobs have been lost in the parts of the United Kingdom where carted stag hunts have been closed down.  Those hunts are thriving as drag hunts.  Why can we not use common sense, grow up and come into the modern era?  We are not living in the Stone Age.  We are not barbarians.  Can this country get out of its adolescence?</P>
        <P>We made many mistakes in the Celtic tiger era.  The Bailey brothers were to the fore in the Celtic tiger era.  The Bailey brothers are to the fore again in this debate.  The Fine Gael Party supports the Bailey brothers and their friends to whom the Bill applies.  They are a bunch of <Col N="809"/>very rich people who love to go from their nice comfortable houses and run around what is now suburban north Dublin in chase of a deer which has been raised on a farm and has had its antlers lopped off.  Not only does the deer run into schools, it runs into people&rsquo;s back gardens.  We have heard all about it.  Some of the deer are unfortunately killed.  We hear that no deer are killed.  I have heard of a number of instances.  There is a record of deer being killed, drowned and jumping on top of people&rsquo;s cars in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I find the debate incredible.  I do not believe in cruelty to animals.  Some of the people in this Chamber and in the other Chamber need to grow up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White, to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It has become obligatory to say at the outset that one did not grow up in a city.  I grew up in rural Cork where many people in the village followed the fox hunt on foot.  I hope when I speak it is not perceived to be from a position of urban sentimentality or an attractivist-type of argument, as outlined by Senator O&rsquo;Toole who suggested that some of those who support the ban are coming from that perspective.</P>
        <P>This is not an urban-rural issue.  Many people from rural backgrounds are very much against the idea of stag hunting.  I am very much against it.  Like Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, I believe we should not treat animals with cruelty.  I am not a vegetarian.  I accept that animals must be killed for all sorts of reasons but where necessary we should kill them in a humane manner that is not purely for sport without regard to the effect on animals, particularly domesticated or farmed animals.  A strong issue of animal welfare arises but it goes beyond that.  As a criminologist, I am conscious of a great deal of research on the treatment of animals as a measure of the way in which people treat other people.  For example, children who carry out cruel practices on animals are more likely, in certain cases, to be cruel to humans later in life.  How we treat animals and other humans is a measure of human decency.</P>
        <P>Other issues are involved in any debate on hunting, be it fox hunting or stag hunting.  There are class issues, which are perhaps more relevant in England than here where that has really been a dominant focus of debate.  There are public safety issues, to which the Minister, in introducing the Bill in both Houses, referred.  I have friends and colleagues from the Meath area who have had their lands trampled upon and their livestock scared by the Ward Union Hunt.  I accept that is an issue but perhaps a lesser one.  I do not like the tactics of RISE and find them scare-mongering.  The organisation has whipped up a certain reaction to the Bill that is unwarranted and suggests it goes beyond its actual scope.</P>
        <P>I have worked for some years with groups and individuals opposed to stag hunting.  I have provided assistance for them and have a long record on this issue.  For that reason, I cannot vote against the Bill.  The arguments made against the ban suggest there is only one hunt involved.  Perhaps that is all the more reason to be supportive in tackling the issue.  There is a clear distinction to be made between the Ward Union Hunt and the much more widespread practice of fox hunting.  The fox is a wild animal and very different issues are at stake.</P>
        <P>I have read much of the background information on the legislation, including the report of veterinary inspector Kane in 1997.  He described domesticated red deer as being completely unfit for a prolonged chase by hounds.  He also described the handling of the stag as terrifying and stressful to the animal.  He stated the stag became distressed and was exhausted towards the end of hunts and described various aspects of hunts as inhumane.  At the same time, he pointed out in a balanced way that there was no intention to engage in cruelty and that most people involved in hunting did not have such a conception.  He outlined fairly the issue of disturbance to farmers and others tended to be exaggerated.  The report is fair.  I accept that since 1997 some of the criticisms of the hunt have been addressed.</P><Col N="810"/>
        <P>I am conscious that my good friend and colleague from the law school in Trinity College, Professor William Binchy, has taken a public stance on this issue.  He stated recently the hunting of carted stags was a gratuitous act causing unnecessary suffering.  He and a colleague have written on the interpretation of the Wildlife Acts and whether the deer is a wild animal.  That issue is being addressed in the Bill.  For these reasons, I will not be voting against the Bill.  Having said that, I will not take lectures from the Green Party which is taking the moral high ground over the Labour Party on this matter because the Labour Party has a strong record on animal welfare.</P>

	<P>The Kane report of 1997 was produced on behalf of the then Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who introduced the licensing regime that controlled the Ward Union Hunt for many years and which the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has been operating.  The Green Party is the party which has been propping up Fianna F&aacute;il for the past three years.

It is the price of Green Party support for the NAMA legislation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I usually preface my remarks on Second Stage by saying I am glad I have an opportunity to speak on the legislation in question, but it is rather difficult to do so on this occasion because we have turned a fairly straightforward Bill into a complex and emotional argument.  It is disappointing that it was initiated in the other House.  Had the debate commenced in the Seanad, there would have been a much more positive, inclusive, non-partisan and unemotional debate.  The Dog Breeding Establishments Bill which is to be returned to the House towards the end of the week and which is much more complex and has more anomalies is an example of how we should do business.  It was debated fairly and calmly in this House and we were able to make our points without political point scoring.  Sadly, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill has been chopped to bits &mdash; excuse the pun &mdash; in the other House for political purposes and we are now left with the consequences.</P>
        <P>I regret that I was not present for the Minister of State&rsquo;s initial contribution.  It is important that he outline clearly, if he has not done so sufficiently strongly, that this is once-off legislation.  It stems from the renewed programme for Government but is about one hunt and one issue.  It must be clarified that it is not a generic, broad-spectrum attack on country pursuits.  Many of my constituents are genuinely concerned and fearful that it could lead to an attack on sports such as coursing and even fishing.  Every opportunity the Minister of State has to clarify the matter should be taken, as it would be helpful to the broader argument.  The legislation has been passed in the other House and I presume the Government side in the Seanad has sufficient numbers to put it into law by a vote, thus making it legislation with which we must live.  Members on all sides travelled down a <i>cul-de-sac</i> in the debate, particularly in the other House, which was irrelevant and unhelpful.</P>
        <P>I contrast the debate on the Bill with the debate today on animal welfare at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Members dealt with the issue of unwanted, undernourished and stray horses and were trying to put in place a regime of animal care and manage<Col N="812"/>ment to solve the problem.  Whenever we approach the issue of animal welfare, be it from a hunting or cattle welfare perspective, we must try to do so as fairly and reasonably as we can.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of representations I received on the Bill were not from people concerned about the Ward Union Hunt but from those concerned about other hunts across the country.  I referred to fears regarding coursing, fishing and other country pursuits.  Spending a significant amount of Oireachtas time on this legislation and the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill at a time when there are very many economic and social problems facing the country can lead to public cynicism and complaints.  I appreciate that a matter included in the programme for Government must come before us for deliberation and that time must be allowed for it.  I hope that once the Bill is passed and there is a final political adjudication on the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, we will return to the issues most of our constituents hope we will spend most of our time discussing, including job creation, the health service and the broader state of the environment.  I do not see this as a Green Party Bill.  This is a Government proposal which is before us.  There is no colour of any political party on it.  It was agreed by the Government parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in Government members trying to make a name for themselves by going solo at this stage.  My understanding is that it was voted through the two parties of Government at their respective party conventions or conferences, and it is very much Government policy.  We are debating Government, not Green Party, legislation.  We must deal with that political reality.</P>
        <P>While it is simply dealing with the Ward Union Hunt, it is important that the Minister and his Government colleagues, across both parties, re-confirm as strongly as possible that on the hunting of wildlife etc. the Government has no further plans to ban hunts or rural pursuits.</P>
        <P>I also hope that by the time all of us finish for the summer recess common sense will have prevailed on the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009.  In this House we made sensible and substantive amendments, which the Minister went down some part of the road to address.  I hope he will travel the rest of the road in the other House during the coming few days.</P>
        <P>My party has taken a view on this legislation, that it could be a precursor to more damaging attacks on rural Ireland and the rural way of life.  That is the Fine Gael position.  I hope the Minister will be able to persuade us that there are no such further plans.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope we will conclude this debate, in particular the Committee Stage, in a calm fashion in this House and do some degree of credit to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I heard some of the debate across the airwaves this morning from different parties on one side of the House.  I thought quite pathetic and childish the level of shouting and roaring between Members who had lost the party whip in order to make a political point.  That does not do anybody any good.  It certainly does not do the body politic any good.  There is plenty of space and time in both Houses for reasoned and calm political debate.</P>
        <P>The position of Fine Gael is our overall concern about where this legislation may lead us will cause us on this occasion to oppose the Bill but we must try to deal with it in a rational and reasonable fashion.</P>

	<P>I am making my statement here tonight.  I have not taken a position on stag hunting previously.  The Labour Party has not taken a collective position on stag hunting in the past three years since I have been a Member of this House.  We have taken a collective position on this legislation and we are opposing it.</P>
        <P>I am not voting against this Bill because I have been whipped into it.  I happen not to agree with it.  I believe the legislation and licensing arrangement that currently governs the area is quite adequate to deal with the animal welfare issues.  Indeed, had the Labour Party taken a collective position which was in favour of this legislation I would have had to be whipped into supporting it.</P>
        <P>The promoters of this legislation are putting a spin on it that those who oppose it are somehow in favour of cruelty to animals.  I am not in favour of this legislation and I am not in favour of cruelty to animals, irrespective of whether Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in nods his head or not.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two good reasons I might want to support this Bill, that is, those two persons to whom Senator Boyle referred, but that is not my way.</P>
        <P>I married into a farm family in County Dublin, in Oldtown, near Garristown.  None of that family engaged in hunting.  They loved and cared for their farm animals.  They followed the hunt though on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day every year in cars, as many people in the area did and still do.  I have been visiting that farm family for well over 20 years and in all of that time I have never heard any tale after the hunt about a death or injury to the stag.</P>
        <P>There is a licensing arrangement and there are 35 well set out conditions in three categories: general, animal welfare issues and control of the hunt.  Are the animal welfare issues not being addressed adequately in the licensing arrangement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a power not to issue the licence?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister tell us what the advice is?  Has he been advised by his officials that there is a problem, that there are animal welfare issues and that this legislation is a response to that?  I have not heard that.</P>
        <P>This legislation is based on a narrow ideology.  Why should that narrow ideology be imposed on so many people who do not agree with it?</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Gormley, stated he is not going after other hunting pastimes, but why not?  Why leave it at stag hunting only?  Why is the Green Party happy to demand an end to stag hunting and not go after the other hunting that goes on?  There is no logic to that.</P>

Indeed, I read the Green Party&rsquo;s 2005 policy.  The Green Party&rsquo;s welfare policy states the Green Party does not promote or support the live export of animals, campaigns for an end to intensive rearing of cattle, sheep and poultry, campaigns for an end to the use of wild animals in circuses, when in government the Green Party will introduce an end to blood sports with heavy penalties for organisations and participants, and the party does not promote or support traditional zoos in the longer-term and will continue to work towards a complete reformation.</P>

	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il has sold out the people.  They are certainly waiting in the high grass.  Last week, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, mentioned on the news three times that the D&aacute;il and the Seanad want to return to discussing jobs and the economy, but he is the Minister who introduced this legislation.  He is preventing the Houses from dealing with the banks, jobs and the economy.  What a hypocrite.</P>
        <P>By advocating these policies, the Green Party is fanning the flames of division, not just within parties, but throughout society.  I listened to Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in discussing being in Government for some years to come.  The Green Party has three councillors who could hold their meeting in a telephone box.  After the next general election, a telephone box might be too good and too big for the party&rsquo;s Oireachtas representation.  I could say more, but I shall restrain myself.</P>

	<P>When rural Ireland finds out what the Green Party is doing, 17% might be too much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to be calm.  I was surprised when this matter appeared on the revised programme for Government, given the state of the national economy, not to mention the other ailments afflicting every Department.  I am entirely pro-deer.  I am a member of the Kerry Deer Society, which is a conservationist body.  Our primary concern is protecting the gene pool and increasing the number of Kerry red deer, that native strain.  We are delighted that numbers have increased significantly in latter years.  Unfortunately, the number of Sika deer has also increased significantly and they now outnumber the native Kerry red greatly.</P>
        <P>I am also a member of the Irish Deer Society and am familiar with colleagues in County Wicklow and throughout the North, most of whom are hunters.  That is fine in its own way if it is properly licensed and controlled.  However, as Senator Ryan and others have stated, no cruelty is intended in this instance.  Only one hunt is involved.  Senator Cummins mentioned how my part of the country loses a number of deer on the roads closest to me, including the Ring of Kerry and the primary Kenmare road.  Sadly, deer jump on to them at night and get hit by cars.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>

	<P>This occurs on other roads as well, including the Killorglin road.  Deer enter my garden because I am fortunate enough to live on the edge of Killarney National Park on the Killorglin road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Coghlan hunt them?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="819"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at all.  I told the House we were conservationists.  We protect the herd and see that it increases in size and grows stronger.  Thanks to a former Taoiseach, we have populated Inishvickillane with native red.  We have also populated Letterfrack and Doneraile.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>And the Ward Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have reached the stage where, to avoid a serious cull, we need other areas in which to place the native red.  This is important, as there could be a TB attack or so on.  Protecting the strain against possible future attack by placing them in different locations would be a welcome idea.</P>
        <P>I do not understand this issue, as cruelty is not intended.  One deer ran into a school yard and another jumped out in front of a car.  Those are two instances and perhaps there are a few others I am not aware of.  What about it if there are?  It is not intended, and I do not believe we should get over-excited about it.  I am not a hunter and do not understand the kick people get out of it in the Ward Union.  However, we are a &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo; society.  We are respectful democrats, and it is licensed and controlled.  I cannot, for the life of me, see the objection to that or any harm that it is doing.  I am led to believe it projects a good, favourable image of us when visitors come from abroad.  As I know from my part of the world, as do the Senators opposite from Cork, Galway and other places, we do not have enough British visitors.  We do not have enough visitors from anywhere at the moment and that is unfortunately the way it is.</P>
        <P>It would be frightfully sad if, as has been said, this was in any way a forerunner &mdash; I am not saying it is and I sincerely hope it is not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We must protect rural customs, traditions and pastimes.  These country pursuits are worth protecting and we should not do anything that might be injurious or harmful to them.  For all those reasons I am happy there is nothing untoward in this pastime.  It is a pity given our traditions and history that we are now, through Government policy, directing a closure of one hunt.  I find that hard to credit and that is basically my position.</P>

	<P>I am glad to be in a position to respond to some of the Senators who have spoken and to bring Second Stage to a conclusion.  I know there are heartfelt views as regards the legislation, but I honestly believe there has been so much misinformation on this Bill that it is quite disturbing.  People have been fired up and put into positions as a result of this misinformation.  I have a job in hand to explain to people in my constituency that what they have been told is incorrect, inaccurate and needs to be corrected. </P>

	<P>The important point is that there is no interference with any hunting.  This Bill addresses a particular hunt in one location and that is the complete substance and content of the legislation.

	<P Just="Left">That will be admitted by our partners in Government.  We have An Agreed Programme for Government, as we all know.  Safety issues have arisen as regards the Ward Union hunt and we are well aware of that too.  People who are not in the political spectrum have found a very solid platform for their perspective as regards this legislation.  They have used offices of the House and other areas to promote their case.  They have created massive fear among people as regards an attack on rural life.  I know this is not the case, however, and indeed I presented the case to the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party on the issues involved, where there was a need to address section 3 of the Bill.  That was done, following consultation with my Cabinet Minister, Deputy Gormley.</P>
        <P>The issue, as regards an attack on rural Ireland needs to be absolutely discounted from the argument here.</P>

	<P>It is inappropriate to continue to harp on that particular matter and to fuel the discontent and worries.  Over the summer and autumn, the public will realise there is no interference with any aspect of hunting or rural pursuits in any location other than one, and that has to do with the Ward Union Hunt.  There is no interference with any aspect of rural pursuits anywhere in Ireland as a result.</P>

If one goes to Speakers&rsquo; Corner in Hyde Park one will hear all types of people making pronouncements as well.  As a student I used to go there on a Sunday morning and entertain myself when I had no money.  I would stand listening to people on their soap-boxes proclaiming the end of the world.</P>

I respect the comment made by Senator Ryan to the effect there were no changes in his time, in two years.  I respect people&rsquo;s right to say what the position was in their time.  However, I have been in the Oireachtas 21 years and in that time I have heard fairly solid statements from the Labour Party as regards blood sports.  However, I respect Senator Ryan&rsquo;s situation, and I knew his brother, who preceded him as a Member of the House.  When somebody says something like that I will not contradict and say it is different from what has been said.</P>

    <Title>Water Supply</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  While the matter before the House is a local issue, it is one which is causing much distress and anxiety to a strong, rural Gaeltacht community, the community of Magheraroarty.  For many years the people of County Donegal have been aware of issues relating to water supply, especially the pipes carrying the public water supply through much of west Donegal, including the areas of Gaoth Dobhair, the Rosses and Gortahork.  The area to which I refer is Magheraroarty.  In the past two months the pipes have exploded or burst seven times.  In some instances these events have left the community without water, while in others, the water supply had to be turned off.  The Minister of State will appreciate that in this day and age when something like this happens once, it causes annoyance; when it happens twice, there is anger, and when it happens three times, people cannot understand why it is occurring.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a Gaeltacht community, an area in which there is a large number of scholars who come from various parts of the island to learn the Irish language.  It is welcome to see so many people in the area.  When pipes burst, householders are unable to meet basic requirements such <Col N="823"/>as the provision of cooking facilities.  In some houses old style ranges are used to provide heat.  The water flows behind the range and when there is no water flowing, it is not possible to turn on the range, cook dinner for students or wash linen or clothes.  This causes serious problems for the mn&aacute; t&iacute; when, for example, there are 12 scholars staying in one house.</P>
        <P>In this day and age there should not be such a weak system as that in place in Magheraroarty.   I have spoken to senior officials within the county council who have informed me that if one digs out a pipe and examines it, it is like paper in that one can put one&rsquo;s fingers through it.  That is an indication that the pipes are in bad condition.  We are aware that the pipe infrastructure is bad in other areas also, but this area is first on the council&rsquo;s list of priorities and the pipes need to be replaced.  I acknowledge that &euro;2.9 million is earmarked for pipe replacement in County Donegal but phases 1 to 3, inclusive, of all the schemes have to be completed before the money can be drawn down for any scheme to proceed to phase 3, which is pipe replacement.  Although phase 1 has been completed across the county, phase 2 will take some time and we cannot wait because all the departmental and local authority officials and public representatives know this.  While Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill who also represents the county is not present, I am sure he shares my views on this and supports my call.</P>
        <P>We need to remove the red tape.  A sum of &euro;200,000 has been allocated for the Rosses regional network, which is near the Magheroarty network.  However, &euro;378,000 is required to ensure proper pipe replacement can be done on this short but important stretch of the public water network.  Money has been allocated by the Government on the basis that all phases must be completed on a county basis but we need to cut through the red tape, which people on the ground do not understand.  Pipes in the Magheroarty network have burst seven times in two months and will probably do so again in the next few weeks.  Can the money required be secured out of the allocation of &euro;2.9 million earmarked for pipe replacement or through additional funding, including the &euro;200,000 allocated for the nearby network so that this necessary infrastructure, which is the No. 1 priority of the county council can be sorted for the benefit of all those living in the Magheroarty catchment area?</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which relates to water conservation works, which are a priority under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme.  The main objectives of the water conservation programme are to reduce water loss in the public supply networks; to obtain value for money by deferring capital expenditure on new water supply schemes through improved supply and reduced consumption; and to ensure environmental protection by deferring the need to develop new water sources.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are three distinct stages to water conservation on public water supply schemes.  First, a local authority must put in place a water management system that enables the authority to monitor water use and loss throughout the supply networks.  Second, the authority must establish an active leakage control programme which involves locating and fixing leaks and, based on the results of these two stages, it must establish a prioritised pipe rehabilitation strategy for its area.  The third and final stage is the rehabilitation and replacement of defective supply networks where repair has proven to be uneconomic due to the age or condition of the pipes.</P><Col N="824"/>
        <P>Over the past decade funding has been provided to local authorities to carry out water conservation works, mainly for the first two elements I have outlined.  It has led to reductions in unaccounted for water, improved knowledge of the condition of water distribution networks and consumption patterns and an improvement in the level and quality of supply to consumers.  Exchequer spending on water conservation over the past ten years amounted to &euro;168 million.  This investment provides the platform for intensive investment in mains rehabilitation, which is a key priority under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012. This programme is based on needs assessments carried out by local authorities who prioritised key contracts and schemes in this area; with a requirement to give top priority to water conservation works as an alternative to new infrastructure provision.  A greater proportion of the fundsavailable annually under the programme is being assigned specifically to water conservationworks.</P>
        <P>The programme, which was published in April 2010, was drawn up to deal with a number of environmental and economic priorities, including the need for increased water treatment capacity.  The programme also places a greater emphasis on water conservation, providing for network rehabilitation contracts with a total value of &euro;321 million to commence in the period 2010-2012.  Reducing unaccounted for water is an important element in maximising the output from our water treatment plants and funding has been targeted at areas where the level of unaccounted for water is unacceptably high.  As a general rule, and in the interests of securing best value for money from Exchequer investment, my Department does not authorise a local authority to undertake mains rehabilitation works unless it has largely implemented the water management and leakage control works necessary throughout its functional area and has completed its strategy for mains rehabilitation on a prioritised county-wide basis.</P>
        <P>I understand water mains rehabilitation works in the Magheroarty area of Donegal are being prioritised by Donegal County Council for inclusion in the water mains rehabilitation project phase 1 contract, for which I have indicated that funding will be available under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012.  My Department is awaiting Donegal County Council&rsquo;s tender documents for the work, including details of all areas to be covered by these priority works.  Once Donegal County Council&rsquo;s submission for the phase 1 water mains rehabilitation contract is received there will be no undue delay in my Department in ensuring that the work gets to construction in the shortest time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Donegal County Council has to monitor the entire county before it can secure approval to deal with its first priority and the problem is it takes time to monitor water loss throughout the county.  A report can only be provided over a six-month period and not overnight.  Seven times over the past two months, the pipes have burst in the Magheroarty area and people have been left without water.  Is the Department flexible regarding this &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo; in Donegal?  This mains needs to be replaced entirely and the Minister of State can ask any engineer, official or local authority or Oireachtas Member about that.  Everybody in Donegal who knows of this area recognises this.  Will officials and the Minister be flexible and acknowledge this is an exceptional case and that phase 1 for the entire county does not need to be completed before dealing with this emergency?  I appreciate the Minister of State may be unable to give a reply now but if there was willingness to examine this issue with a little flexibility, it would be beneficial.  There would be no additional cost to the Revenue because, at the end of the day, this project will be undertaken.  Unfortunately, under the existing rules, it will only be done when the entire county has been reported on.  Between now and then, more residents in the area will be discommoded by the inevitable leaks in the system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The matter I wish to raise relates to the commencement of work on the provision of a 20-bed primary care centre in Ballinamore, County Leitrim.  This project has been under way for some time.  Everything has been completed, including the planning process.  I am informed by the local HSE office that officials are waiting for approval to proceed.  There was a commitment to provide the centre 18 months ago but there were delays in design, planning and other matters.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could outline what progress has been made on the project, which is of tremendous importance to the people of the Ballinamore catchment area.  They do not have a facility such as this other than the one in Carrick-on-Shannon, which is 20 or 25 miles away for some people.  It is imperative that it be provided.  It is included in the capital plan for 2006 to 2010.  Can the Minister of State, on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, inform me of the up to date position with progress on this project?  It is of tremendous importance to the local community.  People have been waiting for it.  The need for it has been outlined down the years by the HSE and, previously, by the North Western Health Board which had prioritised it.  I would appreciate if that priority would ensure it is included in this year&rsquo;s capital programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not viable for whatever reason, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  We will continue to develop health services around the country, wherever possible, to enhance quality provision and patient safety.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has sole operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services.  The Senator will appreciate that all developments in the health sector, including progressing capital projects, have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures.  The executive has been asked to rigorously examine how existing funding might be reconfigured or re-allocated to ensure maximum service provision.  In particular, we need to ensure that the highest standard of care will continue to be provided to all patients in a safe and secure environment.  Any decisions, therefore, taken by the executive must have regard to the current budgetary position and the current moratorium on the recruitment of nursing and non-nursing staff.</P>
        <P>The HSE has indicated that a design team for the Ballinamore project was appointed in October 2008.  Significant progress has been made to date, to the extent that planning permission, subject to conditions, was granted in late 2009.  The proposed development has significant additional funding requirements, including a capital cost in the region of &euro;6 million and <Col N="826"/>an estimated revenue cost of approximately &euro;500,000 per annum.  I understand from the HSE that planning for the project incorporates: a 20 bed community hospital to include long-stay care services and palliative care services; day care services to include a social model of care with interaction activities and personal care needs; a centre to facilitate the provision of multi-disciplinary primary care services which will ultimately encompass the core multi-disciplinary team of general practitioners, public health nurses, mental health, occupational therapy, social work, chiropody, community welfare, physiotherapy, dietetic and home help services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The key objective in primary care policy is to develop services in the community which will give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams, such as that proposed for the Ballinamore development.  The HSE has indicated that it aims to have 530 primary care teams developed by 2011.  This target will allow the entire population to easily access a broad range of health and personal social services  through the local primary care team.  There are 246 teams currently operating around the country.  Approximately 200 new primary care centres are currently under consideration, following the initiation of a programme to procure centres.  This involves the HSE entering into fixed term lease agreements with private providers.  I understand that 187 of these locations have been approved by the HSE board to proceed with negotiations with interested parties.  In addition to the six centres which have already opened this year, it is planned to open a further 26 centres before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The HSE expects 125 primary care centres to be delivered by 2012, supporting 160 primary care teams.  In addition to these developments, the HSE is continuing to develop primary care centres, which are funded through the executive&rsquo;s capital allocation, and a number of these centres are at an advanced stage of development.</P>
        <P>In light of the current financial difficulties generally, the HSE has had to reassess the projects that can be progressed within its limited capital resources and is not in a position to bring the Ballinamore facility beyond design stage this year.  The possibility for commencing construction will be revisited by the HSE when finalising its capital programme for 2011, within the context of the overall demands for capital developments.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for the reply.  I presume the most appropriate thing to do is to pay a visit to the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, rather than ask this Minister to progress the matter when it is not his Department.  However, it is accepted in the reply that we need to provide it as soon as possible.  It is imperative.  This is something that probably should have proceeded at a faster pace than it did.  The Minister can inform his colleague, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, that she will receive a visit shortly.</P>

	<P>The Senator is in Government, I suppose.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for attending.  This issue relates to the provision of a travel pass for a 19 year old insulin dependent diabetic.  This young man is attending a course in D&uacute;n Laoghaire College of Further Education.  While attending the course he became very unwell, with his <Col N="827"/>diabetes becoming unstable and out of control.  He had to go to hospital.  Subsequently, he has been very well cared for by the team in the hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is led by a number of consultants.  He is required to attend the consultant on a monthly basis.</P>
        <P>He has now finished his course and is living at home in Athlone.  He does not have a job and, as a result, is experiencing severe financial difficulties.  His parents are also compromised financially by the recession and are in receipt of family income supplement.  Throughout this young man&rsquo;s childhood and early adolescence, his mother was in possession of a travel pass which she never used.  She did not need to use it as she had a car.  Logically, he asked me to approach the Department about having her travel pass transferred to him, a young adult who urgently needs to be able to access his medical care in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>
        <P>I have got nowhere with the Department.  Could this young man have the travel pass instead of his mother?  It is a very logical request.  The young man has overcome huge adversity in his life and manages his illness.  He has a positive outlook and will achieve everything a normal young lad can achieve.  It is incumbent on us to ensure he remains healthy, able to afford to visit his consultant in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and that his parents do not have the anxiety and worry every month of wondering how they will afford to get him there.  He has a long-term illness book but has been refused a disability allowance.  He does not want the allowance because he does not consider himself to be disabled, but he needs support to attend the consultant in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>
        <P>This anomaly must be addressed.  The family never used the travel pass when the young man was younger but now he needs it.  Can the Minister get it for him?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection.  </P>
        <P>The main objective of the free travel scheme administered by the Department is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community.  The scheme permits a recipient to travel for free on most CIE public transport services, Luas and a range of services offered by a large number of private operators in various parts of the country.  A free travel customer can also travel for free on cross-Border journeys between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Customers aged 66 years and over can avail of free travel on transport services operating internally within Northern Ireland.  There are approximately 686,000 customers availing of the scheme at an annual cost of some &euro;77 million.</P>
        <P>In addition to the free travel scheme, the Department makes an annual contribution of &euro;1.5 million to the rural transport programme, in addition to the contribution provided by the Department of Transport, in recognition of the carriage of free travel customers.  It is acknowledged that free travel customers benefit from the initiative, particularly those who had no access to public transport prior to the setting up of the programme.</P>
        <P>The free travel scheme is available to a wide range of customers, including all persons aged 66 years or over and customers under the age of 66 who are in receipt of disability related payments such as disability allowance, invalidity pension, blind pension and incapacity supplement or workmen&rsquo;s compensation with a disablement pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity payment from a country covered by EU regulations or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement and who have been in receipt of that payment for at least 12 months are also eligible for free travel.  Free travel is also provided for those providing care and satisfying the payment condition in recognition of the additional costs which may occur in assisting the care recipient.  Widows and widowers aged 60 to 65 years whose late spouse was availing of the free travel scheme may also qualify.</P><Col N="828"/>
        <P>Customers who qualify for the free travel scheme who are married or living as husband and wife may have an entitlement to a free travel pass that allows their spouse or partner to accompany them for free when travelling.  In addition, certain people can obtain a free travel companion pass if they are medically assessed as unfit to travel alone.  This type of pass allows any one person, aged 16 years or over, to accompany the customer for free when travelling.  The purpose of the scheme is to encourage recipients to remain mobile and to ensure a person&rsquo;s entitlement to free travel is not diminished because a companion cannot afford to accompany them.</P>
        <P>In regard to the specific case raised by the Senator, the person&rsquo;s adult son is not in receipt of a payment that would qualify him for entitlement to avail of the free travel scheme.  As with all social welfare schemes, or any scheme administered by the State, there is no provision to transfer entitlement from a person who meets the qualifying criteria to a person who does not meet them.  There is no provision, therefore, to transfer a free travel pass from one customer to another.  Moreover, in this case I am advised that the mother referred to by the Senator does not qualify for free travel.  The free travel scheme is available to persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or to a nominated carer for a person in receipt of constant attendance allowance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance from the Department.  The person referred to by the Senator was previously in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and had an entitlement to avail of the free travel scheme until payment of the allowance ceased in 2007.  Eligibility to avail of the free travel scheme is contingent on a person&rsquo;s eligibility to receive payment of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  When payment of carer&rsquo;s allowance ceased, the customer would have been advised that she was no longer entitled to avail of the free travel scheme and that she should return her travel pass.  I understand the person submitted a new application for carer&rsquo;s allowance earlier this week which will be given full consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the reply.  As the Minister of State said, the idea is to keep people mobile and independent.  This is, therefore, a reasonable request.  I understand the Minister cannot make law for one person, but I have also been contacted by the Diabetic Association of Ireland and there are a number of young people in this position.  They no longer have anybody caring for them because they are old enough to care for themselves and are managing their insulin very well, but they need support to travel to and from their hospital appointments.  I am not happy with the response and do not know what I can do or say to encourage the Minister to look at this case more favourably.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the point made by the Senator.  Two issues arise, the first of which is that there is no provision or regulation in law for the transfer of a travel pass.  The second, which is fundamental, is that the woman concerned does not have a travel pass, but that might change if her application for carer&rsquo;s allowance is successful.  Perhaps the matter might be revisited at that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
