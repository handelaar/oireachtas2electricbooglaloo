	<P>I have received notice from Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the follow matter: </P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to confirm that the mental health budget will be spared in the proposed cuts to the health budget and that the specialist teams constructed under A Vision for Change to look after the most vulnerable patients with severe mental illnesses will not be disbanded.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Liam Twomey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to discuss the case of a person (details supplied) who was the driver of a colleague&rsquo;s car who incurred penalty points when the owner of the car was in South Africa; and the options open to the person concerned.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to provide an update on the status of the Dublin rail interconnector and whether it is still going ahead.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mark Dearey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to comment on the need for regulation of the cash for gold business and make a provision in order that those presenting with gold for sale are required to present a passport or driving licence identification before entering into any transaction.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday a tough and stark budget was announced.  I said then that we would judge it on a number of criteria, including whether it was fair, reforming, contained a stimulus plan and protected the vulnerable.  It showed no evidence of any of these.  It will hit the vulnerable, is very tough on families and provides little by way of a stimulus or job creation package.  It marked the culmination of failed policies from the Government in terms of its management of the economy, in regulating and managing banking and failing to make the right decisions in recent years.  We will shortly have an opportunity to discuss it.  However, the devil is in the detail.  When one examines what is happening in schools and, for example, the national education and psychological service, in respect of which there is an 18% cutback, one is concerned for children and families who are being severely hit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to set out his plans in terms of the sitting arrangements leading up to Christmas and in the final days in office of the Government.  The Green Party stated it would be leaving government in the second half of January.  Perhaps the Deputy Leader might indicate the timeframe for the general election in terms of the passing of necessary legislation.</P>
        <P>There is a disturbing report in today&rsquo;s newspapers on education.  An international study shows that Ireland has fallen from 5th to 17th place in terms of reading skills.  There is something extraordinary happening in our schools and with our young people, given that some 17% of children are low achievers when it comes to reading.  In the case of maths, Ireland has fallen from 16th to 26th place and in the case of science, it continues to be ranked 18th among OECD countries.  We need to debate what is happening in our schools and the reason our children are falling behind in what is a most critical period.  Therefore, I call for a debate on education as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased Senator Fitzgerald has raised the issue of education.  It was also raised yesterday by Senator Cummins.  I would like to provide a simple explanation for what has happened.  On the last occasion the test was carried out in Irish schools there were particular levels of resources in respect of the provision of special schools and classes, in which children with special needs were dealt with.  At the time there were many non-national children &mdash; now known as visitor children &mdash; in our schools and the State assigned teachers to assist them because they did not speak English.  On average, 10% of children have learning difficulties or special needs, while a further 3% to 4% do not speak English as their first language.  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 was introduced to deal in part with this issue, but the Government refused to enforce it.  It then withdrew special needs assistants.  There is a structural systemic difficulty&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is going to get worse.  Teaching and teachers have not changed.  However, the outcomes are different for this reason.  We provide community-type education, of which everyone is in favour, where all children are educated together in the same classrooms, regardless of whether they have special needs, are of another nationality, from Traveller groups and so on.  Previously such children would have been tested at a different location, but they are now part of the system and, as such, the norm has been reduced.  This will continue to happen unless the issues involved are addressed.  I would, therefore, welcome a debate on education.  I regret that I have been only able to address the issue with one-liners, but that is the reality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday afternoon at both gates of Leinster House members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were given a torrid time by demonstrators.  For more than a quarter of a century I have been involved in organising demonstrations outside the gates of Leinster House and various other places.  There is a clear procedure in this regard, namely, that one contacts the local Garda station to discuss how the demonstration will proceed.  Article 46.1 of the Constitution makes it clear that there may be legislation to govern such events.  That legislation is the Offences Against the State Act 1939 which, among other things, requires anyone organising a demonstration to contact the local Garda station which can given certain advice.  It goes on to state that should this not happen, any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can call upon persons taking part in such a meeting to disperse.  This did not happen yesterday.  I support the right of citizens to demonstrate.  However, there are public servants &mdash; members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &mdash; to protect our democracy and there are parties inside the Houses who appear to give passive support to such activity which is undermining our democracy.  Last night the gates of Leinster House were closed for a couple of hours, preventing cars and people from entering and leaving.  This sends a strong message.  If people believe they can stop the process of democracy, it will be a bad day for all of us.  I compliment the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and staff of Leinster House on their work.  Let us support the right to demonstrate but also make it clear that there are rules governing demonstrations, just as there are rules governing every other right under the Constitution.  I would like to see the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being urged to ensure the relevant legislation, the Offences Against the State Act 1939, is given effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls made by Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole for a debate on the disturbing report from the OECD on falling literacy levels in Ireland and the poor rate of achievement in maths.  It gives the lie to the notion that this is a country that can be proud of its education system when so many children are falling between the cracks in the system.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, this is about the systemic doing away of supports for children.  I heard the other day from a friend who is part of the visiting teachers service for Travel<Col N="294"/>lers about the effects of the cuts in the numbers of resource teachers.  This can be replicated in respect of children living in disadvantaged areas.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that, instead of having a sos for one hour, we debate the report from the OECD.  While we would need more than one hour to debate it, the debate could be rolled over and continued next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious issue in the context of our discussion today on the budget, the most brutal in the country&rsquo;s history.  The cutbacks will severely affect the low paid and those in receipt of social welfare.  Cuts of &euro;8 per week have been announced for those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s and unemployment benefit and blind and disability pensions, which is outrageous.</P>
        <P>Having listened to the people express their anger and highlight their despair, it is important that we recognise there is a need for a stimulus package, that we support education and that we ensure there will be some strategy to promotoe growth, create jobs and aid recovery, as proposed by the Labour Party, none of which was contained in the budget.  We need to learn from other countries, including Finland which, when it went through its economic crisis, insisted on the retention of supports for education.  We need also to learn from Iceland.  The joke, when it was going through its economic crisis, was: what is the difference between Iceland and Ireland?  To which the answer was only one letter and six months, which has turned out to be more like two years.  We are even now enduring the same weather conditions.  One of the many things the government there did was to ensure stimulus and to ensure more women were put in charge of running the system and the economy.  They have approached recovery with better leadership and government and a better strategy for recovery than our Government did in yesterday&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Iceland is also the recipient of funding from the IMF and much of what is happening there is being replicated here.</P>
        <P>I support the calls for a debate on education.  It is important to consider the OECD report fully and it is also has to be accepted that inputs and outputs in education are not being measured adequately.  The budgetary process engaged in by the Department of Finance has been too much about pounds, shillings and pence.  Proposals were made regarding the pupil-teacher ratio, special needs assistants and larger cuts in capitation but it needs to be understood the amount being spent on education now to reverse some of the measures mentioned by Senators, and which we need to debate to more widely, has been difficult to achieve.  We have the pupil-teacher ratio, we stopped the reduction in special needs assistants and we have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Bacik&rsquo;s call for a debate on the education system.  I welcome Senator Boyle&rsquo;s agreement with this call and I hope when we divide later he will vote in favour of having a debate this afternoon.  A sos is proposed between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. and a debate could easily be accommodated then, which could then be rolled over.  I look forward to debating in detail later the measures proposed in the budget but a debate on the OECD report on education would be worthwhile.  I am concerned about how this will appear to the outside world.  I note the comments made by the American Chamber of Commerce last night.  One of its spokespersons said this was deeply concerning and she was worried that this might have an impact on the level of external investment in the country.  A debate would be worthwhile as we consider issues such as standards in schools and the curriculum.  I am concerned about the drop in standards in mathematics as well as in literacy levels.  I propose we have a debate as soon as possible to demonstrate the seriousness with which the House takes the most recent report.</P>

	<P>I join Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik and Hannigan in seeking a debate on education.  The OECD report is a damning indictment of the Government&rsquo;s policy and it is important we have a debate.  Senator Boyle referred to the pupil-teacher ratio.  As bad as it is, it is not the problem.  The problem is the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator listened for a while, he might learn something.  The Government has taken away the support structures in schools.  When I started out as a teacher, there were 30 students in a class but while I welcomed the attempt to make education all-inclusive with children with intellectual disabilities, Traveller children and children of visitors to our country being added to the mix, the Government then withdrew funding for special needs assistants, SNAs, Traveller education teachers and support for one-to-one education, which has led to failures in the education system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader facilitate a debate on the failure to implement the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act, the abolition of the rights <Col N="297"/>of individual students and the failure to honour the commitment to the pupil-teacher ratio in the programme for Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek a debate on the justice system, especially in light of yesterday&rsquo;s coroner&rsquo;s hearing regarding the assault on Noel and Marie Keegan in Longford following which, sadly, Noel Keegan died minutes afterwards.  The perpetrator, who had a record of assault, should have been in prison on the night of the attack but owing to a number of failures and blunders by the State, he was free to commit further assaults.  Will the Leader also arrange a briefing document?  I understand the Minister for Justice and Law Reform is undertaking an investigation along with the Courts Service and the sooner we have all the information, the better.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Will the Leader arrange with the other group leaders to make accommodation for topical debates in the ordering of the business of the House, especially as we deal with the current economic and financial difficulties?  Will he arrange a debate on the National Asset Management Agency?  Obstacles have been placed in the agency&rsquo;s path during its early months trying to put the finances in the property sector back on track.  Misleading and what has been perceived in certain instances to be false information has been provided by the financial institutions which is causing delays and serious problems for the agency in doing what it was set up to do.  Will the Leader try to get Members briefing documents and to arrange a debate on this matter as quickly as possible?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like everyone else in Ireland, I care for my country, as do my colleagues in the Seanad.  In the closing days of this Seanad we should reflect on the crisis in Irish politics, which is the lack of respect for politics and politicians.  Our primary task should not be to score points against each other within the political system.  All politicians have a duty of care to the people and to get people to respect politics once more, because politics has never been so disrespected in modern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Part of respecting politics is to understand the nature of the crisis.  Conventional wisdom is that it is an economic crisis.  It is that, but we have been through economic crises since the 1920s and dealt with them.  The problem with this crisis is that there is a crisis of authority as well &mdash; a crisis of politics itself and of leadership.  That is the reason I proposed, in my column in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday, a reverse Tallaght strategy for Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; that in Opposition it would support the incoming Government.  The broad parameters of the budget are agreed and what people are fighting about here is the small change.  It is like arguing about the composition of a Christmas pudding, where the raisins should go or whether there should be less flour and so forth.  The point is that all political parties in these Houses are committed to the broad parameters of the budget and it behoves Fianna F&aacute;il to support the incoming Government.  Otherwise, we will be at the mercy of the anarchist, independent and messy forces in this society.</P>
        <P>People crave stable government from the centre for a few years to allow them to get their heads and their act together.  I appeal once more to the parties about this.  I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, picked up my reverse Tallaght strategy on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; programme and that the Taoiseach endorsed it this morning.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party should consider their duty of care to the other side and their duty to give Fianna F&aacute;il a soft landing.  They should say: &ldquo;Yes, we accept that we all have a duty of care and that we are all within the broad parameters of this budget together.  We have a duty to create a centre of authority in Irish politics.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">That duty devolves on the Labour Party as much as others.  I was interested to see that Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock believed the budget should be supported.  That marked the intelligence <Col N="298"/>and cop-on for which his family has always been noted.  All political parties in this House should consider whether it would not be wiser of them to gather around and protect the broad parameters of this budget and of public policy.  I know, and they know in their hearts, that is what the people want them to do.</P>

	<P>I have no problem with a debate being held on the OECD report.  The education committee held a meeting last Thursday and it was interesting to discuss the different approaches and topics with a range of people from the third level sector, the business community and the student sector.  It is important to note that they are concerned that the image of Ireland that is being conveyed is very negative, because people within the business sector said the people they encounter are not reflective of that.</P>
        <P>I agree that there is a difference in how things are dealt with now since the incorporation of all abilities and disabilities within the classroom.  However, many resources were put into classrooms.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole said nothing had changed other than these people had been included and that teachers had not changed.  Perhaps teaching styles need to change.  When I was teaching in England there were three levels for what one was teaching &mdash; high, medium and low ability.</P>

        <P>I again ask whatever party is in the next Government to examine the role of music, both music therapy for those who need it and music as a personal development tool in the education sector.  There are proven links between that subject and mathematics.  I might be a lone voice crying in the wilderness in this Chamber but I am not the only voice on this when one considers international research, which has proven those links.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the House for a discussion on justice and an update on how the Children Act is currently being implemented.  I read with horror a report in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> on Monday.  Many children who commit crimes are too young to be dealt with in the system.  In the North, one child had committed an offence at three years of age and one had committed nine crimes at four years of age.  Have we a similar problem with children aged from three to seven years old committing crimes?  Under the Children Act, parents were made responsible for the actions of their children.  A comparison should be carried out between the situation here and that in the North under the Minister for Justice, Mr. Ford, given that there is so much cross-Border co-operation.</P>

	<P>Every family in this country will be approximately &euro;3,000 worse off as a result of the budget yesterday.  However, this country could face nothing worse right now than a recession in our education system.  It is an outrage and alarming for this country that in terms of literacy standards it has fallen from fifth to 17th place in the OECD and in terms of mathematics standards it has fallen from 15th to 25th place.  Let us wake up and smell the coffee.  We are on the brink of a major depression if our educated workforce is at risk.</P><Col N="299"/>
        <P>I wholeheartedly support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s call for the House to urgently invite the Minister to the House to discuss standards.  This is a failure on the part of the Government.  Why has the Government not monitored standards and learning outcomes?  Why has the Minister for Education and Skills not kept an eye on standards?  Above all, why has the Minister not invested in teachers?  I am not referring to pupil-teacher ratios but to the quality of our teachers and their ability to remain in touch with the needs of children today.  The needs of our children are being benchmarked against the developed world.  Our youngsters must compete against the best in Europe.  The only chance this country has is to have an educated workforce so we can continue to attract industry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Harris about the need for consensus on these issues.  It is painful, and Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to this, to watch political parties exploiting the protests outside the House.  However, we have seen in the last couple of years the exploitation of the financial and economic crisis in the country purely for party political gain.  It does nothing for the image of politics and definitely does nothing for this country.</P>
        <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator Callely, on the need for a debate on NAMA.  It is not functioning as effectively as it should be at this stage.  Unfortunately, much of the future of this country is vested in NAMA and unless it performs to its full and best potential, we will suffer as a consequence.  I seek a debate on this.</P>
        <P>With regard to the OECD report, while we should not be complacent about its findings we should consider it in context.  It has been acknowledged that it is a comparison with five years ago and we have a significant number of young people who are immigrants and whose literacy skills would obviously be more challenged than those of natives.  The other issue, which is positive in some respects, is the fact that there are fewer early school leavers.  Many children are remaining in school, which is a good development.</P>

	<P>That said, we should hold a reasonable debate on the subject.  The quality of teachers, which is a huge issue, and the curriculum should certainly be the focus of that debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader hold a debate at an early opportunity on the HSE and the hospital consultants&rsquo; contracts?  It is shameful that, having increased salaries by approximately 50%, they are now reverting back to the breakdown between public and private practice in our hospitals.  A stop must be put to this abuse of privilege and I seek an early debate in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there something we have missed with regard to Government plans to drastically slim down the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  According to the figures there is a cutback of over 31%.  There is also a cutback of over 60% in the heritage section.  I am concerned about some of our historical and heritage properties.  Is it the intention to have the section subsumed within some other section of the Department?  I am particularly concerned about Killarney House, which is falling into rack and ruin.  This is a major tourist attraction both within the town and in the national park in Killarney.  It would be disastrous if something like that were to suffer because we need to boost tourism.  I do not know if the Leader has any information on this.</P><Col N="300"/>
        <P>Deputy Noonan made a very good point on NAMA in the other House yesterday.  NAMA has the largest property portfolio and we have a stagnant property market at the moment.  He made a worthwhile suggestion that NAMA should release some properties to get a proper floor on the market so people can lose this image that the market will fall further.  We could at least establish a floor.  That is a very worthwhile proposal and we should commend it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I renew my calls for a debate on wage structures following yesterday&rsquo;s budget.  I was pleased to see that a maximum wage in the public service was introduced by the Minister in the budget.  I called previously for the maximum wage to be linked to the minimum wage, but that was not done.  I was looking for a linking of eight times the minimum wage.  The figure of &euro;250,000 is between 14 and 16 times the minimum wage, depending on what the minimum wage is.  It is important to have a debate on this because it affects many people.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden spoke about a debate on the abolition of the Seanad.  It is important to have that debate.  I would personally advocate reform rather than abolition.  If we had a referendum on the abolition of the D&aacute;il right now, there is a possibility it would pass.  A knee jerk reaction on the abolition of the Houses of the Oireachtas is not a good idea.  Clear reform is what we need.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the call by Senator O&rsquo;Toole for a full debate on the EPSEN Act.  The education debate is very important.  We should bring the Minister to the House for a debate, but it is crucial that we have that debate in the context of the budgets that are realistically available for education.  We should be able to implement the Act under any budgetary circumstances.  It is in the renewed programme for Government.  I accept that the progress on its implementation has not been what we would like to see, but we need to have discussions with the unions to ensure the Act can be implemented regardless of the budgetary situation, either now or in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of us find ourselves giving reluctant support to the budget, despite the lack of credibility in the Government&rsquo;s projections for growth on which the four year plan is predicated, and despite the apparent political opportunism which continues to bedevil decision making.  Everybody is happy to see that there were no cuts in the State pension, but when we see that there were cuts for people with disabilities, it becomes clear that political calculations were at work and that is very unfortunate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader and the Deputy Leader to speak to their bosses in the Government about the playing of politics with the institutions of this State.  We heard that there was a last minute discussion about whether it would be a good idea to scrap the Seanad, apparently in order to gazump the leader of the Fine Gael Party and to do what he did a few months ago, namely, to reach for the cookie jar of populist ideas, instead of having a mature, considered debate about how the institutions of the State are working.  This is reminiscent of the five minutes&rsquo; notice given by the smaller party to the larger party in the Government about its general election intentions.  It is simply cynical.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Those of us who have some political contribution to make will find another way of offering ourselves to the electorate.  It is not about us.  However, was any consideration given to the people who work in administration here as support staff for Senators, or is it just all about gaining the political advantage?  If there was serious respect for the institutions of this State, we would be looking at a reformed Seanad.  We would be looking at a list system so we could move from a situation where people are voting on the basis of local considerations to a situation where parties would be putting their ideas out on a platform, the personnel on a list, and <Col N="301"/>people would vote for ideas instead of personalities.  That would be real political thinking and would show real responsibility towards the electorate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senators who spoke about cross-party support for the budget.  I do so, not just in the light of today, but in taking the long view.  I was pleased to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, indicate on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; that if Fianna F&aacute;il were to go into Opposition, it would support the Government of the day if it were to implement the four year plan.  We have taken the first and necessary steps on that road.  Those Senators who are looking at cross-party support are looking at doing business in a proper manner for the benefit of this nation.  We did the same for the North of Ireland, which was the most intractable problem.  It was much more difficult and much more serious than our current economic problems, yet we achieved results.</P>
        <P>I commend the &euro;250,000 limit on public funds and salaries.  Some people are on salaries that look like telephone numbers to rest of us, and it just does not make sense that public funds would be expended in that manner.  Some &euro;250,000 is still a significant sum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been many calls for reform of the Seanad and there have been many knee-jerk reactions on getting rid of the Seanad without properly thinking what the Seanad does, how many separate times it has implemented legislation, and how many times it has amended legislation.  I think about 1,200 amendments are made per term.  If we amend legislation 1,200 times, that is because it needs to be amended 1,200 times.  Unless the D&aacute;il is going to sit night and day to ensure that no legislation gets through that is not correct, we need a second Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have raised the issue of a nursing home in Athlone several times before, but this is not just about Athlone, but about care of the elderly across the nation.  If we do not care and respect the elderly in their final years, we are at nothing.  I am talking about Loughloe House in Athlone.  It is a nursing home that was purpose built in the 1970s in the most ideal situation on the banks of the River Shannon.  The HSE delivered a very uncompassionate ruling to close this nursing home.  There were 24 residents in the nursing home seven months ago, but there are only five remaining today and they are refusing to leave.  The HSE manager, Mr. Joe Ruane, gave an undertaking that people would not be thrown out, they would not be bullied and they would not be intimated.  Sadly, that is not the case. The pictures have been removed from the walls.  The oratory is being dismantled.  Mass was said in the oratory for the last time yesterday evening.  Furniture has been removed in order that visitors cannot sit around and visit their relatives.  People have now been told that Friday is the last day for the home to remain open.</P>
        
        <P>I call on the Leader to bring the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, or the Minister for Health and Children, before the House today, to tell us why Loughloe House is being closed and explain how we will care for the elderly.  If it was happening in St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in Mullingar, the Leader would be just as emphatic as I am today.  Senator Phelan has raised the situation in Kilkenny several times.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business because I feel strongly about this.  The Minister for Health and Children, or the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, should come in here to discuss this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Senator Leyden&rsquo;s opening comments on the reference in yesterday&rsquo;s budget speech on the future of the Seanad, as well as Senator Mullen&rsquo;s comments. <Col N="302"/> In all the discussion on abolition and reform, the Members of this House in the past few decades have taken it upon themselves to initiate a variety of debates that have culminated in a stack of reports with very positive proposals on how this Seanad could be more reflective of life outside it.  If there has been no reform, that has not been the fault of the elected Senate, but rather the fault of successive Governments that have failed to grasp the need for reform of the Senate.  Senator Leyden is right to paraphrase the former Minister, Michael McDowell, talking about his own party in saying we must be radical or redundant.  I would welcome any initiative the Leader, even at this stage, could bring forward that would inform the public.  If it was suggested that the D&aacute;il would be abolished, I guarantee the public would vote for it.  That could be followed by the Presidency and then we could get rid of the local authorities.  We can go down this road if we wish but at the end of the day there must be some loyalty to the democratic institutions of the State.  If there is to be further debate on the future of the Seanad, it must take account of the various reports that have been done, the most recent of which was carried out under the former Leader of the House, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, which contained far-reaching proposals.  Governments have ignored it, however, and now it is turning around with a populist, knee-jerk reaction to suggest the Seanad should be let go.  Of course the public would be happy to abolish this House.  They would abolish everything and I do not blame them, but they must be informed.</P>
        <P>Yesterday was a sad day.  Traditionally budget day was a day of some spectacle, and I use the word advisedly.  Yesterday we saw massed ranks of garda&iacute; both in front of and behind the House.  People are fully entitled to protest, it is right and proper they do so, and we all know and appreciate the anger, pain and hurt being felt by those who are struggling with families.  God knows, it is not too far from my own door or those others of us who face an uncertain future.  I wish to record, however, my appreciation of the behaviour of the garda&iacute; yesterday, where they adhered to their oath to uphold the institutions of the State.  This House should express its thanks to the Garda Commissioner for the manner in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carried out its duties yesterday.</P>

	<P>I second Senator McFadden&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business and join other speakers in complimenting the garda&iacute; on their work yesterday.  They did an excellent job in upholding democracy.</P>
        <P>On Seanad reform, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government met the party leaders and others last year on that subject and he said he would have proposals in a Bill before the House before Christmas 2009.  We have not seen a single idea from the Government side.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in calling for an urgent debate on Seanad reform and agree with Senators Leyden and Mooney when they alluded to the former remarks of the former leader of the former party, the Progressive Democrats, when he said they must be radical or redundant.  If we do not reform and reform quickly, we will be made redundant quite quickly, and let us be under no illusion about that.</P>
        <P>I also join those speakers who mentioned the protests outside the Houses yesterday.  I am a democrat and I believe people should be entitled to protest in a peaceful manner.  The 200 or <Col N="303"/>300 people who protested outside this House last night, however, were nothing short of a disgrace.  They are not democrats in any way and I point that some of the flags and emblems on display last night were flags and emblems displayed by the 200 thugs who hijacked the students&rsquo; protest a number of weeks ago.  This is a democracy and it cannot be hijacked by such people.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned, some of the flags and emblems being held by protesters belong to a party that has representatives in the other House who claim to be democrats.  Let us tell it as it is.  These people are not democrats; they are thugs and layabouts.  I pay tribute to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the staff of the Houses for protecting Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I echo the remarks of Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Wilson.  I have been in public life for 30 years and I respect the views of everyone.  That is one of the great things about this House, the other House and all the local authorities.  People can put themselves forward for election, be elected and have a mandate to speak.  I will not repeat the remarks made by the Senators but the fact that I have alluded to them is an affirmation of my agreement with them.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the best police force in the world.  I am proud of it, as is every Member of both Houses. On the issue of Seanad reform, there is an attitude in these Houses that it is a great thing to propose radical ideas.  I am aware there is nothing so good it cannot be improved.  Of course, this House can be improved.  There have been several reports on it and they are all gathering a layer of dust.  That is not the fault of the Seanad.  We have put ourselves forward for reform on many occasions but nothing has happened.</P>
        <P>Who wants to get rid of town councils?  County managers do, because they are an irritant to them.  Our 75 town councils, five borough councils, five county borough councils and 29 county councils are all arms of democracy.  The day we abolish them will be a sad day for democracy.  If they do not have powers, that is not the fault of local government.  It is the fault of successive Governments.  This House should set its face against the abolition of the town councils because they are the first bastion of local democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a former town councillor, I echo Senator Glynn&rsquo;s comments.  I know that both town and county councils are concerned about their future.  In the context of the suggested abolition of the Seanad, what protection will there be for local authorities?  I was very unhappy at the reference in the budget speech to the proposed abolition of this House.  If I never got a second term here, I would have the same view.  Rushed legislation is bad legislation and sufficient thought has not been given to this.  As Senator Hanafin said, this House does immeasurable work and takes much of the strain off the D&aacute;il.  If this House was not here, legislation would take twice as long to get through and the process would be interminable.  Hitler decided to burn the Reichstag and while this is more subtle, sufficient thought has not been given to the process.  I will oppose this tooth and nail,  no matter if it comes from Enda Kenny as Taoiseach or whoever might be leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

We will have the budget debate immediately after the Order of Business until 3 p.m.  I also wish to inform the House that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Calleary, will give a progress report to the House next week on the Croke Park agreement.  I look forward to this debate because it concerns one of the most crucial aspects of what is happening and much depends on the success of the agreement.</P>
        <P>Senators Leyden, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, Mullen, Hanafin, Mooney, Cummins, Wilson, Glynn and O&rsquo;Sullivan all expressed their serious concern about D&aacute;il and Seanad reform.  Never was it more obvious than yesterday, and today, why Seanad &Eacute;ireann should be retained.  It is the protector of the taxpayer and a House in which debates on Bills are not guillotined.

	<P>In New Zealand the equivalent of the Seanad was abolished in 1971.  It is now being restored because the value of having a second Chamber to act as a watchdog on behalf of the taxpayer is immense.  The work we do in this House on all Bills is important.  As I have often said on the Order of Business, two years ago we discussed 1,201 amendments to a particular Bill.  The second Chamber is a major protector of the taxpayer.  We may delay Bills and the process of government, but that is our duty and responsibility under the Constitution.  That is why the House was set up in the first place &mdash; as an independent voice on behalf of the taxpayer.  That is what Seanad &Eacute;ireann is.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik, Boyle, Hannigan, Buttimer, Keaveney and Healy Eames called for an urgent debate on the OECD report on education.  I listened attentively as Senator O&rsquo;Toole gave his view to the House.  I understand one of the reasons for the low ratings is that students from non-English-speaking families are now in our schools.  Whatever the challenge is, I will have no difficulty in arranging a debate on the issue.  I propose to contact the Minister&rsquo;s office after the Order of Business to see if we can come back later this evening after Private Members&rsquo; business to hear statements from Senators.</P>

I join all colleagues who commended the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the staff of the Houses for their tremendous work.  I hope this will not happen again.  Members and staff should be allowed to access Leinster House freely; they should not be told they cannot leave the precincts for a few hours, as happened last night.  As has been correctly said by many colleagues, this is something we do not want to see happen again and we should make all necessary rules and regulations to ensure it does not.  This is the protection of democracy itself.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely spoke about the sad circumstances surrounding the killing of Noel Keegan in County Longford.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s strong views to the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and try to arrange a briefing on this very sad incident.</P>
        <P>Senators Callely, Walsh and Coghlan called for a debate on NAMA and sought an update on its progress.  I will have no difficulty in arranging a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Harris mentioned the lack of respect for politics and, with Senators Walsh and Hanafin, called on all parties to provide the necessary support, in the national interest, to solve the problem of the country&rsquo;s finances.  I heard the utterances of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; on Monday night and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s endorsement of these comments.  This establishes the position of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I fully support the views expressed by the three Senators this morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney mentioned the role of music in therapy.  I fully support her comments on the issue and have always done so.  It is something that should be taken far more seriously by Ministers, particularly in the field of education.  The Senator also mentioned the crimes committed by children and called on the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to come to the House for a debate on this serious issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh spoke about the HSE and hospital consultant contracts and called for a debate with the Minister for Health and Children which I will have no difficulty in arranging.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan asked me to point out strongly to the Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government his serious concerns about Killarney House and the beautiful national park in his home town of Killarney.  I have no difficulty in supporting him in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden mentioned Loughloe House nursing home in Athlone and the terrible plight of patients in view of its proposed closure.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s concerns about the difficulties being experienced by the five patients in the nursing home, as well as by the 24 who were there previously.  I will see what I can do and will pass on her strong views to the Minister immediately after the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>As Mark Twain might have said, rumours of this House&rsquo;s demise are much exaggerated.</P>
        <P>A year ago when I addressed this House on the 2010 budget, I highlighted the background of an unprecedented rate of economic decline experienced since 2008.  I went on to say, however, the Government&rsquo;s strategy over the previous 18 months was working and we could see the first signs of a recovery in our main international markets.  I also pointed out the measures taken by the Government up to then had been commended by international bodies such as the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as well as winning the approval of the international markets.</P><Col N="307"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P Just="Left">After the 2010 budget, improvements continued into the early months of this year until the crisis in Greece in April.  This crisis precipitated a series of events which led to the costs of funding for the State and for our banks becoming increasingly expensive.  Also, during the autumn, firm estimates of the cost of dealing with the banks became available and were higher than previously calculated.  This, as well as concerns about the prospects for the global economy, added to doubts in the markets about the sustainability of our public finances and our capacity to fix the financial system without outside help. These doubts continued to grow, as did the price of Irish debt in secondary markets.  Therefore, it became clear these stresses would not go away but, instead, would have intensified and have led to disaster for our banks and the economy unless they had been urgently addressed.</P>
        
        <P>This was the background to the Government&rsquo;s decision to seek support from our European and international partners to achieve a sound and smaller banking system, as well as a sustainable budget position, to implement structural reforms to underpin economic stability and enhance growth and job creation.  If we had not been able to obtain this support, it is doubtful if the State could have borrowed the money needed, other than at exorbitant interest rates, to maintain our public services or a functioning banking system.</P>
        <P>Prior to seeking this support, the Government had already begun work on a comprehensive plan to secure a return to sustainable growth in our economy and put our public finances in order.  The policies set out in the joint programme of assistance incorporate to a considerable extent the blueprint set out in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, published on 24 November.  The policies in the programme are not new ones imposed on us by outsiders<?oasys _jy ?>but are a continuation of the Government&rsquo;s strategy for recovery which best fits our circumstances.</P>
        <P>At the end of last September, during my speech to this house on statements on the economy, I mentioned the many pointers to a stabilisation in the economy and in the public finances that were becoming apparent at the time.  Notwithstanding the crisis that led to us having to seek support through the joint programme, the real economy and the public finances have continued to improve.</P>
        <P>It is now expected that gross domestic product will record a small increase this year after a fall of 7.6% last year.  Exports increased by approximately 7% in real terms in the first half of this year and are expected to grow by more than 6% for 2010 as a whole.  Output in the manufacturing sector was up 12% in the third quarter of this year.  There are signs that conditions in the labour market are beginning to stabilise.  Last week, we saw a fall in the underlying live register for the third month in a row, marking the first time we have seen such a sustained drop since 2004.  In the 12 months to November 2010, redundancies notified to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation were 21% fewer than in the same period last year.  I accept migration by Irish and other citizens may contribute to this outcome, however.</P>
        <P>Our underlying budget deficit has stabilised.  Our tax revenues in 2010 are ahead of target despite a weaker start to the year and our spending has been brought under control.  These data taken together paint a picture of an economy that is returning to growth after a deep and prolonged recession.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Looking to the future until 2014, real gross domestic product is forecast by the Department of Finance to strengthen to an average increase of almost 2.75% per annum.  Again, it must be taken against the backdrop of the large drop in 2009.  The most recent indicators point to economic recovery.  However, the scale of the adjustment needed in the public finances is such that any rate of economic growth that could reasonably be expected over the medium term <Col N="308"/>would fall way short of providing the resources needed to close the huge gap in the public finances by 2015 or to stabilise the banking system. Accordingly, the adjustments in the 2011 budget have had to be severe, both as regards expenditure cuts and tax increases.  We do not have any choice, however.  Adjustments on this scale must be made and we must make them now.  Notwithstanding the severity of these measures and despite arguments to the contrary, the actions taken in this budget to stabilise our public finances and those planned for the years ahead are consistent with economic recovery. This is because they will provide a degree of certainty that will encourage consumers to spend and businesses to invest, as well as &mdash; this is perhaps the most important aspect &mdash; boosting the competitiveness of our economy.</P>
        
     
        
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<?oasys _cl14.3- ?><P>I will turn to outlining the various measures in the 2011 budget and the rationale for each of them.  In the national recovery plan we have set out the timetable for achieving an overall adjustment of &euro;15 billion in tax and expenditure adjustments over the next four years.  We need this adjustment to reach the target to bring our deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2015.  Owing to lower than expected medium-term growth prospects as well as higher debt interest costs arising from the bank rescue, the European Commission has agreed to give Ireland an extra year to reach the 3% deficit target required under the Stability and Growth Pact.  This extra year will change neither our targets nor our timetable for achieving them.</P>
        <P>As outlined in the plan, &euro;6 billion of the overall adjustment is being made in the 2011 budget.  Big as it is, this is the scale of the adjustment needed to demonstrate we are serious about restoring order to our public finances.  The benefits of the now-gone boom were spread across every section of the population.  Between 2000 and 2008, public spending increased by in excess of 140% while the consumer price index increased by just 35%.  Working age social welfare rates are now more than twice their rate in 2000.  Over the same period, the State pension almost doubled.  These increases were therefore well ahead of the cost of living.  At the same time, taxation was reduced and the proportion of income earners exempt from income tax increased from 34% in 2004 to an estimated 45% this year.</P>
        <P>It is important to keep things in perspective.  The current spending reductions set out in the national recovery plan to 2014 will bring total gross voted current spending back only to 2007-2008 levels.  The income tax measures in the plan will bring us back only to 2006 levels.  Today, the CPI is where it was in April 2007, which is an important factor to bear in mind.</P>
        <P>The Government has maintained working age rates of payments at a rate which far exceeds total inflation since 1997 and has now become unaffordable.  This rate of increase also has implications for replacement rates for the unemployed.  This is why the Government has decided to reduce working age rates of payment by about 4%.  These new rates will still be slightly ahead of the 2007 working age rates of payment when price levels were about the same as they are now.</P>
        <P>Between 2000 and 2009, expenditure on child benefit grew from &euro;638 million to approximately &euro;2.5 billion per year, which is 12% of gross social welfare spending.  There will be a &euro;10 reduction both on lower and higher child benefit rates, with an additional &euro;10 reduction for a third child only.  This is a step in the direction of diverting support to selective poverty reducing measures, such as the family income supplement and qualified child increases, as well as rationalising the child benefit structure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The large increases to the State pension in the past ten years or so have been successful in addressing poverty in that age group.  This is shown in the recently published 2009 survey of income and living conditions in Ireland which revealed that the proportion of persons aged 65 <Col N="309"/>years or over living in consistent poverty has been brought down to 1% or lower.  Despite the huge pressures on the public finances the Government is determined to preserve this achievement, which is why it decided not to reduce the State pension.</P>
       <P>Despite the fact that considerable savings have been made in the cost of delivering public services, further savings and reforms are needed.  This is why savings will continue to be made through planned reductions in the number of public servants and through greater efficiencies in delivering public services.  The salaries of the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers will be reduced by &euro;14,000, &euro;11,500, and &euro;10,000 per annum, respectively, and the Government will seek a maximum salary rate of &euro;250,000 in the public sector.</P>
        <P>I wish to elaborate on this point.  One of the famous sayings of Eamon de Valera when he took office in the early 1930s was that no man was worth more than &pound;1,000 a year.  In terms of net public sector take-home pay, it is now the case that no one is worth much more than &euro;100,000 a year.  For example, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s net pay and gross income have declined.  In 2008, his gross income was &euro;285,000 while it is now down to &euro;214,000.  Taking into account all the various changes that have been made, his net take-home pay has gone down from &euro;174,000 to &euro;102,689.  It may come as a surprise that in the case of TDs, for example, the gross income has come down from &euro;100,000 to &euro;92,672.  This will be especially relevant to those of us who will again be D&aacute;il candidates.  The net take-home pay has come down from &euro;69,000 to scarcely more than &euro;50,000.  I do not have figures for Senators but they are obviously less.  I do not think the public has any idea of that situation.  I welcome it, however, because over the past ten years in particular, salaries across the top levels of the public sector got completely out of hand in line with the general euphoria of the late Celtic tiger era.  This is the new situation.  As announced in the national recovery plan, provision will be made in legislation for a 10% reduction to be applied to the pay of new entrants to the public service, including those appointed to hold office in the Judiciary in 2011.</P>
        <P>The cost of providing public service pensions has risen by 56% to &euro;2.235 billion in the period 2006 to 2010.  Failure to reduce the cost of pension provision could undermine the longer-term viability of the public service pension system.  Up to now, existing public service pensioners did not have their pensions reduced to reflect the pay reductions applied to serving public servants.  Accordingly, it is appropriate and reasonable that public service pensions above &euro;12,000 a year would be reduced by an average of 4%.  Those on a pension below &euro;12,000 a year, roughly equivalent to the value of the social welfare pension, will be exempt from the reduction.  The reduction will apply to former political office holders, retired members of the Judiciary, and their survivors or dependants.</P>
        <P>The grace period under which previous salary levels for public servants are to be used to calculate pension entitlements, which was due to expire by the end of 2011, is being extended by two months.  As the Minister explained in the D&aacute;il, that is to prevent a pile-up at the end of this month. The new pension scheme based on career average earnings for new entrants to the public service, which was announced in last year&rsquo;s budget, will come into effect in 2011.  Under this scheme, post-retirement pension increases will be linked to retail price inflation rather than to pay.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the considerable programme of investment in recent years, the Government will invest 3.6% of GNP in 2011 in the Exchequer capital programme, which will be augmented by the investment programmes of the commercial State-sponsored bodies.  In addition, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, has confirmed that it is willing to invest in Irish infrastructure assets on a commercial basis in partnership with third party institutional investors.  The Government will help to identify opportunities for the NPRF and other private inves<Col N="310"/>tors.  While it is to be regretted that public capital investment has been reduced to this level, we must bear in mind the huge level of capital investment that has occurred in the past ten years.  It has given us a national motorway network and many other assets.</P>
        
        <P>The OPW capital allocation for 2011 includes &euro;41million for flood risk management.  Although we were allocated &euro;50 million for this year, we only succeeded in spending approximately &euro;38 million or &euro;39 million on a huge programme around the country this year.  Some of that will be carried over, giving &euro;44 million next year.  Major flood relief schemes are under way at Mallow, Clonmel, Ennis, Fermoy, Bray and Clontarf.  We have also undertaken a couple of hundred minor flood relief works around the country in conjunction with county councils.  It is a major amount of activity.</P>
        <P>Public procurement represents a considerable proportion of economic and commercial activity and is estimated to account for up to or more than &euro;15 billion, close to 12% of GNP.  The public procurement function has been receiving particular attention from Government in recent times and a number of reform initiatives have been undertaken.  The national procurement service, the NPS, was recently established in the Office of Public Works and has been given the task of implementing the ongoing programme of reform.  The main aim of national policy on procurement is to achieve value for money in a regime of probity and accountability.  The primary objectives of the NPS include achieving value for money from large-scale public service procurement exercises, assisting in the training and development of public service procurement officials and facilitating greater collaboration.  Through its strategic approach to procurement the NPS ensures that appropriate engagement takes place with both suppliers of all sizes and public service clients prior to the running of any competitive process.  It is recognised that when officials, across sectors, work together to identify suitable opportunities for demand aggregation, significant cost savings can result.  The resulting cost reductions can alleviate the impacts that reduced budgets would otherwise have on the delivery of public services.  We are very conscious of the importance of public procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises.  We have done our best in terms of revising the documentation and conducting outreach courses in order to make procurement as user-friendly as possible, particularly for such enterprises.  Despite impressions to the contrary, a high level of procurement contracts remain within the country.  At the same time, there is no point in thinking we can apply that pre-1958 approach to public procurement, following the old Sinn F&eacute;in economic policy.  Firms engaged in this must be competitive and must seek and win contracts abroad.  Many of them are doing so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is essential that Ireland&rsquo;s tax system provides the resources to pay for public services without damaging our economic growth potential.  That is why the Government has decided in the national recovery plan that two thirds of the required adjustment should be through expenditure reductions and one third should be raised by taxation.  Our tax base is too narrow.  Too few income earners pay any income tax.  This year, just 8%, earning &euro;75,000 or more, will pay 60% of all income tax while almost 80%, earning &euro;50,000 or less, will contribute just 17%.  Also, many high earners have opportunities to shelter their income from tax.  These are serious structural defects that must be addressed to create a system that is rational, sustainable and fair and that delivers the resources required. Such a system cannot be created in one budget but the following major steps forward in the reform process have been made in this budget.  This budget has replaced the income levy and the health levy with a single universal social charge, governed by one set of rules on a broad base; removed the employee PRSI contribution ceiling, as has been long called for; increased the PRSI rate for the self-employed, higher earning public servants and office holders; reduced the value of bands and credits by 10% in <Col N="311"/>line with overall reductions in incomes; tackled over-generous reliefs associated with private pension provision; abolished or restricted many tax reliefs that higher earners use to shelter income unfairly; and targeted the remaining reliefs more clearly on employment growth.  By broadening the base at both ends of the income spectrum, the nominal rates of tax can be kept lower while the effective rate can be raised in a way that is fair to all.  Those on the new reduced minimum wage will not be brought into the tax net.  The top marginal tax rate will be maintained at 52%.</P>
        
         <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>The national recovery plan contains a commitment to the abolition or curtailment of tax expenditures and to the phased abolition of property-based legacy reliefs.  The 16 measures identified in the plan will be given full legislative effect.  This budget will abolish or restrict a further nine reliefs, bringing the total to 25.  Property-based legacy reliefs will be further restricted.  Three new measures in particular will be targeted at passive investors.  Restrictions on the carry forward capital allowances will start in 2011 and have an impact progressively over the next few years.  From 2011, section 23 relief will be restricted to income from section 23 property.  A guillotine provision will ensure all unused capital allowances after 2014 and section 23 reliefs will be lost, effectively terminating all property-based reliefs in 2014.  Following the economy-wide fall in asset values in recent years, the base for capital acquisition tax will be broadened by reducing the tax free thresholds by a further 20%.  Finally, the deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, rate on ordinary deposit accounts is increased by 2% to 27% and on longer-term deposit accounts by 2% to 30%.</P>
        <P>The national recovery plan contains a commitment to significant reform of pension tax relief.  Employee PRSI and health levy relief on pension contributions have been abolished.  The annual earnings cap for tax-relievable pension contributions will be reduced.  The portion of retirement lump sums above &euro;200,000 will be subject to tax and the maximum allowable tax-relieved pension fund will be reduced.</P>
        <P>Employer PRSI relief on employee pension contributions is being reduced by 50% from 1 January next.  The effective tax rate on approved retirement funds will be increased by raising the deemed annual distribution of assets in those funds from 3% of end-year assets to 5% per annum with that distribution subject to full income tax each year.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the 12.5% corporation tax rate was restated in the national recovery plan.  Recent comments by European finance ministers who understand the importance of this issue to Ireland are welcome.  There will be no change to Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax rate.</P>
        <P>In order to stimulate the property market as well as to provide necessary valuation information for a site value tax and to increase market transparency for the smooth operation of the market, stamp duty on residential property transactions has been reformed with immediate effect.  From today there will be a flat rate of 1% on all residential property transactions, old or new, up to a value of &euro;1 million with 2% applying to amounts above &euro;1 million.  All existing reliefs and exemptions for stamp duty on residential property are abolished.  This is in line with the aim of this budget to broaden the tax base.  Instead of increasing rates of tax, which experience shows leaves us with less revenue in many cases, the choice has been made to broaden the tax base if the objective is to bring in extra revenue.  There is no increase in the standard rate of VAT, which has implications for Border counties and the country north of a line from Dublin.</P>
        <P>An air travel tax on passengers departing Irish airports was introduced on 30 March 2009.  The tax is expected to yield &euro;105 million in 2010, despite the impact of the volcanic eruption on air travel this year.  Similar taxes, often at a higher rate, apply in many countries.  There have been consistent calls for the abolition of the tax which is blamed for the reduction in <Col N="312"/>visitor numbers.  I have debated the issue many times in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  The rate of the tax is being temporarily reduced to &euro;3 from 1 March to the end of 2011.  The position will be reviewed next year and the rate will be increased again, unless there is evidence of an appropriate response from the airlines.</P>
        <P>Excise has been increased by 4 cent per litre on petrol and 2 cent per litre on auto-diesel, both increases inclusive of VAT, from midnight last night.  However, the cost of petrol and diesel will still be cheaper south of the Border than it is north of the Border.</P>
        <P>In the light of its success, the car scrappage scheme introduced last year will be extended for a further six months to 30 June 2011.  The VRT relief provided in that period will be up to a reduced maximum of &euro;1,250.  The VRT relief for series production hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles has been extended for two years to the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>A review will be undertaken of the excise duty payable for licences for on-trade and off-licence sales of alcohol products during 2011 to ensure the system is both transparent and fair.</P>
        <P>The construction sector has been at the centre of the economic downturn and it will be some time before the sector returns to a sustainable level of output.  In the meantime the Government wants to ensure existing employment levels are, as far as possible, protected, although they have been greatly reduced, and support construction businesses operating in the legitimate economy.  To that end, the budget proposes significant reform of the relevant contracts tax regime to enhance its effectiveness and reduce the opportunities for fraud and includes a new 20% rate for those registered for tax to foster compliance.</P>
        <P>The budget also introduces a new tax incentive which will support employment, while improving energy efficiency in homes and complement the grant aid available through the home energy savings scheme available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Contractors employed to complete the work must be registered with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Small and medium-sized companies are a cornerstone of employment and innovation in the economy.  As job creation and protection is the Government&rsquo;s priority, it is essential that schemes such as the business expansion scheme and the three-year corporation tax exemption for start-up companies are targeted and evaluated against jobs created or retained.  Accordingly, the business expansion scheme is to be refocused as the investment for employment initiative with increased limits and simplified certification requirements.  The new incentive will expire on 31 December 2013.  The three-year corporation tax exemption for start-up companies commencing a new trade in 2011 will be extended and refocused on employment creation in order that companies which create jobs will be rewarded.  The accelerated capital allowance scheme for energy efficient equipment will also be extended for a further three years.</P>
        <P>The national employment action plan is being refocused to establish clearer pathways to employment by ensuring there will be early and ongoing contact between State agencies and those who have lost their jobs to provide them with opportunities to participate in education, training or work experience placements, as appropriate.  An additional 15,000 activation places and supports for the unemployed will be provided at a cost of approximately &euro;200 million.  The skills development and internship programme will provide up to 5,000 places in the private sector.  The work placement programme will provide up to 5,000 places in the public service.  A new community work placement scheme will provide up to 5,000 additional places in the community and voluntary sector.  The labour activation measures will be complemented by the extension of the employer job, PRSI, incentive scheme to the end of 2011 and transforming the business expansion scheme into a new investment for employment initiative.  The national recovery plan provides for reform of the labour market and the removal of barriers to job creation resulting from inflexible employment agreements and the wider impact of the current <Col N="313"/>level of the national minimum wage.  The aim is to stimulate employment in labour-intensive sectors, particularly for the young.</P>
        <P>The budget has involved hard decisions and choices and will result in reductions in the living standards of nearly everyone in the State.  It is nevertheless the right budget to address the serious problems which threaten the economy and financial sector which are the fundamental basis of our future material well-being.  The budget, while severe, has been fair and seeks to get most from those who can pay most.  Where it has affected the less well-off, particularly those dependent on social welfare, the cuts made have taken account of the substantial increases in such payments in past years which, combined with the recent falls in prices and the prospect of low inflation in future years, will keep the standards of living of these citizens substantially intact.</P>
        <P>This is not just a budget to increase taxes and reduce expenditure; in our current economic circumstances we have to do far more than this.  It is also, crucially, a wide-ranging plan which points the way to securing stability in the public finances and the economy which will be followed by sustainable economic and employment growth in the years ahead and which will also be underpinned by reforms in key areas that will boost the performance of the private and public sectors.  An important point made in a recent debate in this House is that difficult and critical situations such as at present do provide an opportunity to undertake fundamental reforms that are often recognised as desirable in better times but where there is not the impetus or obvious necessity to undertake them.  The point has been made at least as often on the Opposition benches as on the Government side.  This is an opportunity to undertake some fundamental restructuring which will not just save money but also put us on a more sustainable basis for the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The economy is showing widely based and strong signs of recovery.  That should not be surprising because it still has many fundamental strengths.  We have a young, highly skilled, well educated and flexible labour force.  Our infrastructure which had been a serious drag on the economy has been brought up to the standard needed to support growth and the Government will improve on the existing good standard of provision.  Our taxation system strongly supports enterprise and will continue to do so.  Already we have won back much of the competitiveness that we lost earlier in this decade.  However, there is a long way to go yet.</P>
        <P>I was struck by a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> in the past week or ten days from an Irish citizen living and working in Germany, pointing out that, on many fronts, their costs and welfare rates were lower than ours.  I am not sure if I have it to hand, but it is somewhere among my papers.  I was struck forcefully on two recent visits to Germany, one private and one official, to Berlin and Frankfurt, respectively.  This one example is not necessarily hugely significant, but one could get from the centre of Berlin or Frankfurt to the respective airports by train for a fare of &euro;2.50, whereas the minimum fare from somewhere like Bus&aacute;ras is &euro;6.  I am afraid this is replicated in a lot of fields, although not everyone might like to hear it.  There has been talk about dictation from outside, appealing to a latent anti-German feeling, of which I do not think there is much in this country which is in the eurozone.  If we did not realise it before, we do now and have to internalise the logic of this.  We must never again allow ourselves to become uncompetitive and lax because of the apparent ease of conditions, particularly credit conditions, that we have experienced in the past ten years.  Although there is a long way to go yet, the budget is an important first step in restoring stability to our public finances and economy so that we can move with increasing strength and confidence towards securing strong, enduring and job-rich economic growth.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Do I take it from the Minister of State&rsquo;s <i>ad lib</i> comments near the end of his contribution that it was not Lehman Brothers that got us into this mess but Govern<Col N="314"/>ment policy during the past decade?  After we have had time to digest this budget and its impacts fully, it will be interesting to see whether it will contribute to getting us out of this crisis or whether it will be interpreted as a holding budget ahead of an early election, one that will not damage Government parties too much irrespective of whether the long-term crisis gets sorted.  The budget focuses on cuts and taxes.  The measures on jobs are not strong or clearly defined and are not underpinned by the policies that are needed to make them work during the next one or two years.  For this reason, a certain amount of scorn has been poured on the budget.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State alluded to another factor that has contributed to where we are today as opposed to where we were when making our statements on last year&rsquo;s budget.  The dreadful mismanagement of the banking crisis has cost us additional billions of euro that we were not discussing this time last year.  A hallmark of the Government&rsquo;s approach to the banking crisis seems to have been the country getting hit with extra billions of euro every couple of months.  The underlying concern that further problems exist within the banking sector still remains.  I do not want anyone to tell me that Bloomberg is looking in on proceedings in the Seanad and that our rating will drop further following my comments, but the concern about additional problems in the banks and why the Government needs an extra &euro;25 billion is being expressed.  We are not getting much information from the Minister for Finance in that regard.</P>
        <P>Irrespective of this year&rsquo;s one-off measures to deal with the banking crisis, there are ongoing problems with the public finances.  If additional problems exist in the banking sector, next year will also see one-off measures.  Where would that leave the Government deficit next year and the year after?  Some people claim the potential for economic growth is zero while others claim it will be 1.8%.  This is a sizable difference in terms of sorting out the problems in the public finances.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State was right in one respect, in that the non-government economy has reacted quickly, has restored its competitiveness and is on the verge of recovery.  Exports have increased and there are other signs within the private sector that changes are coming about to make it more competitive.  Unfortunately, the parts of the economy for which the Minister of State is responsible do not seem to have the same enthusiasm for or ability to change.</P>
        <P>The budget brings with it risks.  For example, the increased taxes could have a negative impact on the economy.  As is usually the case with budgets, one wonders how some glaring changes were included.  Perhaps the Minister will have an opportunity to consider those at a later stage.</P>
        <P>The last time the Minister of State attended the House during a similar debate on the economy, I asked whether he had indirect concerns about our corporation tax.  While there are no direct concerns, I asked him whether VAT or other taxes would be levied on the profits of some European companies.  This would have an indirect impact on our revenue from corporate taxes.  The Minister of State did not answer.  When he is concluding this debate, perhaps he will respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the reasons we are where we are.  The budget breaks down into cuts valued at &euro;4 billion and taxes valued at &euro;2 billion.  Some &euro;1.8 billion of the cuts will be made in the capital budget.  This is a significant portion of the overall adjustments.  As we pointed out, there is no clear policy on restoring jobs in the economy.  The &euro;1.8 billion would have been spent on building school extensions, refurbishing hospitals, local authorities fixing roads and so on.  As such, it would have provided jobs in the public and private sectors.  This <Col N="315"/>significant cut will have an impact on jobs in both sectors and could lead to further problems next year unless a clear policy, one that is not just about tinkering around the edges, is put in place to reinvigorate job creation.  The Government needs to examine this issue ahead of next year, otherwise we will not be able to get ourselves out of this trouble.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;2 billion in cuts will either come from public sector pay and pensions or social welfare.  We have agreed with the Government on some of the cuts in the social welfare budget that affect people trying to get back to work.  We want to make going to work a desirable option, but there is a sense that working is not the desirable option.  Being on social welfare is offering people a cushion in these straitened times.  We must change people&rsquo;s focus by taking them off social welfare and putting them into work.  We support this policy, but a greater focus must be placed on producing jobs for those who will see their social welfare benefits reduced.</P>
        <P>The naked political decision to leave the old age pension alone has been pointed out, as has the decision to cut the pension entitlements of blind people, widows, widowers and those with disabilities.  It sounds strange that one would want to hurt a 62 year old blind woman, a 59 year old disabled person or someone who was widowed at an early age.  It does not stack up.  Consistency throughout the budget is required and the Government must examine whether other options are available to it instead of targeting a group of vulnerable people, including those with disabilities, who cannot stand up for themselves in the same organised and coherent way in which the elderly approached the Government.  That said, the latter group&rsquo;s approach is good, in that it shows how people power can work.</P>
        <P>Public sector pay and pensions constitute a significant issue.  The amount of money involved is considerable.  Fine Gael has discussed slimming down the public sector and increasing efficiencies.  These measures will be vital in controlling the Government deficit of &euro;18 billion.  What will happen to public sector pay and pensions if efficiencies and redundancies are not delivered and radical changes are not made?  The Croke Park agreement was approved last March, yet there is significant concern to the effect it is not working as it should be.  The International Monetary Fund, IMF, has put a gun to the Government&rsquo;s head by stating it will move by next September.  It is a question of being honest with the large number of people working in the public and civil services and with public sector pensions.  What will occur in three or four years if the situation does not work out?  The only option will be forced redundancies or considerable cuts to pay and pensions.  The unions are also responsible.  There is still a certain mindset within the public sector unions, emanating from the partnership arrangements that were in place for years, to the effect that somehow all that needs to be done is to fill up the ATM machine, but that day is long gone.  There is an enormous push on us to reduce the Government deficit, although the problem was not of our making.  I believe the Government is not showing leadership but rather misleading public sector workers, and those relying on public sector pensions.  It is playing a game with them, indicating in effect that the Croke Park agreement is the one.  Both the Minister of State and I know, however, that this is like a train coming down the tracks and something must be done about it now.  Otherwise, it will just crash straight into the buffers.</P>
        <P>The IMF will enforce stringent cuts to the pay and pensions of public sector workers in the event.  I have nothing against public sector workers.  I am a public sector worker, as is my wife and other members of my family.  If they ask me, I cannot mislead them and say that somehow things will not change if we do not deal with our problems,  if we do not achieve growth in the economy over the next couple of years or if more people lose their jobs.  If the banking crisis deteriorates, we have to pay for it and we must make allowances for that eventuality now.  I do not believe that type of honesty is entering the debate.</P><Col N="316"/>
        <P>On the &euro;2 billion on taxes, one sees that across the board the majority of people will take a hit in take-home income next year of somewhere between 4% and 5%.  It will be somewhat more for some and less for others.  One of the topics raised earlier in the week was the fact that the bankers were still paying themselves bonuses.  Everyone else is taking a 5% pay cut, in effect, to pay out another &euro;25 billion to the banks, and they are awarding themselves bonuses.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue about Ministers giving themselves a clap on the back because their pay has been brought into line with that of President Obama of the United States.  There is an argument that Ministers are still grossly overpaid and perhaps need to look again at their severance arrangements.  There are issues to be addressed when one sees that people on &euro;12,000 will have their pay reduced to something marginally above what an old age pensioner receives.  There are issues about the increasing cost of mortgages next year.  The only areas reflecting inflation in the economy at present are mortgages and utilities such as gas and electricity.  The taxes imposed in this budget affect families who must pay mortgages and meet high ESB and gas bills.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s promise to get rid of property reliefs by 2015 does not really count for much because most of these reliefs would have been for a five or seven-year duration, which means they would have been taken out in 2007 around the time the crisis in the property sector began, so they will have run out.  The Minister of State has not indicated whether the &euro;660 million, which seems to be the price the State will get for the sale of Bord G&aacute;is, is part of the &euro;6 billion as well or whether the whole amount is &euro;6.6 billion?</P>
        <P>On the issue of the cap of &euro;250,000 on public sector pay, were many people taken on in recent months in excess of that figure?  I would like an answer to that when the Minister of State responds because people on the minimum wage face twice as many cuts in terms of adjustments to pay and tax as those who face adjustments being made to social welfare.  That does not send out the right signals when the Government is supposed to be trying to get people back to work.</P>
        <P>I would also like the Minister of State to bear in mind the consequences of the figures for families and individuals.  A family on &euro;40,000 a year, for instance, with three children, will face a cut in take home pay of &euro;1,000.  That is not &euro;1,000 off the &euro;40,000 but rather off the net pay, having paid all the cuts up to this point before the latest changes came into play.  That will fundamentally distort the picture in terms of whether such a family might be better off on social welfare.  The Minister of State needs to look at all these figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join others in welcoming the Minister of State and I am glad of the opportunity to make a few points on yesterday&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P>No one would set out willingly to introduce a budget such as this and many of its measures are regrettable in the context of the reductions people will have to take.  In the history of the State, no Administration, apart from the last two or three, it is worth noting, have invested more across all Departments and sections of society.  Regrettably, as we have analysed in countless debates over the past 12 months, circumstances have changed substantially, and with that so too have policy priorities.  To meet the &euro;19 billion deficit between income and expenditure we have had to adopt a budgetary process which continues with the &euro;6 billion adjustment that was made in yesterday&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a personal level I am surprised at how balanced the budget is.  That is not remotely to suggest there are not many measures in it that will be very painful for people.  As the Minister of State has rightly pointed out, there are measures which will reduce the standard of living for every household in the country.  That is an adjustment very few have had to contemplate. <Col N="317"/> People of my age, 37, and younger have never known the necessity for that type of sacrifice, but this is what is necessary.  There are adjustments we can all make and challenges we can meet if we focus our minds and work together.</P>
        <P>The cost of living in the context of consumer prices is back to about April 2007 levels.  In the context of the proposed reductions in social welfare, for example, this means it will be reduced to &euro;2.20 more than was paid in 2007.  Life was not all bad in those years between 2005 and 2007 in the context of the taxation measures that have been changed and in the context of social welfare.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has gone through the various measures in the budget in some detail and I am not going to replicate that.  I want to indicate, however, a couple of areas with which I am particularly pleased, and one is the old age pension.  Obviously, from the Government&rsquo;s perspective it would have been much better to have been in a position where no cuts had to be made.  Speaking as an individual citizen, I am quite happy to sacrifice more to give relative security to old age pensioners.  I am very pleased the State pension has not had to be cut.</P>
        <P>Another positive move has been the cut in the travel tax from &euro;10 to &euro;3 because this will bolster the incentivisation the airport authorities provide to carriers to encourage them to grow their numbers from those of last year.  There is a vast opportunity in tourism and this initiative can enhance capability to get more people to visit Ireland and get more money into the economy from tourism.  Many other countries have travel taxes and more are to introduce them next year.  This will make us more competitive in that regard and give the airlines, which rightfully have been very vocal in criticising the tax, the opportunity to grow the market and contribute to economic progress.</P>
        <P>In the context of the reworking of the business expansion scheme, the employment investment incentive is very welcome as well.  It increases the maximum to &euro;2.5 million in a given year and for the first time it is very employment focused.  It will be relevant to companies&rsquo; PRSI contributions, and that is very positive because it ensures the numbers of employees must increase if concerns are to maximise the benefits they may draw down from investors.  The three-year corporation tax holiday people are afforded, up to a maximum of &euro;200,000, also must be linked to PRSI contributions, and again this will be very employment focused.</P>
        <P>I welcome the new agri-environment options scheme to be introduced in 2011.  This will be open to those coming out of REPS 3, with participation levels capped at 10,000 and maximum payments at &euro;5,000.  This is a welcome boost.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to our corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  It is vital that we have managed to maintain this because it will be the cornerstone of Government economic policy regardless of who is in government in the coming years.  We have not been hearing much on the airwaves during recent days about the many positives mentioned by the Minister of State.  I watched breakfast television this morning from which the age old concept of balance was absent.  One wonders if Government representatives were invited to participate in any of these programmes.</P>
        <P>While there has been much uncertainty and fear among the public during recent years, this budget and the four year plan announced last week provide certainty and hope for them.  There has been some progress in the real economy.  Unemployment numbers have fallen for three months in a row.  While some people have gone abroad, not all have done so.  There has been job creation.  We have also seen a strong, robust performance in the export area.  As such, there are positives and we must be conscious of them.  We must also believe in the resilience and determination of the people who in the past were able to meet the challenges presented to them.  We certainly can do so again.   While this budget contains painful measures, we can deal with them and make the necessary adjustments.  I accept it will be difficult for the younger <Col N="318"/>generations who have known little more than increments, flexi-time, salary increases, holidays, new cars and so on which came with the Celtic tiger era, but circumstances are different and we must adapt accordingly.</P>
        <P>In terms of rebuttal of some of the things that have been said such as, that we blew the boom and so on, it is worth reminding ourselves of some of what the Minister of State said, namely, that &euro;6 billion was spent on our road network during recent years, 4,000 more garda&iacute; were recruited, 1,700 new prison places were provided, 9,000 more special needs assistants were recruited and we trebled the rates of social welfare between 2000 and 2009 when the prices of goods and services increased by less than one third.  We are not returning back to 2000 levels but to levels which pertained in the middle of this decade.  It is possible for us to make these types of adjustments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are 1.86 million people in employment and we continue to have a strong educated workforce.  I believe the increase in registration fees by &euro;500 is just.  As I have often said to Senator Ross, what other universities like Trinity College, which is among the top 100 universities in the world, do not have fees?  The answer is that there are none.  I would like if in future budgets we could ensure those who can afford it pay higher fees.  My parents paid significantly more in the 1980s than is paid today to ensure my brothers and sisters went to university.  Perhaps there is scope in this area for whoever is in government in the future, be it Fianna F&aacute;il or another party.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I said, the number on the live register has decreased.  Some 2,500 jobs have been announced by Government agencies since March this year.  If one were to average this out, it amounts to almost two announcements per week.  We are ranked number one in the world for jobs created by foreign direct investment.  We have heard many times that eight of the top ten technological firms are based here.  As I said earlier, exports have bucked the trend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having listened to the analysis of the Opposition parties in recent times, while they might be ready for an election one wonders whether they are ready for government.  Their alternative budgets published last week indicate they are to a large extent polar opposites.  While Fine Gael agrees a &euro;6 billion adjustment was necessary in the budget, the Labour Party disagrees and believes this figure should be &euro;4.5 billion.  On &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; on 5 December 2010 Deputy Gilmore stated it was the view of the Labour Party that this is a product of right wing consensus in this country and in Europe and it is not an approach it supports.  Fine Gael disagrees.  It plans to cut a further 30,000 public sector jobs and to dismantle the HSE and F&Aacute;S, with which the Labour Party disagrees.  The Labour Party wants to introduce a new 48% tax rate; Fine Gael vehemently opposes this.  Fine Gael wants to abolish the Seanad and to reduce the number of Deputies by 20; the Labour Party does not agree.  Fine Gael would cut social welfare rates by &euro;6 in 2011, rising to &euro;14 in 2014 while the Labour Party says that all headline social welfare rates must be protected.  Fine Gael wants to increase VAT rates.  On the other hand, the Labour Party believes we should reduce them, which is fantasy land economics in the context of the crisis we are facing.  Clearly, there is work to be done by the Opposition parties as they contemplate their readiness for Government as opposed to elections.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey said the Government had postponed some of its decisions owing to electoral concerns.  The Government published its four year plan last week, the first instalment of which was addressed in yesterday&rsquo;s budget which credibly takes &euro;6 billion from the economy and which, while painful, ensures through the introduction of other schemes that we will not be killing the patient with the medicine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the budget contains difficult measures.  We are a resilient nation, however, and can overcome these difficulties.  The budget is the first instalment of the four year plan. <Col N="319"/> As stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, last Sunday night on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; and echoed today by the Taoiseach, we will support these policies regardless of who is in Government.  We have not conceded defeat in the forthcoming general election.  I have just outlined the reason it is essential people focus on the real alternative.  We have seen from the plans outlined by the alternative government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party that they are polar opposites and have not put forward credible alternatives to what is proposed in the four year plan and budget announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  As difficult as the adjustments are that will have to be made by all sections of society, they are manageable and credible.  I commend the budget to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>As a veteran of many budget debates in this House, I am reasonably used to the pattern of such debates, namely, the Government spokespersons speak about the parts of the budget of which they approve and the Opposition spokespersons speak about the parts of it about which they can be critical and which hurt individual sectors.  While this is not a difficult game to play, it is much more difficult this time round for the Government because this budget contains so little that is saleable to any vested interests or lobby groups, although Senator MacSharry made a good fist of it with the limited ammunition he had in his armoury.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am disappointed the budget is not being debated from a slightly different perspective.  Rather than speak to individual items contained therein we should be examining it in the context in which it comes to us.  If we are honest, this budget is the result of a negotiating rout in Merrion Street ten days ago.  The Government is not unused to negotiating routs for budgets.  This budget, however, despite what has been said by the Minister of State in the debate and by the Minister in the D&aacute;il yesterday, was not written by the Minister or the Cabinet.  It was written and dictated by outside forces that are more powerful than the Government and ourselves.  Whereas this House is so often the rubber stamp in terms of budgets, the rubber stamp in this case was not this House or the D&aacute;il but the Cabinet.  We took our orders from the IMF and Europe.  That is what has been delivered to us today.  This is not unusual because in the past we have taken our orders on budgets from the social partners.  It is enlightening that the social partners are outside the tent on this budget.  The reality is that external forces dictated what went into this budget.</P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I would have preferred us not to have had the type of conventional budget we have and for the Minister to have announced yesterday that we were going to burn the bondholders. Once the decision was made that the bondholders would not suffer any pain, it was directly and immediately transferred to social welfare recipients, taxpayers and even those with a fair amount of wealth.  It would have been better if the Government and the Department of Finance had thought outside the conventional area and stated they were going to make the bondholders pay because that price had to be paid.  There is a rationale for this.  Whereas the bankers are, possibly, the most guilty parties for the entire fiasco that is the economy and they were reckless and irresponsible, where did they get the money?  If we ask the question and point the finger at them and say they were reckless in producing the property frenzy and that they vandalised the nation, we also have to ask if those who gave or lent to the banks must share the responsibility and if they were equally guilty because they also lent recklessly and without accountability.  That was the message we should have received.  The Minister of State should not paint a picture of horror and despair if that were to happen.  It would have been a default, but what would have been wrong with that?  Once one defaults, one is saying, &ldquo;I cannot pay&rdquo;.  The reality is we cannot and could not pay.  We are, in effect, defaulters.</P>
        <P>The lender of last resort has come to rescue us because nobody else will lend us money and the reason is we are bust.  If one looks at the budget from the position of a bankrupt nation, <Col N="320"/>one is looking at it from a very different perspective.  Instead the Government parties took the line that they would pay off the bankers who had lent recklessly to us because they said no one would lend to us ever again if that were to happen, which is an extraordinary reason because nobody was lending to us anyway.  Therefore, what was the big problem?  Our credit rating had sunk to levels which made it impossible for us to borrow.  Why did the Government not state it could not borrow and that it would reach a settlement with the bondholders on its terms, not theirs.  Instead, it has opted to pay a huge price which we probably will not be able to pay.</P>
        <P>We have already debated the interest rate.  I do not want to go over that ground, but it is horrific.  Assumptions made in the four year plan and the budget can be debated until kingdom come, but the growth rates are based on very weak evidence.  It would be surprising to the world markets and many independent economists in Ireland if we had a growth rate that consistently averaged 2.75% in the years to come.  The figures are wildly optimistic.  Perhaps we have to be optimistic, but if we cannot pay the IMF and the European funds the rates they are charging, we will have to borrow more money to pay the penal interest rates on these loans.  There is an element of hope and postponement rather than evidence-based information that indicates that we can pay.  The budget is based on a premise which is on rocky foundations.  Why have we not been given, at least, a good argument spelled out in black and white against the consequences of a default or against a debt for equity swap?  Why have they not been spelled out because people are asking everywhere why the taxpayer has to pay for the sins of the banks?  Why cannot somebody else, particularly the institutions which lent to the banks, at least take some of the pain?</P>
        <P>Why has there not been a good and rational explanation for Ireland not becoming part of a two-tier Europe with two currencies?  These issues still seem to be taboo, but if one looks at what is happening in Europe objectively &mdash; I do not make predictions because that is dangerous and I do not know what will happen no more than anybody else &mdash; the signs of structural strains in the eurozone in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Ireland, France and Greece indicate that is a real possibility.  It is not what anybody wants to see happen, but when one considers that Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland could all be bailed out, the pattern that is developing is that the problem will get larger each time and the eurozone will crack up and, bit by bit, we are trying to put sticking plaster on it.  However, the direction in which we are pointing means something will happen to the euro.  Everybody hopes this will not happen, but let us see what the scenario is because there is a good chance that will happen and, by pretending it is not a possibility every time we have a crisis, we are on the back foot.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first crisis was remedied by the creation of a &euro;750 billion fund which was supposed to be the solution, but we now know the problem is so great that this fund is too small.  If the problem affects Portugal, Spain and Italy, it will have to be increased.  Everybody has read about the squabbling over euro bonds as the next answer to this growing problem.  I do not know whether that will happen, but it looks increasingly unlikely because the Germans will not put up with it.  Why, at the very least does, the Department of Finance not spell out to every concerned citizen the implications of a departure from or the break up of the euro for Ireland, as well as the downside and the upside?  It is no good saying it will not happen because it may.   We are entitled to receive an answer because the budget is working on the absolute assumption that the IMF package will work not only for Ireland but also for Greece and all of the other countries, the economies of which are in jeopardy as a result of the contagion in the banks.</P>
        <P>I wanted to get into the detail of the budget, about which I have been somewhat critical, like everybody else.  However, those who say the budget is an attack on social welfare recipients are right, but spare a thought for middle Ireland and the middle classes also.  What about the <Col N="321"/>young middle class and the middle-aged married couple with two school children to whom Senator MacSharry referred?  They have been hit everywhere, not just in their income but also in child benefit, the price of petrol and mortgage payments.  This has put them in a position where they might not be able to repay their mortgages or educate their children.  That is the reality.  More emphasis might be put on the real difficulties of those who have their heads just above the parapet and who will sink beneath it as a result of this budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning I attended a briefing by the Irish Taxation Institute.  Obviously, the organisation does valuable work, but the briefing revealed the existence of many Irelands.  The reaction to the budget was based solely on the tax changes, as that is within its remit.  There was no reference to the cuts in social welfare payments and only one vague reference to the cuts in public expenditure in general.  What most concerned this group of professionals was that the ability to avoid tax had been seriously compromised by the budget.  Whatever else we might examine with regard to the circumstances that have brought us to this position, at least there should be some acknowledgement of the fact that the budget finally eliminates 25 tax reliefs and tackles the tails that have lingered for too long of unnecessary reliefs extinguished several years ago.  I hope it has undermined the concept of tax reliefs being introduced on such an <i>ad hoc</i> basis with little thought given to their long-term costs and consequences.  This is something that has bedevilled our political system for the last 20 years.  The Labour Party representatives will contribute to this debate on their own behalf, but I recall a Government during the 1990s in which a Labour Party Minister for Finance introduced tax reliefs for items such as holiday homes and multi-storey carparks.  Reliefs were never logical then and are certainly not now; therefore, nobody should regret their passing.  The effect of this and horizontal measures means that those on higher incomes will pay more tax.  These are only some of the balancing measures in the budget.  </P>
        <P>There is a gesture, certainly a small one but a step in the right direction, with regard to ministerial pay.  Frankly, the PRSI adjustment for higher level civil servants, Deputies and Senators is not enough.  It affects income by a figure of approximately 5%, but it should have been a more honest and across the board pay cut.  The budget lacks such gestures to show some affinity with many of the decisions that have had to be made.</P>
        <P>Most of the negative commentary will concentrate on the social protection decisions.  They are the decisions nobody in public life ever wishes to make.  For many of these categories, it is the second year of such changes.  Yes, decisions have been made to protect people on the State pension and other social welfare payments for those over 65 years of age.  However, in the case of cuts to the carer&rsquo;s payment, disability payment and specific payments such as the blind pension, it is difficult to offer a rationale as to how it could be done.  However, how could it have been avoided?</P>
        <P>There have been ten years &mdash; this applies across the political system &mdash; in which we spent too much and taxed too little and the biggest beneficiaries of this were those in receipt of social welfare payments which have more than doubled in a decade, during which the underlying rate of inflation was 40%.  Even following two years of adjustments, they are still at a higher level than those in many other European countries.  They are also at a level at which the recipients&rsquo; purchasing power is still greater than those in receipt of social welfare payments in other countries.  Following the adjustments in this and previous budgets, the rate of child benefit is still three times what it was ten years ago.  This is happening in a country which has lost its ability to be financially sustainable.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross can make the argument, as he regularly does in the Seanad, that the banks have brought us to this position.  I believe they were only the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.  This situation is due solely to the financial unsustainability of the policy mentioned &mdash; <Col N="322"/>the constant willingness to spend more and tax less.  Even the tax changes which bring those on lower incomes into the tax net and the introduction of the universal social charge will result in the country having an average tax regime, as a percentage of GDP, that is still lower than the European average.  This distancing from reality, in which we lived through a period of time when we thought we had it all but were not providing for it or not doing so sustainably and ignoring the future consequences, is something that is as much a societal problem as a political problem.</P>
        <P>That said, the circumstances created since 2008 and how they would have been dealt with by any other combination of political parties would not have been substantially different.  One could have taxed slightly more, but the more one taxes, the more one undermines the ability of the economy to recover quicker.  Some might have been tempted to cut even more, but the more one cuts, particularly in areas such as social welfare, the more one deprives others of the right to spend.  Spending more money in the economy also acts as an economic impetus.  Getting the balance right will be a challenge for any Government.  It is not realistic to claim that whatever budget is produced in these circumstances and the budgets that will follow in the next three to four years can be produced without affecting the 40% of the budget that is accounted for by social welfare payments or the 80% accounted for by social welfare payments, health and education funding.</P>
        <P>In the context of the OECD report released today and the critical comments made on the Order of Business both here and in the Lower House, the fact that current expenditure on education will rise this year appears to have been missed by many of those who are critical of the budget.  There will be more teachers.  Our demographics are such that there are more young people and we must provide more teachers to maintain the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On all these grounds, the budget has the right emphasis.  Two themes must be conveyed in the budgetary process &mdash; to protect and try to improve education and training, for economic as much as social reasons, and to encourage and foster enterprise.  We have elements within the economy because it is an open economy and attracts foreign direct investment that will see it grow in any case.  We can argue about whether the rate will be 2.75%, but there will be growth.  What will make it necessary and sustainable is if we can add the ingredients of hope and confidence.  I hope there will be these ingredients for whoever is in government in the coming years.</P>
        <P>One of our main difficulties and the reason we found ourselves in a situation where we had to accept an agreement with the European Union and the IMF is not that we could not borrow money &mdash; we can &mdash; but that the rates of interest available for that money are utterly unsustainable.  One of the reasons for this, aside from the weakness of the euro as a currency, is our ability to talk ourselves into a situation where things are as bad as they can possibly be, are beyond salvation and that somehow we need to be dug out of a hole.  The elimination of that attitude is the first requirement.  The reality is that when we have a &euro;15 billion adjustment, with &euro;6 billion being front-loaded of &euro;6 billion &mdash; I accept that not everybody accepts this &mdash; it cannot be done without striking an appropriate balance between cutting capital and current expenditure and increasing taxation.  To believe that we can achieve the &euro;6 billion this year or the &euro;15 billion in any year, and not affect social protection, is not being honest with the people.  Once the finance Bill and the social welfare Bill that accompany this budget are approved and we eventually have a national debate in the form of an election campaign, then we will have honesty about our economic future, when we have that conversation with the people.  It has been sadly lacking today.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="323"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not accept it is dishonest to say we can make the kind of adjustment that undoubtedly is required without affecting social welfare.  As I do not accept that, I must be blunt about it.  In circumstances where the Government has engaged in an adjustment in this budget of the order of &euro;6 billion, we know the proportion that is attributable to social welfare payments, including the reduction in payments to people of working age and in payments of child benefit, amounts to about &euro;500 million.  I do not accept the proposition of Senator Boyle and others that it is not possible for the Government to avoid affecting the least well-off in our society and to avoid reducing welfare payments by 4% and still bring in a credible budget.  I think he is wrong with that proposition, but he is right to say we will have an opportunity to debate these issues in the course of the general election, which cannot come soon enough.  I would not mind asking Senator Boyle when he thinks that will come.  We have heard all manner of rumours about extensions and target dates moving as well as proposals for referenda being held on the same day as a general election and so on.  What is going on?  Perhaps the leader of the Green Party will clarify that when he gets an opportunity.</P>
        <P>I would like to begin my contribution by quoting the Minister of State towards the end of his speech, which I thought was quite striking.  He said: &ldquo;This is not just a budget to increase taxes and reduce expenditure; in our current economic circumstances we have to do far more than this.&rdquo;  He went on to say: &ldquo;It is also, crucially, a wide-ranging plan which points the way to securing stability in the public finances and the economy which will be followed by sustainable economic and employment growth in the years ahead and which will also be underpinned by reforms in key areas that will boost the performance of the private and public sectors.&rdquo;  With all due respect, he could have fooled me.  He could have fooled anyone who heard the speech because this is entirely a measure that increases taxes and reduces expenditure.  Can someone point to a plan in here?  Where is it?  It is not in the speech.  It is not in the bigger document.  It is not there.  It does not exist.  There is no point in the Minister of State trying to persuade us it is there when it is not.  We had a look and we cannot find it.</P>
        <P>It comes down to what Senator Boyle said in his contribution when he used the word &ldquo;wish&rdquo;.  In fairness to him, he said in good faith that he wishes that there would be growth and that the Irish economy&rsquo;s fortunes would improve under whichever Government is in charge of it.  It is fair enough that he should wish those things, and I share his good wishes that things would improve.  More is expected of politicians, however, than the expression of wishes.  Senator Boyle is right when he says we are not beyond salvation.  I do not believe anything in human affairs is beyond salvation.  It is not beyond our ingenuity as a people to turn this appalling situation around.  I share the optimism, but that is not to say it is not a very difficult task.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that we can regain control of our affairs, develop and improve our country and the wealth of our people if we take the right decisions.  Wishing it to happen will not make it happen.  There is no point in just talking about wishing.</P>
        <P>The first difficulty we in the Labour Party have with this budget is that it is only six weeks since the Department of Finance stated the correct order of adjustment in the 2011 budget was &euro;4.5 billion.  That is a very short time since the Department took this view.  Its officials were exercising a judgment.  Everyone knows that if we take money out of the economy in this radical way, we will cause a deflationary impact.  The Government does not talk about that.  Its members accept it is true if this is put to them, but they tend not to want to remind us of that.  Whether it was &euro;6 billion, &euro;4.5 billion, &euro;3 billion or &euro;1 billion, we know it would have that impact.  People might ask why we are going for &euro;4.5 billion or &euro;6 billion.  They want to know where we get the figures.  These numbers can go over people&rsquo;s heads sometimes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have to exercise a judgment.  We have to point out that this will have a negative impact.  How can we minimise that impact?  How can we control the possibility of growth in the economy and not rely on international improvements?  What steps can we take to ensure we open <Col N="324"/>up and free up the possibility for growth in the economy?  It seems an adjustment of &euro;6 billion in such a brutal way can only have the effect of very severely deflating, if not clobbering, the economy and any prospects it has for growth next year.  There is no point in Ministers or their colleagues in this House criticising the Labour Party and saying a figure of &euro;4.5 billion does not have credibility when this was the Department&rsquo;s own figure only six weeks ago.</P>
        <P>We are seeking to exercise a judgment on what the correct figure ought to be.  Why did it get to &euro;6 billion from &euro;4.5 billion?  How did it happen?  It is clear what happened and it has been admitted what happened.  The members of the Government saw the chaos on the markets and the extraordinary difficulty we had in borrowing at any kind of a sustainable level and they decided they would throw them the figure of &euro;6 billion in the hope that this would be good for the optics, that this would persuade people they were serious in Dublin, that they were really taking this on board, that they were going to tear the backside out of their economy and that they really meant business.  They were not talking about &euro;4.5 billion but about &euro;6 billion.  It was all about optics and how it would look.  How does it look to people who are facing a reduction in welfare payments?  How does it feel to them?  What are the optics of the situation for the people who must sustain the effect of this much larger adjustment?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State in the House, Deputy Brady, will understand the effects of what is happening.  We all see the effects of it in the daily lives of people in our constituencies.  We cannot turn our backs on that.  There is much lip service paid to fairness in this budget, but it is no more than lip service.  It is not a fair budget.  No budget can be fair.  There is a notion that to be fair, we must take something from everyone.  There are many people in society who cannot afford to have anything taken from them.  Let us be blunt about that.  It is an academic argument to demonstrate by taking some from here and more from there and so on, but there are some people who cannot manage if anything at all is taken from them, given what they have had to sustain over the past two years.  That is the basis on which we should be debating this.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Ross that the budget is the result of a negotiating rout.  Instead of sitting down, as they do in other countries, to negotiate a memorandum of understanding, the Minister of State claims we prepared one and that the IMF and European Central Bank looked at it and stated they would have everything in it.  Pull the other one.  Does anyone believe there was no close collaboration between the Government and the external parties to the memorandum of understanding prior to its being agreed?  No one buys this.  This is part of the narrative that stretches back to the start of the crisis, where people are told things by Ministers and, like in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, words mean what the Minister says they mean.  People can read and understand what is going on.  They do not buy the notion that the budget is anything other than the result of the Government being in an incredibly weak position by virtue of the catastrophic failure of its banking policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">How many times in this Chamber have we heard the Government and its supporters say the reason we had to pump money into the banks and establish NAMA and introduce all of the other measures introduced was so that the banking system would function again and lend in the economy?  They have not said this for weeks now because they would not have been able to say it while keeping a straight face.  It has not happened and there is no sign that it will.  Where is the credit from the banking system, the life blood of business?  It is not forthcoming.  Even according to the Government&rsquo;s own test of the success of its banking policy, the availability of credit, it has failed.  To call it mistaken does not even begin to describe the disaster of the Government&rsquo;s banking policy, which is recognised internationally.  It is an disaster to pin the fortunes of the taxpayer to the banking system as it collapses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The budget comes at the end of an extraordinary period.  It is a bookend in historical terms.  Senator MacSharry can read bullet points of good things that have happened within the last <Col N="325"/>ten years all he wants &mdash; good things did happen; infrastructure has been improved &mdash; but if they had not happened, it would have been absolutely extraordinary.  Why would it be a surprise if we could point to something like the roads system or the provision of special needs assistants?  If they were not in place, it would be worse than an abject failure.  Of course, there have been infrastructural gains; the problem is that the Government failed throughout this period to provide sustainable funding for infrastructure and public services more generally.  It ignored that key responsibility, not just to find money to pay this year&rsquo;s bills but also to look to the future of our children and put in place a sustainable basis for funding the public services we want.</P>
        <P>That idea was totally set to one side by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Its view of the economy and future looked to the fortunes of the party rather than the country.  That is why we have reached this stage.  No amount of pleading on the part of the Government, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il, that no one saw this coming and that the Opposition had demanded improved services, as if that was not our responsibility, will lessen the impact of that fact.  The Government is a gate keeper and iresponsible for the public finances.  What it has done in the budget will not give anyone confidence that it has taken a serious approach to securing the future of the country or the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The necessity of the budget announced yesterday is clearly outlined by the fact that we spend significantly more than we take in.  In the good years, when the money was rolling in &mdash; we are now being blamed for the expenditure then incurred &mdash; it is worth noting that across every Department, the Opposition was looking for extra expenditure.  Not only that, but it blamed us for not foreseeing the banking crisis or the property bubble, yet in its last manifesto, Fine Gael wanted to do away with property tax.  This morning, however, we are being asked not to mind the fact that the Opposition sought these increases because that was the job of the Opposition parties and they did not really mean it.  That is arrant nonsense.</P>
        <P>The &euro;6 billion in adjustments that had to be made yesterday were made in a fair manner across the board.  There were some increases in income tax and some decreases in social protection rates.  The reason there was a decrease in certain social protection payments was to ensure there would be social protection in the future.  How will the Opposition parties reconcile the fact that one wants to see no increase in taxation, while the other wants to see no cuts in social protection payments?  How will they ever get a budget through?  If they are to be honest with the people, they will have to tell them on the doorsteps that they will have to compromise and change their policies if they are to put together a Government.  We all know that will not happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask people to bear in mind that these were necessary adjustments and that the Government made them in a fair manner and only to protect people.  When we look at the decreases in social protection payments, the average figure is 4.1%.  The only thing that matters is what a person can spend.  The fact that there was an 8% decrease in the cost of living means real spending power has been protected.  What would be the use of a 10% increase if the inflation rate was 20%?  People are being protected a level that is sustainable and affordable.  I am particularly pleased that in difficult times the Government was able to achieve this.</P>
        <P>The fact that we are looking at a growth rate of 1.7% has been questioned, with people asking how we can achieve such growth when taking &euro;6 billion out of the economy.  As one of the most globalised economies in the world after Singapore and Hong Kong, we will disproportionately share in the growth in world markets which are to grow significantly this year.  A growth rate of 1.7% next year will come exclusively from growth in world markets.  We have achieved significant increases in exports this year, with manufacturing output up 12% in the third quarter.  Export figures were up 7% in real terms in the first half of the year, while corporation taxes were up significantly.  This year we will come out of the recession and next <Col N="326"/>year we will see growth.  The live register figures are down for the third month in a row, while the number of redundancies is down by 30%.</P>
        <P>There are initiatives to look after the unemployed in the budget that are welcome such as the extension of the employer job initiative, the additional 15,000 activation places for the unemployed and the refocusing of the national employment action plan to provide opportunities to avail of education, training and work experience placements.  Also to be welcomed is the transformation of the business expansion scheme into a new employment and investment incentive to boost job creation by small and medium-sized enterprises.  The amount has also increased and the regulations have been eased in order that it is easier and more efficient for businesses to avail of the scheme, because businesses are always complaining about red tape.  This is also to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The necessary adjustments in salary have been carried out by the Government.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers have again reduced their salaries for this year, and many public officials have agreed voluntarily to reduce their salaries to the new limit of &euro;250,000, including those in State agencies.  At a time of fiscal uncertainty, when we are making necessary adjustments, salaries of more than &euro;500,000 or up to &euro;750,000 in State agencies are unsustainable.  There are people who will be happy to accept the changes.  The old adage about losing the best and the brightest was the argument used by the banks, and we saw what happened there.  We want the best and the brightest.  It says a lot about a person that he or she is willing to take a salary cut to &euro;250,000 while continuing to work at a high level in the public service, rather than in the private sector, to do something for the State.  Of course, there are benefits to working in the public sector, one of which is security of employment.</P>
        <P>Tax must be levied on the basis that everyone contributes according to his or her means, and that is what the Government achieved in yesterday&rsquo;s budget.  The income and health levies will now be replaced with a single universal social charge, the employee PRSI contribution ceiling will be removed, and the PRSI rate for the self-employed, high-earning public servants and office holders will be increased.  We all took a reduction of 10% in tax bands and tax credits.  The excessively generous reliefs on private pensions needed to be tackled.  The many tax reliefs that high earners used to establish tax shelters were effectively abolished yesterday, which must be welcomed.  At a time of fiscal uncertainty we must have equity, and those who can afford to pay more need to pay more.</P>
        <P>If we are taking increased amounts of tax from the economy, we need to give a message of hope.  The message of hope has not gone away.  Our 12.5% rate of corporation tax is one of the foundation stones of our development, and we are still bringing disproportionate amounts of foreign direct investment to this country.  What we say in this forum is not said in a vacuum.  To say the economy is a corpse or that it is banjaxed is inappropriate.  Those who suggested the economy was banjaxed then turned around and said that was not really what they had meant.  They said it was something to do with mechanics and that it was a Dublin colloquialism meaning a car that needed to be fixed.  That is arrant nonsense.  To say something is banjaxed means it is broken badly, possibly beyond redemption.  That is what went out into the international marketplace, and it did this country harm.</P>
        <P>One item in the budget which will be significant in the future and which we should consider in terms of underpinning the housing market is the new provision on stamp duty.  The property market still has a disproportionate effect on Ireland Inc., and the reduction of stamp duty to 1% will at last give a boost to that sector on which we are so dependent.  The reason we are unable to fix the amount the banks or NAMA might need is our inability, in a falling market, to see the floor.  We will now, through the efforts of the Government, see a levelling off of the property market, which will be a significant boost.  We can clearly see a period of growth ahead, <Col N="327"/>which is badly needed.  I welcome that change in particular.  There were many other positive developments in yesterday&rsquo;s budget.  It is a difficult time, but it was done fairly, and that is the criterion by which I am happy to be judged.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want to talk about the way in which Senator Hanafin evaluated this budget in terms of fairness, and I will consider a number of examples to help us understand how fair it really is.  Before I do so, however, I want to consider some of the commentary that has taken place about the budget.  I was struck by an image I saw on my way to the House this morning.  It was a picture on the front of a newspaper of the Minister for Finance dressed up as a German general, and the message was that Ireland had been given orders from abroad to blitz various parts of our society.  That is a myth we must destroy in the House.  Such images and language do our country no good and have the potential to cause great harm.  There is no doubt our country was targeted to deliver a deficit reduction of &euro;6 billion in the budget.  Even if we were not dependent on the IMF and the ECB for outside help, those cuts would have been required.  The deficit reduction programme that has been undertaken by the Government, the objectives of which Fine Gael supports in the context of this budget, is necessary for our country to regain its full independence and to ensure it can stand on its own two feet.  Regardless of the relationship we have with the outside world and how it has changed, we would need to do that anyway.  A myth is being peddled by certain people with vested interests within and outside our country that there are other options open to Ireland, that we could go it alone or consider measures such as defaulting on our sovereign debt, but any of those measures would be catastrophic to the interests of our country.  As I said before, Ireland should not be involved in any experiment that no country in the developed world has managed to pull off.</P>
        <P>One of the great engines of economic prosperity our country has enjoyed has been our positive engagement with the outside world.  Let us stop blaming the outside world for the difficulties in which we find ourselves.  Much of that difficulty was inflicted on our country by Fianna F&aacute;il, a party in a Government we elected ourselves.  That was the cause of our difficulties.  It was not a foreign or alien agency that caused this fate to befall our people and our country, it was choices that were made at home.  For our country, and people who are writing about our country, to indulge in a fantasy that seeks to put the blame on others is the worst possible kind of escapism.  It is dangerous and it could be fatal.  We need to be honest and accept that the cause of this was decisions that were made at home, decisions made politically by Fianna F&aacute;il which will pay the price.  That said, decisions made at home are capable of restoring our country to the path it should be on.  Let us not blame people who were not involved or who, if they did play a role, played a far smaller role than domestic forces &mdash; faces we knew and people who were elected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Hanafin said that the budget sent a message of hope and fairness.  I want to consider three examples and ask where is the hope and fairness of which he speaks.  The first is the reduction in the salaries of Cabinet Ministers and the Taoiseach.  The story that has been put out is that our political leaders and the elite are taking pain to reflect what the rest of the country is going through.  The fact is that before those changes were implemented and before the minimum wage was cut, the Taoiseach was earning 13 times the minimum wage but after these changes are implemented he will be earning 14 times the minimum wage.  These are the figures.  The minimum wage will be cut at a faster rate than the salary of anyone holding senior public office in this country.  This is exactly the type of relationship and unfairness that makes the people we represent believe other forces are at play beyond the need to be fair and to ensure everyone shares the burden equally.  A great deal more could have been done to ensure the budget was fair and that the people at the top, especially those at the top of the public service and the political classes, made a fairer contribution.</P><Col N="328"/>
        <P>Our party has outlined what we believe these proposals should involve, including a smaller D&aacute;il and the future of the Seanad.  Our leader has made clear that upon the formal announcement of a general election, we will have more to say about the salaries people are paid in these Houses and the way we conduct our business.  Let us consider those who teach in the classroom, run schools or hold senior roles in hospitals.  These are the type of front-line workers that my colleague, Senator Jerry Buttimer, talks about regularly with such passion.  We must reach a point such that no one in these Houses is earning much more than anyone performing such roles.  Only then will we restore fairness and the principle of ensuring everyone makes a contribution to the path out of this disaster.  Only then will the people who wish to be led have faith in those who aspire to lead them.</P>
        <P>Another example of where fairness appears to be lacking is the relationship between those on the minimum wage and those on social welfare.  Our country learned a crucial lesson during the 1980s, especially the middle of the 1980s, about the need to ensure the right incentives are in place for someone who wishes to work and that it is worth his or her while to work.  Both of these boxes must be ticked.  Many people are keen to work but we must ensure it is worth their while to work.  If a person enters the workplace and finds he or she is worse off as a result, the people who suffer are his or her children and those workers trying to pay household bills and mortgages.</P>
        <P>Let us consider someone on the minimum wage who will now be in the net for the universal social contribution.  Such a person will be &euro;879 per year worse off as a result of the implementation of this budget.  This is twice the adjustment or change that someone on social welfare must face or deal with.  This will mean the incentive for people at the lower end of the income scale in the services industries and what is left of the construction industries to work beyond the need to maintain their dignity and self-esteem, which is their primary motivation, will be reduced further.  We must find a way to ensure this is re-balanced and the incentive to work is maintained where the social welfare system meets the tax code.  I am concerned this area has been dealt damage as a consequence of the changes made yesterday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will finish on a broader point with regard to the apparatus of the State.  We are all aligned to the view that we should take the most from those who need it least.  The classic example often proposed relates to child benefit.  Why do people on high incomes need child benefit?  I have some sympathy for the point of view but this is the choice we must consider making.  It stuns me that whenever this issue is explored, we are informed we do not have the administrative ability to distinguish between people on different levels of income and tailor child benefit or the welfare payment such people receive to reflect the difference.  How have we reached the point that our systems are unable to tailor fully the level of welfare benefit a person has to that person&rsquo;s need?  Had more progress been made in this area there would not have been the need for the instruments under discussion today to be as blunt as they are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the comments of Senator Donohoe regarding media comment and the way in which we are portrayed abroad.  It is important the proper message is sent from these Houses that the budget represents taking responsibility for our imprudent past spending.  The budget today represents a correction to ensure the message goes out loud and clear to the markets, the EU and the IMF, the organisations currently funding our situation for the coming three years.  It is vital we do this and put down this marker.</P>
        <P>I realise every household and family in the country will suffer greatly because of various decisions we have had to make in the budget and we should not minimise or understate the importance of this.  In future when times become good again we must be more prudent than we have been.  Having said this, many good things took place during the ten or 12 years of the <Col N="329"/>Celtic tiger.  People have indicated that there are better roads and water systems.  We have upgraded our rail systems, including the Luas system.  There have been improvements in education and sports.  Although the health system could be improved, many great achievements have been made in the health services, including breakthroughs to help people suffering from cancer and various other diseases.  These are all pluses and we should not undersell or underestimate the value to our economy in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind that the EU has a responsibility to all members in the community.  As one such member of the community I believe the EU paid a major part in ensuring cheap money was sent into this economy.  This is a danger from which we have suffered within the EU.  Now the EU does not wish to take responsibility for this.  This represents a failure in the system as well as our own failure to recognise the problem.  It is important to correct this.  There was a suggestion that a new bond system in the EU would be considered.  The paymaster of the EU, the German economy, has decided it does not favour this idea.  It is important we reflect on how we can fund ourselves in future and the budget is the first step on the ladder, regrettable though it is and that it will affect every family in the country.  Everyone who works will pay something in this budget and this is where fairness comes into it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some elements of the budget may help us to lift the property situation which is effectively non-existent. The reduction in stamp duty will help restore some sort of reasonable sales to the property market.</P>
      
        
        <P Just="Left">It is important to remember that in the 1980s we paid 35p in the punt on our debt abroad while it will only cost 22 cent in each euro now.  These facts need to be used to put the economy into perspective.  We must ensure we manage the economy much better than we did in the past.  It is good if it means we have someone from the International Monetary Fund or the European Commission looking over our shoulder to ensure that happens.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It would be remiss of me not to point out that any other government would have had to have introduced exactly the same budgetary measures.  The Fine Gael Party has shown a genuine consensus in this regard.  Polls indicate the new government will be made up of Fine Gael and Labour, however, and the latter has a very different approach to tackling these budgetary requirements.  Accordingly, there will be difficulties for both parties to join up the dots when it comes to taking hard decisions.  Unless both parties come to some sort of a compromise, I cannot see how they can provide effective government.  Fine Gael has also ruled out Sinn F&eacute;in as government partners.  According to the polls, Labour and Sinn F&eacute;in could reach 39% of the national vote.  What would happen then in the election of a new Taoiseach?</P>
        <P>This budget is an important step in tackling our economic problems.  I am glad we have ensured the old age pension and those at the lowest end of the ladder are protected, an important part of any budget.  This is where fairness comes into this budget.  A low inflation rate will also help ease the other reductions.  Albeit unwelcome, those reductions are necessary to balance our spending costs and send the correct message to our European partners and international markets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I meant as an adviser.  To paraphrase the bible, shouts of glee will go up with trumpet blasts when the Taoiseach calls time on this Government.  Ireland&rsquo;s current economic position has been greeted with amazement and incredulity abroad.  Friends of mine from across the world have e-mailed me wondering if we will be okay in this crisis.  It is hard when one sees a great nation reduced as such before the eyes of the world.</P>
        <P>I do not believe for one second our economic crisis was a result of the world recession or the decision of the former US President, Mr. Bush, to let Lehman Brothers go.  I believe it was the policies of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  These have led to polarisation in society with, unfortunately, the Government successfully managing to pit private sector worker against public sector worker, the lower and middle classes against the upper classes.  In the past 13 years, it has also marginalised people, giving a young educated generation no hope but to emigrate with no opportunity to return home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Budget Statement indicates that with the fall in economic activity and the impact on Government revenues, the State is no longer in a position to afford the level of public services and social welfare rates of recent years and that reductions in capital expenditure in 2011 will also be significant.  That is an indictment of the Government&rsquo;s policies which have caused our nation to become paralysed and our people to live in fear and trepidation.  I do not say that lightly.  I canvass my constituency four days a week and everyone I meet is united in their disbelief at how Ireland has come to this.</P>
        <P>Under three main headings, this budget can be judged as not being fair, not protecting the most vulnerable in our society and not providing a job stimulus package.  I agree with Senator Hanafin that we must be careful with the language we use in these debates.  As a teacher, I am proud of the students who come out of our schools and the graduates from our universities.  I am also very proud of our public sector workers who do great work in their respective front-line services, protecting, defending, caring and educating.</P>
        <P>I dismiss the naysayers &ndash; those opposed to reform &ndash; in the public service, however.  The Fine Gael Party is not for cutting public sector wages but for real sectoral reform.  The opportunity for reform could have been grasped in this budget but the Government flunked it.  There is no need for the public sector to be afraid of Fine Gael&rsquo;s polices on the public sector.  We stand with public sector workers, but for a better and more streamlined sector.</P>
        <P>Ireland will recover.  I agree with those speakers who say it is not banjaxed.  It may be broken and demoralised, but we will rise again.  We have done so at every opportunity in our history and always emerged as a better nation, producing great individuals in the arts, education, sport and music.</P>
        <P>There must be a changing of the guard that runs the country.  Any Government which can propose a reduction in the national minimum wage and allow the banks to continue with a culture of bonuses and high remuneration rates does not have the concerns of its people at heart.  The bottom line is that the Government has not been pro-employment.  We must examine how we can promote job creation and reward entrepreneurship.  Surely a person is better off working than on social welfare, but there is no message of hope and fairness in the budget.</P><Col N="331"/>
        <P>While I welcome the cuts to ministerial salaries, including the Taoiseach&rsquo;s, they do not go far enough.  The Government has no real ability to tackle the cost of the political class.  We can quote the percentage decreases in recent years, but those on lower incomes and the national minimum wage are being pummelled, which is wrong.  We cannot allow a situation to continue where the marginalised are penalised.  The budget is lacking in social justice and fairness.  Since yesterday people have contacted me by text and telephone to ask how they can afford to continue when they are already struggling to make ends meet.  Are we seriously saying blind people, the elderly and the disabled must pay for the sins of a few?  I hope that is not the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  We should consider the implications of budget 2011 in the context of what the Government has done in recent months to sort out the country&rsquo;s problems.  It has set out its stall by directing and restructuring policies and services to boost confidence.  For the first time in the country&rsquo;s history, the budget was approached on the basis that it formed part of a multi-annual process, as set out in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  That is the correct procedure to adopt and I hope it will be set in stone for years to come.</P>
        <P>The policies pursued in the last two years by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration, with the four year plan, the joint EU-ECB-IMF programme of assistance and the financial measures in budget 2011, are all targeted at getting the country back on its feet.  We have all heard the announcements by a host of commentators, not just in the last 24 hours but in the past two or three years, on the state of the economy.  These commentaries have focused on unemployment, our financial difficulties and the banking crisis.  We have heard that a variety of adjustments are necessary to ensure correction.  In certain instances, there has been detailed analysis of isolated aspects, but there has been a great deal of fragmented thinking and a fuelling of destructive propaganda.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt we are at a critical point in the country&rsquo;s history, but we are not alone in facing this challenge.  We must take account of the position in the world around us.  The sad, sober and grim reality is that we are going through an exceptionally difficult period.  All of the elements of the global economic and financial difficulties are present in the domestic economy and, in certain instances, are more intense.</P>
        <P>It has been said a rising tide lifts all boats.  Equally, however, one assumes an ebb tide lowers all boats.  We are in uncharted waters, with unprecedented internal and external factors having an impact on our course.  At times such as these, if I were asked whom I would like to see captaining the ship, I would prefer to have an experienced captain who knows all about the impact external forces can have.  The National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 demonstrates that we have a Government with knowledge and expertise.  Budget 2011 is an addendum to that plan.  We must examine the macro picture.  In launching the four year plan the Government indicated that it was only part of a process, that the budgetary aspects would form another.  We have seen the first instalment in budget 2011.</P>
        <P>The question at issue is whether the Government is taking the correct measures or whether somebody else could do better.  Allowing for the impact of external forces, the Government was not content to let the downward spiral continue.  It could have taken the easy option of engaging in window-dressing with a general election looming.  Instead it took the appropriate measures &mdash; albeit tough ones &mdash; in the national interest.</P>
        <P>Given everything that has been said, I am seriously concerned about the message emanating from the media and my colleagues in the Oireachtas.  We all need to display a positive attitude.  There is no doubt that a renewed effort is required, with a strengthening of our national will and an ability to succeed in tackling the challenges facing us.  We are a great people with tremendous determination and resilience.  Budget 2011, the national recovery plan and the EU-<Col N="332"/>ECB-IMF joint assistance programme present a clear framework to which we can all work.  It is a welcome framework that allows us to take the necessary corrective action.  In two or three years we may come back and say we should have tweaked it one way or another.  It is easy to do that in retrospect.  The policies of this Government over the past two years, the work in the national recovery plan and the joint assistance programme are all targeted in the same direction.  That shows there are people with knowledge and experience who know the direction in which this country should be headed.  The figures add up, the equation works out and the equation was not considered solely on the basis of party politics or the Government.</P>
        <P>I do not have the time or information to go into the full details of the budget, nor am I qualified.  I agree with the Minister for Finance and the Government when they say that the issue is jobs.  I congratulate the Government on what it has done on exports and other aspects, including the falling number of people signing on for unemployment benefit.  This points in a positive direction.</P>
        <P>We can do other things that cost little money and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to take one aspect back to his Government colleagues.  Recognising the importance of jobs in exports, we should listen to small and medium-sized enterprises.  We should work with them closely over a short period to identify the issues that must be addressed because they have their finger on the pulse.  Issues are causing impediments to small and medium-sized enterprises.  If the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation had an e-mail system with an accident and emergency assistance line to hear what businesses want the Government to do to assist them in creating jobs and products, it would be greatly beneficial.  I regret I do not have sufficient time but I will take the issue up with the Minister of State directly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to know what to say on an occasion such this.  I was in the Visitors Gallery of the D&aacute;il yesterday, as were many of my colleagues, listening and witnessing what happened as the budget was presented by a man with whom I have a professional friendship and whom I respect and like, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  What appalled me was the spurious air of formality given by the production of the document, which is just like all the other budgets.  The atmosphere in the House, the tables at the back and the supplementary leaflet were all as if everything was just as usual.  In the Minister&rsquo;s opening statement, he said this had been a traumatic and worrying time for the citizens of the country.  That is the understatement of the year.  I would say apocalyptic on a biblical scale.  Later that evening, when I heard the Bank of Ireland ATMs were vomiting money onto the snow, I decided to pack my bags and get off home before it started raining blood and I was attacked by an army of frogs on O&rsquo;Connell Street.  We had the locusts in last week and we fed them our elderly, our infirm and our weak.  They gobbled them up greedily and now they are back for more.  We are still supine because this country and its workers have been sold into slavery.  This must be particularly difficult for the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  There has been a betrayal of the principles on which this State was founded and, in particular, of the ideals so movingly expressed in the Proclamation of Easter 1916.  In what manner could this budget be held to cherish all the children of the nation equally?  It simply does not.  In microcosm, it does what the ECB and IMF have done to us in that it privileges the rich and disadvantages the poor.</P>
        <P>I cannot possibly agree to this.  There is no vote allowed in the Seanad; we are not to be trusted with finance.  How extraordinary and laughable it is that Senators are not regarded as worthy to have a proper say, control or a vote on a budget such as this because we might be irresponsible.  There has been plenty of real irresponsibility in the other House and it cannot be covered by any quantity of cant about what a wonderful, resilient people we are and how <Col N="333"/>we must act in the national interest, ensure we show the country in a positive light and be careful of our reputation.  We have very little reputation left and it is time we faced the facts.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech in the Dail yesterday was full of logical jumps, gaps, inconsistencies and points that are difficult to believe.  He stated: &ldquo;For the period out to 2014, real GDP is forecast by my Department to increase by an average of almost 2.75% per annum&rdquo;.  Does anyone believe any of the figures that come out of the Department of Finance?  They have been wrong for so long.  I remember saying long before this crisis that the Department of Finance rarely got any of its figures or forecasts right.  My attention was drawn to this by the late Mr. Ken Monaghan, a nephew of James Joyce and a banker.  Over coffee, he and I used to discuss the production of these figures.  We tallied how disastrously wrong they inevitably were.</P>
        <P>The Minister asked the following question:</P>
        <P LI="1">So if the real economy is poised to grow, why do we need the help of the IMF and the EU?  The answer is that we need their support to break the vicious cycle that has threatened our national finances and our banking system.</P>
        <P FLI="0">No, not at all.  The answer is that he was so ineffably stupid as to give the banks a blanket guarantee.  This was the astonishing and catastrophic mistake.  Everything else could be dealt with, although with difficulty and hardship for all of us, which one would hope would be spread equally.</P>
        <P>I return to the principle of equality.  It is some years since I used my Private Members&rsquo; time to take on what the Government was doing in seeking to undermine the agencies that spoke out for the vulnerable and marginalised going into this economic blizzard, which was bound to create levels of poverty never seen before, by abolishing Combat Poverty Agency, undermining the Equality Authority and attacking the Irish Human Rights Commission.  The Government did this and it was sly, underhand and indefensible but so was the behaviour of the media.  I do not expect them automatically to cover every word I say &mdash; I am not that self-important &mdash; nor do I think they will bother themselves with the debate at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, but I took the opportunity to issue written statements and the full text of what I said to every media outlet and not one took it up.  Having given advance notice of the serious matter of what the Government was clearly doing, I advanced my case by argument and systematic analysis with facts and figures inside the named groups and Departments and I was astonished it was never covered.  I regard it as a moral dereliction because the people should have been warned that this was happening.</P>
        <P>The guarantee was so obviously wrong and it does not give me any huge satisfaction to know I voted against it.  My conscience is clear but that will not help anyone.  Let us look at the groups that are being victimised: carers, the blind and the disabled.  This is the most astonishing dereliction of duty.</P>
        <P>I will make a few brief comments as I did not realise the time was going quite so quickly.  The car scrappage scheme is a load of complete rubbish.  Who does it help?  It helps the Germans, whose banks we are paying.  We have been turned into a money-laundering machine for the ECB, the German, Swiss, Italian, French and British banks.  We are now helping their car industry as well because the profits are for the manufacture of cars, not for their resale and distribution.  What we should have said to those groups is that if they want us to be a money-laundering machine, we would oblige them for a small fee.  Otherwise, we will do a Samson and pull the whole thing down around their ears and see how they would like being in it, the same as they have put us into it, because they did, with their easy money and stress tests on the banks that were all over the place.  I have very serious concerns about that.</P><Col N="334"/>
        <P>The Minister said that public debate on our currency has focused almost exclusively on our banks.  He also said that much of what was said is plain wrong.  Much of it is right, but it is just very uncomfortable.  A lot of what was said is very weak.  The Minister said he does not know whether any alternative Government would have done better.  That is the weakest and most pathetic thing I have heard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Anyone who wants to know the amount of damage that has been wreaked only had to look at &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; with Pat Kenny last Monday.  A young woman and her mother were in the audience.  The young woman had supplied a question by e-mail.  She was directed by Pat Kenny to direct the questions and material contained in the e-mail to a Minister.  She had difficulty remembering it.  She was abashed.  When the programme returned later to her mother, the woman said her daughter had suffered.  One only had to look at the faces of those two women to realise they were traumatised.  That is a horrible legacy.  I wish I had the opportunity to vote against the budget because vote against it I most certainly would.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reassured by my good friend Senator Norris&rsquo;s frankness about his inability to have his worthwhile statements picked up by any aspect of the media.  I had always been of the opinion that he had a direct line, if not to God then to the gods of the media in this country, so I am somewhat reassured that he, like the rest of us, must fight his corner in terms of getting news space.  His point is well made.  The chances are that, unfortunately, it was as much because the statement was emanating from this House as it was about the merit of the statement itself.</P>
        <P>It is rather interesting that the overall media reaction to the budget yesterday has been uniformly hostile.  The people have been divided into two camps in the sense that the perception is that the poor have been attacked and the rich have got away.  I am disappointed by that.  In a free and democratic society a free media is entitled to take whatever position it wishes.  Like many of my colleagues on this side of the House I attended numerous pre-budget briefings by the Ministers with large spending Departments: the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Health and Children and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills.  This will probably be lost on the wind anyway but I should put it on the record that throughout all of those briefings I came to the conclusion that the Ministers who are dealing with these large sums of money that are like Monopoly money had an underlying ethic to try to ensure, even in these most difficult of times, that they would protect the vulnerable and those who need help most.  Whatever criticisms are being levelled at the budget in its totality, I would be failing in my duty as a Government Senator and as someone who attended the briefings and saw at first hand the manner in which the Ministers and their advisers were wrestling with the complexities of the various issues that were being put forward by Deputies and Senators in advance of the budget.  They have been successful in some respects in trying to protect the most vulnerable in society.</P>
        <P>The other aspect of the debate has been about the bank guarantee and the celebrity economists.  I never realised there were so many economists until the past two years.  Practically every programme now wants to have its own panel trying to outdo every other programme.  Newspapers are trying to do the same.  It is sometimes forgotten by members of the public that they too are being manipulated by a competitive media with its 24-7 rolling news.  Every aspect of a story is now teased out to get a particular dimension in order that one can put a headline in a newspaper so that when one walks into a newsagent with so many competing newspapers, the hope of the newspaper owners is that whichever one has the most attention-grabbing headline will be the one people buy.  The reply of those in the newspaper industry would be why not, as they are in a competitive business.  My response to that is to ask about their sense of <Col N="335"/>responsibility.  Is it only about ratings?  Obviously that is all it is about because rational argument in many cases is either ignored or twisted and screwed to come up with a particular conclusion.</P>
        <P>In the context of the bank guarantee, the example of Argentina is constantly put before the public.  I do not wish to read any more about references to Argentina without any context, background or rational analysis of what the Argentinean Government did.  Only one newspaper in the past week went into the detail of what happened in Argentina.  It pointed out that there had been a succession of finance ministers and that the country defaulted and was out of the bond markets for several years.  The only person from whom the country got money was President Chavez in Venezuela.  It was certainly not from the international investors.</P>
        <P>Boringly, the question must again be put of what options the Government was faced with in September 2008 that got us into the financial mess we are in.  The simple answer from some of the celebrity economists, and I include David McWilliams as one in particular who has consistently said that we should have defaulted, is what difference it would have made because people would have got on with life and said &ldquo;Hard luck&rdquo;.  Obviously he can come to those conclusions because he has no accountability.  He can say whatever he likes because he will not be called to account.  The public should be aware that there is always an agenda.  There is always a context whenever they hear and see people on radio and television spouting about economics from their particular agenda.  They are not independent, detached observers or commentators on the economic and political environment or on the decisions made by the Government.</P>
        <P>I welcome one budgetary initiative and express concern about another.  The concern is about the reduction of 12.5% in the allocation to county child care committees under the Department of Health and Children.  I am honoured to be chairman of the committee in County Leitrim.  Our current budget is &euro;285,000.  According to my administrator, that will be cut by approximately &euro;35,000.  That will affect front-line services, to use that loose term.  In the next few weeks, with my colleagues on the committee, which is a statutory body, we will have to try to rationalise this reduction.  I am not at all happy that despite all that is going on in the wider economy, the child care allocation has been reduced.  It is a retrograde step, especially as this is a service that has been built up in the past 13 years and the structures in place administratively and in the provision of child care services throughout the country will now come under severe threat.</P>
        <P>My positive comment is on the budget initiative announced yesterday by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Hanafin, namely, a reduction in the travel tax to &euro;3.  I am sorry it was not abolished.  Will this initiative work administratively?  Whenever one increases or decreases a tax, there must be critical mass to ensure the process of implementing the change does not cost more than maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  Will it cost more to administer the &euro;3 tax?</P>
        <P>The Dublin Airport Authority has decided to incentivise airlines to increase the volume of business.  I send the message to Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary &mdash; as I have made clear since entering the House, he is a man I have long admired &mdash; and, to a lesser extent, Aer Lingus that they now have a real opportunity in the light of this incentive to increase the number of tourists coming to Ireland.  I understand Mr. O&rsquo;Leary has not exactly embraced the budget initiative enthusiastically, but I hope he will realise on reflection that increasing traffic levels into the country will result in an increase in his profit margins.  I ask him to give serious consideration and a positive response to the initiative included in the budget with the best of intentions, that is, to increase tourist numbers.  Without sounding repetitive, tourism is the most important indigenous industry after agriculture.  Some 250,000 people are employed in the sector.  I have faith that Mr. O&rsquo;Leary who has done much to reduce the cost of accessing Ireland through <Col N="336"/>Ryanair, with Aer Lingus following his lead, will rise to the challenge.  I ask him to do it as much in the national interest as in the interests of his shareholders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;We are where we are&rdquo; is the message we have heard many times.  We are where we are because of the policies the Government has pursued for 13 years.  Last year the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told the people that we had turned the corner.  We had certainly turned the corner, but we ran into a wall.  Every turn taken since has highlighted the inability of the Government to be brave in dealing with the fiscal crisis.  The Government has been and probably still is in denial.</P>
        <P>The budget announced yesterday targeted the most vulnerable.  The payment made under the working age rate scheme has been slashed by &euro;8 per week, while payments made to carers, widows, widowers and people with disabilities have been reduced by 4%.  The old age pension has been left alone, yet carers, widows, widowers and blind people can be hit.  I cannot fathom what the Government is doing in cutting benefits for the most vulnerable in our community.  While that phrase is often used, they really are the ones who are most vulnerable.</P>
        <P>Business people, graduates and the unemployed needed the budget measures to lead the way and stimulate growth in the economy.  However, they have been badly let down.</P>
        <P>Low and middle income families have been targeted in the budget.  The universal social charge will be applied to those earning more than &euro;4,000 a year.  Was the need for fairness and social justice considered when a charge on poor people earning more than &euro;4,000 a year was added?  It is a disgrace.  People living in rural areas who need to send their children to school but do not have a means of transport will face an extra charge of &euro;50 under the primary and secondary school transport scheme.</P>
        <P>My party has real and workable proposals, some of which have been taken on board by the Government, to get people back to work.  We need a pro-jobs tax policy, significant reform of the public service and protection of the most vulnerable.  We realise that we cannot recover our independence in economic matters unless we deal with the deficit.  For this reason, we have rejected the soft options offered by the left which would involve borrowing even more and accepted the need to cut the deficit aggressively in 2011.  Delivering deficit reduction measures to a figure of &euro;6 billion will maximise Ireland&rsquo;s chances of restoring confidence and borrowing in the private markets at a lower interest rate than the rate of 5.8% available as part of the EU-IMF bailout.  Unlike some right-wing elements of the Government, however, we know we cannot deal with the deficit if we continue to ignore the jobs crisis and bail out reckless banks.</P>
        <P>Given the lack of substantive new ideas to promote job creation and growth, combined with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue with its failed banking policy, the Government&rsquo;s plan is not workable and should not be supported.  We needed a plan that was fair, but the budget is excessively harsh for low and middle income families.  The Government&rsquo;s policies have wreaked havoc in the economy and destroyed confidence.  The Government has put 450,000 people out of work and forced many young people to emigrate.  While canvassing in the Donegal South-West by-election, I encountered many young, bright people who wanted to join the workforce but will emigrate.  That is the legacy of the Government and its policies of recent years.  That our young people must leave the country and parents they love to try to find work in Australia, Canada or wherever they can eke out an existence is sad.  It is an indictment of Government policy to see young people leaving our shores in such large numbers.  We believed we had seen the end of this in the 1950s and 1980s.  To see it recurring after the so-called Celtic tiger years is dreadful for everyone, particularly parents.</P>
        <P>I will address the cuts outlined in the budget.  I remember the time when we did not enter into a pairing arrangement for the T&aacute;naiste when she travelled abroad to attract students to <Col N="337"/>study in Ireland.  It made newspaper headlines.  However, the element of the Department of Education and Skills budget that funds the general expenses of organisations and those involved in the promotion of Ireland as an international education centre will be cut by 56%.  We were told that the focus of the T&aacute;naiste was on bringing people into Ireland and promoting Ireland as an international education centre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;yet the budgetary allocation is being cut by 56%.  That is what we mean when we say someone is speaking out of both sides of his or her mouth.  The people will see the true picture behind the cuts.  Let us take the cuts in the RAPID programmes for the disadvantaged throughout the country, equivalent to 41%.  I could go on and on, but I shall bow to the Cathaoirleach in this regard.  I could say a great deal more, but this Government has done little or nothing to protect employment and foster any growth in the economy which is absolutely necessary to get our people back to work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate being given a little time to speak on the budget.  Everyone has said it was not easy to deliver and neither will any of the next few budgets be.  I was quite interested in Senator Cummins&rsquo;s criticisms of where the cuts are to come.  If Fine Gael is fortunate enough to serve in government after the general election it will have to make difficult choices too, and it will be targeting vulnerable groups.  It is fine for the Senator to be on his high horse today, but he knows his party will have to address these difficult challenges in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to accept that one particular group may be singled out for special treatment, but as the Minister for Finance said in his speech yesterday, the road to recovery is all about getting the fundamentals of the economy right again and restoring competitiveness in order that people can provide jobs.  It is the best security against poverty that could be provided, and that is what we are doing, as the Minister announced yesterday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Different people to whom I spoke around the House yesterday all agreed that the fundamentals of this economy are good and beginning to get better.  This budget represents a restoration of our competitiveness.  I have heard talk about the costs involved in a factory that might be coming to Ireland being reduced by 40%, so of course people are far more interested in providing jobs here.  Witness the announcements we had this week.  That is where we should do the country a service now and start talking positively, especially when we hear international media opining that they cannot get over the gloom and doom in Ireland.  The fundamentals are good, we have made a start and the task of achieving competitiveness is most important.</P>
        <P>The Minister has done something very clever with the travel tax.  He has put it up to those who have been whining about this being one of the reasons for the collapse of the tourism industry.  I find it amusing that when one finishes booking a flight with any of the operators, one gets a &euro;10 handling fee.  Why do they not believe this is not bothering people, whether they are coming or going?  The travel tax cut is really putting it up to them and it has been done in a clever way.  I welcome this and endorse the difficult challenge the Government had in framing this budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators for contributing to what has been an interesting and constructive debate.  I can only take up a few points in the time available.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey asked about the present position of what is called the CCTB, the harmonisation of the corporation tax base as opposed to the base in Europe.  The European Commission has indicated it will bring forward a proposal for a directive next year on this issue.  This matter <Col N="338"/>has been ongoing for a number of years, in fact during the lifetime of the present Commission.  It does not appear to have made a great deal of progress and neither do the background noises from different member states suggest a consensus on it is likely to be reached.  In any event, the answer is that the proposal is in gestation and has not been progressed for discussion.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey issued what I took to be a warning about the Croke Park agreement and the need to achieve efficiencies and otherwise.  In the words he used, the only option would be forced redundancy or a further drop in income and pay, and this, I believe, reflects a significant strand of opinion in the Fine Gael Party.  The Government&rsquo;s position is to the effect that the Croke Park agreement has to deliver.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry spoke about the higher registration fee per family of &euro;500, which I believe to be a very reasonable compromise in all the circumstances.  There are sharply differing views on that subject but the decision arrived at, I believe, will deter very few from participating in third level education.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Shane Ross was right, of course, to refer to the wider background to the budget, but he is very wrong to talk about default.  Neither is he prepared, no more than he was last week, to think through any of the consequences of that.  The reality is that if we default we will not be able to borrow.  If one looks at the Argentinian experience, the only place they have been able to borrow from is Hugo Chavez&rsquo;s Venezuela.  That is a perfectly disastrous and defeatist position, and it reflects, of course, the views of the newspaper he is involved with.  I am simply flabbergasted by the irresponsibility of that type of contribution which goes on to talk about leaving the eurozone.  The reality is we are in a tightly-knit group, which is the eurozone.  We do not have the freedom to act unilaterally in ways that will cause a great deal of damage to others.  It is easy to come in here and to write in newspapers about what is, in my opinion, an utterly irresponsible option which would have the deepest and most detrimental impact on the welfare of this country.</P>
        <P>One can argue that morally, this, that and the other should not be so, but the reality is we have to agree with our partners in the EU.  We have chosen to be part of the EU and the eurozone and we do not have the freedom to act unilaterally.  There are problems, as referred to by Chancellor Merkel, with dealing with future financial crises based on the outcome of the current one, but these will have to be addressed multilaterally.  We do not have the freedom, apart from accepting disastrous consequences for Ireland, of acting unilaterally.</P>
        <P>Senator Dan Boyle was correct to talk about the purchasing power of social welfare recipients being maintained and to point out that education spending was rising.  Despite the cuts on the capital side, the education spend is still substantial.  I am not tempted to say anything much in response to Senator Callely, except that in my opinion, <i>la commedia &egrave; finita</i>.</P>
      
      
        <P Just="Left">I would like to read the letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> to which I referred earlier, which should put matters into perspective.  The letter, from Gerard Montague, Zaumberg, Immenstadt, Germany, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Madam,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Why should European taxpayers be expected to subsidise a standard of living higher than their own?  There is a surprising willingness to help here in Germany but little sympathy for an Irish backlash against allegedly harsh bailout conditions.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Average gross income here is currently &euro;32,000 per annum, which translates into considerably less take-home pay than is common in the Republic . . . University teachers here can only dream of what their Irish counterparts of equivalent qualification take home and the same goes for ordinary teachers.  A hospital <i>Oberarzt</i>  [a senior doctor] effectively works <Col N="339"/>around 50 hours a week and takes home less than half as much as an Irish hospital consultant, his equivalent in qualifications and experience.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The fact is we did get out of line.  We now have to come back into line, which we appreciate is going to be difficult.</P>
        <P>Mr. Montague concludes:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">In short, the Irish are heading back towards European normality in the next five years, not austerity.  Sadly, there are individuals on low income, or unemployed, who will be hardly hit . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">We have to correct an over-shoot and excess, which is going to be difficult.  The parties who may form the next Government are soft peddling the difficult choices that will have to be made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment places the Acts listed in this section in chronological order and also clarifies that free election post is provided to candidates pursuant to section 25 rather than section 28 of Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act 1937.  I bow to the experience of Members on this and I am interested to hear their thoughts but the amendment provides for electoral communications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of current whisperings from the Cabinet table, do we need to deal with this amendment at this time?  Is it superfluous?  There is a strong view that Senators will not need to take advantage of free post anymore.  Should we go through with the amendment?</P>
        <P>This facility is provided via registered post and it was put in place in 1937.  Communications are required under the Act to be sent by registered post but there is no need for that.  Various options are available nowadays.  The Minister spoke at length about the importance of using new innovative ways but he is about to set in stone a system that has been in place for 70 years.  This is contrary to the vision articulated by him yesterday.  Under the current legislation, election literature must be sent by registered post.  This means that it must be signed for when it reaches its destination.  When a postman, therefore, arrives at apartment No. 46, No. 4 New Road, Anytown, and no one is there because everyone is at work, he or she will leave a note in the door saying the registered letter is at the delivery office awaiting collection.  That is the only way the postman can deal with the letter.  Consequently, people wonder whether they need to go to the trouble of collecting the post and voting and, therefore, the returns are low.  Will the Minister consider ensuring an option other than registered post is offered?</P>
        <P>Registered post also creates additional work and costs for everyone involved.  Is payment required or is there a cash transfer?  I understand money is involved at some point and costs in connection with this are assigned.  Registered post is much more expensive.  There are a number of in-between operations that are not quite registered post.  Could we approach this in a different way?</P>

With the Senator being an O&rsquo;Toole and me a Ryan, our boxes were beside each other alphabetically.  His daughters were tallying his box and my mother looked on as the wheelbarrows arrived and pitched the votes into his box while my mother took out her tweezers for the single ballot that fluttered on to the floor of the Eamon Ryan box.

        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>b</i>) by inserting the following after subsection (1):</P>
        <P LI="4" el="5">&ldquo;(2) The expenses incurred by reason of this Act by a relevant postal service provider (whether such expenses relate to the exercise by candidates at elections of the right of free postage conferred by section 25 of this Act or are otherwise so incurred in relation to a Seanad election) shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>Chapter 11 of the Bill amends provisions contained in various electoral Acts that relate to the recoupment of expenses incurred by An Post in the provision of free postage for election candidates and extends the provisions to all postal service providers.  The amendment corrects an omission by inserting a section clarifying that costs incurred in the provision of free election post for candidates under the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act are to be paid from the Central Fund.  It is a continuation of the issue of Seanad electoral communications and ensures all providers will be covered by the provisions.</P>

	<P>This section enables the Minister to establish, maintain and operate a national postcode system.  The amendment relates to the definition of &ldquo;postcode&rdquo; and makes it clear that the postcode relates to the address, not to the individual to whom the mail item is sent.  When an individual moves house, the postcode stays with the address.  From a data protection point of view, it is important to clarify that the postcode relates to an address, not an addressee.</P>

	<P>I do not have a problem with the amendment, but will the Minister give an indication of the timescale involved in the production of postcodes?  How close are we to having them?  Will they be based on co-ordinates or random numbering?  What system does the Minister favour?

We have been examining the detailed arrangements and, with everything we have seen, the introduction of a postcode system makes more sense.  There would be huge efficiencies and cost savings for postal service providers and huge benefits in public service administration and for other users.  My preference, as I have said publicly on a number of occasions, is to adopt the advice given by the group established to examine this issue which is to have an alphanumeric solution which would give memorability but which would also, critically, gives us the capability of having a single house identifier, whereby one would have a unique location code for a particular house, not just an area-based system.  The exact mechanism or way of doing this will be determined following a procurement process which will be launched within weeks.  It will follow the usual procedure for a pre-request for tenders process, an initial phase when we will seek broad statements of interest.  It will be followed by a more detailed final procurement process, leading to the introduction of the postcodes towards the end of next year or early in the following year.  The process is on track.  Huge benefits are starting to accrue and the more we look at it, the more it makes sense to do it.  Critically, it will have a unique location code, as well as a general area detail to it.  I am keen to progress it as quickly as possible.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Schedule 4 be Schedule 4 to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to remind the Minister about the issue to which he said he would return on Report Stage, the cost of the universal service, how it might be related to people bidding for sections of it and in what way the various costs might be taken into consideration.  We talked about the various items that could be taken into consideration when determining the access charges and the Minister said he would report back to us on Report Stage after examining that aspect of the matter.  Section 28(9) deals with the items that should be taken into account and the Minister said he would take another look at it.  I am pushing my luck here, but it relates somewhat to what is included in Schedule 4.  I am not opposing the Schedule and have no problem with it, but I am reminding the Minister that he should have something to say to us on the issue on Report Stage tomorrow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is not pushing his luck.  My officials have been in contact with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and we will be able to table an amendment on Report Stage to amend the section to include in the definition in section 28(9) the assessment of postal network costs.  Following our debate yesterday, it will reflect our desire that it incorporate a review of all cost implications across the network.  I hope to present an amendment to that effect tomorrow.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Green Party on pulling the rug from under the Government on 22 November.  We thought for a short period we would have an end to a <Col N="345"/>Government that has outlived its purpose.  One of the many farces in this episode has been that having announced the Government would end in January, the Green Party representatives said they would support the budget and the finance Bill.  Now we do not know when the general election will take place because there is a game of cat and mouse going on between the Greens and Fianna F&aacute;il at a time when the fate of the nation hangs in the balance.  Fianna F&aacute;il is dangling the prospect of a climate change Bill and Oireachtas reform, among other things, in front of the noses of Green Party Members.  There is a possibility that electoral politics will keep this Government for two, three or four more months.  Let nobody be in any doubt that that is the game being played.</P>
        <P>The Green Party could have done the nation a great service by announcing that it was pulling the rug from under Fianna F&aacute;il there and then, but it did not do this.  It left the electoral timetable in limbo; in fact, it has left the nation in limbo.  What is the state of the nation?  What has happened to Ireland in the past few months is complete and utter humiliation, for which the responsibility rests with the Government and nobody else.  Whether we like it, we are now the beggars of Europe.  We are the people who went cap in hand to the IMF and the European Union, even to the Scandinavian countries and the United Kingdom, which are bailing us out.  It is, psychologically and historically, a major humiliation for us.  That is the state into which the Government has led us and in which it will leave us.  No one overseas will lend money to Ireland.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but to take it because nobody else would lend to us.  We are, I am afraid, despised by many other nations because of the trouble we and the economy have caused.  What happened?  When we went looking for money, we had one card to play, that we would sting the bondholders.  However, we were told by the European heads that they would not even tolerate such; it was taken off the table immediately and we had nothing at all then to bargain with.  That is the reality, Senator Cassidy.</P>

	<P>Therefore, we took what was given to us by our European partners and the International Monetary Fund in one of the most humiliating exercises in the history of the State.  That is where we stand.  The Government came home and told us we had no option and that default was not to be spoken about.  This morning the Minister for Finance said on radio that we were not to talk about default.  Why not?  Because it is embarrassing for the Government.  There has been a deliberate mix-up between what is in the national interest and what is in the interests of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>It was the Government which allowed the banks to behave in the way they did, was close to the developers and let the regulator off the hook.  Why did it do this?  Today we are being told time and again not to worry and everything is fine because we are only going back as far as 2006.  That is the spin that has been put on it.  Social welfare payments are returning to what they were in 2006.  Imagine that being the boast of a Government &mdash; that we are only going back four years.  That is what the Government has done.  It is taking us back four years, but it has taken the economy back a lot further.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Government why, although it initially managed some aspects of the banking crisis with a certain amount of integrity, it began in the middle of the crisis to practise the old habits Fianna F&aacute;il, apparently, cannot and never will discard.  Why did it make political appointments &mdash; appointments of individuals identified closely with the current regime &mdash; to the banks?</P>

	<P>It is difficult to take at times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has never lost its knack of appointing its friends to State boards.  When it nationalised Anglo Irish Bank, it appointed Mr. Aidan Eames, a fund-raiser, to the board.  The situation was far too serious for such individuals to be appointed to boards and for Fianna F&aacute;il to appoint ex-Ministers, able though they might have been.  It should have appointed individuals without a political pedigree, but it could not and still cannot do <Col N="348"/>this.  It appoints its friends all the time to sit on boards of vital national importance because it has utter contempt for these institutions.  It regards them as its own, to be used for the benefit of the party.</P>
        <P>I wrote in my book that I had spoken to a Cabinet Minister who told me that when he was sitting at the Cabinet table, Deputy Bertie Ahern who was Taoiseach at the time knew far more about what was happening on the boards of semi-State bodies than the Minister did, although semi-State bodies were the responsibility of his Department.  The individuals appointed to the boards were of the view that they were answerable to the Taoiseach of the day and kept in touch with him, not with the Minister, because they were designated, loyal party people.  That continues in this country.  What did the Government do when it discovered the enormous waste and learned about the abuse of power on the board of F&Aacute;S?  Instead of appointing the people who were there automatically, it reverted to the old system of political appointments.  That is what it did and still does.</P>
        <P>This is partly the reason the nation is in this position because cronyism breeds waste and enormous extravagance and leaves the nation in a state of arrogance, intolerance and profligacy.  That is what happened in CIE.  I have mentioned it here before because the Leader of the House would not allow a debate on CIE.  Not only was there the appointment of cronies, although that did take place, there was also a refusal by Government Members to allow them to come before an Oireachtas committee to give evidence.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party voted not to allow them to give evidence.  What is that?  It is cronyism.  It is protecting one&rsquo;s cronies and subverting democracy.  I do not believe any Government which behaves in that way deserves to remain in office.  That amounts to a single party State protecting its own and running the country not for the benefit of the nation but for itself.  What sort of legacy will Fianna F&aacute;il leave when it departs office this time?  It will leave a nation and an economy a good deal worse off than when it came in.  It will leave with unemployment high and a nation almost bankrupt.  Yet it is telling us today that exports are better and that the public service is in a good state.  It will leave the nation in a state of almost total and utter penury.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and look forward to the responses to the debate.  I come at this from a slightly different perspective to that of my colleague, Senator Ross.  It is important that he has tabled the motion and that we hold a discussion.  I hope the debate will not be on the basis of interruptions and that people deal with the issues.  I do not come at this on the basis of issues, but on the technicality of the motion and I hope to convince the House why I reached the position to second the motion.  We discussed various approaches, including the possibilities of the budget, but this is the motion we agreed Senator Ross would move.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I put it to the Government and the Minister that I have supported a good deal of Government decision making during the past two years.  Senator Ross and I have disagreed on some of the issues.  I supported the deposit guarantee scheme and NAMA and I do not believe there has been a loss of sovereignty with regard to the IMF business.  I have no wish to go into those issues but I wish to put it on the record.  There will be no easy response to the points I am making.</P>
        <P>I wish to put a question to the Leader and the Minister.  I have dealt with the Government, listened to its proposals and responded to them in a positive or critical way, depending on the case, as I have gone along.  Although I disagreed with many of the things the Government did, the question of confidence did not arise until one party in Government stood up out of the blue and declared it was walking away from the Government.  I seek an answer to this question: how can I have confidence in the Government members when half of them claim they cannot <Col N="349"/>live with the other half?  This is a straightforward practical issue and one of the problems I have with the Green Party.</P>
        <P>Another problem with the Green Party in government is its legislative list.  I was led to believe that it would bring forward reform and major legislation on local government in Government.  However, we have got nowhere with it.  I heard one colleague discuss the importance of urban councils and councillors this morning.  I agree completely with the views expressed.  That person&rsquo;s reasons may be somewhat different from mine but I agree with the structure for local government endorsed.  I had looked forward to the legislation on the Dublin mayor which would deal with several other matters in which I took an interest as well.  More than anything else, I looked forward as did my colleague Senator Ross to the proposal on corporate donations which, we were assured, the Green Party would introduce before it left Government.  How can I have confidence if I have been given these sacred promises and commitments from which it is now walking away?  I am asked to have confidence in the Government which is, at the very least, half broken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A further issue with that half of the Government relates to the facts on Seanad reform.  I have simply given up on it.  Senator Ross and myself have listened to discussions time and again.  We attended a meeting chaired by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, some two and a half years ago.  We were given a guarantee that proposals would emerge from the meeting within a couple of weeks.  Then it became a couple of months and then it became Christmas.  That was one year ago and we are still waiting.  Will the Leader indicate the position on this matter?  Apparently the Government is taking a political line on the question of Seanad reform and is trying to match Fine Gael.  A significant constitutional issue relating to the Houses of Parliament is being made into a political issue.  The matter should be debated although I have no wish to go into it now.  However, if we do not see the colour of the Government&rsquo;s money on a promise it made at the beginning of its term of office which it is now considering ignoring, how can I have confidence?  These are straight questions and I call on the Minister and the other side to address them.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I was elected to this House some 24 or 25 years ago.  One of the people elected at that time was Deputy Dermot Ahern.  I have known him for that period.  He and I may disagree on many things but I know him to be honest, truthful, committed and not for turning.  I saw him hung out to dry two weeks ago.  I am unsure whether it was done deliberately and I am not interested in the question of untruths, lies or whatever.  The fact is that we were all misled by two Ministers, including Deputy Dermot Ahern, but I do not believe he would do so deliberately.  That is my judgment on that man.  I believe he is honest and straightforward.  Therefore, something was broken in Government and this created a situation where two Ministers faced the cameras and were effectively hung out to dry.  They made fools of themselves and could not do anything about it.  How can I have confidence if two significant Ministers in the main party in Government are treated like that?</P>
        <P>Another issue is the talk within Fianna F&aacute;il of changing the leader.  I wish to offer a judgment in this regard.  If there is someone in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party who can handle finances better than the Taoiseach I wish to know who it is.</P>

	<P>The Government side is all over the place but it calls on us to have confidence in it.  That is the issue.  One need not agree, disagree or &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; me.  That is not the issue.  This is about the uncertainty and lack of confidence that the Government side is infusing into the situation, but it calls on us to have confidence.  I trust it will begin to get the message about the difficulties this creates for those of us on this side of the House.</P>
        <P>I have listened to all the discussions on the minimum wage, including the argument about the gap between welfare and the minimum wage.  I have considered all the reasons but I have not heard any logical reason put forward for the reduction in the minimum wage.  IBEC did not call for it and the National Competitiveness Council did not envisage any gain.  It was not sought by any representative group.  I have not done the sums but it seems the Government has managed to narrow the gap between welfare and the minimum wage.  We have reduced the minimum wage more than welfare and therefore we have narrowed the gap.  I have listened to one and a half years of discussion about the gap and a situation whereby people are more content to stay on welfare and have no wish to take a job on the minimum wage but now we narrow the gap to worsen that situation.</P>
        <P>Those are six reasons but I could give more.  How can I be asked to have confidence in the Government?  I wish to put the issues straight down but I have no wish to make it easy on the other side.  I have only mentioned one issue-driven matter and I do not care if I do not get an answer on the issue-driven question but I seek an answer to the questions of why we have been fooled about the legislative list from the Green Party, why we have not been given Seanad reform despite promises from the Government and why the Government appears to be changing its mind now following a solemn commitment.  How can we trust a Government half of whose members are walking away?  How can we trust a party which speaks of not having confidence in its leader?  How can we have confidence in a Government if two of its main Ministers are hung out to dry and manage to mislead the whole country?  Then there is the issue of the minimum wage.  I call on the Minister to deal with the technical matters and to discuss them with me.  I look forward to hearing why the Government can justify opposing the motion.  The Government side might believe we should have confidence but it should explain why we should not have tabled the motion.  How can we have confidence in the light of the context in which I have placed the issues?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This amendment affirms confidence in the Government&rsquo;s economic strategy and the leadership of the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  As I have said on previous occasions, the Taoiseach is a man of substance and of real integrity.  In tough economic times, we need people in government with broad shoulders who will not be deflected by criticism.  We need them to have the bottle to do what is right by the country and who will not be rattled or thrown off course by fleeting opinion polls.</P>
        <P>This country is battling its way through a major economic crisis.  I do not buy into the idea peddled by some in the Opposition in recent days that this country is banjaxed or an economic corpse.  The past 13 years have seen a transformation in the facilities this country provides which is a credit to the Government.  Those who deny this are not being honest with themselves or the people they represent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have always had a strong belief in the capacities and abilities of the people.  By working together, we can overcome our present difficulties.  Since the middle of 2008, the Government has taken significant steps in response to the rapid deterioration in the public finances to stabilise the situation and return this country to a sustainable fiscal position. Adjustments amounting to close to &euro;15 billion have been implemented in the past two years.  Yesterday's budgetary adjustment of an additional &euro;6 billion is another crucial instalment in reaching the crucial 3% deficit target.  It puts us on the road to recovery and back to job creation.  With yesterday's budget, we are now two thirds of the way through the necessary adjustments.</P>
        
        <P>The Government understands people want assurance and hope.  I believe the four year recovery plan and budget provide this.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Government have shown leadership as a team and made the right decisions.  The four year plan provides a roadmap for the future, enabling people to plan for it.</P>
        <P>Others too have shown faith in Ireland&rsquo;s ability to overcome this crisis.  It is a pity the main Opposition parties are not among them.  They would do well to ponder the recent words of the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Olli Rehn:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Irish are smart, resilient and stubborn people.  They will get over this challenge and the EU is supporting them in that.  Ireland has hit a very deep economic recession resulting from the financial crisis, which hit Ireland because of its credit boom and real estate bubble.  But the economy will face up to serious challenges.  Ireland has a flexible and open economy, which is capable of rebounding relatively rapidly from this recession.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have no time for those who claim everything in this country is gone and all progress made wiped out.  In just over a decade, we have put in place a world class national road network, 4,000 more garda&iacute; and more than 9,000 special needs assistants.  The social welfare budget has been trebled while the prices of goods and services increased by less than a third.  There are many positives in the country today.  Up to 1.86 million people are in work with a young <Col N="352"/>educated workforce.  The live register has stabilised for the third month running while redundancies are down 23% on this time last year.</P>
         <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Ireland is number one in the world for jobs created by foreign direct investment.  Eight of the world&rsquo;s top ten technology firms are based in Ireland.  Our exports are bucking the trend with the balance of payments of the economy moving into surplus.  This important fact tells us that our economic relations with the rest of the world are firmly pointing towards our capacity to pay our way, to service our debts and to achieve economic and fiscal stability.</P>
        <P>Regarding the burning of the banks&rsquo; bondholders, I want to bring to the attention of the House a perceptive and intelligent article by Senator Harris in last weekend&rsquo;s <i>Sunday Independent:</i></P>
        <P LI="1">[Meantime,] I have no trust in those hurlers on the ditch, at home or abroad, who [blatantly] blithely speak of playing poker and burning the bondholders.  The chips in this game are the Irish people.  We cannot risk them being badly burned too.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Last week, Brian Cowen and Brian Lenihan acted like leaders.  [Eschewing] the empty bluster of Eamon Gilmore they settled for doing good rather than looking good.  [Our] Fine Gael [colleagues] showed a firm touch too.  Michael Noonan told Prime Time it would be &ldquo;imprudent&rdquo; to renege on senior debt except it was part of a general EU strategy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Like Senator Harris, I too have no time for those hurlers on the ditch who want to gamble Ireland&rsquo;s future at a time when the real economy has stabilised, unemployment is falling and exports are growing strongly.  It would be irresponsible to follow the course of action the Labour Party has set out on bondholders given its potential to cause havoc to the economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  Listening to the Leader, one would think we lived in the land of milk and honey where everything runs free.  The reality is Ireland has been completely abandoned by international investors since last April.  No matter what the Leader may think, the Government has lost the complete confidence of the people.  It does not matter whether it is the Kaiser or the King who gives us the money, Fianna F&aacute;il has handed over this nation&rsquo;s sovereignty to others.</P>
        <P>I visited the Department of Finance with Deputy Noonan and the Fine Gael finance team in the run-up to the IMF-EU intervention.  There are officials from the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund monitoring our progress.  The Leader would have read the same letters as I have and, therefore, knows regular update reports must be made to the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission.  That does not sound like the workings of a sovereign nation.  Fianna F&aacute;il has caused this problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2011 budget is the beginning of several years of misery for the people.  What will happen to the road network, local authority housing and business rates in County Wexford when its local authority budget is reduced by 30%?  The same applies to every local authority.  A young family on &euro;40,000 a year will find itself &euro;25 worse off when the full budget measures come into effect.  This budget will hit and hurt many families.</P>
        <P>The next large issue to face this country will be mortgage repayment defaults if interest rates go up.  I do not know if the Leader has a mortgage, but I am paying a 3.5% interest rate on mine.  The Leader claims we are getting cheap money from the International Monetary Fund at 5.8% which will be used to bail out the banks.  There is a small problem of a 2.3% difference between what mortgage holders are paying now and what they could be paying later next year which will hammer their ability to repay.  The Government has stored up many problems for <Col N="353"/>every individual in the country for next year and the following year.  Individual Green Party Members of the Oireachtas need to be clear about what they said last month.  Are they expressing no confidence in the Government?  Will they walk away from it next month?  Are they just playing games with the people?  Senator Boyle might find it unusual that someone could be more despised than Fianna F&aacute;il members of the Government, but its Green Party members are playing games with the people by saying they might review the position.</P>

It should clear the timelines and let us get on with it because there is a need to turn the country around and provide strong leadership in the next four years.  The Senator was his party&rsquo;s spokesperson on finance in the Lower House when I was my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on health.  He understands the financial implications of budget 2011.  He also understands it is nebulous when one examines all of the subheadings which indicate that millions of euro will be saved through administrative changes.  There is obviously a problem with which somebody will have to deal next year.  That process needs to be started quickly instead of being long-fingered for another three or four months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When my party entered government in 2007, it did so knowing what had happened to smaller parties which had entered coalition Governments.  The likelihood was that in the succeeding election it would see a reduction in the number of seats and votes won because that had been the experience of all smaller parties in government.  However, no one could have anticipated the depth of the change in our economic circumstances.  We are also fighting a cartoon image, that somehow we lacked a degree of certainty, that we were not up to the challenge of being in government and that we would run away at the first obstacle.  We had and still have a responsibility to ensure we will not walk away from whatever challenges face us in government.</P><Col N="354"/>
        <P>The decision of my party a few weeks ago was based on the fact that circumstances had irredeemably changed and that because of this, a degree of certainty was required.  There needed to be certainty concerning the budget, the negotiations with the European Union and the IMF, as well as the Finance Bill.  It is necessary to overcome these obstacles to ensure the future economic health of the country.  Once overcome, we said there would be certainty in terms of how the people would view the future governance of the country.  I do not think they will see it in the black and white terms presented by some today.  There will be a national debate which has been lacking for a long time.</P>
        <P>We entered government in 2007 with knowledge of policies that, as the Senator rightly said, I criticised in the Lower House.  I believed they would cause difficulties along the way, but they were voted on by the people.  In addition, they had been mimicked by all political parties in the 2007 general election campaign.  At the time the Labour Party was seeking tax decreases.  The reality is that one makes a decision on the basis of how the people made their decision.</P>
        <P>Everyone enters political life in the belief they may have an opportunity to serve in government, make changes and a difference.  My party has sought to do so in the most difficult of circumstances.  Despite this, we can point to concrete achievements in areas such as the renewable energy sector, for which the figure has doubled from 7% to 15%.  Thousands of jobs have been created in the sector, one of the engines of the economy.  Our policies also included a revamping of planning legislation.  Because of the way it had been framed, it led us to the economic situation in which we find ourselves.  We have also provided for changes to social legislation, including the Civil Partnership Act.  We are glad we placed these matters on the legislative agenda and were happy to see the changes implemented.</P>
        <P>We have placed a time limitation on our participation in government because the Finance Bill must be passed within a set time period.  However, in that period other legislation can and will be passed.  When the other House is debating the Finance Bill, we will have debating time in this House.  When the Seanad is debating the Finance Bill, the other House will have debating time.  There are possibly six to seven weeks available in which we want to see Bills passed dealing with climate change and corporate donations.</P>
        <P>As regards the economic crisis, I have already expressed my unhappiness about the policies that preceded the entry of the Green Party into government.  Regardless of what Government was elected in 2007, given the economic circumstances, we would have arrived at the same point because of the policies followed.  It is due to a combination of wrong decisions being made and the ignition of the wrong international circumstances.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross has referred to the situation in which we find ourselves internationally, but it is not unique.  Iceland, Latvia and Hungary find themselves in the same position.  Portugal and Spain are borrowing money at a rate of 7% on international money markets.  Our level of debt was far higher, yet we were able to get out of the difficulty ourselves because we had an independent currency.  The difference now is our membership of the single European currency, the trigger for these events.  Despite this, my party in government has sought to make difficult decisions to get us out of this difficulty as quickly as possible.  While acknowledging mistakes have been made, it has pointed to the road to recovery and tried to ensure it is done as fairly as possible.  This means examining how we spend every penny, as well as how we raise revenue, because there are huge imbalances.</P>
        <P>History cannot be written while one is in the midst of events, but I feel no shame and take some pride on behalf of my party in the fact that is has participated in government to make a difference.  We have tried to deal with the most difficult set of circumstances any Government has had to face in the history of the State.  Therefore, I will not be lectured by people who <Col N="355"/>avoided making such decisions and who have made worse mistakes in government.  This is our first experience of government and it certainly has been a baptism of fire.</P>
        <P>When we have a national debate in a few months time, whatever the result may be, my party will be able to state it did its best and tried to be honest with the people.  However, there will be considerable disappointments, particularly as the time available will be limited; in other circumstances a further 18 months would have been available.</P>
        <P>In addition, I regret the fact that we have failed on the question of Seanad reform, something we have not been able to resolve in our participation in government.  That is part of the national debate we need to have, but not in the populist way suggested by some in my party, as well as by those in Fianna F&aacute;il and the leadership of Fine Gael.  We need to have a conversation on the form and participation of government, the quality of public confidence in politics and the systems of government.  If this election gets to that level and goes beyond the economic arguments we must have for our immediate future, then we can say this was an exercise worth having and we can inspire some hope and confidence in the future of this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On behalf of the Labour Party I support this motion of no confidence in the Government.  Listening to Senator Boyle, I was struck by the tone of his delivery and I thought he was going to tell us about his sleepless nights, as his party leader has done.  The Green Party walked itself into the straitjacket of government, as it has been described.  There was an alternative in 2007 and the Green Party did not have to choose to prop up Fianna F&aacute;il in power for what turned out to be more than 13 and a half years.  Options were presented at the time.  In 2007, in the run-up to the election campaign, Opposition spokespersons from the Labour Party and Fine Gael, such as Deputies Joan Burton and Richard Bruton, pointed out the madness of building an economy on construction.  They pointed out the over-reliance on the construction sector and the fact that far too many jobs were dependent on construction and far too much Government spending was dependent on the impermanent income derived from stamp duty.  To suggest there was no alternative is to mislead.</P>
        <P>I support this motion but there is no need for it because it is clear the majority of the people have lost all confidence in this Government.  That is why it is clear that at the next election we will see a significant shift in the political landscape, with a distinct move away from the dominance of Fianna F&aacute;il in Irish politics.  Fianna F&aacute;il figures have swooped as low as 13% and it is clear from the pattern of movement in the opinion polls that all confidence has been lost.  Confidence has also been lost in the assurances we heard from the Minister for Finance and from the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, today.  The expression of the view that we have come out of the worst rings hollow.  That is why we will see a welcome change of government in the next election.</P>
        <P>Let us not forget that Fianna F&aacute;il has been in power for 13 and a half years without a break and, before that, for the vast majority of the past 20 years apart from the rainbow coalition.  Let us not forget that when the rainbow coalition left office in 1997, with a Labour Party Minister for Finance, there was a budget surplus and the beginnings of a real boom.  This should have been sustainable as a boom and instead it was directed into a bubble of property speculation brought about by Fianna F&aacute;il in power.  There is always a problem when one party becomes so closely associated with the State as Fianna F&aacute;il has done.  That brings about an arrogance, a staleness and a reluctance to bring in new policies.  That does not excuse the intervention of the IMF, the ECB and the EU.  It does explain, however, the sleepwalking of those in government and why they sleepwalked us into an abyss.  They allowed the code words of light touch and principles-based regulation to mean, in effect, no regulation and allowed the economy to slide to the appalling state we are now in.</P><Col N="356"/>
        <P Just="Left">During the speech on the budget, the Minister for Finance asked what other parties would have done differently.  Senator Boyle has taken up that theme.  The Labour Party would not have continued the extensive tax breaks for property development and speculation that directly led to the development of ghost estates throughout the country and the reckless lending spree that brought down our banks and, with them, the economy.  The Labour Party would have ensured less reliance on the shaky foundations of stamp duty as a source of State income.  We would have sought a more sustainable job creation strategy not based so firmly on the construction sector.  We know the boom was built on a bubble of property speculation.  We knew that in 2007 and warnings were given, yet Fianna F&aacute;il went ahead and bought the election, accusing opponents of talking down the economy.</P>

I am happy to deal with that but I did not heckle Senator Boyle although I was severely provoked.  It is a source of great national shame and humiliation that we brought in the IMF, the EU and the ECB.  As Morgan Kelly said, we are now dependent on the kindness of strangers and they are not very kind strangers.  The ECB and the EU have been far from kind to us.  Their interest lies in sustaining the European banking system and the eurozone, not sustaining our economy.  That is clear from the views they take in the memorandum of understanding and the projections provided.  They are now pulling our strings and dictating our economic policy.  No matter what fine words the Minister dresses it up in, that is the case.  We have lost our national sovereignty and to what end?  There is still no guarantee we will not ultimately default and international economists say we have kicked the can down the road with the four year plan and the budget.  The markets still have no confidence in us and our growth forecasts have been revised downwards by the European Commission.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Finance still seeks to talk up our prospects in his budget speech but people do not believe that any more.  People have lost all confidence in him and in his assurances.</P>
        <P>It is time we stepped out of the denial of the Government rhetoric and language and faced economic reality and the alternatives presented to us.  The Labour Party has presented options and an alternative way to stimulate recovery.  Rather than take &euro;6 billion out of the economy in this budget, which the Labour Party believes is unsustainable and unjustifiable, &euro;4.5 billion should be taken out now and money should be left aside to stimulate growth and promote recovery through the development of a strategic investment bank and what Deputy Joan Burton described as the three Rs, reflation, reform and redistribution.  The Labour Party would not have sought to target the least well-off or those on social welfare in the obscene way this Government has done.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the amendment moved by Senator Donie Cassidy and to express my full confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government.  I will deal with some of the points made by Senators before <Col N="358"/>making other points.  Senator Ross appears to be on a crusade about default on the bondholders.  That is a matter for him to explain because he has not explained very well how one would deal with the inevitable fall-out from it. That is something we might hear at some time in the future.  He is also very critical of the Government for having, as he said, allowed the banks to behave in a particular way.  I infer from that he intends that the Government should have intervened in the system to ensure the banks behaved in a different manner.  We could all pause to consider the inevitable consequences of political interference in that manner.  There is no doubt that the system in place was weaker than it needed to be but the suggestion that there should have been direct political interference would lead to a situation that would be even worse than we face.</P>
      
        
        <P Just="Left">Simultaneously, in a turn of logic that defies explanation, the Senator is critical of the Government for having put former politicians on the boards of banks, some of whom were Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers and leaders and Ministers of the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  The logic of that runs completely counter to his claim&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would say he was available himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on what might have been done on the other hand.  He also made a point about cronyism in terms of directors not giving evidence before D&aacute;il committees.  He, as well as everyone else in the House, is aware that there are a number of considerations on what it is appropriate for directors to do and whether to make themselves available.</P>
        <P>I will move on to the much more difficult points made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  They have the advantage of being presented in reasonable and reasoned argument and they are much more difficult to deal with.  Senator Boyle has dealt with the initial one about the involvement of the Green Party in government.  I am prepared to accept what was said by him on that and the legislative list.  I am sure Seanad reform will come in due course.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole made the point very strongly about the information given by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform on the EU-IMF deal.  When the Minister replied to the question, the Government had not given approval to enter into any negotiations on such a deal.  The information he gave at that time was entirely correct.</P>

	<P>If I had been asked I would have said exactly the same thing.  It had not been approved at any stage by Government and until it was approved it was not under way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a point about the Fianna F&aacute;il leadership.  I have absolute confidence in the Taoiseach as leader of the party and leader of the country.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The Senator's final point related to the minimum wage.  I was Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs when the previous three increases were made to the national minimum wage so I am very familiar with the process and with the arguments that were put forward at that time.  When the final increase was recommended by the Labour Court major concerns were raised even at that time to the effect that the proposed increase was excessive.  The case was made strongly to me by a number of interests.  I was so concerned that I commissioned a report from the Economic and Social Research Institute which to a considerable extent supported the recommendation of the Labour Court.  I went ahead and altered it by doing it in two stages over a longer period.  The reality at this point is that virtually all employers, especially those who employ people at the lower end of the wage <Col N="359"/>spectrum, are saying clearly that the level of the minimum wage as it stood was a disincentive to employment.  They were also concerned at the difficulty created by the connection between the minimum wage and levels in other employments.  For that reason it has been decided to reduce the minimum wage in an attempt to improve the level of employment.</P>
        <P>Senator Cassidy outlined a number of points which I might have dealt with.  I will deal with different ones for that reason.  Senator Twomey raised the issue of sovereignty, which was also raised by Senator Ross.  I have not heard anyone explain how no loss of sovereignty was involved in the decision to join the eurozone, which put an end to our own currency and the independence it brought.  Neither was there any loss of sovereignty whatsoever in receiving billions of euro in European grants or in engaging in exactly the same level of borrowing on the markets we are engaging in with European institutions and the IMF.</P>

	<P>Senator Boyle outlined the Green Party response to the challenges of Government.  I accept the points he has made in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik made a fair point about the over-dependence on construction employment.  Approximately 280,000 people were directly employed in construction at the end of 2007 and in early 2008.  It should have been obvious that a continuation of employment in that sector would be difficult to sustain for a long period.  However, any attempt to address that would have had, among its first consequences, a significant drop in that employment.  It is a very difficult decision for a Government to take to decide to drive 100,000, 50,000 or whatever number of people out of employment at that time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>

	<P>The policies of the time were driven by the realities of the time.  Among the realities was two major Opposition parties arguing for a continuation of policies to keep up that level of employment, including the Labour Party.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

	<P>At the time the policies of the Government on all of those issues were described as Scrooge-like by the two major Opposition parties.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it was in terms of dealing with the issues of the moment.  The final point made by Senator Bacik which appears to suggest that the alternatives currently are to choose between an adjustment of &euro;6 billion or an adjustment of &euro;4.5 billion, conveniently overlooks the fact that there are two options available to the State at this time.  There is the &euro;6 billion alternative which enables us to access the European and IMF funding and the &euro;18 billion alternative which is the only other alternative currently available, of living within the means of the moment.  That means living on the income available from taxation at this time, which is approximately &euro;32 billion, implying an immediate reduction of &euro;18 billion.  Those are the options that are currently available.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>An issue arises in terms of competitiveness.  There is an enormous challenge for this country in terms of job creation.  Although we always hear about the 430,000 on the live register, 280,000 in receipt of payments are unemployed full-time.  Many more are employed part-time or fall into several other categories.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to address the large number who are unemployed full-time.  We also need to remember that a great many of them were in employment and will be again if they have an opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>They want to be in employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the challenges is presented by competitiveness.  Since 2009 we have seen a 7% improvement in our unit labour cost relative to the remainder in the eurozone.  This is one of the reasons the IDA and Enterprise Ireland have been more successful in attracting jobs; our export performance figure has increased by 7% this year, while productivity in the export sector has increased by 12% in a short period.  In listening to some Senators&rsquo; contributions one would be forgiven for assuming there was nothing positive to be said about Ireland or its economy.  Ireland is ranked first under the heading of corporate taxes, fourth in respect of the availability of skilled labour, fourth in being open to new ideas, sixth in terms of labour productivity, seventh in the availability of financial skills and seventh in respect of the flexibility and adaptability of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>And a partridge in a pear tree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>For this reason, more companies, foreign direct investors and others are being attracted by the IDA than might have been the case otherwise.  It is important, therefore, that we highlight the positives.  Our competitors abroad, undoubtedly, want to highlight the negatives and have done so at all times.  They did this during the good times; development agencies in other countries highlighted the high cost of employment in Ireland and a level of regulation that they considered made business and employment unsustainable.  We have gone a long way in addressing these difficulties and are now No. 1 in attracting foreign direct investment and jobs.  The four year plan targets a modest net increase of 90,000 jobs.  The agencies and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation have set a target of 150,000 direct jobs and approximately half that number of ancillary and follow-on jobs by 2016.  The 90,000 figure is at the bottom end of the scale.</P>
        <P>I will refer briefly to another issue that has been dealt with by the Government, one that no Government of any hue or mixture would ever want to deal with, namely, the difficulties in the banking sector.  It matters little whether the difficulties were caused exclusively by the banks&rsquo; management and boards of directors or in part by light touch regulation.  When the problem reached a point at which it could not be dealt with in the banking sector, the Government was first to make a call.  If one wants to know more about this issue from an independent and qualified jury, one need only read the reports of Messrs Regling and Watson and Professor Honohan.  They are long technical reports, but they bear reading.  It is bad enough that few of their conclusions have been disseminated in the media, but relatively few elements have been <Col N="363"/>disseminated in debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a great failure on the part of the Government, in that we did not disseminate the elements as effectively as we could have, but it is also a considerable failure on the part of the Opposition which aspires to being in government and will, undoubtedly, need to be guided by the principles clearly set out in the two reports which bear reading, consideration and debate.</P>
        <P>The reports do a number of things.  They confirm the need for an extensive guarantee and what none of us wanted to be the case, namely, that Anglo Irish Bank was of systemic importance at the time of the guarantee.  They confirm that a bank failure would have been disastrous for the economy and that the timing of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s nationalisation did not result in higher costs.  They confirm that the substantial steps taken to address the main issues of regulation were correct.  People are critical of the two Government parties.  However, the Green Party has been part of a Government which has introduced a raft of changes, some of which I have dealt with in the Seanad, concerning the Central Bank and regulation, including the appointment of people like Professor Honohan and others.  These are important moves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The conclusion that everything should have been left as it was for any new banking regime does not stand up to much scrutiny.  Senator Bacik knows this as well as I do.</P>
        <P>The reports highlight a number of mistakes.  We have faced up to this fact, particularly in a number of speeches made by the Taoiseach and various Ministers in the D&aacute;il.  There were mistakes made in the system of taxation and in our reliance on a regulatory system that was exactly the same as that in place across western Europe and the United States of America.  The practice of light touch regulation was international, not just national, and it did quite a bit of damage.  Our banks depended to an extraordinary extent &mdash; far too much &mdash; on wholesale funding.  That money was available at such low interest rates was a significant driver of the construction boom and other investment initiatives that had not been well thought out or solid in the long term.</P>
        <P>With the benefit of hindsight, the management of individual banks was of an extraordinarily poor standard.  Whether it was of the level that required intervention by the justice authorities is a question that remains to be resolved.  At best, it was negligent and fundamental errors were made in individual banks.  Regulatory controls were found to have been inadequate and have been replaced.  The raft of new personnel brought in have considerable international credibility, but it is important to bear in mind that they also have a high level of credibility with the people.</P>
        <P>One of the challenges for the political classes, in particular parliamentarians, is to establish credibility with the people, a fundamental tenet of democracy.  While there are disagreements between various parties over style, the Opposition parties are making a serious mistake that they will rue if they are ever in government, namely, in thinking the Government does not have a mandate.  The mandate of the Government is set out clearly in the Constitution and some legislative provisions.  The Constitution sets out the way in which Members of the Parlia<Col N="364"/>ment are elected, their role in choosing a Taoiseach, the role of the Taoiseach in choosing a Government and the Government&rsquo;s term.  Any action taken by a legitimately elected Parliament in choosing a Taoiseach who picks a Government is legitimised by the Constitution and remains legitimate for the entire term of that Government.</P>
        <P>In the not too distant future other parties might be in government and within a short period outside interests will accuse them of having reneged on the promises they made when in opposition.  As it occurs every time, it is likely to happen next time.  I have a particular concern that the erosion of the primacy of Parliament and the constitutional role of the Government which has been continuing apace and fuelled by the unhelpful statements of politicians, although not to the same extent as comments in the media, is a dangerous road to take.  The Seanad is one of the Houses of Parliament to which the Government is responsible.  Individual Members have a particular responsibility that needs to be differentiated from what commentators might choose to say in their contributions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has been a failure in the recent past &mdash; it was not the case when I first entered the D&aacute;il 18 years ago &mdash; that we are now prepared to run with the fashion of the moment and, in so doing, denigrate the role of Parliament and the constitutional role of the Government.  Sometimes we lazily dispense with the responsibility of Parliament to hold the Government to account.  We lay it aside and replace it with soundbite politics.  The temptation to do this is considerable, as we all know what we need to say to receive coverage in the national and local media.  That should not have primacy over our responsibility as parliamentarians to come forward and put as balanced a view as possible despite disagreeing fundamentally and philosophically with Members from other political parties.  All of us have a level of responsibility as parliamentarians, which in my view is a sacred charge not always well discharged by myself, and sometimes very poorly discharged by some people.  This is something we need to reflect on and consider where we stand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also have a responsibility to give people a relatively balanced view, while admitting that of course things might have been done better and perhaps even conceding that had the Opposition been in government it might have done better.  However, people should at least be given an overview which shows that ultimately the challenges we currently face in terms of the repayment of the debt at the worst level, in 2014, will be at about two thirds the level taxation was at in 1985, or perhaps even less, and to show the country has the capacity to deal with this.  It will need to be shown, as the main Opposition party says, that if a &euro;6 billion adjustment is addressed for the 2011 budget, that this helps rather than hinders in getting to the &euro;15 billion that all the parties in this House agree with, and reaching the 3% target at that time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The value of this is that it shows the real pain that the vast majority will experience in the next three years will have the result of returning the country to a stable economic situation while simultaneously delivering a level of growth in jobs, some of them in entirely new areas of the green economy, some in traditional areas and some, very significantly, providing opportunities for people who two years ago were earning large sums in the construction industry.  Such people, in the event, have shown a capacity for work, and an ability to retrain and be among the best workforces in the world.  We should not have to remind ourselves that this is the case, and we have the capacity to perform at least as well as anybody else.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to support the amendment and to outline some of the steps the Government has taken to try to address, in as honest a manner as possible, the points made by the various Senators.  There is a responsibility in these Houses of representation on behalf of the people, and it is one we should hold among the highest of considerations in a debate such as this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire, Deputy Tony Killeen.  I am conscious that the Minister has given an excellent address and I compliment him on it, but if he was to be sincere, he would certainly not vote confidence in the Government of which he is a Member.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am mindful of the fact that we have two famous slogans, &ldquo;A lot done and more to do&rdquo; and &ldquo;The next steps&rdquo;, which were part of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s auction politics in recent election campaigns.  The Minister spoke about soundbite politicians and his party&rsquo;s leader for many years was king in that regard.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s comments as regards parliamentary democracy and the primacy of Parliament, but former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern eroded parliamentary democracy and its primacy, as evidenced by the whole issue of social partnership whereby he bypassed these Chambers and did deals without coming into the Houses. He further eroded the primacy of Parliament by not coming in on Thursdays, and again by making major announcements outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is one of the reasons I do not have confidence in the Minister's party in government.  I am mindful of the words of Abraham Lincoln in this regard that it is possible to fool some of the people some of the time but not all the people all the time, and Fianna F&aacute;il's time has come.  This motion is not about personalities.  It must not be about the personality of the leader, the lack of personality or whatever.  It is about policy and it must be policy driven.  That is why I have no confidence in this Government because its policies have failed profusely and profoundly.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">To me this motion is about the economic collapse of the country.  It is partly about the open warfare within Fianna F&aacute;il, which Senator Ross and others have mentioned.  It is about the IMF and the EU bailing us out.  Its about the banks and the way they behaved, with the Government acquiescing.  The job of Government is to govern, the job of the regulator to regulate.  Forget the light touch regulation argument; the job of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance was to ask the regulator what was happening in the banks and why it was not being dealt with.  He did not do it and the Government turned a blind eye.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also about the fact that the Minister for Finance said, in effect, that the bank recapitalisation would be the cheapest deal in the history of the world.  I wonder whether the Members opposite believe that now.  To quote Crawford H. Greenwalt, president of the American corporation, DuPont, &ldquo;The grab for a quick killing is the mark of the worst type of leadership, for it places immediate profits above the long-term interests of the people, and can lead ultimately only to disaster&rdquo;.  That is a fitting testimony to the policies of Fianna F&aacute;il in government.</P>
        <P>I ask my absent Green Party colleagues in this Chamber whether they have confidence in the Government and in the Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers and Taoiseach.  They are somewhat akin to the fellow who went to ride a bike in that he fell off, and half got on again.  They are somewhat wobbly and have no stabilisers.  They are at the door, half in, half out.  Do they have confidence in the Government they signed up to three years ago?  We are in the season of Advent in the liturgical calendar of the church, and it is a time of renewal.  However, the only renewal this country needs is a change of Government, not for the sake of change, but to introduce better policies that will bring about more jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s eleventh hour apology today on radio.  I am glad he apologised for the mismanagement of his Government and those of the previous Administrations of which he was a Member that let down the country.  The Government has lost its authority.  I do not believe for a second, however, that the country is banjaxed.  I said today in the budget debate that although the country is broken, it can be fixed.  We must have hope, vision and a change of Government because it is a question of confidence.  Quite frankly, the people, na gn&aacute;th daoine, have no confidence in the Government or its policies.</P><Col N="366"/>
        <P>Do not believe that the Government in charge now can reinvent itself to bring about change.  Senator Ross is right in saying that part of what happened had to do with the whole issue of cronyism.  I know all parties have done it, but Fianna F&aacute;il could not wait in the stampede to fill State company boards.</P>

	<P>The example of this is where we are today.  I am referring to F&Aacute;S, CIE and the airports, which are a shambles, and it goes back to policy, not personality.  The polices of the Government were wrong.  It could not wait, the money kept flowing in and by God, it gave it out: benchmarking here, buildings there.  Bertie called from Drumcondra and a few boys and girls were brought in here and there.  They could not wait. </P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senator Feeney will appreciate, the problem I have is that it is about people.  Look at the people who have emigrated, at those who have lost their jobs.  I bet every Member has had e-mails, text messages and telephone calls from carers, those on invalidity pensions, the widowed and those who cannot see.  These are people who depend on the State to fund and look after them.  It is the primary job of Government to look after them but this Government has not done so.  It has also cut the minimum wage.</P>
        <P>It was announced with great fanfare yesterday that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s salary is to be cut by &euro;14,000 and that Ministers&rsquo; pay will also be reduced.  Big deal.  The Taoiseach and Ministers can afford to take massive pay cuts but people on the minimum wage cannot.  This must be about jobs and people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I welcome the eleventh hour conversion on the tourism tax, it should never have been introduced.  In my view, it should have been abolished in yesterday&rsquo;s budget.  There is no message of hope for people in negative equity or those with massive mortgages.  More failed policy.  I am surprised at the members of the former Progressive Democrats Party and members of the Green Party; they should know better.  Confidence is about a chosen course of action that is the best and most effective.  The Government has not pursued such a course.</P>

        <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Buttimer speak about the senior Labour Party politician who used the word &ldquo;banjaxed&rdquo; to describe our country.  I thought when it was said that I was hearing things.  This remark was made by someone who purports to call herself an Irish woman, a senior politician who believes she and the Labour Party have nothing to do but turn up on the day of the election and they will be elected to office.  I have news for Deputy Burton.  The Labour Party will have one hell of a fight from the current Government.  I can only speak for my party, but when the election is called Fianna F&aacute;il will be up for the fight.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wondered where was Deputy Burton&rsquo;s sense of pride and duty in sending out that type of message to the international press.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, has always put the country first.  He has never lost faith in our ability to come through this crisis.  The Taoiseach and the Government have never given up or given in to populism or anger, although they understand the anger.  Senator Buttimer is correct that this is all about people but anger is not a policy.  The Government got more right than it got wrong.  I am sick, sore and tired of hearing the Taoiseach being asked if he is going to apologise.  There is nothing being said about his trying to fix the country; it is all about when is he going to apologise, which is being driven by the media.  I have heard the Taoiseach apologise on more than one occasion.  I have heard him say that the Government got more right than it got wrong.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mention was made of the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael manifestos of 2007.  One would have to put a fine tooth comb through each to find a difference between them.  We all got it wrong in 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross&rsquo;s contribution was misleading.  I will not take up my time going over the reason it was misleading but he was disingenuous when he said the average interest rate over five years is 5.8%.  He knows as well as I that &euro;17 billion of that funding is our own money and that we are getting &euro;22 billion from the IMF.  While the remainder is coming from Europe and is expensive, it may not all be drawn down.  That is the reality.  Through the measures being taken by this Government in budget 2011 we will get our credit worthiness back and will not need to draw down all of the money.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was appalled by the depths to which Senator Ross stooped when he spoke about the Government appointing cronies to boards.  The people concerned include former Deputies Dick Spring, Alan Dukes and Ray MacSharry, Mr. Mike Soden, Mr. Michael Somers and others.  Senator Ross has a cheek to make fun of and accuse men who have served their time as politicians in these Houses of being Government cronies.  Shame on Senator Ross.  I am sure if future Governments call on him, because of his expertise in economics and finance, to become a member of a board he will not refuse to take up such a position because he might be viewed as a Government crony.  Shame on Senator Ross.  I am surprised.  I have always had the height of respect for Senator Ross but he stooped to an all time low today.  Are Government appointees to the Judiciary also cronies?  Is it cronyism when these people deliver judgments?  I fear the Senator&rsquo;s response in that regard.</P>

They should not be too smug thinking that they will walk into office with their eyes closed.  The election is planned for the new year and when it is called my party &mdash; I do not know about our partners in government &mdash; will be up for one hell of a fight.

In many ways, it is easy to understand when Opposition Members read about an attempted coup against him, but I totally and utterly disapprove and disagree.  It is painful to feel and know people are threatening his leadership at this time of national crisis.  Our members have to face up to the fact that if the message is that members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party have no faith in the leader, naturally people will wonder why we should have faith in the Government when party members do not <Col N="369"/>have faith in their leader.  The Taoiseach is, unequivocally, the best person to lead us forward in the next general election.

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I refer to two issues dear to my heart &mdash; business and the peace process.  Our competitiveness has improved dramatically in the past few months because of the cutbacks in the public sector, etc.  It is our responsibility, as politicians, to inspire hope in the people.  We have the youngest population in Europe with one in three aged under 25 years and the highest proportion of graduates in the 25-34 year age group in the European Union.  Exports have increased by 7% and Ireland&rsquo;s stock of inward investment is five times greater than the OECD average.  Surely a Fianna F&aacute;il Government which supports 1,000 multinational companies in Ireland, including IBM, Google, eBay, Facebook, Intel and Microsoft, has given the right signals internationally to encourage other blue chip multinationals to invest here.  I commend Albert Reynolds and Deputy Bertie Ahern on their tremendous achievement in bringing peace to the island.</P>
        <P>The three good reasons I have asked Senator Feeney to share time are I wish to express support for the Taoiseach in leading us into the general election, highlight the need to improve competitiveness and the stability engendered by the Government to send a message around the world that Ireland is a place in which to do business and point to the peace process in Northern Ireland.  I thank the Senator for allowing me two minutes in the sun.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The only comment on which I can agree with my colleague and friend, Senator Mary White, is that the Taoiseach has clearly demonstrated that Ireland is a place in which to do business.  If one wants to rape a country, get every available asset and screw the people to the wall, it is a case of &ldquo;Come on in, the shop is open,&rdquo; because that is what has happened under this Administration.</P>
        <P>I take no pleasure in saying I do not have any confidence in the Government.  I am an Independent and like to think I have friends in all parties.  I supported the Government parties when I thought it was right and criticised them when I thought they were wrong.  I  said I believed they were on a wrong track from the beginning of the economic crisis and that I also hoped I was wrong and that the Minister for Finance was right because what is important to me is the best thing for the country.  I have always tried to make it a principle in politics that I want to win an argument on my strengths, not on the weaknesses of others.  I have not counted the number of mistakes because that would be mean, petty and silly and I do not care whether one side or the other made fewer mistakes.  However, the mistakes have been absolutely catastrophic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This House is a microcosm of the situation because it is unbelievably badly run.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do.  Senator Mary White has said people are wondering if Fianna F&aacute;il Party members do not have confidence in the leader.   How can they?  It is not a question of confidence in the Government.  People do not have confidence in the Government because it has done exactly what I said would happen almost three years ago when it started to disable every organisation which had tried to speak out on behalf of the vulnerable and the marginalised.  I refer to a letter I received.  I am not unique in receiving this kind of letter.  It reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Senator,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I&rsquo;ve been up all night pacing the floor and running the figures from the budget yesterday.  Our family holds a medical card.  My husband is a PAYE worker, I am receiving a social welfare benefit and we have 1 child.</P><Col N="371"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Medical Card holders were exempt from paying the Health Levy &amp; Income Levy until the Budget yesterday.  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that Medical Card holders will NOT be exempt from paying the Universal Social Charge.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I have calculated that our income, come 1st January 2011, will be reduced by 9% or approximately &euro;68 per week.  We had been prepared to take a reduction of our income but this figure is devastating.  We must prioritise light, heat, food on the table and fuel, insurance &amp; tax for the car so my husband can get to his work which is not served by public transport.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">To put this into perspective this will make the difference between us being able to meet the mortgage repayments in full or falling into arrears. The amount is the equivalent for my grocery budget on a weekly basis.  Our child benefit right now is redirected towards light, heat &amp; food.  I have never been in the position where I can go out and spend it on my 2 year old.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That is what is happening in the country.  How can a woman like her be expected to have confidence in the Government when this is what it has done to her?  I do not say it was done deliberately and I am not counting the mistakes made, but we are dealing with the results.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Did anybody watch &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; programme a week ago and see the shot scanning the Front Bench in the D&aacute;il and the devastation on the face of every Minister?  Another visual image was the faces of the people in the audience on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; programme with Pat Kenny, many of them from Fianna F&aacute;il stock.  They were devastated.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Wonderful people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Do you, Senator Feeney, believe they have confidence in the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Yes, I do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris must address his remarks through the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is Senator Feeney&rsquo;s answer, but I find it impossible to believe it is true.  I echo President Clinton&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the economy, stupid&rdquo;, and do not mean it as a vulgar insult to Government Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not so stupid to think the Senator does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what President Clinton said, because that is where the living heart of public life is.  However, people are being put to the pin of their collar while they see fat-cat bankers and other individuals trading on our gullibility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to say something which my friends in Fianna F&aacute;il have also said.  Perhaps some of the Members present will pick up on it.  I regularly hear people on television saying we did this and that and that we over-indulged.  No, I did not and I know many others who did not.  We behaved prudently and decently.  However, we are being presented not with our own bills but with those that imprudent, foolish and criminal bankers ran up.  They did not run them up in Ireland&rsquo;s name but in the names of their banks.  One of the biggest mistakes we made was to give them a guarantee, without even ascertaining its extent.  I remember asking at the time how the Government could give a blank cheque and how much was involved.  The Government stated it was &euro;440 billion.  When I asked how much was the value of our gross national product, it did not know and had to go and make a telephone call.  Does that not indicate the incompet<Col N="372"/>ence of the Government?  It pains me to say I do not have confidence in it and I believe only 13% of the people do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a fine contribution in which he addressed the issues of confidence and whether and why we would vote confidence in the Government.  It was a measured contribution.  His strongest point was about the Taoiseach and how he had performed in the past ten days, in particular.  He said, in effect: &ldquo;Show me a person on any side of the D&aacute;il who would do a better job and has a better command of what is happening.&rdquo;  I would welcome seeing all of the party leaders debate the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe Deputy Bruton would.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Senator&rsquo;s opinion.  All of the party leaders should engage in a debate on the budget.  We would then see who really does and does not understand economics.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks, I am happy to vote confidence in the Government.  The person who knows about and is in complete command of what is happening is the Taoiseach.  He has a supreme command of the situation.  No more than anyone else, he is not happy that we are in the current situation, but, given that we are in it, we need somebody who fully understands and knows economics.  At a dangerous time such as this, I am glad he is in that position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also listened with interest to Senator Bacik&rsquo;s contribution and a point she has made on previous occasions.  It is contemptuous.  She has lamented the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il has been in government so often, as if the public is making a mistake in electing the party.  This flies in the face of democracy.  As everybody knows, we have a general election, the results are accumulated and a Government is formed.  It is up to the people to vote and it is not for Senator Bacik to decide that the people have got it wrong.  She laments the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il managed to win the last election.  That is what happens &mdash; one goes to the country, gives one&rsquo;s best performance, comes back with the numbers and forms a government.  What will happen in the next election is important.  I agree with Senator Feeney.  The Opposition should take care in thinking it has it won already because every seat will be contested.</P>
        <P>A measure of what is happening and how the Government is doing the right thing is the fact that popular support is evaporating.  Who likes to take sweets from children or money from people who want it, have earned it and are entitled to it?  I hope that when the election campaign starts, the public will realise that being in government in difficult times is not popular.  The opinion poll does not matter; what matters is the poll on polling day.  During the election campaign people will recognise that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government have acted honourably.  They have looked at and learned from the past and decided to take swift measures to remedy the situation.  As was said in the debate earlier today, the fundamentals of the economy are good.  If we did not have the banking problem, we would be more or less moving in the right direction.  However, it is utterly contemptuous of Senator Bacik to give out to the people, the electorate, for electing the Governments they have elected in the periods concerned.</P>

        <P>We heard about the look on the faces on the Front Bench in the D&aacute;il when it was discussing one of the most serious issues facing the country.  That type of comment typifies some of the debate in recent times.  When there was no recession, if the camera had picked out some of the faces in this House, I doubt that they would have made the cover of <i>Hello</i> magazine.  However, is that what democracy is about, making comments about facial expressions and body language?  I would like to think we take this issue far more seriously.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Ross.  He made an important contribution to financial probity in this country, for which he deserves credit.  Likewise, Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a major contribution to industrial peace in the country.  The proposer and seconder of the motion are a fine mix of capitalism and socialism.</P>
        <P>To return to the comment made on the Front Bench in the D&aacute;il, I wish to comment on the Taoiseach.  We have the right leader at the right time.  Anybody who has watched the Taoiseach will have seen the manner in which he has absorbed not the criticism about policy but the personal abuse directed at him from the first hours he took office, even before the recession.  One of the reasons such personal abuse was directed towards him was that he was not prepared to champion perception as opposed to reality.  He was not prepared to play the cosmetic game which the media appeared to require from him.  I say that in defence not just of the Taoiseach who is an astute and intelligent man and an honourable patriot but also on behalf of any other leader who might emerge from any other party in the future.  It is important for the body politic not to take succour from the personal abuse meted out to the leader of the country.</P>
        <P>A time will come when a motion will be tabled in this House to express confidence in the people, their spirit, nationalism and tenacity, to overcome these difficulties.  I feel the motion, possibly put down with the right intention, may be tinged just a little with political expediency.  I believe it is the product of a negative environment that is prevailing at the present time.</P>
        <P>When this debate is over and the vote has taken place, I hope the Leader will do all in his power to give us the opportunity to have a realistic, positive and patriotic debate on the future of this country.  The people outside who are angry, worried, are suffering and feel threatened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He thought it was unfortunate and wrong that a question should be raised over the constitutional mandate of the Government.  I make it clear to the Minister and others that at no time have I ever taken the view, notwithstanding that I have stood here alone with my colleagues and voted against the bank guarantee, took a view on NAMA and voted against it, took very conflicting standpoints on different Government decisions, and at no stage&mdash;&mdash;-</P>

	<P>He cannot even listen to people.  Even when he does listen, he does not understand the point.  The Minister understands the point, in contrast to Senator Cassidy.  The Minister is an intelligent individual, in contrast to the nonsense that the Leader comes out with.  The Minister bemoaned the risk that Parliament would be undermined, and I think he is right in that.  I was shaping up to agree with his point that this is a danger.  However, I have never questioned the constitutional mandate of the Government, and the Minister is absolutely right that a constitutional mandate for any Government subsists until the night the Taoiseach dissolves the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>It does not mean that one cannot say that the Minister for Finance and the Government have banjaxed the economy.  These criticisms can be made.  It does not mean for one minute that a person is questioning the constitutional mandate of the Government.  However, when we look at the erosion of the legitimacy of the Government, the Government really only has itself to blame.  First, it has failed to tell people the truth.  There is nothing that can undermine legitimacy and belief of the public in its Government more than not being told the truth, and it has not been told the truth.  Leaving aside the debacle involving the two Ministers, Deputy Dermot Ahern and Deputy Noel Dempsey, the people have not been told the truth again and again by the Minister for Finance.  We have an emperor&rsquo;s new clothes problem with the Minister for Finance.  Everybody wanted to believe him when he took office.  Everybody admired him and said he was a great communicator.  I even wanted to believe that things were as good as he suggested they were, but they were not.  Over and over again, he misrepresented the position, whether it was turning corners or anything else, and people lost faith and he cannot be believed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Feeney came in here and tried to say there was smugness on this side of the House.  The greatest exponents of smugness I have seen since I came in here are right over there in the chairs she and her colleagues are sitting in.  I listened to Senator Feeney say something before that was very telling and is reflected in her attitude again this evening.  In the course of one of the battles that was going on across the floor, she was told that she would be in opposition some time, to which she responded, &ldquo;a fate worse than death&rdquo;.  That is a very interesting reflection on the attitude of Fianna F&aacute;il to being in opposition.  It is on the record, because I checked it.</P>

They should try it out some time.  It is not that bad.  It is part of the way the system works.  Legislation is scrutinised and the Government is called to account.

	<P Just="Left">The most notable characteristic of this debate has been the guerrilla warfare from the Fianna F&aacute;il benches.  I presume they will be able to indulge themselves a lot more in this in the months to come, but from this side of the House.</P>
        <P>I have been disappointed with this debate.  I have been disappointed with the fact that I have not noticed a particularly sturdy defence being put up by the Fianna F&aacute;il benches for the governance of this country over the last three and a half years.  I noticed that Senator Cassidy disappointingly read his speech.  That is out of order in this House.  It is something we should not tolerate from the Leader of the House.  I notice that the Minister did not read his speech, and to be honest, it might have been better if he had done so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was very keen on giving us a lecture on banking.  I am grateful to the Taoiseach for the fact that the limit of the Minister&rsquo;s ambitions appear to be the Department of Defence, because the Minister does not know an awful lot about banking.  Senator Cassidy knows more about banking but that is because he read it from a script.  The Minister said something interesting.  He said that if we had interfered with what was happening in the banking sector, that would have been political interference.  God forbid that a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister should indulge in political interference in anything that was none of his business.  Perhaps the Minister does not know &mdash; he is only Minister for Defence, the most junior of Cabinet Ministers &mdash; that the Government appoints the board of the Central Bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an all time low.  The Senator is insulting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Does he not know that the Government appoints cronies to the board of the regulator?  Does he not know that?  Does he not know why or on what criteria they are appointed?  Does the Minister not know that one of the greatest abuses in this country is the cronyism to which he refused to respond, except to say that if the Government did that, it would be guilty of political interference?  The hallmark of this Government on all semi-State boards is political interference.  That is one of the problems and one of the reasons it should not be in office.</P>
        <P>The Minister cannot tell me Fianna F&aacute;il is not guilty of cronyism.  It has consistently over the years appointed those whose loyalty is to Fianna F&aacute;il and nothing else, whose primary loyalty is to a party and not to the nation.  The Minister cannot tell me it has appointed people who are members of Fine Gael.  Occasionally it throws in the odd token Fine Gael or Labour person.  The Green Party has learned the tricks from Fianna F&aacute;il and now its people are being appointed as a sop here, there and everywhere.  The Minister cannot talk to me about political interference, the Government does it all the time.</P>
        <P>When Fianna F&aacute;il did get its hands on the banks, and the Minister did not answer this question, it put its own people in there, people who had few qualifications to be on the boards of banks but had great loyalty to Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>That is what Fianna F&aacute;il is good at and that is why Fianna F&aacute;il should be out of office.  It has been in power for too long.  There are semi-State companies in this country, F&Aacute;S being one of them, which are political protectorates of Fianna F&aacute;il.  That is one of the reasons the party is unsuited to be in office.  CIE is a political protectorate of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Let us look at the boards of these bodies.  I can name them, and that is what they are.</P>

That is the explanation and Fianna F&aacute;il will continue to make these appointments.

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I am especially pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, is here given the topic I have raised relates to mental health.  This matter relates to the need to confirm that the mental health budget will be spared in the proposed cuts to the health budget and, in particular, that the specialist rehabilitation teams envisaged under A Vision for Change and constructed thereunder to look after the most vulnerable patients with severe mental illness will not be disbanded or disturbed in their work.</P>
      
        <P>I am aware of and welcome the various commitments made in the budget for mental health care and services.  It appears senior HSE mental health managers considered subsuming <Col N="381"/>rehabilitation and recovery teams into other general mental health teams.  This would eliminate the rehab service and redistribute its resources to these teams.  The teams in question were originally established under A Vision for Change to specialise in and care for those with severe and enduring mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.  They aim to provide multidisciplinary care for such patients in adherence to the recovery model which has been constructed on the belief people with such severe illnesses can, despite symptoms and disability, live meaningful and fulfilling lives in settings with support levels to match their needs.</P>
        <P>Patients are referred from their general teams when their resources are unable to cope with the severity of the patient&rsquo;s illness or deficits in functioning.  There are approximately 20 mental health rehab teams nationally, many of which are poorly resourced to perform their functions under A Vision for Change.  It has been reported some consultants have no administrative support, do their own typing and do not have the skills mix on their teams which even the referring teams have.  For example, occupational therapists have a key role to play in such teams, but not all have them.  Many of the rehab teams have never been allowed to function to the optimum.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>An outreach service is an essential component of rehab teams, but only two teams nationally have been resourced to construct such a service, whereby people with such severe illnesses can be looked after as far as possible in their own homes.  A guiding principle of rehab services is that people should be able to access care where they are.  The people concerned, because of their illness, are often the most unwell, most deprived and least able to argue or advocate for themselves.  It is incumbent on us, therefore, to prioritise their needs.  Their care has improved under rehab teams which can devote more time to them because they have smaller caseloads.  This is the care those who have endured years of illness, stigma and marginalisation deserve.  Any suggestion mental health rehab teams should be eliminated must be opposed if we are to consider ourselves a decent and civilised society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the Senator&rsquo;s interest in and commitment to this area.  I thank him for raising the matter as it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the commitments made in A Vision for Change and allowing me to dispel the notions that funding for mental health services has been parked.  The capital projects continue.  The new psychiatric units in Letterkenny, Clonmel and at St. Loman&rsquo;s, Mullingar are near completion.  For the first time since 1815, there are no further referrals to Grangegorman, with the opening of a new admissions facility for north-west Dublin mental health services in Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the vulnerability of mental health service users and fully accepts that the impact of a reduction in funding on front-line services must be minimised.  We will ensure the needs of service users remain the highest priority.  In that regard, I particularly welcome the special consideration given in the budget announced yesterday to the mental health and disability sectors, which will ensure a maximum reduction of just 1.8% in the 2011 allocation for the sectors.  The relatively lower reduction, compared to other health sectors, recognises these services are provided for vulnerable groups.  It is anticipated that the savings necessary will be achieved through efficiencies, economies, innovation and flexibility.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied mental health services will be maintained and that the question of cutting front-line services can be avoided.  The central challenge facing the health service is to continue to remove costs from the system, while also delivering broadly the same level of services next year.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises the financial and staffing constraints within which all budget holders within the HSE and its funded agencies will be required to operate next year.  Undoubt<Col N="382"/>edly, the levels of commitment, innovation and flexibility required by all concerned will be greater than ever before to protect services.  We must demonstrate an approach to managing within financial constraints that takes account of relative priorities.  In particular, this requires that services provided for the most vulnerable members of the community should be afforded the appropriate priority.  This consideration should inform decision making at all levels in the HSE.</P>
        <P>Despite the requirement to achieve savings of up to &euro;6 billion in the budget, an additional &euro;1 million was allocated to the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  This funding will enable the office to build on initiatives taken to date and bring added momentum and new impetus to its activities to address the increasing incidence of suicide.  The See Change initiative will address the stigma attached to mental health issues.  It will help various groups to reach out to individuals to help them understand the support structures available.  It also aims to help in reducing the high suicide rate.  In particular, the additional funding will target increasing the number and range of training and awareness programmes, the improvement and standardisation of the response to deliberate self-harm, the development of capacity within primary care to respond to suicidal behaviour, consider new models of response and the co-ordination of helpline supports.</P>
        <P>I must acknowledge the commitment of Deputy Neville and the Irish Association of Suicidology which I have met several times recently.  They have come back to me with new thinking and offered to be the regulator of the various groups which want to assist in suicide prevention to ensure we are all on the same message.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Despite the economic downturn, we are still making tangible progress in the implementation of A Vision for Change.  It is important to recognise that in many parts of the country services are pressing ahead with implementation of the policy, a fact of which we should not lose sight.</P>
        <P>While the emphasis is on community mental health teams, I will not brag that some of them are staffed to the maximum.  The real challenge is to ensure the moneys saved as a result of the closure of the old institutions are put back into community mental health teams.  Significant progress has been achieved, including shorter episodes of inpatient care, improved child and adolescent mental health services, improved forensic mental health services, fewer involuntary admissions and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.  Representatives of service user organisations sit on local committees to ensure they are involved in all initiatives taken under A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>Acute admissions to St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital, Grangegorman have ceased following the opening of a new admissions facility for north-west Dublin mental health services at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown.  I visited that hospital last week and was pleased to see a great sense of determination to deliver A Vision for Change, given that part of that process was to secure a new hospital setting away from Grangegorman.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Enabling works are under way on a 54-bed unit to replace the current facilities for long-stay patients at St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital.  It is also worth noting that plans for the transfer of acute inpatients from St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, Portrane, to a new purpose-built unit at Beaumont are now proceeding.</P>
        <P>New community nursing units in Ballinasloe and Mullingar have been developed and it is anticipated that two 20-bed units for adolescent inpatients in Cork and Galway will be fully operational by January.  Other construction works have commenced, including the development <Col N="383"/>of a new acute service in Letterkenny and also at Cherry Orchard in Dublin.  These services will be funded from the proceeds of the sale of psychiatric assets.</P>
        <P>On the specific point raised by Senator Mullen, there is a commitment to continue to support community services.  I acknowledge the strong contribution and commitment of service providers when they continue to work in 2011 to ensure the maximum delivery of services in an efficient and effective manner, with priority being given to those in greatest need.</P>

	<P>That has to be a given.  In talking about A Vision for Change we must be real and separate it from the funding part.  To do what the Senator suggests the HSE might have in mind would be a retrograde step.  It would certainly not be in keeping with A Vision for Change.  That must be the clear message as we start the new programme in 2011.  If there is any evidence of subsuming such teams, I would like to be made aware of it in order that we can make direct contact with areas in which the HSE may be implementing that programme.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State has some details of this case before him.  It concerns two South African doctors who are in practice together in South Africa.  They rotate through this country, alternating between South Africa and Ireland where they provide an out-of-hours service for Caredoc in County Wexford.  They have been providing a fantastic service with Caredoc in the county for the past five or six years.  While working in Ireland they also share a car which is registered in one doctor&rsquo;s name.  When one doctor was in South Africa, however, the other doctor &mdash; who is also insured to drive the car &mdash; incurred penalty points.  When the notice regarding penalty points was sent, it was addressed to the doctor who had gone back to South Africa.  As the Minister of State may be aware, the envelope that arrived to the house gave no indication to the other doctor that this was an urgent matter that required immediate attention.  When the doctor who was the registered owner of the car came back from South Africa six to eight weeks later, he had clearly gone beyond the period during which he could change the fixed penalty points to the person who had been driving the car.  In the intervening period, he incurred a significant fine for not paying the initial fixed charge. Is there some process whereby the actual driver of the car can take the penalty points and pay the initial fine rather than the onus being put on the doctor who had returned to South Africa and was completely unaware that such a fine was in his post back in Ireland?</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I apologise for the fact that the Minister cannot be here to answer the question, although I hope I can bring some clarity to it.</P>
        <P>Road traffic legislation is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enforces the legislation.  The Road Traffic Act 2002 introduced a system of fixed charges and penalty points for specific traffic offences.  The legislation has been amended on a number of occasions subsequently.  It provides a choice to any person accused of committing an offence to which the system applies and who has consequently received a fixed charge notice.  The person can either pay the fixed charge and incur a number of penalty points on his or her driving licence or he or she may decide to allow the matter to proceed to court.  If the person is convicted, the legislation provides that the court will impose a penalty which can be <Col N="384"/>higher than the fixed charge and the person will incur a higher number of penalty points than would have been the case if he or she had paid the fixed charge notice.  This system has a number of advantages, both for the recipient and the justice system.</P>
        <P>When a fixed charge offence is detected, the fixed charge notice, which is issued by the Garda, sets out the amount of the fixed charge that may be paid.  The recipient of the notice has a period of 28 days from the date of the notice to pay this amount.  If that period of 28 days has passed and the recipient has not paid the amount, he or she has a further 28 days in which he or she can pay the original amount plus 50%.  If, after that second period of 28 days has passed and the recipient has still not paid the amount, court proceedings are initiated by the issue of a summons.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides for the situation where the driver of a vehicle is not the registered owner of the vehicle.  Where a registered owner receives a fixed charge notice and was not the driver at the time the offence was committed, he or she is accorded a period of 28 days from the date of issue of the notice to nominate the person who was driving the vehicle at the time of the alleged offence.  A fixed charge notice is then issued to that driver.  The nominated driver then has the two periods of 28 days to pay the fixed charge if he or she so wishes.  The legislation regards non-payment of a fixed charge as an indication that the alleged offender has opted to go to court.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey has set out the facts of this particular case.  It would appear than in this case the registered owner became aware of the fixed charge notice only after the period of 28 days had expired, during which he could have nominated the person driving his car.  The owner&rsquo;s wish to have the facility of doing so, even after the period stipulated in the legislation had expired, is understandable.  However, the legislation does not allow for that to be done.  Legislation has to operate on the basis of certainty.  It would not be possible to have open-ended periods within which registered owners and drivers could avail of the options provided for.</P>
        <P>Owners of vehicles are responsible for their vehicles even when they are not themselves driving them.  On the assumption that the owner concerned has received a summons, he will have the opportunity of making his case in court.</P>
        <P>The fixed charge and penalty points system was introduced under a previous Government road safety strategy.  The current Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 continues to bring about a significant reduction in deaths and injuries on the roads and to bring road safety in line with best international standards.  Ireland&rsquo;s road safety record has improved dramatically in recent years and the number of deaths on our roads has reduced significantly.  The road safety strategy&rsquo;s target is to reduce the number of road deaths to 252 per annum by the end of 2012.  In 2009, there were 240 road deaths, the lowest annual total since records began in 1959.  We are on target to achieve a further reduction in 2010.  As of today, there have been 22 fewer fatalities this year compared with the same period in 2009.</P>
        <P>We cannot afford to be complacent.  In particular, excessive speed is one of the most significant causes of road deaths, and the enforcement of speed limits is prioritised by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The outsourced network of mobile safety cameras, which was launched last month, is an additional means of encouraging drivers to slow down.  The aim of these cameras is to help garda&iacute; change driver behaviour, reduce speed and as a result improve road safety.</P>
        <P>I am not sure if I have been in any way helpful to the Senator regarding the specific case he has raised.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this motion.  It refers to the Dublin underground interconnector, which is frequently referred to as the underground DART.  It could provide an underground facility that would link many of Dublin&rsquo;s existing train stations.  By so doing, it could free up capacity for additional services and trains to come into the city centre.  On its merits, the project makes a lot of sense because it seeks to join up existing infrastructure across Dublin and the Dublin region.  I have two reasons for raising this matter.  While it will deliver a much-needed benefit to the city of Dublin, all of the cost, in terms of the construction location and where the debris will be removed from, is located in a part of Dublin in the constituency in which I live.  I refer to East Wall and North Wall.  They will be very much affected by the construction of the project for many years while they will not share in any of the direct benefits the project will deliver.  In those affected areas there is great support for the project because of the benefit it will deliver to the city.  However, they have important concerns they seek to have recognised in the oral hearing organised by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>The second reason for raising this matter is to understand, in light of the publication of the four year plan, whether the Minister of State can clarify when construction is expected to take place on this project.  If the nearest construction date for the project is 2014, as some documentation leads me to believe, will consideration be given to deferring the oral hearing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la that has just started?  Millions of euro will be spent by the State and private interests in legal representation and the organisation of and participation in the oral hearing for a project that will not be commenced for a number of years and will not be operational for many years after that.  In light of the country&rsquo;s circumstances, is there not merit in organising the oral hearing nearer to the start date of the project?  This will ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money and money spent by affected interests will be spent on a project that is going ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I apologise that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, cannot be present.  I will respond to this matter on his behalf. </P>
	<P Just="Left">Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority on 1 December 2009, the implementation of infrastructure projects in the greater Dublin area, such as the DART underground project, now comes under the remit of the National Transport Authority rather than the Minister for Transport.  The legislative basis for this is section 11(1)(<i>e</i>) of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, which refers to the principal functions of the authority being &ldquo;to secure the provision of public transport infrastructure&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government published the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 on 24 November.  The four year plan sets out the capital allocations for the Department of Transport for the period 2011-14.  It is important to remember that no project has been cancelled and planning and design will continue so projects can commence as funding becomes available.  At the time of the publication of the four year plan the Minister for Transport advised it would not be possible to deliver the tunnel element of the DART underground project in the immediate period.  However, the Minister emphasised that some of the re-signalling and associated works, which have capacity benefits in and of themselves, will proceed over the next four years.  This will prepare the network for the delivery of the underground tunnel once financial resources permit.</P><Col N="386"/>
        <P Just="Left">In the meantime, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has commenced the oral hearing for DART underground.  Matters relating to oral hearings on infrastructure projects such as the DART underground come entirely under the remit of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is unlikely that the railway order will be made by the end of 2011.  The DART underground project is an extensive programme involving the construction of an underground tunnel, to be delivered by public private partnership, and the delivery of various other re-signalling and associated works to facilitate the integration of the northern and Kildare lines via the tunnel.</P>
        <P>When completed, the project will provide the missing link that will deliver a fully integrated rail network for the greater Dublin area, linking with all modes of public transport, including metro north.  As the Minister for Transport indicated yesterday, the capital provision for public transport investment in 2011 is &euro;394 million.  This will enable the completion of the Luas extension to Citywest and the continuation of advance works on metro north.  It also provides funding for planning and design work on other Transport 21 projects with a view to the earliest possible delivery as financial resources become available.  Funding is also being maintained for a number of important public transport programmes, including railway safety, accessibility, integrated ticketing, traffic management and bus priority.</P>
