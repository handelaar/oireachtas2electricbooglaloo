	<P>I have received notice from Senator Diarmuid Wilson that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to protect employment in Quinn Insurance and the Quinn Group.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to review the decision to abolish the primary school teacher supply panel and investigate ways to create a more cost effective or cost neutral supply panel.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children, based on the recent sexual assault treatment report, to provide a secure position within Longford-Westmeath General Hospital for the sexual assault treatment unit and for this location to have full bathroom facilities and a full complement of staff in order to ensure delivery of a quality safe service.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to bring forward proposals that will see an end to the application of vehicle registration tax in the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Wilson, O&rsquo;Toole and McFadden and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Doherty may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on women&rsquo;s participation in politics, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and adjourn not later than 6.15 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and on which Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, and No. 2, statements on banking, to be taken, notwithstanding anything <Col N="196"/>in Standing Orders and by agreement of the House, at the conclusion of No. 1 but not before 6 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and on which Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called on ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments.  This is to allow spokespersons and those who contributed the last day to comment on the up-to-date position in banking.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent days there has been a debate on the issue of pensions and, in particular, the entitlements of politicians to pensions and the conditions under which one should keep a pension if one is engaging in public service or continuing as a politician.  Today all Fine Gael ministerial pension holders have voluntarily agreed to give up their pensions.  Fine Gael will publish amending legislation and ask the Government to accept it to ensure this happens with immediate effect.  This is the correct approach.  Many other issues arise from the discussion of pensions in recent days.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>I propose to raise two issues related to the National Asset Management Agency.  We were informed when the NAMA legislation was being enacted that the new agency would deliver a social dividend.  I ask for information on developments in the National Asset Management Agency and whether this matter is being considered.  The issue of a social dividend will have be discussed, whether in connection with ghost housing estates we see around the country or land located in the middle of communities that has been transferred to NAMA.  Many issues arise in this regard.</P>
        <P>I also ask that the Minister come before the House to outline whether there have been developments in the scheme established to assist homeowners struggling with mortgage repayments.  As many as 300,000 people may be in this position.  The issue must be discussed in detail in the House in its own right.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about recent information that has emerged on the women&rsquo;s prison in Mountjoy Prison.  The details of the concerns raised by the resigning prison governor give rise to serious issues about developments in the prison.  The prison was a model of its kind.  The governor indicated there has been a severe deterioration and undue interference in the way the prison is run, which has been very damaging.  This is another issue on which the House should have a debate and I ask the Leader to arrange such a debate as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald raised an important issue concerning the women&rsquo;s prison.  We must not take a simple approach to this issue, in which there is considerable interest, as there is also a legislative responsibility in the matter.  We have created an imperative whereby people who do not pay their television or credit union bills are thrown into jail.  What kind of a modern society are we running?  While I would be pleased to have a debate on the prison service, we should examine legislation and ask the reason we have neglected to amend the legislation which allows and, in fact, demands that people are put in prison for minor indebtedness.</P>
        <P>The issue Senator Fitzgerald raises about people in negative equity is similar.  People who are experiencing negative equity may be forced to sell their homes in the next year or two and will need support.  I make a distinction between those who cannot repay their mortgages, an issue raised by Senators MacSharry, McFadden and others in recent months, and those who must, for some reason, sell their homes.  The latter group will find themselves paying off the difference between the sale price and the value of the mortgage for the rest of their lives.</P><Col N="197"/>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald also raised an issue related to pensions.  In recent days, the media has made a great sport of chasing people around asking whether they will give back their pensions etc.  While this serves as an excellent diversion and distraction, serious issues have arisen which need to be discussed.  I would welcome a debate on what principles should govern pension entitlements and how pensions should be paid out.  If changes are required, we should make them.  No one, however, is engaging in the type of detailed examination of the issue required.</P>
        <P>Deputy Leo Varadkar published legislation in recent days, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2010, in which he realistically proposes to reduce by 10% all costs in which the Government has an input.  These include the cost of electricity, gas, bus and train fares, airport charges, television licences, motorway tolls, college registration fees and State examination fees.  Every single State supplier of resources and services to the State has been required to reduce fees and costs by 8% to 10% in the past two years.  This Government has been remiss in not doing the same in those areas it controls and over which it has influence.  This is far more important than taking shillings off some politicians.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a very attractive map in today&rsquo;s newspapers which shows how the new Dublin Bus network will look if the changes proposed by the company are implemented.  I welcome the fact the company has addressed something as basic as bus routes across our capital city.  It is based on the old tram system and many numbers on the buses hark back to an earlier age.  Can we have a debate on public transport in our capital city?  To what extent will this map, with all its high design production values, be represented by the service that Dublin Bus produces once these changes are implemented?  If we go with these proposals, 90 buses will be taken out of the fleet in Dublin and 150 jobs will be lost.</P>
        <P>I am prepared to accept, for the sake of argument, that a reduction in costs can lead to an improved service.  This is always possible, but we should remind ourselves that Dublin Bus provides a very good service and has a very good record.  The subsidy to Dublin Bus is relatively modest by international standards.  We have a good service.  No matter what happens to the routes and apart from having an opportunity to view the map, people want to know whether the service will improve.  I ask the Leader to consider a debate on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I largely agree with Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on the subjects she raised, especially the resignation by the governor of the D&oacute;chas Centre.  I also agree with the point raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole about the imprisonment of people for certain types of offences.  I would like to think that we have already stopped imprisonment for the non-payment of a television fine in the Broadcasting Act 2009, while the Fines Bill 2009 will come before the Seanad and address some of those issues.  It is clear in 2010 that there are still too many petty and technical offences that require imprisonment.  A debate on the issue in the House would be useful.</P>
        <P>A progress report debate on the credit review group would also be useful.  The group was established in February and it has a brief to report in the quickest possible time.  There is an ongoing agreement between the financial institutions and the Irish Bankers&rsquo; Federation on repossessions, and this is helping the situation.</P>
        <P>We must talk about the need for legislation for public service pensions, including those of politicians.  The idea of a group collectively making a voluntary decision is a concept that is strange to me, but I do not care if it is the right decision.  We need to reflect on the level of public concern that exists about the idea of ongoing payments to members of the public service who receive pensions for previous employment at the same time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Alex White&rsquo;s call for a debate on public transport, but it should be wider.  While Dublin Bus has its issues to consider, the metropolitan Dublin area is also served <Col N="198"/>by the DART, Luas and commuter rail, but the other major urban centres &mdash; Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway &mdash; have bus-only services, so they should be included in such a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on pension entitlements.  I hope sitting Deputies and Senators in receipt of the ministerial pension relinquish it in the national interest.  As actions speak louder than words, it is about time we started to show leadership in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is welcome that Ireland&rsquo;s European Commissioner has relinquished her pension.  She is on quite a salary in her current position.  I have heard the call from the union leader, Mr. Jack O&rsquo;Connor, who was exerting pressure from the trade union perspective.  While I do not have a problem with this, union leaders should look at their own membership, including those who continue work after retirement, including teachers and nurses.  Retired Civil Service workers in receipt of pensions are taking up employment and preventing young graduates from doing so and gaining experience.  We should review all of these aspects and have a full debate on pension entitlements.</P>
        <P>One of the scourges of modern Irish society is heroin.  I ask the Leader to make provision for an early debate on the impact and consequences of heroin usage.  Many families face huge debts owing to those unfortunate enough to be addicted to heroin.  This is one of the biggest challenges facing young people in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the <i>Irish Independent </i>on publishing a fine supplement on the 1916 Rising today.  It is indicative of a growing interest in this period of our history.  In addition, we are preparing a comprehensive programme to mark the centenary of the Rising in six years&rsquo; time.  In that context, I refer again to the building at 16 Moore Street where the 1916 leaders made their final stand.  I am worried that it will not be preserved or restored, as it should be, in memory of the great men and women of 1916.  I understand planning permission has been obtained for a particular development.  Government intervention is now required because as we work towards marking the centenary all of these issues will take centre stage.  A particular 1916 leader has been forgotten.  I am referring to Tom Clarke, the first signatory of the 1916 Proclamation.  It is important that we find a major project to be named after him.  I suggest Dublin Airport would be ideal for this purpose.  One must bear in mind that in America there are JFK and O&rsquo;Hare airports, while in France there is Charles de Gaulle Airport.  There are many similar examples throughout the world.  The Government should be asked to consider honouring the memory of Tom Clarke by naming Dublin Airport after him.  I have no doubt this proposal would be met by much goodwill.  Since we restarted the national commemoration of the events of 1916, there has been a growing interest, not just among people of a certain age but also among young people.  </P>
        <P>Perhaps the Leader could take up these two issues on my behalf.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concern of my colleagues about the resignation of the governor of Mountjoy Women&rsquo;s Prison, Ms Kathleen McMahon, who is a remarkable woman who has done wonderful work.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to prison overcrowding and the fact that people were put in jail for not having a television licence.  Two years ago I tabled an amendment to a Bill in this House to deal with that matter but it was rejected by the Government.  Why does it not act on proposals made on an all-party basis in this House in order to avoid such difficulties?  I was surprised a little that in her resignation statement the governor had linked lesbianism with bullying and drug addiction.  That is regrettable.  I was glad that she acknowledged subsequently that she did not know much about the subject, but it is not very flattering.  One could just as easily link heterosexuality with bullying and drug addiction.</P><Col N="199"/>
        <P>Will the Leader indicate support for the application of Mr. Peter Matthews, a distinguished and accurate commentator on the economy, to be admitted as an expert witness to give evidence on least-cost solutions to the financial crisis?  Mr. Matthews has written to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call for a discussion on the Frontline report published today.  The report was conducted by a very distinguished barrister, Mr. Brian Barrington, who, at my suggestion, briefed Members previously on the immigration Bill.  He is a reputable man and a significant authority.  In the Frontline report, Shell to Sea - the Corrib situation, he and some other international panels have determined that Mr. Willie Corduff was seriously assaulted, that the investigation by the Garda was not thorough and was completely unsatisfactory and that the recommendation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, that there should be a review of police policy and practice in the area and that people from the local area should be moved to other areas because of the difficulty, was not followed through.  This issue is so important that I intend to table a motion on the Order Paper seeking to have a debate on it, but I would like all-party support, at least for the discussion.  Not everybody may agree with my views on it.  I anticipate a refusal after my distinguished colleagues to my right and left speak &mdash; into the valley of death he strode &mdash; but we should have this discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, support the call for a debate on the issue of pensions.  The question of whether pension payments should be made to sitting Members of the Oireachtas has arisen time and again over the past 12 months.  The issue was highlighted in the media at the weekend.  I never saw anything like it.  The media were like vultures after a kill in their pursuit of the Commissioner who was in the country to perform her duties, which was a disgrace.  A discussion on the issue would be worthwhile and should be held in this forum, but we should be wary of going too far.  Any change will filter down to all public servants, including those in the teaching profession, many of whom after retirement are re-employed for the correction of leaving certificate papers.  Should such experienced teachers be deprived of this income just because they have their pensions and should not take up other work?  It is important we have a debate on the subject as there are many issues to be considered. </P>
        <P>In light of the resignation of the governor of the female prison at Mountjoy, I would welcome a debate on Mountjoy, which is an affront to civil society as it is overcrowded, male dominated and a dumping ground for people who have not paid their debts.  We must consider alternative arrangements.  The Fines Bill is still on the agenda.  The issue concerns where we put people who commit less serious offences and who may be socially inadequate.  They should not be dumped in with serious and dangerous criminals.  We need a debate that will consider community services and how best we can move forward.  Perhaps we should produce a paper and set up a sub-committee to look at an alternative approach for these people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate scheduled for this afternoon on women&rsquo;s participation in politics and thank the Leader for at last acceding to the request from me and many other Members for such a debate.  I am delighted the debate will take place today and look forward to debating, in particular, the recommendations of our sub-committee&rsquo;s report on women&rsquo;s participation.  I am aware the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, is in the Visitors Gallery and I welcome her and the many others with an interest in this topic.</P>
        <P>I echo the concern of Senator Fitzgerald and others about the resignation of governor Kathleen McMahon.  In that context, I call for a debate on conditions in prison.  I and others have been calling for that debate for some time.  We need to debate the serious criticisms the former governor of the D&oacute;chas Centre has made of the women&rsquo;s prison and conditions there.  I have been in the D&oacute;chas Centre many times.  It was built just over ten years ago as a model prison.  It was a flagship prison in terms of rehabilitative prisons, but we now see chronic <Col N="200"/>overcrowding in it to the extent that spaces designed for one occupant now have bunk beds installed, which is one of the major problems the governor identified.  Perhaps more serious is the fact that many women in the prison are such low risk offenders that they should not have been sent to prison in the first place.  Senator Norris and others spoke about women who were sent there for non-payment of fines.  It is outrageous that in 2010 we are still sending women to prison, many of whom have young children, for these matters.  We need a serious debate on conditions in prison and the use of imprisonment for women.  We need to look at reports such as the Corston report in England which recommended that the use of imprisonment for women should be completely overhauled and that prison should be reserved both for women and young offenders as a sanction of last resort to be used only for high risk violent offenders.</P>
        <P>I also seek a debate on the proposal to merge the National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission with the National Library.  I have raised this matter before and it is of serious concern.  At a recent conference in Trinity College on the National Archives many experts expressed serious concern about the decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome recent developments in the Bank of Ireland.  Given that the placement was three times oversubscribed, it shows that there is some confidence in the institution.  It also shows there is confidence in the role of the State in the continuing rehabilitation of the financial system.  This is positive and augurs well for the other institutions as they seek to get their act together in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Fitzgerald in calling for a debate on the supports available to the many struggling families who are falling into arrears.  While the measures taken to date by the regulator and others, including the moratorium, are welcome and have kept the threat of repossession at bay for a period, the numbers struggling with arrears are increasing in a major way.  I ask the Leader to contact the Department of Finance to ascertain when the expert group will report and what measures it proposes to introduce.  While the number of repossessions has subsided somewhat, they will re-emerge substantially when the moratorium comes to an end.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Last week I brought the attention of the House to my attempts to receive some information from the HSE which had taken 14 months and ultimately needed the help of the Information Commissioner, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly.  In that context, I ask for a debate on the HSE which has been in existence for six years following the introduction of the Health Act 2004.  We must concede that as an arm&rsquo;s length organisation, it has not worked in the way we would like.  It is responsible for and has control of more than 50% of the tax take, yet our level of representative access, influence or involvement is effectively nil.  It seems the HSE is in a position to prevent the public from adjudicating on its policy and performance by systematically hiding information through a culture of secrecy and the obstruction of the provision of information, as I have experienced first hand in the past 14 months.  I am not simply talking about the cancer report for the north west.  There have been reports on children in care, among others, in recent months.  It is time the Legislature had some input into and element of control over public policy on health and a very large proportion of the budget as a whole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on a subject that could overshadow many of the themes we are discussing today.  I refer to events in Greece on Friday, when a small member state of the European Union announced to the international markets that it believed it would not be able to meet its expenditure and asked member states to support it in an act of solidarity.  That event will change the path and choices countries such as ours will have to face.  It puts on the table the fact that another country which occupies roughly the same space in the league table of European economies is experiencing profound difficulty in keeping the lights on at <Col N="201"/>night.  That is a subject that needs to be discussed in this House, given that this country will be asked to make a contribution of approximately &euro;450 million to support Greece.  While that is the right thing to do, we need to explain why and the profound implications of what is happening in Greece and could happen here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the pensions debate.  Some colleagues spoke about overcrowding in the D&oacute;chas Centre, the women&rsquo;s prison, which is located around the corner from where I live.  I must contrast the attitude of the State regarding the prisoners there to its attitude towards Mr. Michael Fingleton, the former chairman of Irish Nationwide.</P>
        <P>Over the weekend, in a letter that was published in a national newspaper, he said he was harassed into volunteering to repay money.  This is the man who led the organisation, for which he received a &euro;1 million bonus, that the taxpayer must now support to the tune of &euro;2.5 billion.  That represents the unacceptable face of capitalism in this State and the Government must take a much tougher line than it has up to now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Although I had not intended to refer to the issue, I welcome the comments made by Senator Donohoe and hope the Leader will take them on board.  In light of the lies the former Greek Government told the European Union about the requirements for entering the eurozone, for which it is now reaping the whirlwind, some economic commentators are suggesting the figures for Ireland might be questionable.  I do not think the commentator in question was trying to set an agenda but it would be horrendous if the international bond markets had any whiff of anything untoward in the statistics provided by this country in the last 20 years to EUROSTAT.  Senator Donohoe was right to raise this issue and it should be debated to offer an opportunity to the Minister for Finance to state unequivocally that the country has an international reputation for probity.  The international bond markets and commentators have welcomed the harsh but necessary decisions that were taken to turn the economy round.</P>
        <P>The travails of the Quinn Insurance Group have been raised in the House on many occasions, particularly by Senators from Cavan.  This morning representatives of 150 companies circled the M50 and came up the quays.  Many of the vox pops on radio suggested the Government should intervene in the decisions of the regulator.  I have a deal of sympathy with those people but we either have independent regulation or we do not.  I have the greatest of sympathy with those workers in Cavan who are wondering if they will have jobs next Friday, when the administrators make their decision.  As a public representative from County Leitrim, where there is a significant number of workers from the Quinn Insurance Group, I feel helpless.  How must the workers in Cavan feel?  There must be something that can be done to shift the regulator and to accelerate his decision to at least open the northern market for Quinn Insurance if he is not prepared to extend it into the British market.  I make this plea as a representative in the Oireachtas, that the regulator will make a decision promptly so those workers in Cavan do not have to spend the weekend worrying whether they will be able to pay their mortgages or put food on their tables.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue will be addressed on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the developments at Bank of Ireland in the last day or so.  We need clarification of that in light of the increased State stakeholding from 16% to 36.5%.  Is it intended to appoint further public interest directors?  Perhaps some others might be removed because of conflicts of interest.</P>
        <P>I welcome the capital requirement situation and the paying back to the State, buying out of the warrant entitlements under the preference shareholding.  There have, however, been significant other developments and we have heard nothing about them yet.  That is why I welcome <Col N="202"/>that this is a fresh debate on banking instead of a resumption of statements because there are new developments every week, if not daily.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has ruled on the curtailment of some of the powers of NAMA, particularly in regard to vesting orders, where other third parties or non-participating institutions are involved.  Equally, the context they envisage regarding Revenue might constitute a further infringement of citizens&rsquo; rights.  In addition, no one seems certain about developments in regard to Anglo Irish Bank &mdash; at least I cannot obtain hard information on them.  However, there is a curtailment.  We urgently need clarification in the interests of transparency.  We need to be reassured that it is the least expensive option.  There are changes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That debate might take place later, but we cannot have statements on banking now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it will, but we will accept enlightenment by the Leader now.  There are also the regulator&rsquo;s new proposals on probity, fitness and competence, which are most welcome.  We need further information on all of these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Bacik said about a debate on women in politics.  Obviously, there is a need to have all sectors of society reflected in politics and making an input in the formulation of policy.  However, there is a dearth of business people, male and female, in both Houses, whose absence, unfortunately, has contributed to certain policies that might have been better thought out if that shortcoming had been addressed.  We should actively look at this.</P>
        <P>Last week we spoke about the Irish Thalidomide Association and the great injustice suffered by those affected as a consequence of the failure of the State, as well as the German corporation involved in the manufacture of the drug.  I compliment Senator Mary White and Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l on taking the initiative to bring representatives of the association to the Oireachtas and tabling a motion for discussion by the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party tonight.  The motion will be endorsed fully by Fianna F&aacute;il which, if it stands for anything, stands for supporting those who find themselves in this unfortunate position.  In the interim the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, will meet the association.  She is a tremendously caring person with a good social awareness and conscience.  I know she will respond positively and adequately to the concerns of the people concerned which were not addressed properly by the State.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole who sought a debate on the reduction of prices.  There is a need for wages to be reduced further in both the public and private sectors, as we are still uncompetitive, although there has been a correction.  A corollary of this, however, is that prices must be pressurised and brought down.  I was amused to hear some speakers from other parties talk about the pensions issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may comment on that matter in a debate.</P>

	<P>I join Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in calling for a debate on the commemoration of the 1916 Rising.  I was fortunate enough to spend some hours today with the grandson of James Connolly and the great-niece of Joseph Plunkett as they made history come alive in the streets around the GPO.  These streets that withstood the bombardment of guns in 1916 are now under threat from developers.  I seek a debate on how, as a nation, we should move to protect this historic area which is part of our culture.  I would like the debate to be widened to consider other ways of commemorating not alone the 1916 Rising but also the period up to 1922, including events at Ballykinler camp.  We might include the comments made by Senator Fitzgerald who spoke about the social dividend in the context of NAMA.  There might be properties we could take over and use in commemorating the 1916 Rising.  I ask that the debate take place as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Hanafin, read the theme of the Proclamation in a stateswomanlike and exemplary manner, quoting the phrase, &ldquo;We cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>At this time, representatives of the Irish Thalidomide Association are meeting with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I hope she has the vision and strength to compensate adequately for the negligence of our State.  Some 10,000 people across the world were born with deformities arising from the use of thalidomide; in Ireland there are 32 survivors.  I want to see the Minister send a spiritual signal, making an apology on behalf of our State and providing for financial compensation.  I want to draw attention to a woman called Dr. Frances Kelsey, an inspector in the US Food and Drug Administration, who had the guts to refuse the pharmaceutical companies permission to have thalidomide on sale in that country.  She said not enough research had been done on it.</P>
        <P>There was a photograph in the <i>Irish Independent</i> yesterday of Mrs. Mary Cowen attending the Fianna F&aacute;il commemoration at Arbour Hill.

	<P>My position is quite clear.  A pension is for retirement and should not augment a salary.  When will the Government show leadership on the issue?  When will the Leader set a date for a debate on the future of politics because the biggest fear I have is that we will make politics the preserve of the rich and we will go back to part-time politics like we had in the 1950s and 1960s, which is bad for democracy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on the celebrations of the events of 1916.  I draw to the attention of the House that the centenary in 2016 clashes with proposals for the construction of one of the country&rsquo;s biggest transport infrastructure initiatives at the event&rsquo;s location.  For this reason, it is all the more important that we make a joint effort to ensure we have planned well for what we would all like to be a fantastic celebration and event.  I am referring to the metro.  It is my understanding that it will be a big black hole in O&rsquo;Connell Street for a number of years while the work is ongoing.</P>

	<P>This is why I am somewhat concerned about the number of years it will take and where we are today.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader accommodate a debate on the food supply chain?  Irish producers and processors are, as we know, internationally renowned for the high quality of their produce.  The gross output of the agrifood business is worth in excess of &euro;25 billion.  With the required supports, it will contribute significantly to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery, but there is a need to debate a number of related matters, such as CAP reform, viable family farm incomes, the farmers&rsquo; share of retail prices, retail practices and the issues of food labelling and information to customers, particularly in respect of dietary and nutritional needs.  Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for quality food production is a great strength of our agrifood sector, but we should support the sector and build our image as a sustainable food-producing island.  Therefore, I would like us to put a focus on and stepped approach to a debate on the matter.</P>

	<P>Some months ago, I called for a debate on the last report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention.  To my knowledge, we have not debated it.  Senator Bacik asked for a similar debate.  We could discuss the questions of overcrowding in <Col N="206"/>prisons, especially Mountjoy Prison, the current Thornton Hall situation and the resignation of the governor of the D&oacute;chas Centre, the women&rsquo;s prison.  On my way up this morning, I listened to the head of the Prison Service, Mr. Purcell, on the radio.  He was convincing and forthright in his opinions on this issue.  They must be listened to.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with Senator Norris in terms of discussing the recent report on the Corrib gas field, but I reject totally the suggestion that the Garda report was less than thorough.  As I have stated in the House previously, the abuse and blackguarding that the Garda has put up with in respect of the issue in recent years have been disgraceful.</P>

	<P>Last weekend, the HSE published two summaries of a lengthy report on its handling of the tragic deaths of a young boy aged 17 years and a young girl aged 18 years.  Will the Leader please allow a debate on the issue of abuse of children in the HSE&rsquo;s care?  It has been there for the past few months, but it cannot be allowed to go off the agenda.</P>
        <P>A few weeks ago, all Members asked for a debate on standards in the media.  It would be apt at this time when all of us in public life are affected by the media and its coverage of political events.  I am spurred into making this call by the way in which political journalism has degenerated into personal attacks and avoided any political discussions or issues.  This goes across the board to all parties.</P>
        <P>In the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, I read an article entitled,  &ldquo;The Great Debate&rdquo;.  We saw pictures of the three main leaders.  It was nothing short of disgraceful.  The three leaders were attacked in a personal and highly unpleasant manner, but none was targeted as crassly as was An Taoiseach.

	<P>I welcome the requests for a debate on pension entitlements.  I also welcome the decision on the part of former Ministers and Ministers of State to relinquish their pensions.  However, if they think this is going to go down well with the public, they should realise that their action came far too late.  The Minister for Finance should write to Mr. Joe Duffy and some of his colleagues in RTE to commend them on the work they are doing.  RTE has saved taxpayers a fortune &mdash; hundreds of thousands of euro &mdash; by asking the difficult questions people in my party and others have been posing for many years.  Such questions were avoided by politicians from all parties who were of the view that it was right that they should continue to draw ministerial pensions while continuing to be Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>On a separate issue, a number of requests have been made for a debate on the 1916 rising.  I would welcome a continual debate on that matter, but not merely on what happened 94 years ago this week as the GPO was being shelled.  We should consider not merely the events that took place but also how we are living up to the dream outlined in the 1916 Proclamation.  We must also consider how we might bring forward plans to re-unite this country and provide to people the entitlements and rights that were prescribed in the Proclamation.</P>
        <P>Those who took part in the 1916 Rising were men and women of action.  It is important that we should follow their example and take action.  As legislators, we need to act.  A major development company which owns many properties and which is about to be taken over by NAMA has been granted permission to do what the British Army was unable to do, namely, demolish the area surrounding the GPO, including No. 16 Moore St.  There is a way in which we can protect this structure and we need to take decisive action and follow this way.</P>

	<P>I wish to seek a debate on the economy.  I am particularly conscious of the fact the markets reflect the realities that obtain.  Earlier this year, the markets recovered somewhat before falling back.  What is happening in the markets at present is a sustained recovery.  In light of this and the fact that all boats will rise with the tide that will result from such a recovery, it is time the House debated this issue in full.  To quote Shakespeare, &ldquo;When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions.&rdquo;  That is what happened to the economy in this country.  Ireland&rsquo;s economy is the third most vulnerable to what happens in the world market.  We are literally like a cork on the ocean.  When the world market turns, however, we will do particularly well.  I ask that we focus on the economy and on what we should be doing to prepare for the international upturn.</P>
        <P>I also seek a debate on pensions.  There is no doubt that there should be balance and equity.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a matter I encounter almost every day as I make my way to this House from my home.  I take a route which brings me onto O&rsquo;Connell Street via Cathal Brugha Street and as I turn left onto O&rsquo;Connell Street, a taxi rank is located on my right hand side.  I constantly find that taxi drivers have stopped there with hazard lights flashing, thereby blocking traffic on the street and forcing regular motorists to break the law and to enter the bus lane.  Senator Norris lives in the area and may verify this but it appears as though a two-tier system of queueing is in place, whereby one taxi from the middle pulls out and allows out another taxi, which has been stopped, to get into that line.  It appears as though some drivers are not considered to be part of the club and I believe that bullying is taking place there on behalf of that club.  The effect on the main street of our capital city is disgraceful and is forcing ordinary motorists to break the law.  I do not know how this can be allowed to continue.</P>
        <P>I have raised the matter with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with Dublin City Council, which may be in a position to put in place some barriers to prevent this practice from taking place.  However, Dublin City Council has refused to do so and has stated this is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda has stated that it cannot take action because it does not have sufficient resources.  I call on the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Transport, who may raise it with the taxi regulator, and with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in order that he can bring it to the attention of the Garda to <Col N="210"/>ascertain whether something can be done in this regard.  This is taking place on the main street of our capital city and is a disgrace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader for a debate on a slightly different subject, namely, the conservation of our environment.  While Members have many debates on the economy and on the human impact on the country, no matter what is happening with regard to our economy, we have a fantastic natural environment and are very lucky people.  Before the existing banks ever were invented, we had banks of the rivers.  Moreover, we have beautiful coastlines and fantastic landscapes.  However, we must ensure the human impact thereon is not invasive and does not destroy such fantastic habitats.  Consequently, it would be timely to have a debate on the conservation of Ireland&rsquo;s environment because while we get worked up about all sorts of things, most Members can agree on the necessity for such conservation.  I acknowledge there are differences of opinion on the economic impact on our environment but such a debate should take place as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Callely in asking the Leader for a debate on the food supply chain and on agriculture in general.  The Government made a commitment a number of months ago to the introduction of a statutory code of practice for the activities of the large multiples with regard to suppliers.  The Leader should indicate when he expects this statutory code of practice to come into play and should state when a facilitator will be appointed to draw up such a code of practice.  Although the former European Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, was appointed initially, he withdrew and no one has been appointed to the position subsequently.  I ask that someone be appointed to that position as a matter of urgency and that the Leader should highlight this issue outside this House.</P>
        <P>In addition, I join those colleagues who have sought a debate on how Members can best commemorate the 1916 Rising.  I agree with Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s comment that it is not the preserve of any particular group of individuals as people from all current political parties and those who are not from political parties are represented in the stream of Irish opinion that was part of the 1916 Rising, to which I also happen to subscribe.  However, I also ask the Leader to facilitate a full debate in this House on the Irishmen who fought in the First World War.  I refer to the denigrated bunch of people who joined the British Army or perhaps the ANZAC forces, many of whom lost their lives.  Moreover, many of them returned home and fought subsequently in the War of Independence.  In many respects, they are a group of people who are written out of Irish history completely.</P>

I congratulate Senator Buttimer, who was the only Member of Fine Gael to support the Oireachtas attempt to prevent An Bord Plean&aacute;la from granting permission for the development of what can only be described as the most vulgar post-Celtic tiger monument on O&rsquo;Connell Street, which would see the demolition of some of the building at No.16 Moore Street.</P>

	<P>I also agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s call to name Dublin Airport after Tom Clarke.  Moreover, attempts are under way at present, in which Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has been involved for many years, regarding the repatriation of the remains of Thomas Kent from <Col N="211"/>Cork Prison.  As next Wednesday marks the official national commemoration in Arbour Hill, which is being led by the President, I call on all Members to attend and perhaps it also would be an appropriate date for the debate on the centenary and the proper commemoration of the 1916 Rising.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, Coffey, Ormonde, MacSharry, Donohoe, Mooney, Coghlan, Cummins, Hanafin and Doherty all raised the issue of pensions.  I certainly welcome what M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn has done and I certainly wish her well.  There are reports from across Europe that Ireland has one of the best Commissioners representing the European Union and this country.  She is a person of great ability and I look forward to Members working with her in the best interests of Europe and Ireland.  I also acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of the former Minister for Education, Councillor Niamh Bhreathnach.  I am looking forward to the women&rsquo;s debate on politics and it is timely that it is taking place this week, which is the 94th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  I also look forward to the participation of many colleagues in the House and if additional time is needed, I have left time in order that this debate can be rolled over.</P>
        <P>As for the up-to-date position in respect of NAMA and the social dividend in particular, Members will be aware the Minister will be in the House later today to participate in statements on banking and I have left time available at the end of that debate for a question and answer session on the very points Members have brought to the attention of the House.  As for the credit review group and Senator Norris&rsquo;s point regarding the appearance of Mr. Peter Mathews, it is a matter for the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service as to whether a person should be invited to attend.  I certainly will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s strong views in this regard on the conclusion of the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Boyle, O&rsquo;Toole, Norris, Ormonde and Bacik also called for an urgent debate on prisons, standards therein, the women&rsquo;s prison, conditions in Mountjoy and overcrowding.  As the Fines Bill will be debated in the House all tomorrow afternoon, I strongly suggest that Members should then bring their views to the Minister, who will be present, on the kind of society we have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Senators Alex White and Boyle raised the issue of the new Dublin Bus routes and spoke of the good service Dublin Bus has delivered, which it is proposing to tweak and make even more efficient.  I wish it every success in doing that.  As the Deputy Leader, Senator Boyle, said, a debate on public transport in general and on all the challenges in this area might be useful.  I have no difficulty in arranging such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney expressed strong concerns regarding the jobs of the 5,500 people employed by the Quinn Group in Ireland.  No one has done more to create jobs in Ireland than Se&aacute;n Quinn and his family, a view with which I am sure we all agree.  Senator Wilson has tabled a matter on this issue on the Adjournment this evening at which time we will get the up to date position on it.  I congratulate Senators Mooney and Wilson who have been very supportive of everything that has been happening in our area in terms of what we, as parliamentarians, can do to assure workers that efforts are being made in this respect.  I would like to think the Government and everyone concerned here will do everything they possibly can to assist matters and the re-opening of the company&rsquo;s Northern Ireland market might be the next step.  We want to bring this matter to a successful conclusion.  We support the great effort and work that is <Col N="212"/>being done in an area which was a wilderness until Se&aacute;n Quinn started his endeavours 37 years ago.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey called for a debate on the terrible effect heroin usage is having on our society.  I have no difficulty setting aside time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Hannigan, Mary White, Buttimer, Callely, Doherty, John Paul Phelan and Daly spoke about the centenary celebrations of 1916.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; put forward his strong proposal as to how we should celebrate the centenary of 1916.  I acknowledge the great efforts of the <i>Irish Independent</i> in its supplement on the events of 1916.  I was at the commemoration in Arbour Hill last Sunday morning with the Taoiseach, just one day before 24 April.  I was proud to be there as the Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, as a Senator and as an Irish man.  If one does not know from where one comes, one will not know where one is going.  The wonderful book published by the Office of Public Works on the final hours and final days outlined by those four reverend gentlemen is a must for everyone to read to understand what our forefathers, men and women, did to give us the country that we have today.  I will pass on the views of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; to the Minister concerned and to the Government on the renaming of Dublin Airport.  I look forward very much to the Abbey Theatre being relocated to the GPO in time for 1916 centenary celebrations in 2016.</P>

As Senator Daly suggested, the President will lead the commemoration in Arbour Hill next Wednesday morning and I will check if it will be possible to have a debate on this matter next Wednesday evening or late that night.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry called again for a debate on the HSE and its prevention of informing members of the public of matters of which they are entitled to be informed.  I have given a commitment that such a debate will take place as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Senators Walsh and Mary White expressed strong views regarding the 32 survivors following the use of the thalidomide drug and the hope that when the Minister receives members of the deputation today that they will receive a positive and sincere response that we all know they people so richly deserve.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called for a debate on the role of politics in our country and I have no difficulty in arranging such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Callely and John Paul Phelan called for a debate on the food supply chain which, as Senator Callely correctly pointed out, is worth &euro;25 billion to the country every year.  In terms of CAP reform, the retail sector and food labelling, I gave a commitment to the House last week that I will arrange for an all-day debate, with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in attendance, in the very near future, on the importance of agriculture and food and the challenges facing this sector in the next five years.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and Cummins raised the Shell to Sea issue and Senator Norris expressed one viewpoint regarding the people involved while Senator Cummins expressed strong support for the Garda report and the endeavours and hard work being carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I fully support Senator Cummins&rsquo;s acknowledgment of that, as I am sure would all other Members.</P>

        <P>Senator MacSharry called for a debate on developments in banking in Ireland and welcomed the announcement by the Bank of Ireland yesterday.  We will have statements later this evening on banking.  All spokespersons and other Members should avail of the opportunity to ascertain and tease out the up to date position on all the different things happening in the banking area.</P>
        <P>Senator Geraldine Feeney called for a debate on the abuse of children in the HSE&rsquo;s care.  It is a timely call for such a debate.  We have had many debates on this issue in the Seanad and I have no difficulty in allowing time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>I will give priority to Senator Feeney&rsquo;s second call for a debate on standards in the media, the press council and the decency, or, should I say, the lack of decency of standards in the media.  I will give this request priority for a debate in the forthcoming weeks.  I will allow the longest possible time because the balance in the media has very much shifted to a dictatorship.  We used to have a newspaper one time that reported the truth of the news and we had decent reporters, as pol corrs, in this House at that time.  One knew when one read their articles that they were factual and true.  Every night we can see on a certain television channel at 11 p.m. a one-sided view on issues.

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to be in the Seanad to deliver this statement on the important issue of women in politics.  The greater involvement of women in politics is an issue very close to my heart, as I know it is to the heart of every Member of this House, representatives of which were actively involved in the work of the sub-committee chaired by Deputy Kenneally last year.  Senators Bacik and McDonald played a key role in its work.</P>
        <P>On a personal level, I was the first female Deputy to be elected in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny since the foundation of the State.  It took a couple of attempts and I had to dust myself down and start all over again to gain that seat.  This is not easy for men or women to do.</P>
        <P>I fully empathise with and pay tribute to all of the women candidates, successful and unsuccessful, of every party who have faced up to the challenge by engaging in Irish political life.  Many women have given selflessly of their time to seek a seat in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad or even engage in local politics.  The sad thing is that all of their efforts are quickly forgotten and their talent may be wasted if they are not encouraged to try again.</P>
        <P>It is useful in the first instance to refresh our memories about what is contained in the national women&rsquo;s strategy 2007 to 2016.  This all of Government strategy aims to create &ldquo;an Ireland where all women enjoy equality with men and can achieve their full potential, while enjoying a safe and fulfilling life&rdquo;.  It identifies more than 200 actions as part of its 20 plus objectives.</P>
        <P>The strategy has three key themes, namely, equalising socio-economic activity for women, ensuring the well-being of women and engaging women as equal and active citizens.  It is the latter theme which is of most relevance to our discussion today.  In respect of this theme alone, there are over 50 actions listed, some 13 of which relate to women in decision-making roles, whether in politics, on State boards, on boards in the private sector or in policy influencing positions in the public and private sectors.</P>
        <P>Progress on implementation of the strategy is being overseen by a monitoring committee.  In my new role as Minister of State with responsibility for equality, integration and human rights <Col N="215"/>I will chair the monitoring committee.  The Government reaffirmed its commitment to the strategy last year when it received the 2007-08 progress report.  I will forward the 2009 report to the Government before the summer recess.  I will also chair a sub-committee of the monitoring committee which will look at the advancement of women in politics and other decision-making roles.  The new sub-committee will have its first meeting shortly and I expect the whole piece of work will take approximately one year to complete.  However, this does not preclude all of the key players from considering the issues raised by the Oireachtas sub-committee and I, too, will take guidance from the document.</P>
        <P>The national women&rsquo;s strategy is correct in identifying the political parties and their memberships as the key players in this area.  This has been borne out in the recent research published by the Houses.  Why is it so important that we work proactively on this matter of women and politics in Ireland?  There are a number of good reasons.  First, it makes good sense to ensure we have a fair and balanced society in all its facets.  Second, for such a progressive country, we are lagging very far behind others in regard to the role of women in political decision making.  Why has there been so little progress made to date?  While we will all agree that this is a complex issue, it is, in part, about human behaviours and perceptions.  It is a challenge with unpredictable outcomes.  Will women vote for women candidates?  Will men vote for women candidates?  Is it about stereotypes and discrimination?  If the answer is yes, how do we address them?  Should we have quotas and enabling legislation?  What has been done to achieve success elsewhere and how can we replicate it in Ireland?  How do candidates come through the selection process in the first place?  Are the potential women candidates reticent in seeking nominations?  How do we modify the whole system in Ireland to make it more family-friendly and ensure Deputies and Senators, both male and female, can also have quality time with their families?</P>
        <P>Many of these issues have been addressed in the research prepared by Senator Bacik for the sub-committee chaired by Deputy Kenneally.  Some of them are being addressed by the Joint Committee on the Constitution which has been addressing the issue of electoral reform.  In some of these challenges the Government can take the lead, while in others, it is a matter for the political parties to step up to the mark and recognise that Ireland has been &ldquo;found wanting&rdquo; in this regard.  Women must be fostered and encouraged to participate more actively in political life.  As Minister of State, I will actively pursue a body of work in the national women&rsquo;s strategy sub-committee in the coming year.  I will listen very carefully to the views of Senators and assure them of my wholehearted commitment to this work.  I am also mindful of the commitment given in the renewed programme for Government on the need to review the system of appointments to public bodies.  The Government already monitors the number of women on State boards and there has been some progress towards meeting the 40% target but results vary a lot between sectors.</P>
        <P>For more than 60 years the United Nations has fostered human rights, including gender equality, through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which affirms that &ldquo;everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives&rdquo;.  Some ten years later, in 1958, the Treaty of Rome established the European Economic Community and reaffirmed the principles of gender equality.  We are all aware that Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the EEC coincided with a transformation of our society, as well as the economy.</P>
        <P>The European Commission gathers and publishes comparative statistics on progress made towards gender equality in member states.  These statistics show that, under most gender equality indicators, Ireland is better than or close to the EU average.  However, there is one black spot when we compare Ireland with the rest of the European Union.  We have made no measurable progress in women&rsquo;s active participation in elected political life in the past 15 years. <Col N="216"/> Statistics show that women made up less than 14% of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann 15 years ago and they still make up less than 14% today.  What does this mean?  It means that in the D&aacute;il there are six men to every woman.  In the Seanad the ratio is somewhat better, at approximately 20%.  However, it still means there are four men to every woman in this House.  In the past 15 years the rate of female representation has increased significantly in almost every other EU member state.  The average participation rate for women elected to the Lower House in the EU 27 was 16% in the mid-1990s and has now increased to 24%.  Therefore, Ireland is more than ten percentage points behind the EU average.  In seven member states the level of female representation in the Lower House exceeds 30%, the high point being 46% in Sweden.  A further eight member states now fall between 20% and 30%.</P>
        <P>Increases over the period vary from country to country but appear to average out at about seven percentage points.  Overall, there are now 550 additional female deputies in member state Parliaments, an increase approaching 50%.  In the same period, the number of female parliamentarians in Ireland did not increase.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>International experts recommend that there should be a critical mass of at least 30% of each sex to ensure the views of women are adequately reflected in the political arena.  Both the United Nations and Council of Europe urge countries to work towards a representation level of at least 40% for each gender to achieve what is known as parity democracy.  The increased engagement of women in politics is a very complex issue.  It is also an all-party issue as well as a Government issue.  In discussing the topic today we need to move beyond party politics to achieve joined up thinking in an attempt to address these complexities and achieve the goal to which we are committed.</P>
        <P>Until now, none of the political parties has adequately addressed this issue.  A review of the numbers of candidates put forward in our most recent general elections showed that the six main political parties offered the electorate almost 300 male candidates and fewer than 70 female candidates.  The female candidates were closely spread between the parties, showing that the larger parties had relatively smaller numbers of women candidates.  In a number of constituencies, there was no female candidate.</P>
        <P>I re-emphasise, however, that the issue of women and politics is complex.  Is it the case that politically active women choose to align themselves with smaller parties?  Do they feel more empathy with smaller parties?  Are they welcomed more easily into smaller parties?  Can they make their mark more easily in smaller parties?</P>
        <P>On the larger parties, is it the case that the very size of these parties creates a more competitive environment in which a women has to fight to achieve a nomination?  Do the nomination procedures still favour one sex over the other?  Are the parties actively seeking new members from among women?  Do they accept the benefits of having more balanced membership?</P>
        <P>Speaking personally for a moment, in the Green Party we encourage the whole membership to be involved in the selection of officers, making the leadership and officership posts open to all party members.  To raise another matter, is there a body of women who are willing to participate?  In posing these questions I do not yet have definitive answers.  I am hopeful the work which will be done under the aegis of the national women&rsquo;s strategy will build upon previous work and complement work which the political parties are duty-bound to address as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Multilateral organisations strongly foster what they describe as parity democracy.  They believe the balanced participation of women and men in political and public decision making is a matter of the full enjoyment of human rights and makes for the better functioning of a democracy.  The United Nations, Council of Europe and European Union have all taken clear <Col N="217"/>positions on this matter and are united in their thinking.  All parties to the UN agreed in 1995 and in the context of the Fourth World Summit on Women and the Beijing platform for action that &ldquo;the engagement of women in politics and decision-making positions in Government and legislative bodies contributes to redefining political priorities, placing new items on the political agenda that reflect and address women&rsquo;s gender-specific concerns, values and experiences and providing new perspectives on mainstream political issues&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe issued a recommendation on women and politics in 2003 in which it wisely noted that &ldquo;democracy can no longer afford to ignore the competence, skills and creativity of women but must become gender sensitive and include women with different backgrounds and of different age groups in political and public decision making at all levels&rdquo;.  The European Commission works proactively with member states to review implementation across the European Union of the commitments made to the United Nations at the Beijing summit.  This results in the European Council making recommendations to member states and other stakeholders to ensure the European Union addresses deficits in gender equality.</P>
        <P>One matter on which there is widespread agreement is that this is a multifaceted issue.  European Union Ministers agreed in 2007 that all governments, political parties and social partners should be encouraged to develop further and implement effective measures for increasing women&rsquo;s engagement and participation in politics and decision making and suggest the introduction of training and mentoring schemes and the exploration of other initiatives.</P>
        <P>The Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe recommends that governments make a public commitment to equal sharing of decision making powers between women and men.  It recommends that this could be achieved by reviewing current legislation and practice, promoting special measures to stimulate and support women&rsquo;s will to participate in political life and considering the establishment of time bound targets to reach balanced participation.  In making these recommendations, the Council extends the list of stakeholders even further, recommending the involvement of national parliaments, local and regional authorities, political parties, civil service, public and semi-public organisations, enterprises, trade unions, employers&rsquo; organisations and non-governmental organisations.  These are all key players who are positioned to influence thinking and encourage women to take a more active role in the political field.  I am sure everyone in this and the Other House would like us to find ways to address the imbalances which we now have.</P>
        <P>The European Commission also made a useful contribution to the analysis of the difficulties in a research publication completed approximately one year ago.  Writing in the foreword, the then EU Commissioner for Equality, Employment and Social Affairs, Mr. Vladimir Spidla, noted that:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . equal representation of women and men in positions of power is a precondition for truly effective and accountable democracy and lasting economic prosperity.  With more women involved, political debate will be wider in scope and more relevant to a greater number.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This research publication by the Commission looks at election results and the behaviours of political parties.  It notes first that male candidates have a better chance than female candidates of being elected.  The researchers estimate that it would be necessary to skew the numbers of women on the ticket to 63% to achieve parity.  Consideration of this finding leads me to believe that the position may alter over time, as an increase in the numbers of serving female Deputies is bound to raise further the profile of women as able and active politicians and overcome stereotypes on the part of the electorate.</P><Col N="218"/>
        <P>The Commission sponsored research notes that while quotas can bring about rapid change, their success is not guaranteed.  There is evidence to support this position based on experiences in a couple of member states.  Not all electoral systems are suitable for a quota approach and I know from speaking to colleagues across party lines and from media reports as well as a lively debate in my own party that there are mixed views on the use of quotas in Ireland, even among the most committed of politicians &mdash; female and male.</P>
        <P>This research from the Commission also makes a number of points about the role of political parties.  It notes that the main aim of each political party is to maximise its outcome in terms of seats won.  As a result, candidate selection is linked to electability or electoral appeal.</P>
        <P>A further factor identified in the Commission research is the relatively low turnover of opportunities to enter into representational politics.  The report notes that many serving politicians view politics as a long-term career choice and are, therefore, more likely to seek re-election, leaving few openings for newcomers.  Again, the desire to maximise seats leads parties to select the incumbent, he or she being relatively high profile and well known and, therefore, the candidate of choice.</P>
        <P>I note the excellent report published by the Houses of the Oireachtas last year identifies many of the issues to which I have referred.  The report identifies five barriers to women&rsquo;s participation.  Known as the &ldquo;five Cs&rdquo;, these are child care, cash, confidence, culture and candidate selection procedures.  To an extent, we have tried to address the child care issue through the establishment of a cr&egrave;che in Leinster House.  However, the political establishment in Ireland is not structured in a very family friendly manner.  This impacts on men as Members and fathers and women as Members and mothers.</P>
        <P>Neither must we forget the large number of women and men who play the role of principal carer for the Deputy or Senator&rsquo;s family back home in the constituency.  This is particularly difficult for rural Deputies who have to spend a number of nights each week in Dublin.  I understand the German system is structured in such a way that Members have the opportunity to spend one full week in every four at their home base during the political year.  They also have a shorter summer break.  Perhaps this is something we should examine in the future.</P>
        <P>We need to review further issues such as cash, culture and candidate selection procedures and learn from good practice in other countries.  The joint committee has been looking at the issue of electoral reform.  In approaching my work on women and politics I will be reading all the evidence gathered with great interest.</P>
        <P>We are all aware that the legendary electioneering process in Ireland involves tales of pint buying, hand shaking, funeral attendance and baby kissing.  Perhaps we should investigate whether our colleagues in other jurisdictions have found better ways to endear themselves to their electorate which do not cost large sums of money.  Any change here would ensure the Irish electoral battlefield would not require candidates to have access to a pocket full of cash but talent.  Irish women underplay their achievements and many talents.  The Irish population, male and female, is probably among the most politically aware in the world.  Every Irish man and woman has an interest in and an opinion on policy matters as diverse as NAMA, volcanic ash, the health service and the state of the public purse.</P>
        <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for equality, I am more than happy to drive forward this agenda from the Government&rsquo;s perspective.  However, it is not a matter which rests solely with the Government.  It falls also to the political parties which must recognise the important role they can play in attracting and fostering new members, especially new women members, to ensure our political decision making remains well informed, well balanced and inclusive.  This is a matter which falls to educationists who must foster awareness among young people <Col N="219"/>of good citizenship and the need for high quality, well educated public servants and public representatives.  It is a matter which falls to men who must recognise that the time has come to share power in a more equitable manner and help to nurture daughters, female colleagues and friends who have the talents and skills to serve their country as they have done.  It is also one for the women of Ireland who need to show more confidence in their own talents and abilities and recognise that they too have a significant contribution to make to public life through active participation and, in the words of the national women&rsquo;s strategy, engaging as equal and active citizens.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to make this statement.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and the many people in the Visitors Gallery who have a particular interest in this topic, including representatives of the National Women&rsquo;s Council, UCD women graduates and others.  I congratulate the Minister of State on her new appointment and welcome her commitment to this issue.  She will have an important role to play in monitoring developments during her time in office.  I wish her luck.</P>
        <P>The participation of women in politics is an issue, in respect of which we have singularly failed to achieve critical mass.  In the Seanad there is a 20% female participation rate which is higher than that for the D&aacute;il, which is to be welcomed.  However, if the level of progress made in Ireland is compared to that in other countries, clearly we are at a standstill.  Who cares?  Does it matter?  If it does, why has action not been taken?  Who will take action and when will they do so?  What action will be taken?  There really is no mystery about the low participation rate of women in Irish politics.  We know the reasons; what is missing is action.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate Senators Bacik and McDonald who have been involved in compiling the report by the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  The report is a clear statement of the problem and the action that needs to be taken.  It is about implementation, monitoring and evaluation of what is being done.  That is the only way we can move forward.</P>
        <P>This is a critical time in the empowerment of women in Ireland and abroad.  I say this because many of our systems have been seen to fail during the current economic crisis.  So many of our management and regulatory systems have failed.  It is critical that women are involved in rebuilding the country and national and international regulatory systems.  We need to discuss ways by which this can be done.  Given the absence of women at senior decision-making levels, there is a need for action to change this.</P>
        <P>The emerging problem of global poverty will have a huge impact on development programmes which will, in turn, impact on the support that can be given to women and families in the countries affected.  The US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, recently spoke about the importance of the empowerment of women in democracies being critical for the security of the world.  She is right.</P>
        <P>Great progress has been made in the broader mechanisms to improve the participation of women in various fields.  I do not have time to go into them, but I welcome the national action plans put in place, as well as the European plans and the changes at the United Nations.  We can see that the campaign on 16 days of action on the issue of violence against women has become a worldwide phenomenon and its aims have been incorporated into national activity.  The number of women gaining access to the different levels of education in this country has grown dramatically; there are female participation rates of up to 80% in courses such as medicine and veterinary medicine.  Certain barriers have been removed.  Legislative action has <Col N="220"/>improved in dealing with discrimination, but many issues remain to be dealt with, including women&rsquo;s participation in politics.</P>
        <P>I recently read a review in the <i>Times Literary Supplement </i>of a new book on sexism and women, <i>Living Dolls</i>.  The review stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">During the final decade of the last century, it was predicted that the small proportion of women wielding power would soon form a critical mass, with the result that equality would be swift and sure.  All constraints on women would then be relegated, like the corset and bustle, to quaint museum exhibits.  But while girls were marching to the public tune of progress, they were starving themselves in submission to an unrealistic physical ideal and the century ended with a UK Government body image summit attacking widespread media promotion of unrealistic narrow ideals of feminine beauty.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is still the context which faces many women in the world today.</P>
        <P>The recently published report identifies key areas in respect of women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  I want to focus on one, namely, quotas and positive action.  The report concludes that without positive action, we will not see increased numbers.  We have seen this in Ireland in the last 15 years.  What positive action do we need to take?  The United Nations has consistently stated quotas are a temporary measure that need to be taken in countries where the participation rate of women is not improving or changing.  One could argue that applies to Ireland.  There is no doubt we have an unfinished democracy, given the low participation rate of women in politics.  There is still work to be done in this regard.  I refer to some of the countries that have passed legislation concerning candidate quotas.  There is a gender quota of 30% in Spain, 33% in Portugal, 35% in Slovenia, and 50% in France and Belgium.  The enactment of quotas in those countries has made a difference.  In Spain, women&rsquo;s representation in parliament has risen from 28% in 2000, before the passing of the quota law, to 36% in 2008.  In Belgium, the number of women members of parliament has increased from 12% in 1995 to 37% in 2007.  In France, the application of the parity law to municipal elections increased women&rsquo;s representation from 26% in 1995 to 49% in 2008.</P>
        <P>I recently met some members of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly and was interested to see the progress that had been made there.  The representatives included young women who had been chosen under a system whereby every second person nominated was female.  It is quite clear therefore that positive action of this type has worked in many countries.  The question for those who argue against quotas is to define what else works.  There is an onus on those opposing a quota system to produce the evidence and show what other mechanisms will work in Ireland today.</P>
        <P>The other mechanism we can use involves voluntary targets and quotas as well as positive action within political parties.  I would like to see the committee&rsquo;s work being continued with, for example, the general secretaries of political parties being asked to spell out their actions on this issue and how they intend to deal with it.  It is important to monitor and evaluate the actions that are being taken because if that is not done, one will be at a standstill.  Most Irish political parties have taken quite a lot of action in this regard, including the introduction of equality programmes, equality officers and targets.  For example, the number of women in Fine Gael contesting the last local elections and winning seats increased dramatically after a positive action programme in our party.  If we increase the numbers at local level we will find that more women will be elected at national level as well.  We must focus attention on those areas so that we can rapidly make the necessary breakthrough.</P><Col N="221"/>
        <P>A mechanism should be found to examine this report&rsquo;s recommendations and monitor them.  If we seek progress reports in the short to medium-term, we could begin to see changes.  We will need strong, positive action from all political parties, however, if this situation is to change.</P>
        <P>I said earlier that there is no mystery about why we do not have more women in politics, and candidate selection is one of the key reasons.  We will have to pay greater attention to that matter.  Throughout the country, all parties will have to work on getting more women selected where vacancies arise and new candidates are sought to run for election.  It is not acceptable that the electorate has had no chance of supporting a woman candidate in so many constituencies.  From the voters&rsquo; viewpoint, there were many constituencies where there was no gender choice, so they could not vote for a woman.</P>
        <P>As the report said, there is no mystery about the absence of women in politics.  It centres on child care, cash, confidence, culture and candidate selection.  The Minister of State asked if women were interested in becoming involved in politics and I believe they are, in all the political parties.  As Senators know, selection conventions are hotly contested by men and women who are interested in being selected by various political parties.  The level of interest is not a problem.  It is more an issue of candidate selection.</P>
        <P>I was going to say that child care had greatly improved in this country, but it depends what one compares it with.  We still do not have the comprehensive child care system that women in Sweden, Norway and Denmark take for granted.  They offer support systems to all families in those Scandinavian countries, but we still have a quite a way to go in that respect.</P>
        <P>It is good to have greater transparency and accountability when it comes to funding political parties.  The more accountability and transparency we have, the more it will help all candidates.  It certainly helps women candidates because it means the whole area is more open than it used to be.  It is also the right thing to do.</P>
        <P>The quota issue has created the most progress worldwide, so it is worth devoting some time to discussing it.  The report asks whether quotas are discriminatory and it includes a good description of the quota system.  In many ways quotas are making up for past discrimination, which is an interesting way to consider such a system.  I refer Members to the report&rsquo;s details on quotas, including the arguments for and against.</P>
        <P>I note the questions put to the relevant Oireachtas committee by representatives of the National Women&rsquo;s Council who presented their views on this matter.  The key question was what other means one would use to increase the number and diversity of women in the D&aacute;il and Government at national and local levels.  That is the key question that has to be answered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is the second time in a few weeks we have debated equality issues here, but before then this Seanad did not have such debates.  This is the first time that the participation of women in politics has been debated by either House of the Oireachtas.  In that regard, I pay tribute to Senator Bacik who has pushed tirelessly for this debate with the help of Senators on the Government side also.  She has not let go of the issue and I hope we will see a certain velvet triangle developing here, whereby Members in all parties, as well as Independents, will push for reform in this area.</P>
        <P>Last week, the House debated Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Bill on female genital mutilation.  At that time, we saw a velvet triangle develop with pressure being exerted from all sides for some form of legislation to be brought before us, hopefully in this session.  I am not aware of the exact components of that particular deal, but in any event we saw some action.  One could not vote against it because it is of such fundamental importance.  It is an issue which comes down to male dominance and control over females, and it is happening both here and abroad.  That debate was a great example of the work undertaken by women Senators.</P><Col N="222"/>
        <P>There are detractors who say the Seanad should be abolished, but having observed the great women here, I think it would be a travesty to get rid of a body that demonstrates the talents, ability and courage of women politicians who are willing to put forward their views on what are considered female issues.  We have had debates on domestic violence, health and women&rsquo;s role in society, but this does not happen in the Lower House.  It is interesting that Coakley and Gallagher commented that there is a reluctance to be over-identified with feminist issues among female Deputies and there is an unwillingness to be typecast as speaking for women.  They said the few women Deputies in Parliament favour interest in socio-cultural policy concerns as a substitute for articulating a feminist view on wide-ranging policy issues.  This is a pragmatic stance because as a visible minority in Parliament and in a political context where party discipline is strong, women Deputies have little option but to moderate their views to fit in with the masculinist culture and norms pervading D&aacute;il business.  This strong comment would seem to support the view there should be a Seanad, but it shows clearly that women Deputies are very reluctant to take on female issues to which we, as females, feel attracted.  Is that part of the reason more women do not get involved?  Is it a chicken and egg situation.  Whatever it is, it is worth putting the question.</P>
        <P>In our wider society there is a dearth of women in all decision-making or chief executive officer or boardroom positions.  My profession of the law is an example.  Currently, 60% of students in law schools and colleges are female, yet only 6% of the top partnerships in law firms are female and only 6% of those running their own practices are female.  I am among that 6%.  In the Seanad, some 20% of Senators are women, four of whom were appointed by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, myself included.  I thank him for including me.  His nominations raised female participation in this Seanad.  However, if we consider the position of chief executive officer, we only have one female chief executive officer of a publicly quoted company in Ireland.  Some 21% of our judicial positions are female.  This may be because they are appointed by politicians, who tend to seek female names to raise the quota of women.  Therefore, in the upper echelons, an effort is being made to try to make things look better.  However, I am not sure how helpful this is in the overall context of getting more women involved.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, unless we have a critical mass &mdash; up to 30% involved &mdash; we will not see any change in respect of policy decisions and women&rsquo;s voices being heard in Parliament and Government.  It is a serious situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik outlined in her report the five Cs that are recognised internationally as the reasons women do not get involved in politics, namely, child care, cash, confidence, culture and candidate selection procedures.  If we asked all women involved in the political system, as Senator Bacik did, they would cite these reasons.  However, I am not sure we can get into the nitty gritty of those reasons and find a solution for the future.  In the context of child care, the Minister of State mentioned the cr&egrave;che, but as a young mother I am not sure it could help me with my child care issues.  I have never seen myself as a stay-at-home person and whether in politics or otherwise, I see myself as being at work.  Therefore, child care is something I would have to deal with in any event.  It is not a massive impediment to work.  The problem is after-hours child care, for example, at 8 p.m. when one must attend a meeting or at 7 p.m. when one must attend a funeral.  It is when one must leave one&rsquo;s children in child care for 12 or 24 hours that is the problem.</P>
        <P>The big question is how this fits in with getting involved in politics.  This relates to the issue of buying pints, slapping people on the back, telling people they are great and spending half an hour in a pub listening to nonsense when one could be at home just getting on with dealing with the political realities.  This is the side women do not find attractive.  I can deal with the child care issue.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="223"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Many men do not find it attractive either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  Some men are better at it than others, as are some women.  My political opponents might say I am not great at it, but I think I am all right.  However, women seem to have a lower threshold and do not listen to as much of this kind of talk as their male counterparts.</P>
        <P>This raises again the issue of child care in the broader sense.  Child care will remain a cultural impediment or barrier to women&rsquo;s entry into politics until we have paternity leave which will allow us mould our men into seeing child care as not just a women&rsquo;s prerogative or issue.  Child care must be seen as a family issue where both parents should be involved in the upbringing of the children.  Both parents should change the nappies, do the homework, prepare the lunches, etc.  It is all very well to say we have a cr&egrave;che but that does not really help.  Even if a woman gets somebody in to help with the housework, she will not be in a position to employ a person full-time.  Men must step up to the mark and put the washing into the washing machine, hang it out on the line, cook the dinner etc.  I am lucky my husband is practically a gourmet cook and I am, largely, banned from the kitchen.  However, I would not be able to do what I do without the support of my mother who steps up to the mark at times to mind my children for me when I have to attend funerals and do constituency work.</P>
        <P>I do not find the work here a barrier, but I have made that choice.  However, there are some traditionalists and fundamentalists in society who do not see the role of a politician as being properly fulfilled by a woman.  This is a cultural barrier which brings us to the most important of the five Cs, namely, culture.  Ireland has a traditionalist, patriarchal society and until we change that, we will never see full equality.  Many of our traditionalists do not see a woman politician as someone whom they would like to contact.  I often get phone calls from people who apologise for bothering me.  Before I had children, I did not get that.  Constituents used not apologise for ringing me, but now they do.  They do not want to bother me, but they have a problem.  If I choose to be a politician or an astronaut, that is the decision I make as an individual and whatever decisions I need to make around that are my own.  It is the hypocritical, more traditionalist, Roman Catholic view here that says we should not have women politicians, like saying we cannot have women priests.  For years, these people presided over abuse of children, but they still turn around and say a woman&rsquo;s place is in the home minding her children.  This does not make sense.  It is none of their business if I choose to be a working mother who wants to go out and try to make a difference and at the same time rear a family.  I do not believe either of my children suffer because I am not around some of the time.  I do my best to make up to them the time I miss with them.  Perhaps I do not laze around pubs as much as male politicians listening to the order of the day and might miss out on some gossip by not doing that.  Most working mothers, whether politicians or not, must and do make sacrifices.  We have equality in our educational system but we need to make the quantum leap from equality in colleges, universities and schools, where we often see women outperforming men, to a position where women participate rather than opt out and let men make decisions for them.  That is what we have currently &mdash; a system where men make decisions.  We will see change, possibly in my lifetime, but I do not know how quickly it will come about.</P>
        <P>Previously, I mentioned Croke Park on all-Ireland day.  It is always full and the people attending are delighted with the carnival atmosphere.  However, on all-Ireland day for camogie or women&rsquo;s football, it is difficult to fill even one stand.  The point was made during discussion of the report in the joint committee that the media has a role to play in this regard by promoting women. Senator Bacik has alluded to advertising and trying to enhance the image of a female politician or businesswoman.</P>

	<P>Like everyone else, I have much more to say.  Ultimately, society in Ireland supports male role models, with the female of the species not being supported to the same extent.  My party, Fianna F&aacute;il, had a figure of 13% for women candidates in the general election in 2007.  That is a far cry from the figure of 30% in the gender quota system proposed in the report, which would mean we would need to increase the number of female candidates in the next general election by 17% if we were to adopt the report.  I question whether there is the political will in my party to do so.  I have to be harsh on my party and criticise it because we are not stepping up to the mark in this regard.  We are not coming forward and saying we will do this, that and the other.  When the agenda for this week was circulated in the past few days, it was very noticeable that many men in the party did not want to speak on the issue which they wanted to leave to women.  If the reality was that 30% of candidates on the Fianna F&aacute;il ticket in the next general election were to be female, they would be queuing up outside the door to get in and speak.  They really do not believe change is afoot, which is very serious.</P>
        <P>As a young female who has worked her way up through Fianna F&aacute;il, I know there are women in the party &mdash; and in Fine Gael and probably other parties &mdash; who do not believe in quotas.  I did also when I thought I would be able to fight my way to the top.  I came through conventions winning by one vote and having had my name pulled out of a hat.  It would be rather selfish of me to say that because I have been there, done that and worn the tee shirt, every other woman who wants to become involved in politics should do the same and I am not going to help anybody.  If we are to have change, the only way forward is to make the quantum leap and introduce quotas.  We could have a sunset clause, as Senator Bacik proposed, but that is the only way we can make such a fundamental change in Irish society.</P>
        <P>I could tell horrific stories &mdash; it is a case of water off a duck&rsquo;s back &mdash; about the imprints of hands on parts of my anatomy on my way home from Fianna F&aacute;il Party conferences, etc.  One needs to be able to take it and be tough.  However, that is not a reason to say we do not want change.  We need change for the better and the only way to ensure it is to put the onus on the political parties to step up to the mark and run more women candidates.  This should not be seen as a way of having the token woman sweeping up votes for others.  Why should women need to fill that role?  That is nonsense.  Cash is an issue, as has been alluded to.  However, if we can change this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not welcome that either.  There is a message that participation in politics is not for women and that women are not capable of doing the job.  We are very capable of doing it.  Let us remember that no women are before the tribunals.  There were no women involved in the economic mess we face.  The Irish political world would be a better place if there were more women involved.  Like everything, it is about the yin and yang &mdash; women complement men and men complement women.  We need the voices of both in national parliamentary decision making.</P>

	<P>I am sharing time with Senator Norris and as he is counting already, please do not interrupt me again.</P><Col N="225"/>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I have long been a great admirer of hers, both as a Deputy and Minister of State.  I am delighted she has carried on her tradition of plain speaking because there is incredible hypocrisy in considering the question of the access of women to politics.  Lip service is paid to the part that can be played by women and men.  It is like the issue of race in America.  In the old argument between culture and biology we know culture plays a major role.  I remember the leader of the west Cork flying column, Tom Barry, telling me that in 1920 and 1921 the women of west Cork had been very active participants.  They all met at night.  If their father asked them where they were going, they would give him a hard look and say: &ldquo;Movement business.&rdquo;.  He said that in 1922 they were removed and returned to their homes again.  They were gone from politics overnight.  That had nothing to do with the Free State; it would have happened under either Government.  It was due to the repressive, patriarchal, Roman Catholic, republican, Nationalist tradition coming down on top of them.</P>
        <P>People do not need me to tell them they cannot participate in politics; they will do so when the stakes are high enough.  My mentor, Patricia Redlich, a very wise woman, tells me that much of the time it does not strike women as being worth their while because there is so much ridiculousness, pettiness and partisanship in politics that it does not strike them as being important.  She also makes the point on the nature versus nurture argument that there is a biological ceiling.  How can a woman who is child-bearing, child-rearing and home-making devote the time, unless the system is user friendly?  Her point to me is that the system is not user friendly; it is a system that was created for men.  It needs large-scale reform to make it possible for both sexes to perform inside it.  It is a matter of providing cr&egrave;ches and cash.  However, above everything else, there is still a cultural problem in that women do not vote for women.  I approach that matter with trepidation in the way a policeman approaches a domestic dispute.  There is a habit among certain women of putting up ladders and denigrating their own sex.  This needs to be addressed as a cultural mass information issue.</P>
        <P>To come to the crunch, I strongly believe in having quotas.  Many years ago I had a long conversation with a great German feminist, Ulla St&ouml;ckel, who grew up with Leni Riefenstahl.  We talked about the problems of German women in gaining access to the film business, as well as politics.  She said that, given that they had played second fiddle for thousands of years, it was not going to happen in a hurry.  If we leave it to nature, it will not happen in a hurry.  It may never happen or will happen over centuries.  There needs to be hard intervention, as there was in the American race issue which, after initial cynicism, has transformed academe in America for the better.  The women who come through the political system here are the most formidable group.  It is not accidental; they have been through the Darwinian selection process.  To reach where the Minister of State, Deputy White, has reached one has run through a gauntlet involving grit and courage, about which most men would not have a clue.  We have a male locker-room macho club which is in need of reform.  While we are waiting for that to happen, I strongly support the introduction of quotas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a fine and challenging speech by Senator Harris.  I also compliment the previous speakers, Senator Fitzgerald, the Minister of State and, most particularly, Senator McDonald.  I thought her contribution was challenging and clear.  She took on those within the backwoods of her party, which takes political courage.  I felt every word she said was right.  Of course, it is not applicable to Fianna F&aacute;il alone; it is applicable across the entire political spectrum.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on being the first woman to be elected in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.  It is not possible to beat midlands women, as I know very well because my mother was from the midlands.  My father died when I was a child and during that period of life in the late 1940s and 1950s she received absolutely nothing.  My father had been the <Col N="226"/>breadwinner in the family.  If my mother had died, my father would have received a housekeeper&rsquo;s allowance.  That indicates the position of women.</P>
        <P>To a certain extent, it all goes back to Article 41 which recognises the special role of women in the home.  What about the special role of men in the home?  What about the idea that they might be seduced away to neglect their duties?  It is something that is outdated, a wonderful Constitution which is organic.  That means that not only do certain elements of it grow and develop organically, but also that others should be allowed to wither.  That attitude is one of them.</P>
        <P>There has been a glorious tradition of electing women to this House.  The first two were very contrasting figures, Jane Wyse Power who came from a republican background and the<?oasys _jy ?>Countess of Desart who represented the Unionist interest.  Women have been involved in everything, including some of the more dubious aspects.  For example, while I am not suggesting there is anything dubious about Niamh Cosgrave, she was part of a dubious system, having been nominated during the interregnum after the collapse of a Government.  She never sat in the House but voted in the next Seanad election.  Countess Markievicz was also a Member, a very remarkable woman.</P>
        <P>The situation is worse than was mentioned.  The figure for Seanad &Eacute;ireann is not 20%, it is 17%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 22%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it?  This is the figure I got from one of the reports so presumably it has been changed.</P>
        <P>That helpful interruption came from Senator Bacik and we are largely here today because of her initiatives.  It was she who proposed the investigation by the committee of the role of women in politics and it was her who secured the services not only of former and present distinguished women politicians but also of Professor Yvonne Galligan, who made a series of extraordinarily important recommendations.</P>
        <P>I was challenged on my percentages but I will turn to an official document on which I will not be challenged, even though it makes for grim reading.  It concerns representation within the European Parliament.  Finland is the best with 61.5%, while Ireland is a shameful 22nd, with a mere 25%.  That will surprise people because we think we are a forward looking, progressive country.</P>
        <P>It is even worse looking at global classifications.  The country in first place is Rwanda, where there is almost a women&rsquo;s government.  It is very exciting, although it is tragic in its origin, which was partly that so many of the men were wiped out.  Of the parliamentary representatives, 56.3% are women and the majority of cabinet ministers are female.  I think we should watch this space because, please God, they will add some ordinary decent common sense.  Globally, however, we are number 85, bracketed with Cameroon.  What a distinction.</P>
        <P>I support quotas for women because I genuinely believe they have a different angle on life.  I have practical experience of this.  I pushed for many years for reform of the criminal penalties for male homosexuals.  No one would touch it.  Albert Reynolds fled from it.  It was judged to be a major transgression of human rights but Albert said it was not one of his priorities.  There was then the awful possibility that Raphael Burke might be entrusted with this delicate and sensitive legislation but, thank God, he did not take it up and it was left to M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  A woman did it because she had more integrity and more moral courage than any of the men who were all terrified of the issues.</P><Col N="227"/>
        <P>As an aside, if people think it is bad being a woman, they should try being gay in politics.  It can be quite fun but it is also a bit of a risk.  It is extraordinary, 51% of the population are women but only 20% of Members are female, a tiny proportion, while 10% of the population is gay but for a long time I was the only gay in the village.  I am not any longer, there is another one here, openly gay and an excellent contributor.  Apparently, however, there are none at all in the D&aacute;il.  Is that not astonishing?  That is one of the reasons I respond so strongly to these issues, because I have been there, sisters.</P>
        <P>The task policy development committee report gave me the information that 17% of Members were female.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 13% in the D&aacute;il and 22% in the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>So the committee got it wrong too.  Interestingly, according to my report, it states there are 14% in the D&aacute;il and &ldquo;only&rdquo; 17% in the Seanad.  It should have started with the larger number in the Seanad and then &ldquo;only&rdquo; the smaller number in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il took on the issue to an extent.  I read the party&rsquo;s gender equality audit and the gender equality action plan.  There is a nice photograph of Bertie Ahern and some excellent rhetoric that approximately one half of the entire population is grossly under-represented at almost every level of the body politic and that in 2004, Irish politics is still largely a man&rsquo;s world.  Then Sir Humphrey follows Bertie and there is a lot of wonderful language but there is a voice in the background that can be heard saying: &ldquo;Yes, that will fix them for the next 40 years.  We need not bother about that again.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>There were, however, some interesting elements to the report.  There was a reported reluctance on the part of Fianna F&aacute;il, or any of the other parties for that matter, to choose women candidates for winnable seats.  Senator McDonald mentioned the term &ldquo;sweepers&rdquo;.  Female candidates are fine as sweepers, sweeping the votes in for the lads.  On the other hand, there was a suspicion that women are more interested in the home and the family and, thereby, not really qualified.</P>
        <P>Thank God, during my lifetime we have seen some remarkable developments, such as the women&rsquo;s liberation movement in the early 1970s and the establishment of the National Women&rsquo;s Council, an excellent briefing group, representatives of which are present.  Of course, there was Mary Robinson.  Her performance in this House, on Dublin City Council and at the Bar, where she represented all of the most progressive social issues, helped to transform Irish politics and started to remove what a leading academic had described as the disempowerment of Irish women as citizens.  I was at her inaugural address in Dublin Castle in 1999, when she said &ldquo;As a woman, I want women who have felt themselves outside history to be written back into history&rdquo;.  That was most remarkable.</P>
        <P>She has been followed by President Mary McAleese.  One of the academic studies I read drew a contrast between Mary McAleese and Mary Robinson, which is perfectly reasonable because they are very different people and I did not agree with some of President McAleese&rsquo;s views before she was President, although now she is above politics.  Ascribed to her in the document are not only reactionary views, as they were described, on abortion, contraception and so on, but also on homosexuality.  That is not fair.  She was one of the co-founders of the campaign for homosexual law reform with me so that should not be allowed to stand as a view of the President.</P>
        <P>There is a problem with quotas because they are conceived as discriminatory.  They may, however, be a necessary mechanism.  Looking at the situation elsewhere, according to Professor Yvonne Galligan, in Europe five countries have passed candidate quota legislation binding on all parties, ranging from a 33% gender quota in Portugal to a 50% quota in France and <Col N="228"/>Belgium, with Spain and Slovenia in between at 40% and 35%, respectively.  Their enactment has made a difference.  In Spain, women&rsquo;s representation in parliament has gone from 28% in 2002, before the law was passed, to 36% in 2008, a huge jump in a comparatively small space of time politically.  In Belgium, female representation in parliament has increased from 12% in 1995 to 37%.  That is incredible &mdash; an increase of 25%.  In France, the application of the parity laws to municipal elections increased women&rsquo;s representation from 26% in 1995 to 49% in 2008.  That is the legislative model.  There is also a voluntary code for political parties internally.</P>
        <P>Various Senators have mentioned the five Cs.  In my male arrogance, I thought I was the first person to note all five started with a &ldquo;C&rdquo; but then I looked in the appendix and saw a reference to the five Cs &mdash; child care, cash, culture, candidate selection procedures and confidence.</P>
        <P>Members who get pregnant or who have children should instantly be paired.  I was horrified to find this does not happen.  It should happen immediately and the parties can do it.  Female Members should sit on them, as it were, and demand pairing arrangements.  It does not cost anything and will not lose a vote.  It is terribly important and can be done straight away.</P>

	<P>I ask the Senator to conclude.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, being a very biddable male and subservient in all things to the authority of the Chair and the gentle person therein, I will subside.  I very much welcome this debate and congratulate the members of the committee, in particular Senator Bacik.</P>
        <P>It was mentioned that education gives confidence.  I was really jealous when Senator Bacik organised a commemoration of the 90th election of Countess Markievicz with a photograph on the great staircase that included very many women who played a pivotal role in Irish politics.  It was wonderful.  That photograph should go into every school and be up as a poster all over the place.  It says, &ldquo;This is what women can do and have contributed.  Maximise it&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>As they say in another industry, &ldquo;Follow that&rdquo;.  I applaud Senator Norris for his usual wit and rhetoric and for the valuable contribution he makes to debates such as this.</P>
        <P>I first came to this subject in 2001 when I collaborated with a senior research officer in the Houses of the Oireachtas, Maedhbh McNamara.  Our collaboration produced a book that is used now as a textbook in our schools and, I am pleased to say, as a reference book worldwide, because it filled a gap.  &ldquo;Women in Parliament&rdquo; outlined the background and history of Irish women&rsquo;s participation in politics, from Countess Markievicz onwards.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Given that we are having a debate relevant to the Countess, who, inevitably, has been mentioned, I make a plea to the people who produce textbooks, especially for the British educational system, to change a historical inaccuracy.  Lady Astor may have been the first woman to sit in the British Houses of Parliament but she certainly was not the first woman elected to that Parliament.  That honour fell to Constance Markievicz who not only has that place in history but was also the first woman Minister appointed to any cabinet in Europe.  The fact that the then outlawed Irish Government was not recognised by the British Government of the time does not detract from this honour.</P>
        <P>There is an interesting quote by Constance Markievicz who even then had to negotiate, as many women have done since, to assert her rights within the political framework of the time, namely, Sinn F&eacute;in.  She stated to the leadership, which was of course male dominated, that if she was not appointed as a Minister she would join the Labour Party, which seems to have <Col N="229"/>been the worst possible act of treason one could perpetrate in the politics of the time.  She got her way and became Labour Minister in the First D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>In one of many articles summing up the status of women in politics it is stated that men &ldquo;largely dominate the political arena, largely formulate the rules of the political game and often define the standards for evaluation&rdquo;.  Furthermore, political life is organised according to male norms and values and, in some cases, male lifestyles, as per remarks made earlier regarding arranging the Order of Business.  For example, politics is often based on the idea of winners and losers, competition and confrontation.</P>
        <P>Following my experience of the publication of &ldquo;Women in Parliament&rdquo; in 2004, which I readily recommend to those present who have an interest in the subject and which we are updating at present, as a member of the Council of Europe delegation from Ireland I was appointed to what was then and may still be called the Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men.  It will be noted the title was &ldquo;women and men&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;men and women&rdquo;.  I was one of a small body of male politicians on that 50 member body and was tasked with preparing a report.  I was privileged to do so, on behalf of the committee, and presented the report to the parliamentary assembly where it was unanimously adopted in 2004 under the title Women&rsquo;s Participation in Politics.  For those interested, the details are available on the Council of Europe website, listed as Document 10202.</P>
        <P>A number of recommendations were made at that time which are still relevant.  Before I include those in my contribution, I shall provide another quote.  Inevitably, Sweden is mentioned when there is mention of an acceptable percentage of representation of women in national parliaments.  Currently its percentage is approximately 45%.  Birgitta Dahl, a former Speaker of the Swedish Parliament, put this into context.  She stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The most interesting aspect of the Swedish Parliament is not that we have 45% representation of women but that a majority of women and men bring relevant social experience to the business of parliament.  This is what makes the difference.  Men bring with them experience of real life issues of raising children and running a home.  They have broad perspectives and greater understanding.  Women are allowed to be what we are and to act according to our own unique personality.  Neither men nor women have to conform to a traditional role.  Women do not have to behave like men to have power.  Men do not have to behave like women to be allowed to care for their children.  When this pattern becomes the norm then we will see real change.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The differences between men and women with respect to the priorities of decision making are determined by the interests, backgrounds and working patterns of both sexes.  Women tend to give priority to societal concerns such as social security, national health care and children&rsquo;s issues.  The male-dominated working pattern is further reflected in the parliamentary work schedule, referred to by other speakers, and is often characterised by lack of supportive structures for working mothers in general and for women MPs in particular.  In addition to their party and constituency work and service on different committees women parliamentarians are called upon to network within their parties at multi-party levels and with women outside of parliament.  Furthermore, they have to play the socially prescribed nurturing roles of mother, wife, sister and grandmother.  Most parliamentary programmes and sitting times are not adjusted to take into consideration this dual burden that women carry.  Many women MPs struggle to balance family life with the demands of work that often involve late hours, much travelling and few facilities.</P>
        <P>In my research for the Council of Europe report, it became apparent to me that it is not merely that this glass ceiling operates within male-dominated political parties throughout <Col N="230"/>Europe but there is a lack of recognition and acknowledgement of the extra burden placed on those women who wished to participate in political life at local, regional or national level.  To a large extent, this centres on lack of cash&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and lack of opportunity within party political systems.</P>
        <P>I appreciate my time is limited but wish to put on record that in that report I stated that the countries which have succeeded in raising levels of women&rsquo;s participation beyond minimal levels have, almost invariably, used some form of positive action to achieve this.  There is a consensus among comparative studies that quotas make a positive impact on the number of women represented.  Under these systems women are, in effect, assured election to the legislature, either through quotas in electoral law or in the selection procedures of political parties.</P>
        <P>I am an advocate of quotas for this country.  I believe that what Fianna F&aacute;il is attempting to do goes some way towards addressing that imbalance.  Despite what Senator Norris said, I am proud of the contribution and initiatives that have been taken, initiated by Deputy Bertie Ahern in 2006 and to continue as far as 2014, in that the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis of 2005 adopted a gender action plan for 2004-14, prepared by a sub-committee of the party&rsquo;s national executive.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il gender action plan creates quotas on party officer boards whereby a woman must hold the position of secretary, treasurer or chairperson.  It also specifies that of every three delegates to the party national conference or Ard-Fheis one must be a woman.  Furthermore, elections for the Fianna F&aacute;il national executive are now operated on a quota system whereby 50% of places are reserved for women.  The report has a built-in review mechanism, requiring an independent review every two years in which progress is assessed.  The contents of the report are presented to the national executive and another report is due next month.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White, and welcome, in particular, her personal interest in this matter.  I also welcome to the Gallery representatives of very many groups that have had a long-standing interest in this area, in particular, the National Women&rsquo;s Council, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Irishwomen Lawyers Association, women from Trinity College gender studies department and UCD women graduates.  It is great to see there is so much interest in this issue.  A former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, is present and was very helpful to us in the committee mentioned by others.</P>
        <P>I am very proud to be here for this debate, which I have been calling for since being elected in 2007.  I have had a long-standing interest and passion in trying to increase the numbers of <Col N="231"/>women entering politics and this debate is taking place because of a couple of initiatives I took.  These initiatives were brought to me by representatives from Labour women, in particular from the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland.  I acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>We are celebrating 94 years since the Easter Rising but in December 2008, my friend, Sin&eacute;ad N&iacute; Ch&uacute;lach&aacute;in, who is in the Gallery, mentioned that it was the 90th anniversary of the election of Constance Markievicz, of whom Senator Mooney has already spoken.  To commemorate that, we looked at a model which had been used in Portugal some years previously.  In an attempt to break down the cultural barrier of male stereotyping, a day was created in the parliament when it was half-filled with women representatives to show what parity democracy would look like.  Taking that model, I invited all former and sitting women Members of the Oireachtas to take part and the then Ceann Comhairle, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, very generously gave us the use of the D&aacute;il Chamber.</P>
        <P>We had a very visually impressive day where the Chamber was half-filled with approximately 80 former and sitting Deputies and Senators.  The Chamber has never looked so colourful and former Senator Catherine McGuinness read a speech from Constance Markievicz in which she exhorted the women of Ireland to hitch up their skirts, wear stout boots and carry a revolver to get on in public life.  Perhaps some of that advice is still relevant.</P>
        <P>That was a very important day and I am grateful to Senator Norris, who said that picture should be used in education programmes.  I think the Department of Education and Science has used it and I know the Houses of the Oireachtas communications unit has used the picture in some of its materials.  To have the picture of the D&aacute;il Chamber half full of women elected to the D&aacute;il and Seanad displayed somewhere in Leinster House would also help in a small way.  It would help to break down cultural barriers to women&rsquo;s participation.</P>
        <P>Following from that initiative, last year on the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights I initiated the establishment of a sub-committee dealing with women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  I acknowledge the help and support of others, especially Senator McDonald who served on the sub-committee with me and other members.  Professor Yvonne Galligan, Ms Niamh Bhreathnach, Ms Gemma Hussey and Ms Liz O&rsquo;Donnell all gave of their expertise.  Ms Aoife O&rsquo;Driscoll, my parliamentary assistant, helped me write the report as I was the rapporteur to the committee.  I also acknowledge the work of Senator Mooney and Ms Maedhbh McNamara on <i>Women in Parliament</i>, as their book gave us a great deal of invaluable information.</P>
        <P>The report was published last November and received cross-party support.  The findings have been referred to by everybody in the House, including the Minister of State.  I do not want to reiterate them and I hope the report is very readable and clear.  It is not intended to be a weighty tome.  It is meant to be a very practical plan of action.</P>
        <P>Some of the key findings include the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s record is not only extremely poor in comparison with other countries but has disimproved in terms of women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  In 1990, when Mary Robinson was elected as our first woman President, we were in 37th position in the Inter-Parliamentary Union rankings in terms of women&rsquo;s representation in the lower or single house of national parliaments.  By November last year, when the report was published, we had fallen to 84th position, with 23 women Deputies from 166, or 13.8%.  We were ranked equally with Djibouti in east Africa at the time.  I looked at the statistics again last night and we have fallen to 85th position, ranked equally with Cameroon.</P>
        <P>It is not that the number of women in our Parliament has disimproved &mdash; the D&aacute;il representation has never exceeded 14% and 13.8% is about our highest point &mdash; but that other countries have improved since 1990, moving up the rankings.  In particular, European countries where opportunity quotas of the type we recommend have been adopted have seen a difference.  We <Col N="232"/>are well below the world and European average and the internationally recommended figure of 30%.  Perhaps the worst finding is that we have disimproved.</P>
        <P>Negative consequences have included the restriction on voter choice that Senator Fitzgerald mentioned and that we discussed in the report.  Professor Yvonne Galligan told us that at least 60% of constituencies in Ireland in 2007 had no women candidates from either Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael.  Others have said that women do not vote for women, which is a bit of an apocryphal myth because if a woman wants to vote for Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael, she cannot in the majority of constituencies.  Fianna F&aacute;il fielded no women candidates in 28 from 43 constituencies and Fine Gael presented no women in 30 from 43 constituencies.  In five constituencies, there were no women candidates at all, so voters could not support a woman no matter how much they wanted to.</P>
        <P>Local elections last year were no better.  Only 16% of councillors elected last year were women and that figure fell from previous local elections when a magnificent 17% was reached.  Voter choice is restricted and internationally we have obligations to adopt positive action measures to change the position.  We need to address this difficulty as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Others have spoken about the five Cs identified in all the international literature discussed in the report.  These are difficulties with child care, cash, confidence, culture and candidate selection procedures.  On child care, others have spoken about the necessary changes.  Paid paternity leave is required to change the cultural view that child care is solely a matter for women.  I support the Oireachtas cr&egrave;che personally as somebody who has had a baby since my election.  I have found the cr&egrave;che very useful as I could leave the baby there and run here to make a speech, returning later to breastfeed the baby if necessary.  It was very important for me as a new mother to have a cr&egrave;che available on site.  I defend that facility.</P>
        <P>Senator McDonald has had a different experience and this is notable for Deputies and Senators outside Dublin as opposed to those from the city.  We must review our rules and sitting times within the Oireachtas to ensure they are family friendly both for rural and urban representatives.</P>
        <P>On the cash issue we recommended State funding for women candidates to be ear-marked until a certain target was reached, with political parties making additional funds available.  On the confidence issue we recommended that political parties take a lead in initiating mentoring and leadership training programmes.  As Senator McDonald stated, culture is a very important and yet intangible barrier for women.  The pub and pint-buying patriarchal traditionalist culture of Irish politics is echoed and reflected in every political party.  We must address it through a variety of routes</P>
        <P>In the education system young women should be given female role models and there should be an advertising campaign similar to that initiated in Iceland in 1999.  That had some very striking images, with a woman leader of a political party shaving in a mirror and a prominent male politician trying on high heels.  These pictures were displayed publicly as part of an advertising campaign to try to challenge traditional stereotypes of male politicians and what has been described as the overall masculine image of politics.</P>
        <P>A national databank of potential women candidates was established in Norway to get over the problem of not enough women putting themselves forward.  A national non-governmental organisation, such as the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, could administer that on a constituency by constituency basis.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak on candidate selection procedures and the sort of quota model we recommended.  The word &ldquo;quota&rdquo; sometimes conjures an image of reserved seats, with a quota of seats in a parliament for women.  I stress that this is not what we recommended, although it is <Col N="233"/>the model used in some countries, such as African countries like Rwanda which has achieved 56% representation in parliament by women.  It is not a model we advocate, partly because there would be difficulty under European law.  We are suggesting a much more limited form of quota, an opportunity quota rather than an outcome quota.  An opportunity quota simply requires political parties to put forward a certain minimum number of candidates of each gender.  As it is done in Belgium, no more than two thirds of candidates can be of one gender, thus putting a cap on the number of men a party may select.  This does not restrict voter choice but would increase the number of women candidates available for election by voters.</P>
        <P>Professor Galligan, in her evidence to the committee, spoke in a very practical way about how this could be done in Ireland where incumbent Deputies, Senators or councillors retire and vacancies arise.  In 2007, 17 Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour indicated they were retiring and the vacancies were contested by 29 non-incumbent candidates of which six, or 20%, were women.  She pointed this out as an example of where a gender balancing requirement would have increased the number of women running to replace incumbents without threatening any individual incumbent.  She claims it would almost certainly have resulted in more women being elected.</P>
        <P>A quota does not make any imposition on voters.  It simply recognises the reality of the political parties as the gatekeepers of who will go forward to face the electorate.  These gatekeepers must be subjected to certain rules in terms of the number of candidates they select.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation must be introduced as a matter of urgency.  Experience elsewhere shows that, unless some quota is introduced, we will not change.  The <i>status quo</i> has been stuck at 13%-14% of women&rsquo;s representation in the D&aacute;il for a long time.  The Seanad is better at 22%, 13 women out of 60, but the ranking on which we are being measured is done on the basis of the lower or single house of parliament.</P>
        <P>The measures the committee proposed should apply not just to D&aacute;il elections, but also to Seanad, local and European elections where our representation has fallen from 38% in the previous election to 25% in the last election.  A system of financial penalties based on the French model should be imposed in the legislation.  The legislation should have an in-built sunset clause whereby it would lapse once the targets were met.</P>
        <P>As a concrete plan of action on foot of this report, I ask the Minister of State to propose a timeline for adopting the legislation.  We know it has worked in other European countries, particularly Belgium and Spain where the rate of representation has increased from being more or less equal with ours in 1990 to being ranked 12th and 13th, respectively, in the world.</P>
        <P>I will finish on Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s practical point.  The preceding Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, committed to doing something similar.  Will the current Minister of State, Deputy White, convene a meeting with the general secretaries of all political parties to put to them the report&rsquo;s recommendations, many of which are aimed at them, and ask them to revert to her within two or three months for a further meeting to determine what progress has been made?  In addition to a timeline for the legislation and the review of the national women&rsquo;s strategy, I ask the Minister of State to take this issue up with the political parties as a matter of urgency.  Otherwise, in the words of Liz O&rsquo;Donnell before our committee, our democracy will remain unfinished and incomplete.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Possibly for the first time in a debate in the House, I am acutely aware of my gender.  This is no bad thing.  At one stage a number of months ago, I was a member of a Seanad parliamentary team that had 50% female representation.  Despite the fact our team <Col N="234"/>has grown greatly, it now has zero female representation.  This is not even slightly compensated for by the fact that this debate is being addressed and responded to on behalf of the Government by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy White, who has also taken my place in the Green Party&rsquo;s D&aacute;il parliamentary party, which I did not give up willingly.  At least it points to something to which we, as a party, have always aspired.</P>
        <P>I think of one of our founding members, Ms Maire Mullarney, a formidable woman who believed obstacles were not there to be overcome, but to be bulldozed through.  It has not been typical of the early history of our party.  When we first stood candidates in the 1992 election, we had two women out of seven candidates.  The first large-scale representation of candidates for the Green Party, then called the Green Alliance, was 25 years ago in the local elections of 1985 when there was either close to equality or maybe even a majority of women candidates.  While I was neither a member nor a candidate during those elections, one of the prime reasons so many women were recruited to stand was that many of them did not believe they would be elected.  This said something about people who wanted to make a statement through standing for a particular set of beliefs, but who were unwilling or unable to take on whatever would follow in terms of added commitments.</P>
        <P>This issue has been identified in many reports and in this debate as being one of the main problems.  It has been expressed as confidence, one of the five C&rsquo;s, namely, the ability to enter a structure and make a difference in such a way that there are adequate support structures.  At local government level, the Green Party has an admittedly small base, but approximately one third of our elected representatives are female.  With the exception of one town council in Carrickmacross, they have the added disadvantage of being single individuals and, therefore, they lack appropriate support measures.</P>
        <P>The other responsibility, that of child care, is a societal problem.  It is a burden that is still unfairly shared and we, as a society, must address this issue in a more focused way.  People who are elected have faced additional burdens, even though we have improved the situation in terms of cr&egrave;ches and the like.  I remember the experiences of two of my colleagues at different levels of representation, Ms Claire Wheeler of Dublin City Council and Ms Patricia McKenna, formerly of the European Parliament.  In the mid-1990s, neither institution provided facilities for breastfeeding children.  It is a shaming indictment of society that we were still addressing such issues because of a lack of representation, understanding and support structures.</P>
        <P>Given the nature of our political system, the largest impediment remains cash.  It is no great source of pride to say that, even in the field of paid employment with equivalent work positions, women are still being paid less.  Given the other obstacles that must be overcome, the ability to have access to money to run political operations and to take part in campaigns is, for men and women, one of the main determinants of election success.</P>
        <P>It is in terms of culture that we are probably in most need of greater female representation in politics.  Irish politics is male-centric, confrontational and seems built upon a style whereby the more the chest is beaten, the more the political point is made.  We need a politics that is consensual, inclusive and better able to address the issues at hand.  Since we lack a critical mass of women in political structures, our sense of prioritising which issues should be addressed is wrong and we have a mismatch of resources in terms of how those issues should be dealt with.  We must be honest enough to admit this as a society.</P>
        <P>The essence of today&rsquo;s debate has been candidate selection procedures.  While my party has good intentions and has not performed as well as we would have liked, we have had two MEPs out of 15 in Ireland.  This is the area on which we most need to focus attention.  I am not <Col N="235"/>speaking in respect of the report alone.  Rather, we need to examine our voting system.  The Joint Committee on the Constitution is examining whether we should have a different electoral system.  The German Green Party has a closed list system, although many people would not be happy to have it.  The list is 50:50 with the woman candidate listed first.  This system applies to national and European elections.  Last year, I met an excited young woman in Freiburg who had managed to be the 13th Green Party representative on the European list because that is the way the list is structured.  It has a European Parliament presence of seven women and six men.  The leader of the Green Party in Finland, the Finnish Minister of Labour, is a woman.  The leader of the Green Party in England and Wales, who is likely to win the first Green Party seat in the Westminster elections next week, is a woman.  These are the examples towards which we need to strive.</P>
        <P>Regardless of the question of whether we should adopt a different electoral system or try to work within the current system, the difficulty is still that we are not translating what is on the ground into bringing women forward.  Throughout the day in between monitoring debates and participating on the Order of Business, I have made several calls to the area I represented in the D&aacute;il and spoke with a number of activist groups &mdash; a local schools committee, a health group, a Traveller group and a community development group.  In each of those cases, the key person through whom information was being passed and to whom I, as a public representative, was obliged to respond in respect of concerns raised was a woman.</P>
        <P>Why do such women, who work at the level to which I refer and who are involving in setting the political agenda, occupy these positions?  Never mind international representation, the involvement of these individuals is not even being translated into representation at local government level.  This comes down to a lack of support structures and the fact that there are comfort zones within local communities within which people can operate.  I am of the view that such comfort zones relate to the traditional system and to incumbent political representatives who are, in the main, male.</P>
        <P>As a society, we must ensure the latent political activism which exists among women is translated into proper and appropriate representation at all levels of government.  We have a distance to go in this regard.  However, I am confident that debates such as that in which we are engaging and the reports that were issued by the sub-committee will ensure we will make up the ground.  There is a great deal of catching up to do and I hope we can do this catching up in the shortest possible period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish her well with her portfolio.  I have no doubt that she will do an excellent job.  I warmly appreciate the sentiments she expressed during her contribution.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senators Fitzgerald, McDonald and Bacik on the tremendous work they did at the sub-committee in highlighting this issue.  I particularly wish to applaud Senator Bacik in respect of that tremendous day on which we commemorated the 90th anniversary of the election of Countess Markievicz.  That was probably one of the proudest days of my political career and I will never forget it.  On the occasion to which I refer, one obtained a definite sense that women can be as powerful and exert as much control as their male counterparts.  It was tremendous to look around the D&aacute;il on that day and see so many powerful, intelligent, compassionate and caring women.</P>
        <P>I originally became involved in politics as a result of the fact that I come from one of those dreaded political dynasties.  In that context, my father was a councillor and a candidate for election to the D&aacute;il.  However, I went away and had children before becoming further involved.  Later, when Garrett FitzGerald was Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, I became acutely aware of the need for social change.  From a female point of view, some tremendous advances were <Col N="236"/>made during that period.  The late Nuala Fennell, Monica Barnes, Mary Banotti, Mary Flaherty and Senator Fitzgerald were all elected at that time.  This occurred in the absence of mandatory quotas.  I accept that my party is not espousing the imposition of such quotas.</P>
        <P>I must admit that I am extremely concerned about quotas.  I must be brave and outline my position in this regard.  I was one of those who voted against our parliamentary party&rsquo;s line on the imposition of quotas, especially as such quotas have gone against me politically in my local area.  Earlier today, it was announced that former Deputy Mae Sexton will be standing in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath in the next general election.  Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, who is no shrinking violet, will also be standing.  In addition, I am hoping, assuming I am selected which I might not be, to be on my party&rsquo;s ticket in that election.  Longford-Westmeath should, therefore, have strong female representation in the next D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about positive discrimination for women.  Niamh Bhreathnach introduced such discrimination in the vocational education committees and I am aware that this has given rise to a culture of nods and winks, huddles in corners and various types of secretive discussions.  I understand the need and the reasons for discrimination of this nature.  However, I have serious concerns about tokenism and electing women for the sake of doing so.  Women have so much to contribute and, as many previous speakers indicated, there are brilliant female representatives in this Oireachtas.  There are other ways in which to ensure progress is made.</P>
        <P>The report of the sub-committee refers to five issues of importance in respect of women in politics, namely, child care, cash, confidence, culture and candidate selection.  The issue which stands out for me is that of confidence.  In the context of the male-dominated arena of politics, women tend to be excluded.  Such exclusion is not obvious but is rather extremely subtle in nature.  I do not know whether quotas would provide an answer in this regard.  What is needed is positive mentoring and education.  In addition, the general secretaries and leaders of political parties must believe in women and make matters easy for them.  Women in politics are not funded to the same extent as their male counterparts.  That is a major issue.  Men have more resources and easier access to such resources than women.</P>
        <P>I have some serious concerns about quotas.  The sub-committee&rsquo;s report recommends that all quotas should be voluntary in nature.  Professor Galligan&rsquo;s comments in that regard are extremely interesting.  I accept there have been positive results in other countries but I wonder whether these are sustainable.  I am aware of the need to find ways to encourage women to enter politics.  However, I am of the view that this is a cultural issue.</P>
        <P>My sister was recently elected to the local town council.  She is one of two female members of the council.  She is an extremely strong woman but she informed me that she found it difficult to come to terms with the culture of nods and winks, trips to the golf course and drinking pints that obtains.  I do not believe that quotas represent a way to solve that problem.  We must instead empower women and allow them to shine.  That is what is going to have to happen.  Senator Harris stated that it might take some time for this to happen.  I accept that this is probably the case but we must continue to find cultural ways by which we might change society in order that more women become interested in politics.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the issue of management within politics.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour and Fine Gael have very few senior managers who are female.  That is a matter which must be addressed because involving women at that level could prove to be a way of empowering, encouraging, inspiring and giving confidence to them.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to child care has been discussed at length.  The difference between women from rural areas and their urban counterparts is very significant.  I am a lone parent and my two children were in their early teens when I became involved in politics.  I was out of <Col N="237"/>the house half the time.  To this day, I honestly am not in a position to indicate why they turned out so well.  However, I had extremely good support from my wider family.  Perhaps political parties might provide support for their members.  They could organise cr&egrave;ches in rural constituencies for female members who are obliged to travel to work.</P>
        <P>I again acknowledge the great work that has been done in respect of the report and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish her well in her new role.  I acknowledge her personal interest in this issue.  I also compliment Senators Bacik, Fitzgerald and McDonald on their contributions and Senator Bacik, in particular, on driving the report and bringing it to this point.</P>
        <P>Members have debated this issue many times.  I have been a Member of the Seanad since 1993 and in every subsequent session of Seanad &Eacute;ireann there has been a debate on the reasons so few women participate in politics, be it in the D&aacute;il, this Chamber or at local government level.  Perhaps I was fortunate to come from a political background through my grandfather and my father who was a Minister, a Deputy and a Senator.  My brother and I, as well as many members of my extended family, also participated.  If not on the front line, they always were public people and whenever we had family gatherings, we always had fiery discussions on whatever was the topic of the day.  For example, such a discussion took place last Saturday night on the issue of NAMA and another on the volcanic eruption.  I am weary from discussions.  Consequently, there never has been so-called women&rsquo;s talk at any such gatherings since I was a little girl growing up and answering the door bell or the telephone to take messages for my father or my brother.  However, when I took an interest in becoming involved in politics many moons ago, my father, God be with him, told me that I could not go down that road as it was too tough for women.  I recall him saying that to me, but I replied that I still intended to do it.  While I did not get there before he died, on one of his last days, I remember him saying, while having a pint, that he thought I would be the family member who would make it.  While I have not actually made it, I am half-way there.  However, he was aware that I would not give up.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the real discussion.  The contributions made thus far by all of the women who participated and by some of the men who have been present have been excellent.  I do not have much more to add to the debate but I wish to discuss the subject of quotas.  I am completely against them and take Senator McFadden&rsquo;s point in this regard.  However, I noted Senator Bacik&rsquo;s comments on limited opportunity quotas and began to think about what that meant.  That is being implemented in that at convention level within my party there is every encouragement to try to have the participation at candidate level of two men and two women.  This policy is in place; there is a strong push to achieve it, as it is what the party seeks.</P>
        <P>However, that is not where the problem lies.  It arises when one is on the ticket and it pertains to electioneering.  I will get down to brass tacks.  I have run in four elections and know what it means to go out with my machine against those of other candidates.  I am as good as one will get at electioneering and campaigning.  I will take people on in the pubs, play my game of 45 as well as anyone or a game of poker.  I will attend GAA matches or whatever event is taking place and will take them on.  However, that said, I still did not make it and will use my constituency as an example of what can happen.  While they were delighted that a woman was running, I was unfortunate in that I had two Galway men as running mates and during the last week they decided to work together to secure the first and second preferences for themselves, after which I brought up the rear.  In other words, one can get on the ticket and play a blinder, one can be good at one&rsquo;s job, be able to deliver speeches and can match anyone else, but, ultimately, it is the machine on the ground that wins.  It is about how one goes to the door, who are one&rsquo;s canvassers, who joins the campaign and who are the key people who can make up one&rsquo;s <Col N="238"/>machine.  It is about having people who can perform at the door.  One needs people who can talk at the door, who are soft at the door and know how to win people over.  All of these issues arise and there is not much point in having a crowd of men who will go to the door and pontificate, as they will lose one votes.  Consequently, one must be aware of this factor.</P>
        <P>To me, this is real life.  While I want women to participate in politics, I do not know whether that will happen unless the system is changed and there is fundamental reform.  We have talked the talk, but until that happens, I do not know.</P>
        <P>Moreover, even were the system to be changed, I do not know how this would change.  As a career guidance counsellor, I receive invitations to appear in schools at leaving certificate level when the pupils make decisions on filling in their CAO forms and I am asked to talk about politics.  The single point I make to them is that one must have great confidence.  Second, they must be a people&rsquo;s person and be able to reach out, interact with ease and be a fun person in the middle of it all.  If one is too serious, people will walk away.  That is an important point.  Moreover, one must have great energy levels, as one will be up late at night and coming home at all hours.  One must also have good health, as if one lacks energy, it will not work.  God knows, I sometimes have gone out when I have literally been exhausted and tried to string together a few words.</P>

As for culture, this is changing because women are entering all fields of life.  They are attending universities, acquiring engineering and science degrees and reaching the top.  Unquestionably, there is no barrier in respect of academic ability, as they are well able to do the job.  In fact, one should not doubt that they are much better than men.  Consequently, there is no problem with culture.  The problem arises in how one puts together a machine to be elected.  While the quota system can be overcome &mdash; I do not perceive it to be a barrier, no matter how one might want to do it &mdash; the key factor is dealing with what is on the ground.  Senator Bacik has been there and it is where one wins or loses.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Ceist th&aacute;bhachtach &iacute; seo agus sinn ag pl&eacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; ban agus an pholait&iacute;ocht.  N&iacute; ceist fhurasta &iacute; seo le r&eacute;iteach.

        <P>This is a highly important debate, in which there is no easy solution.  It is important that the issue of women in politics is placed in the context of our current position and the kind of state in which we are living.  Members have heard Senator Norris refer to the provision in the Constitution that, at its core, suggests women should not even be working, let alone involved in the political arena.  We need only refer to Article 41.2.1o  of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The State, shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That part of the article referring to a woman&rsquo;s duties in the home clearly shows we have not moved past the idea of women having a role as doting housewives and mothers who exist to cater for the every whim of their husband or partner and those of their children.  We as a State need to ask ourselves why such blatantly gender biased articles remain in place in the 21st century and have remained in place up to now.  This article and many parts of our Constitution need to be fundamentally reformed if we are to make any real change in the issue of gender equality and women&rsquo;s participation in society and politics in general.  Language such as &ldquo;man, in virtue of his rational being&rdquo; etc is outdated; it is an embarrassment for men such as myself and it needs to be removed.</P>
        <P>Great strides have been made and we as a country have come a long way in terms of achieving equality for women.  Thankfully, this State and the religious orders that ran it for many years have ceased consigning women to a life of slave labour in Magdalene laundries.  They have ceased carrying our horrific birth practices in maternity hospitals and prohibiting birth control.  It could be argued that if more women were represented in the political institutions that these practices may never have been carried out in the past in our dark and murky history.  However, huge inequalities still exist in this State.  Huge gaps in pay exist between the genders, many health services for women are dire and there is a severe lack of child care provision.  Women are grossly under-represented in decision making in local and national Government and on State boards.  Even though we know women make up more than half the population and contribute more than their fair share to society both inside and outside the home, they are still frequently excluded from positions of power.  Senator Bacik spoke about where Ireland ranks in this respect.  It is appalling when one see it in writing that we are ranked lower than the EU average, the American average, the Asian average and rank on a par with sub-Saharan Africa.  Ours is a shameful ranking on that list.</P>
        <P>It was stated earlier that many women involved in politics got involved at national level generally because they come from political families or have some experience of electoral politics.  The big issue at the heart of the lack of political representation of women is support.  One of the barriers that has been mentioned is the issue of child care, which needs to be tackled head on.  Addressing it is not as simple as the availability of child care services because we all know that involvement in politics is not a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job.  Such provision needs to be in place.  Many women who would like to get involved in politics cannot do so because of the dire situation regarding the provision of child care, or even if child care services are available, there is the expense.  Some 20% of average earnings in Ireland are spent on child care compared to 8% in other EU countries.</P><Col N="240"/>
        <P>I am not sure if the issue of social class was mentioned but it is a key actor in influencing the type of person who goes forward for election.  Social disadvantage and the lack of opportunities of further education all inhibit a woman&rsquo;s chance to become involved in politics.  Other issues such as family unfriendly working hours also act as a barrier to women&rsquo;s participation in politics.</P>
        <P>I do not understand why the Seanad does not address an issue in this respect.  I remember speaking to Senator Bacik about this when she had her child and I had a young boy and another on the way.  One has to wait until Thursday to find out if the Seanad is due to sit on Friday or on the following Tuesday or Wednesday.  That situation should not exist.  A young father or mother has to wait until he or she gets an email from the office of the Leader of the Seanad to let him or her know what days the Seanad will sit next week.  The situation should not exist.  There are simple ways we can do our work better that would not necessitate overhauling the whole system that could make subtle but serious changes that would enhance people&rsquo;s lives and make matters a little easier for them.</P>
        <P>There are issues that need to be addressed and there are good examples of practice that we could follow.  Countries such as Sweden and Denmark have made huge inroads in terms of the number of women political representatives they have.  Both countries introduced quotas as a temporary mechanism to boost the number of women in parliament.  Such mechanisms work well and can work well in this State.</P>
        <P>Political parties without a doubt have probably the biggest role to play in this respect.  Sinn F&eacute;in has introduced a 50:50 quota for election to its ard comhairle or national executive, which has been a practice for many years, and we also have a quota system in place for candidates.  It has been beneficial to our party.  Some people say they would not agree with this mechanism.  I was reluctant to support the introduction of quotas.  I represent Donegal South-West.  Sinn F&eacute;in has seven elected representatives in that constituency.  I along with six others represent that constituency for Sinn F&eacute;in at council, town council and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta level.  Four of the representatives are female and three are male.  Three of my female colleagues were first appointed to their boards through co-options either by me getting elected to the Seanad and a co-option being made or due to an unfortunate bereavement in the constituency.  I am glad to say that of the three of those who were elected through co-options, two topped the poll with large surpluses when they went on to fight the elections.  This shows that where one has an opportunity to encourage women into the electoral system through a co-option, they can excel in terms of their male counterparts when they stand on an equal platform in a future election, as in this instance when none of their male colleagues could catch them for love nor money by virtue of the talents they espoused.  Therefore, I recommend a quota system.</P>
        <P>While one may have a quota system within a party, as we do in Sinn F&eacute;in, the party may not always select a woman candidate to stand for the party or the party may not reach the quota it has set, which in the case of our party is 30%, but this system fixes in the minds of party activists and party managers that they have to be mindful of the issue of women&rsquo;s participation.  I wanted to establish a Sinn F&eacute;in cumann or branch of our party in an area and I asked one of our female activists to draw up a list of supporters in that area.  She gave me a list of 50 people and of those 50 people eight were men.  The reality is that being a woman, she knew other women and had women friends and women will attract women.  We need to give people the opportunity to become involved in politics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a first because I agree wholeheartedly, I would say for the first time in my life, with Sinn F&eacute;in and the previous speaker in that our Constitution offends both men and women and it drastically needs a rehaul.  It is on that basis and having regard to <Col N="241"/>speakers who are seeking a new system of election that I decided to approach this debate from a solutions point of view rather than merely as a discussion.  I knew this issue would be aired and the shortcomings or reasons we do not have more women in politics are well established.  It was in light of this debate on how we can encourage more women to become involved in politics that caused me to reflect and examine our system.  I thought the only fair way of having a quota and getting more women into politics &mdash; the system must be based on fairness &mdash; is that 50% of the Members elected to the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann would be male and 50% would be female.  Therefore, we would have a 50:50 quota.  As I was thinking about this very simple idea I realised we would have to change our system totally and that is a reason I went further in this respect.  I thought we should cut the numbers.  The only way we will be able to elect 50% males and 50% females is by having two panels, as we have in the Seanad.  People would be elected from the male panel and from the female panel.  The easiest way to do that would be to have two seat constituencies.  In that way, everything would have to be redrawn.  Equally, we would need a new voting system because it would have to be a first past the post system.  This is quite a radical proposal but if we are to go beyond paying pure lip service of involving more women in politics, why not do this?  This is part of what I enjoy about being an Independent, as such, because I would not have been able to come up with or espouse it if I were a member of a political party because I would have been shot down to a certain extent.  I respect what happens in political parties &mdash; I was in one &mdash; and how policy is formulated.</P>
        <P>We have reached a stage when we need radical solutions to our problems and our politics.  This plan places a certain constraint on the voter if asked to be listed only on a male or a female ballot.  I will speak in greater detail about this proposal at the Joint Committee on the Constitution tomorrow.  I imagine it is one about which people need to think because it asks us to suspend how we conduct politics.  There are plenty of people who will say that is not a bad thing and that we should try something new.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I would like to see this plan trialled.  The only way we will know if women make a difference in politics is if we have the opportunity to observe it.  Why not put this plan into action in the next two general elections?  After that, let us look at it again.  One of the problems I have with the Constitution is that once something is put into it, it is set in stone and cannot be touched.  That is not very satisfactory because the Constitution is from a different era.  When one reads it, as I did, one sees how offensive it is in many ways.  The fact that a constitutional referendum is needed should not be a reason not to go ahead with this plan.</P>
        <P>It will have a dramatic effect on party politics and it is one of the reasons the political parties, which control our system of elections, will not buy into it.  This is where one must try to appeal to the people over the political parties.  The political parties will not change a system which has, by and large, worked for them.  That is why I agree completely with what was said about culture and the culture within political parties, which has been discussed quite a bit.  It will take an awfully long time to change it if we leave it to the current system.</P>
        <P>I was quite hostile to quotas originally but I thought about how politics could be different.  This is a very radical and experimental idea which is worth considering.  The notion that we might trial it for two electoral terms is interesting.  Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the number of women in politics in Spain as a result of quotas.  The important question is, what difference did it make?  Did it make a difference to their politics?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There is research on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>If it has made a difference, that is evidence it is not a bad thing.  However, we are more concerned about what we can do in Ireland.</P><Col N="242"/>
        <P>I recognise it is quite a radical suggestion.  How can I get it imposed because, as I said, the political parties will not really buy into it?  I worry it will remain theoretical.  We need real solutions to the issues we face.  It is important to see if women&rsquo;s participation in politics makes a difference and that is why I would like this plan implemented.</P>
        <P>There is a shortcoming in my proposal.  This notion that one is selected for election based on gender is not one with which I am completely comfortable.  However, constraints currently exist in our system.  For instance, some people have a choice of electing five Deputies while others only have the choice of three.  Previous speakers spoke about the barriers that exist to women&rsquo;s participation.  They are as fundamental an obstacle to the inclusion of women as a panel of male or female Members only.  This plan requires some thought and that is why people need to reflect a little on it rather than react to it immediately.</P>
        <P>The plan will also have effect on political parties.  In regard to membership of political parties, how does one get people interested in coming to meetings and so on?  Membership is falling off and people do not believe it is that relevant.  I accept it will have a significant impact on how politics is done.</P>
        <P>There is ferocious competition among political parties in a constituency to get the best man or woman to stand for their party.  As it stands, one&rsquo;s competitors are one&rsquo;s running mates in one&rsquo;s party in the constituency.  This all feeds into clientelism and negativity, which are shortcomings of our system.</P>
        <P>If we had this new system, voters&rsquo; expectation of what a Deputy does would change.  The Deputy would be much more focused on policy issues, on implementing policy and on dealing with national and international issues rather than local issues.</P>
        <P>We need to think about this.</P>
        <P>Too often people only look at solutions within the constraints that exist.  I would like to think we could look beyond them to do something really radical.  An overhaul of our Constitution is very much needed to bring it up to date.  That would coincide with my proposals.  To try to make this attractive to people, I propose we trial it for two elections.  Rather than have our electoral system set in stone, we need to be flexible and respond to the needs and demands of the electorate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to speak.  I wish to make a few brief comments.  Some 30 years ago medicine, the profession in which I am involved, was as male dominated, as macho and with as long hours as politics today.  Some aspects of medicine have changed quite radically.  Surgery is still very much male dominated with long hours and with the same macho culture but other parts of medicine have changed quite radically, especially general practice and where doctors work as physicians in hospitals.</P>
        <P>How did that come about?  It did not come about because anybody wanted to change the system but because the education system put 75% women into medical schools.  Therefore, the doctors graduating were, in the main, women and the system had to change to fit in with the graduates.  That is the way it happened.  Nobody set out to change medicine to make it more family friendly.</P>
        <P>That is the main issue here.  It is not about gender; it is about who is responsible for family.  What makes many women in medicine change their career options is not that they cannot <Col N="243"/>handle the long hours and working weekends but the fact they have commitments to their family.  That is why they often go into branches of medicine which are more family-friendly.  The system only changed because of the large number of women coming into medicine.  There was no other driver.</P>
        <P>Politics is the same.  It is a macho profession and it is all about long nights, staying up all night at meetings, going to games and doing clinics.  Unfortunately, nothing will change in the foreseeable future unless we make active changes to the system.  Active changes mean changes to increase women&rsquo;s participation in politics because that will be the driver to make politics more family friendly.</P>
        <P>What happens when more women are involved in politics is that there is more discussion on social issues rather than on purely economic issues or issues which people believe are important.  The way politics is delivered changes when there is more active participation by both genders.  However, that will not happen by accident.  I do not believe the political system will change dramatically.  The only way we will effect change is by actively placing women in roles of responsibility, both elected and non-elected, in the political system.  If this is done, the ethos in politics will change significantly.  Failing this, however, there will not be any change.</P>
        <P>The use of quotas and list systems can lead to change in the system.  Rather than talking about change, however, we must proactively make changes.  Significant problems must be surmounted to achieve greater active participation in politics.  The political structure is not family friendly.  During my time as a Member of the other House I found politics an incredible burden.  I had three young children at the time and found that considerable effort was required to try to balance being a politician and a parent of young children.  In addition, my wife runs a general practice.  Politics can place incredible stress on family life.</P>
        <P>I have not noted even the remotest interest among voters or political leaders in dramatically changing the current system.  As politicians, we must try to actively encourage change.  Senator Fitzgerald indicated that change was taking place during her time on the National Women&rsquo;s Council, but we appear to have hit a brick wall.  It is time to reactivate positive action to change our mindset and ensure women will want to become involved in politics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Both of us survived our previous encounter on the high seas.</P>
        <P>This has been a fascinating and exceptionally good debate which has focused on important issues.  I concur with Senator Twomey in most of the points he made.  I have seen identical developments in teaching.  Twenty years ago, when people were arguing that teaching was about to become a female dominated profession, I remember asking what was wrong with such a scenario, as at least it would mean women would dominate one profession.  Much has changed in the meantime.  For example, no one even blinked when a woman became the general secretary of the Irish National Teachers Organisation for the first time.  That is how matters should be.</P>
        <P>The issue of quotas generates a great deal of heat and light.  I have been involved in the argument about quotas for roughly 35 years in about 25 organisations and associations.  While I do not agree with quotas as a matter of basic principle, they are critical in engineering change and needed as a transient measure to achieve a specific objective.</P>
        <P>As Senator Twomey pointed out, the Oireachtas is a male club which will not change any time soon.  If I did not live in Dublin, there is no way I would still be a Member of this House 23 years after joining it.  For as long the media argue that the Houses should sit five days a week and that sittings continue into the night, sensible people will not become involved in politics.</P><Col N="244"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The reason women did not apply for positions as principal teachers in many primary schools was that, having taken a good look at the job, they decided it was not for them.  They may have agreed that more women should become school principals, but they decided not to take up the job because it was wrong for them.</P>
        <P>While the term &ldquo;family friendly&rdquo; has become a clich&eacute;, what it means is that people should be able to have a balance in their lives.  This is not possible in politics.  One need only consider the efforts to establish a cr&egrave;che in the Oireachtas &mdash; I cannot remember if we succeeded.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was rhetorical.  I was a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission at the time and know exactly what took place.  The reason Members did not use the facility was they could not be sure when they would start and finish work.  They could not operate in the manner normal workplaces worked.  They could not, for instance, leave work at 5 p.m. or indicate that their child would be in the cr&egrave;che for a specified number of hours each day.  There is also an attitudinal problem.  The Oireachtas is a male club and will continue to be so until such time as the men here decide to change matters.</P>
        <P>Most speakers agree on the objective of increasing women&rsquo;s participation in politics, although they may differ on how to achieve it.  The answer lies within ourselves.  If we want to make changes, we can do so.  Even without quotas, we could take a strong line on how we expect people to operate and what the job involves.  I would begin with a job description for politicians.  If the Minister of State comes across such a description, perhaps she will forward it to me because I have never seen one.  The trick for a politician is the number of masses he or she covers on a Sunday and the number of funerals he or she attends on a Monday.  Rules should be established because if we do not have a proper balance in what people do as public representatives, they will effectively do a job they have not been elected to do.  The reason is that if one was to do the job one was elected to do, one would not be re-elected.</P>

	<P>It is interesting to note that the procedure for this discussion is still being batted backwards and forwards. </P>
        <P>I am pleased to address the Seanad on recent developments in banking.  Every Member of the House is aware that the banking sector is crucial to ensuring the economy can benefit from the global economic recovery under way.  The banking measures announced by the Minister for Finance prior to the Easter recess constitute the latest decisive measures to be taken to stabilise the banks and protect the interests of the taxpayer and depositors.</P>
        <P>The decisive measures taken by the Government in the past two years, including budgetary adjustments of more than &euro;15 billion, have put us in a position in which our fiscal position is credible and recognised as such by the markets and our colleagues in Europe.  It is expected the economy will start growing again in the second half of this year.  This growth will be on a more sustainable and realistic basis and the banking system must play an important role in this return to growth in order that confidence is restored, not only in our fiscal position but also in the banking sector.</P>
        <P>On the issue of growth in the economy, I recommend to the House an excellent article by the former Taoiseach Dr. Garret FitzGerald on the importance of competitiveness and the gains being made in competitiveness.  The article appeared in last Saturday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that some of the decisive and bold steps that the Government has taken are not popular, and the honest and full disclosure by the Government and its agencies of the appalling mess within our banks has shocked the nation.  The measures taken by the Government are necessary and are key to putting our financial institutions back on a sound footing in order that they can return to the business of serving the best interests of our economy.</P>
        <P>The new Financial Regulator announced on 30 March that he will require our banks to have an 8% core tier one capital ratio, of which 7% must be equity.  This is a prudent capital provision consistent with emerging international best practice.  The regulator has specified that the capital to meet these new requirements must be in place in each of the institutions by year end.  It is essential that banks in Ireland are prudently capitalised in order that they can absorb potential future losses that may arise on their loan books.  Since the regulator&rsquo;s announcement, Bank of Ireland has announced its intention to raise &euro;3.4 billion equity capital.  A total of &euro;1.7 billion of this amount will be raised from the private sector.  This will ensure the bank meets the stringent capital requirements set out by the Financial Regulator.  The strongly recapitalised bank will now be in a position to provide credit to Irish businesses and households.  This will help the economy to return to sustainable growth.  The level of private interest in investing is clear evidence of growing international and domestic confidence in both Bank of Ireland and our economy.  The Bank of Ireland capital raising is consistent with the long-stated Government preference that private market solutions to capital raising are found and implemented.  We remember views expressed both in the media and by some political parties that all our banks should be nationalised.  Recent developments have shown that the Government has called that one correctly, even though some financial institutions have had to be nationalised.</P>
        <P>As part of the transaction, the State has agreed to convert some &euro;1.7 billion of its preference shares into ordinary shares at face value or par.  The State has also agreed to sell its warrants back to the bank for &euro;491 million in cash.  This represents the profit generated on the investment over the past year.  The coupon on the remaining preference shares is also increasing from 8% to 10.25%.  This is a significant return for the State&rsquo;s investment in Bank of Ireland.  The Bank of Ireland transaction agreement with the Minister for Finance provides a legal basis for the proposed Bank of Ireland credit package.  Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s plan, which sets out how <Col N="246"/>it proposes to meet the lending targets, will be submitted to the Department of Finance by mid-May.</P>
        <P>AIB has announced its intention to dispose of various assets and to undertake equity capital raising prior to the end of 2010 with a view to meeting the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s capital requirement.  It has also agreed to submit a lending plan to the Department of Finance by mid-May.</P>
        <P>The overriding objective of the Government&rsquo;s banking policy is to ensure a healthy, functioning banking system that can meet all the needs of the economy.  These actions are a crucial step in realising this objective.</P>
        <P>The first tranche of loans have now been transferred from the participating institutions to NAMA with the exception of Anglo Irish Bank which is expected to be completed shortly.  The estimated average discount to be paid by NAMA on the first tranche of loan assets is<?oasys _jy ?>47%.  The agency expects to complete the transfer of the remaining loans from all five institutions by the end of the year or February 2011 at the latest.  In total, the agency anticipates it will purchase &euro;81 billion in loans.  The valuation process is conducted loan by loan so it is not possible to calculate the final haircut at this stage, although the 47% average haircut on the first tranche of loans is much higher than the initial estimates of 30%.  As NAMA is purchasing loan assets from banks at a significant discount, it is expected to make a profit over its lifetime.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 is a crucial step in the comprehensive programme to put in place a domestic regulatory framework for financial services which meets the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining the stability of the financial system, provides for the effective and efficient supervision of financial institutions and markets, and safeguards the interests of consumers and investors.  This represents the first of a three-stage legislative process to create a fully integrated structure for financial regulation.  It provides a statutory basis for the new structure to replace the existing Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to compare the debates on financial regulation eight years ago with those of today.  There was a strong preference at that time to separate consumer interest regulation from prudential supervision.  While one can say the results of what was chosen have been far from happy, the direction in which we are now moving is tightening rather than loosening the connection.</P>
        <P>A second Bill to be brought before the Oireachtas this autumn will enhance the powers and functions of the restructured Central Bank.  These powers deal with the prudential supervision of individual financial institutions, the conduct of business, including the protection of consumer interest, and the overall stability of the financial system.  A third Bill will consolidate the existing statutory arrangements for the Central Bank and financial regulation in the State.  This legislative programme is particularly demanding and complex but is also essential.  A sound financial regulatory regime is fundamental to a sustainable and dynamic financial services industry.</P>
        <P>Prior to the financial crisis, there was a view that the structures and systems responsible for financial regulation were effective and appropriate.  As we now know, that confidence was misplaced.  The previous regulatory system failed to prevent what we now know to have been grossly excessive and irresponsible lending to the property sector.  As a result, our most systemically important banks have had to be recapitalised, with the State acquiring a significant stake in each institution.</P>
        <P>The financial system overall has been severely shaken and customers and households are managing unprecedented levels of debt.  Nevertheless, I believe public confidence in the system of regulation put in place by the Government is growing day by day. However, wide-ranging reform is urgently required.  We need a system where the overarching objective of the stability <Col N="247"/>of the financial system informs directly the supervision of individual firms while at the same time safeguarding the interests of consumers and investors.  The Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 delivers on that clear and simple objective.  It is important it is enacted as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The ethical considerations in respect of rewards for the performance of individuals in the banks has been far from satisfactory.  Some of those rewards have been excessive.  They have shown a complete insensitivity to people in the more exposed parts of the economy.  I am glad to say there has been some recognition in the recent past that certain arrangements, while legal, were definitely not appropriate.</P>
        <P>The banks must realign their business practices with the needs of the modern economy.  The third Mazars report on lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, between October and December 2009 was published last week.  The report showed that credit applications in number and value terms rose slightly in the last quarter of 2009 over the previous quarter, which is encouraging.  The level of applications for credit appears to be stabilising and Mazars also reported a small improvement in the overall credit approval rate.  However, the reduction in the stock of credit, as repayments exceed new credit, and in credit quality reported by the banks remains a concern for the Government.  To address this concern, the Minister has directed that AIB and Bank of Ireland are to make available a minimum of &euro;3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities, including working capital targeted at SMEs, in the real economy in each of the next two years.  To ensure the proper management of these funds the two banks will be required to submit SME lending plans, both by geography and sector, for 2010 and 2011.</P>
        <P>Mr. John Trethowan, our new credit reviewer, will be reviewing bank lending policies as part of his remit.  The Credit Review Office, which Mr. Trethowan heads, is available to review banks&rsquo; decisions to refuse credit to small and medium enterprises.  It will provide an independent opinion of the banks&rsquo; decisions on whether the credit should have been granted.  SMEs can also seek a review of a decision to reduce or withdraw credit.  In addition to dealing with individual cases, the credit review system will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks in respect of SMEs.  This will help the Minister to decide what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit.  The Minister intends to publish the analysis from the review process so the performance of the banks participating in NAMA will be clear to all.</P>
        <P>I should add a comment on the farm sector, which is an important part of our economy.  Last week, the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal </i>had a three-page report on the credit situation as it applies to farmers.  My reading of that report was that the situation, while not completely satisfactory &mdash; and recognising that many people, and the supply industries, are in financial difficulties &mdash; was not an entirely black or bleak picture.  It is not a subject on which I am receiving a lot of representations from farmer constituents.</P>
        <P>The Government is conscious of the high value Irish people place on owning a home and of the huge efforts they make to secure and retain their home.  From both an economic and social policy point of view, the Government is determined to assist home owners who are in difficulty with mortgage arrears.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of developments relating to the Government&rsquo;s commitments in the renewed programme for Government dealing with protecting the family home and helping those in debt.  In February, the Minister for Finance informed the Government of his proposals regarding expanding the membership of the interdepartmental mortgage arrears group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney.  The revamped mortgage arrears and personal debt group&rsquo;s terms of reference, which the Minister has approved, reflect the commitments made by the Government both in the renewed programme for Government and in subsequent Government decisions concerning the issues of mortgage arrears and personal debt.</P><Col N="248"/>
        <P>The group has met on a number of occasions and will focus initially on bringing forward recommendations in dealing with mortgage arrears problems and will later address the personal debt issue.  The group will report and make recommendations to the Minister on a rolling basis and will submit a final report to the Minister on the mortgage arrears issue by the end of June 2010.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the mortgage arrears and personal debt group include a commitment to take account of the ESRI report on negative equity in the Irish housing market.  All estimates of the extent of negative equity appear to be based on very general economic assumptions, but it is difficult to assess realistic price levels when property market activity remains low.  Being in negative equity does not change the level of mortgage payments and the Financial Regulator has estimated that only a small proportion of borrowers with the covered institutions who are in negative equity are in arrears on their payments.</P>
        <P>Senators will be familiar with the other supports available to protect homeowners who are in difficulty.  In addition to the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s code on mortgage arrears, a number of additional support measures are in place.  These include the mortgage interest subsidy scheme.</P>
        <P>It cannot be denied that over the last 18 months, Ireland has faced extraordinary challenges.  We are, however, facing these challenges head on.  We have acknowledged the scale of our problems and we have taken the necessary actions to solve them.  The banks have been forced to recognise their losses and this Government, on behalf of the taxpayer has committed the capital that will ensure we have a banking system to serve the needs of this economy as it recovers.  The positive reaction of investors to Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s capital raising plans is a clear indication that we are on the right path, and I look forward to further positive developments in the coming months.</P>
        <P>There are undoubtedly issues and controversies relating to the international banking system.  That crisis has impacted greatly on the domestic one.  For example, in the current British general election campaign, there is intense debate about some of those issues, which may have exacerbated the sub-prime mortgage situation.  I recently received a visit from the Greek ambassador.  In addition, we also have the whole issue of the concealment of the true state of the Greek national finances, which has had knock-on effects for all members of the euro zone.  There are Members of this House who have significant knowledge and expertise not just in the area of national banking but also in international banking.  Naturally enough I do not wish to hold them responsible for things of which they may only have a branch association, but it would be useful to have contributions to the debate from those quarters.  A complaint was made to the European Commission regarding the ethics of some of the things we have put in place, like NAMA.  In addition, the conduct of office holders in the other House has been an issue here.  I hope that in the course of this and other debates, some of those issues, which I think are very important to this country, including the ethics of international banking and the response to some of the issues that have been raised in international debate, will be dealt with.</P>
        <P>There is a debate on the degree of regulation that is appropriate in light of the experience we have had.  There is also a debate around the issue of moral hazard, whereby if one has to bail out financial institutions is that not an incentive for them to behave irresponsibly in the future, with that implicit safety net.  There is also the issue of what the banks and financial institutions should themselves contribute to the potential future costs of forced State rescue operations.  All these issues need to be carefully considered.  Clearly, the answers cannot just be national &mdash; they have to be international, otherwise one is creating competitive advantage in some countries rather than others.  On many of these issues the western world has to move <Col N="249"/>in convoy.  Whether on this or another occasion, some of those issues are well worth debating as well as our own national domestic situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that when the Minister of State came off script he mentioned the issue of moral hazard.  He clearly started to play the man rather than the ball.  In his comments, the Minister of State was clearly referring to Senator Regan and Goldman Sachs.  That is rather unfortunate considering that in the speech he has just delivered, the Minister of State made no reference to the Government&rsquo;s role in causing this crisis or how Ireland has been hit hardest by it.  It seems amazing that in the last 18 months, with all the moral hazard or lack of morality that has landed us in this mess, only the Minister for Finance was man enough to tell the Irish people that he was sorry about what has happened.  Neither the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, the bankers who have been well rewarded and bailed out, nor any developers who have seen their loans and property companies moving into NAMA, felt any need to apologise to the Irish people.  This is a contributory factor to people&rsquo;s anger, particularly when Mr. McDonagh from NAMA has announced to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that he will bring the wrecking ball to developers&rsquo; fantasies throughout the country and when no apology has been offered to the people by any Minister for the mess into which the Government has got us.  It is nice of them to offer legislation, but it is too late to correct the mess.  Growth in the economy during the tenure of the last Government, up to 2007, was equivalent to the amount of money being borrowed by Irish citizens at the time, but the Minister at the time just laughed it off and found it amusing.  The Government at the time was asleep with regard to what was happening in the economy and either through hubris or lack of moral courage fooled itself into believing there was no problem and did nothing about it.  As a result, we now find ourselves in a situation where there are problems with the economy and the banking sector.  The wider EU and global economies are also an issue and have an impact, but they are not the main issue.</P>
        <P>Now that the banks have off-loaded billions of euro of their bad debts onto taxpayers, we are seeing how the economy is responding.  The Bank of Ireland off-loaded &euro;500 million in a rights issue at a discount of 15% to private investors, but such a 15% discount does not apply to the investment in the bank by the taxpayer.  At the same time, the cost to Government of borrowing on the international money markets has widened to 182 base points, the highest level since the last budget.  It is clear international money markets still have concerns about our economy, regardless of what the Minister of State had to say about the sector.  I urge the Government to respond on this.  By bailing out the banks, we are compromising the ability of the people to get out of the financial doldrums in which they find themselves.  The customers of Bank of Ireland are the same hard-pressed taxpayers who will now be sacrificed for the benefit of the bank&rsquo;s shareholders.  Interest rates on mortgages are increasing, but rates on deposit accounts are dropping.  Every 0.25% rates rise adds a significant burden to the mortgage repayments of hard-pressed taxpayers, the same people who have seen income and pension levies and increased taxes because of the mistakes made by the current and previous Governments, no member of which has felt the need to apologise.  People have noticed that the banks have now gone back to business as usual, putting up interest rates, cutting deposit rates and providing themselves with a nice pension.  The response by the Taoiseach to this attitude, having bailed them out to the tune of &euro;54 billion, is pathetic and has had a detrimental effect on how the people see the Government.  It is strange to see how the bankers have moved on so quickly, leaving the taxpayers to clean up their mess.  It is a sad reflection on the Government that it allowed this happen so easily.</P>
        <P>The future of the economy is still not secure and deflation is still happening.  When the Government talks about deflation, it sees it as something positive because in the short term, <Col N="250"/>the cost of certain services and products reduces.  However, deflation is a problem over the medium to long term because we are in the eurozone.  The only way we can get out of the economic doldrums we are in is to grow the economy.  We need to put significant growth into the economy by bringing about growth in jobs.  Inflation in the eurozone can help this by reducing the effect of the debt we are carrying.  The debt of individuals who bought a house for &euro;300,000 four years ago who now see their incomes cut dramatically and face increased taxes has a more disproportionate effect on them than a couple of years ago.  In order to get out of this situation, we must see significant growth in the economy and some inflation that will help reduce the effects of our huge debt burden.  However, the contraction in our economy is still happening.  It may not be as bad as the massive contraction that happened in the overall economy last year, but it is continuing.  Hopefully, it will come to an end.  We have turned no corners and there are no significant green shoots at this time, although it is nice to hear that job losses are decreasing and an end is coming to the contraction in our economy.</P>
        <P>We must be honest with the people.  Some Members have stood here and said they would like to hear more positive news.  One thing worse than bad news is a false dawn or false hope, such as telling the people we have turned the corner or that the recession is over and them then hearing that more jobs are being lost, that the Government deficit has grown or other bad news.  This only exacerbates their fears and anxiety and does nothing to encourage them to go out and spend to help us turn the corner.  We need to be far more honest with people.  However, I believe they are far too angry and despondent due to the actions of the Government to respond to Ministers speaking positively.</P>
        <P>The reclassification of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s loans as national debt has put us at the top of the league in the context of government deficits.  This has an immediate and potential knock-on effect on the widening of the base points between us and Germany with regard to international money markets when it comes to borrowing more money.  As the Minister of State is aware, our appetite and need for borrowing will not decrease in the next few years.  We need an open debate with the people in that regard.  We are in a hell of a financial mess.  No more than the Minister of State, I would love to be able to talk things up and to see us come out this difficulty, but we must be honest with the people.  The banking crisis is just one aspect of the current crisis and I am not as sure as the Minister of State we have come out of our difficulty so easily.  There are still major concerns with regard to NAMA and we do not know if it will make a profit.  Many people feel the project is still up in the air, whether people who have been negative about what it can achieve or those who are more impartial and have not been out to attack Government policy.  They too are concerned.</P>
        <P>External factors like those mentioned by the Minister of State also have an effect.  For example, we have the situation in Greece and Ireland&rsquo;s position with regard to Government deficit.  The Minister of State only referred briefly to other potential crises over the coming months.  He mentioned businesses and households.  Small businesses are still being squeezed and need to see a loosening on credit by the banks and the Government must be more proactive in getting credit flowing.  It is only when we see job creation and some sort of stimulus to the economy that we will have any hope of getting out of this mess.  This can be helped through a flow of credit from the banks into the economy.  One way or another, we must get credit flowing to get things going.</P>
        <P>Mortgages and personal debt are a problem.  People borrowed heavily at the peak of the Celtic tiger and most of the money borrowed is personal debt such as household debt or on second homes.  When I warned the previous Minister about the huge levels of debt being taken on by people, he said they were not just buying second homes, but third and fourth homes.  We now see where that led us.  Individuals have a product that is not making much, if anything, for <Col N="251"/>them, but they face increased repayments on the loans they have taken out and their incomes are dropping.  That means this problem could get worse in the future.  When the Minister of State is addressing all of those aspects of the economy, the role of the international economy, the role of the banking sector, the role of Government in our economy and all the potential problems that exist in our economy, we need to be more honest about what is going on because we have not a hope in hell of getting out of this in the foreseeable future no matter what happens.  However, if we start deluding ourselves that things are better than they are we will only prolong the agony and make it worse for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the opportunity to speak on the banks again.  The attempts by the Opposition to hold the Government responsible are very interesting.  It is something that Oppositions occasionally do.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly outlined the case of how sometime in the past the then Opposition spokesperson, a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, attempted to hold the then Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, personally responsible for an untaxed tractor in Schull in west County Cork.  Of course it was then and is now not the responsibility of the Government.  The Government is held accountable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a big difference between tax on a tractor and the &euro;54 billion mess about which we are talking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator Hanafin to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator could have used a better example than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to hold accountable what Opposition Members are saying.  They have made certain claims about the banking crisis.  Even the spokesperson here today claimed that during the last term in the D&aacute;il he outlined how we had a property bubble.  That being the case, why in 2007 did he support the Fine Gael manifesto that proposed the complete abolition of stamp duty, which would have thrown petrol on the fire of a property bubble?  Of course there is no answer to that.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the world economy dictates most of what happens in Ireland.  I welcome that because for years we have prepared this economy to be the third most globalised economy in the world.  If one takes out the city state of Singapore, and the special administrative area of Hong Kong we are the most globalised economy in the world.  That has stood to us for a long time because we have been able to export, earn and increase the quality of life and standard of living of the people in this country.  Of course I am very proud of the work my party has done in ensuring we were an export-led economy.  I am also very conscious that in many cases and in particular with the banking crisis, we imported a crisis.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt we could have handled whatever difficulties we had here.  We could have opted for a reduction in the construction industry.  Many of the workers would have gone back home to eastern Europe where there is now a boom of sorts.  We would have had to redirect spending towards capital projects, including roads, rail, a terminal at Dublin Airport and ports.  That would have managed the economy at that time.  That was expected and spoken about.  However, the world economy and the world financial markets were in very severe danger 18 months ago.  There was a real crisis in the financial markets.  We were probably very lucky to have in Ben Bernanke somebody who understood the difficulties that might arise at an international level and handled the difficulties accordingly.  He had knowledge of how the Great Depression was mishandled with all the wrong steps taken and how the Glass-Steagall Act stopped trade, protectionism took hold and banks were allowed fail.  That is an interesting concept, allowing a bank to fail.  To allow Lehman Brothers, which represented just 4% of the US GDP, to fail was considerably different from allowing Anglo Irish Bank, with &euro;75 billion <Col N="252"/>on deposit and more than half the Irish GDP, to fail.  It is and was recognised by all involved, including Alan Dukes, that it was essential that we bailed out Anglo Irish Bank.  It was a systemic bank to the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious that European events and European banks were also among those that fell, the effects of which reached across here.  For 17 years I worked for a building society that became a bank, First Active.  I know the Minister of State will be pleased to hear that everything was working fine when I left in 1999.  Notwithstanding that, to show how globalised the market is, First Active was purchased by Ulster Bank.  Ulster Bank was purchased by the Royal Bank of Scotland.  As we all know the Royal Bank of Scotland purchased ABN AMRO, which had &euro;22 billion of non-performing debt.  It was part of the sub-prime lending that nearly brought down the Royal Bank of Scotland.  We are no different from the UK or America, but we have handled our banking crisis well.  When we are held accountable not on the basis of knee-jerk reaction or soundbites but by what actually happened, the Government took responsibility and did its job well.  The first thing we did was to underpin the banks by giving the guarantee, an action followed by the rest of Europe, which has proved to be one of the main reasons we maintained our economy.</P>
        <P>Although we have a higher budget deficit than Greece, we are being praised for how we managed our economy and the Greeks are calling in the IMF.  An opportunity is being presented to us with the world economy now expected to recover.  There was a mini recovery in the markets earlier in the year which fizzled out because it was not believed to be sustainable.  The current recovery is believed to be sustainable and we will benefit significantly from that.  Particular banks coming out of the critical list are reaching recovery.  We have now seen banks successfully complete fund raising and have paid significant moneys back to the State.  I would like to see that continue into the future.  In my opinion AIB, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life &amp; Permanent are fully in recovery.  There is no doubt that Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society will need assistance for some time.  We were all very disappointed at the mismanagement in the banking sector and the lack of regulation.  Perhaps we should seriously look again at the level of regulation that was allowed to happen and ensure that never happens again.  Light regulation was not the answer to the Irish banking situation.  The strong regulation we have now with the direct involvement of the regulator in the insurance and banking industry can only be for the better in the long term.  It will ensure solid businesses and solid banks.  Of course we know the capital tier ratios, which the banks are now expected to hold, have been significantly increased.  The requirements are for 8% tier 1 capital ratios, 7% of which must be held in equity.  That being the case we will have well capitalised banks.</P>
        <P>There is no point in us talking about why the banks are not lending to SMEs when the next day we see in the newspapers that 30% of SMEs are already not repaying the loans they have.  It will take this recovery that is on the way.  It is a very real recovery.  The ESRI and the Central Bank of Ireland predict that the economy will begin to grow in the second half of this year.  The ESRI predicts that in 2011 gross national product will grow by 2.75%, while the Central Bank of Ireland predicts it will grow by 2.8%.  We can now look again with a different eye at the opportunities that are presenting.  Of course China will race ahead at 9%, 10% or 11% this year.  Ireland needs to look to the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China to fully exploit the growth taking place in those countries.  We note that exports have increased by 16% since December 2009.  This is in the middle of a recession.  If sustained, that increase could create 20,000 new jobs next year and 45,000 the following year.</P>
        <P>More importantly, having studied finance and economics, I know of a simple equation that has not been lost on me.  If somebody pays &euro;20 million for a field outside a small provincial town on which no building will ever take place, while that person has lost that &euro;20 million, <Col N="253"/>somebody got &euro;20 million.  It did not leave the country; it is on deposit.  There are vast sums on deposit in the State and once people feel comfortable again in their jobs, the economy and the future, they will start spending again.  If only 10% of the money on deposit was moving in the economy, we would not have needed the budget we had in December.  That is a significant figure.  When the good times come round, they lift all boats.  All sectors benefit and corporation and income tax, stamp duty and VAT all increase, in the same way they all decrease in a recession but expenditure stays the same.</P>
        <P>What must we do for the future?  We must continue what we are doing with the banking sector, we must speak confidently about the future of Irish banking because it does have a strong future, which has been borne out by the fact that Irish banking shares are increasing again and Bank of Ireland has recently been successful in raising funds.  I have no doubt AIB will be successful in its fund raising when it sells its assets in the US and Poland to ensure the Irish market is well capitalised.  The State is also ensuring the banks are starting to lend to SMEs.  That lending will be significantly easier when the environment in which business works has been improved and that improvement is taking place.  That is the reality.</P>
        <P>Regulation has been a problem.  We now live in a global economy.  The purchase of ABN AMRO by a bank in England caused banks here to stop lending.  We must have detailed security at European level and ensure our trading partners have strong regulation.  Such strong regulation must specifically focus on those banks that are of systemic importance or lend in such a manner.  I am thinking of derivatives, which are very dangerous.  In Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale in France, &euro;5 billion was lost.  That was not a white collar crime that had no consequences.  People lost their jobs.  The banks should have an &ldquo;own skin&rdquo; involvement in any trade; they do not just lose someone else&rsquo;s money, they lose their own money.  They should be heavily regulated and the amount they must have on deposit has recently been increased.</P>
        <P>That is what makes me think we are going about this the right way.  We have been correct in our attitude to the banks so far.  It has not been easy but we have done the right thing and it will stand to us.  We are moving out of the recession and that can only be good news for Ireland.</P>
        <P>This morning on the Order of Business I referred to the pensions that were being claimed in Westminster.  I should have referred to the allowances that were being claimed.  A reference was made to people claiming pensions here who were not entitled to them.  It is difficult to talk about a situation when that particular party was not in a position to speak about anyone else when he was claiming allowances he was evidently not entitled to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  It is important that we continue to have these discussions on developments in the banking sector.</P>
        <P>We should begin by defining what a bank is, as that would help us in the future.  Having banks which were too big fail in the system is what led to the huge problems in the American economy.  It was not stated in quite these terms in the Irish economy, but it led to the same outcome.</P>
        <P>In Ireland banks stopped being banks some years ago; they became financial institutions which bought building societies, stock brokering firms and insurance companies.  They were on all sides of the argument.  The consequence was that the local bank stopped being the local bank; it became a provincial office for a business director in Dublin.  They lost expertise.  I used to say there was no one in Ireland who could remember how to build a railway; therefore, it did not come as a surprise we were not building them anymore.  In the same way we have lost banking skills.  The local bank manager in a small town knew the businessman who came into his or her office to seek a loan.  He or she made an assessment of the risk and the value of the <Col N="254"/>loan to the business.  He or she made other assessments, including based on previous experience.  He or she also knew if the person concerned had been doing business in another bank in the town because bank managers knew each other and shared information.  That stopped happening.  Bank managers were under pressure to lend as much money as possible and lost the discretionary power to make decisions which were all made at the level above them.  Consequently, they did not do this anymore.  Effectively, they stopped being bankers.  We speak regularly about the importance of money being available for small and medium enterprises.  Some money is available, but the banks are afraid to lend; they can no longer make these assessments.</P>
        <P>In the last 20 years the banks have changed.  Had we been faced by this difficulty 25 years ago ACC Bank and ICC Bank had a particular focus to deal with small and medium enterprises, make funds available to them, manage the risk, manage loans and shepherd them.  There is a strong argument being made by the Labour Party for a bank to deal with entrepreneurship and the development of business.  The arguments in favour of having such a bank are strong, but I do not like the idea of a new, separate bank; I would like the banks currently operating to have stand-alone operations for this part of their business.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Why do I think this?  I go back to the small town and the role of the credit unions.  Irish credit unions have shown the value of assessing sub-prime risk.  Many commentators use the phrase &ldquo;sub-prime risk&rdquo; as if it was the worst thing in the world.  There is nothing wrong with it if the risk is managed.  If the local credit union tenders a loan to someone who failed to get one from the banks in order that he or she can put up new shelving and extend his or her shop, if the members of the credit committee pass the shop as they go to their meetings and see that the work has not been done, someone will lift the telephone to find out what is happening with the money.  There was hands on management of the sub-prime risk.  On the sub-prime risk that brought the American company down, it involved people of straw with no assets or income being signed up to pay $5,000 a year for 20 years; that instrument was then sold on for a percentage of the value and it was then sold on to someone else.  Eventually the person facing the risk had nothing to do with the original product.  Banks should be required to face a degree of the risk involved in any loans they make.  They are required to manage, shepherd and guide them.  That is hugely important.</P>
        <P>The other practice that should be ruled out is that of Goldman Sachs, which took both sides of a risk.  In other words, that organisation encouraged people to make chancy investments which it had been advised would fail.  It drew people to part with their money and as soon as the investments were set up and sorted, another part of the operation on another side of a Chinese wall put money into betting that those operations would fail, which they did.  Ultimately, Goldman Sachs took money from the failure and the people who bought in so ill-advisedly will continue to pay into negative equity for the rest of their lives, or for whatever number of years can be imagined.</P>
        <P>That is how Goldman Sachs worked.  To make matters worse, it did something it does all the time, namely, using the differences between regulations in different jurisdictions.  The instrument I described was European but Goldman Sachs channelled and routed it through the United Kingdom.  As the Minister of State will be aware, UK and Irish law puts great stress on <i>caveat emptor</i>, or buyer beware.  If one buys into a dicey operation in this country, as was proved in a major court case some six months ago involving one of the big developers, it is judged that one should have assessed the risk.  The law here says buyer beware and the consumer pays whereas in Europe there is much stronger support for the consumer.  Goldman Sachs knew that and therefore channelled this operation through the UK.</P><Col N="255"/>
        <P>We also must look for global regulation rather than having, for example, one system in the United States under the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, and another in the UK, under its most recent name, the Financial Services Authority, FSA.  That last came about because three years ago Britain decided its method of regulation was not working and set up the FSA as a new approach.  There are also the European conventions which have made great progress.</P>
        <P>I shall give the Minister of State an example concerning the quality assurance of auditors.  There has been a significant debate in banking circles during the past week on how one firm of auditors got a big job in Irish Nationwide although it had not spotted the problems in Anglo Irish.  I shall not go into that matter now because I am somewhat conflicted on it, being a member of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.  However, Europe passed a statutory directive on auditing three years ago, seeking quality assurance.  There are 28 countries in the EU and only one has not signed up to that directive, namely, Ireland.  We were brought to the European Court of Justice and found to be guilty, at fault, or whatever the word may be.  There was a report over two columns in the business pages of <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday week but nobody took any notice of it.  This will cost us money but apart from that it is a worry to me that Ireland is not leading on this.</P>
        <P>I welcome the new consultation document brought out by the Financial Regulator in recent days.  That is hugely important.  We should remember that although the focus is currently on auditing governance is the real issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reality, no matter what amount of auditing we put in place.  When auditing was established in Victorian times, the function of the auditor was described as that of a watchdog, not a bloodhound.  That is the reality.  An auditor can only deal with the information he or she is given.  If there is a lack of information, for example, where one bank does not reveal major transfers or another bank orders all its senior executives not to disclose certain fundamental facts about significant transactions, that is governance.  No auditor will ever find that.  It does not matter how strong the auditing system is if there is not good governance.  Good governance means people being confident enough to say, &ldquo;I do not actually understand this; explain it to me again&rdquo;, and, after hearing the explanation, saying, &ldquo;I still do not understand that &mdash; can you spell it out for me?&rdquo;  Until we have people like that on the boards of banks we will never make the system work.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>In these rolling, frequent but necessary debates we are having on our banking system, I believe we are beginning to see, if not the land of milk and honey, a few shafts of light to take us away from the dark dismal times we have known.  We should highlight what is being achieved while not losing the run of ourselves by pretending this journey does not have a long way to run.</P>
        <P>Many elements of policy that have been put in place are starting to have an effect and are seen to be working.  As we analyse this, and perhaps when we look at this period in retrospect, we will see that many of the arguments we have been having have been the wrong ones.  We have been focused on the wrong areas.  I believe, for example, the debate on the National Asset Management Agency will be seen to be a very misplaced debate.  As a mechanism NAMA is working and will be seen to work.  The money that will be invested in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland will return to the taxpayer because there are long-term viable futures in both banks.</P><Col N="256"/>
        <P>Where we need to take stock is in regard to the dead money going into the other institutions.  The real fault in the banking crisis we have experienced over the past three years lay in practices such as those in Anglo Irish and Irish Nationwide, especially the latter.  The sense of proportion or scale of the rottenness of its loan book, and the fact that it was not a publicly limited company but a mutual building society which brought about this type of cost to the State, is something we will find very hard to come to terms with, both financially and as we restructure our financial services system.</P>
        <P>Others will argue that the cost was brought about by the granting of the bank guarantee scheme.  I do not believe that even in retrospect will we see that as being the cause of the problem.  The right choice was made.  What we are dealing with is the scale of the problems that existed.  I am not sure there were alternative policy approaches that might have taken us out of the situation.  The fact is we had bad banks and these are being dealt with, at an appalling cost.</P>
        <P>What we need to discuss in this Chamber is what we will do in the future.  We must start to set our sights on what form a third banking force, or what is left of those banks, can take.  I postulate that it must be a viable alternative to the traditional banks there have been in this country.  It must not be a publicly limited company that maintains the elements of mutuality but puts into practice the type of philosophy that lay behind those financial institutions.  Irish Nationwide, in particular, lost sight of this.</P>
        <P>Perhaps, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole suggested, by making use of the widespread credit union movement in Ireland we will be able to offer a mutual co-operative banking alternative to people.  If we end up with a banking system made up of a number of large banks that are pale imitations of each other we will have failed to make the most of the few opportunities that exist for restructuring and making more sustainable our financial services into the future.  This will involve a number of difficult changes in most of our banks and building societies in terms of the number and type of people who will be employed.  These are difficulties we must deal with in the coming year.</P>
        <P>The announcement of the appeal for funds through Bank of Ireland and the good response it has had indicates there is a belief that we can come through this.  That said, the problems all of us have been concerned about since the start of this crisis remain to be tackled.  If, ultimately, the widespread fraud that was practised in some institutions and by key individuals is not seen to be tackled, with the identification of those individuals, their being brought through a judicial process and the necessary prosecutions effected, much of the good work that is being done will be undermined.  We must understand this essential truth if we want to bring about public confidence in the restoration of our financial services sector.  This truth must be faced as much as the need to reform our political system, which we face on a daily basis.  By one means or the other, we are collectively managing to do that.</P>
        <P>On that note I would like to think that as we have these debates on a regular basis we can continue to look forward to a future where progress is being made but the necessary questions continue to be asked.  This is not solely a Government responsibility and as there will be elections in future, there may be changes in government.  Everybody must understand that this is a responsibility that will carry on for ten or 20 years.  On that basis, if we take the right approach and make the right decisions, the progress that has been achieved can be sustained and we can return to better times.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened carefully to the speakers opposite, including the Minister of State, who started their speeches by telling us how they were satisfied or pleased that matters were starting to turn around and the position was changing.  The phrase from the Minister for <Col N="257"/>Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in the budget was that we were &ldquo;turning the corner&rdquo;.  All these phrases were used.  I sat back as I do not usually interrupt people, by and large, so I wanted to hear the examples of concrete achievement.  I address my remarks to what Senator Boyle said a few minutes ago as well.</P>
        <P>The indication was that action was beginning to bear fruit but no example is ever given.  The only instance I have heard repeated is what the Minister for Finance said on radio yesterday morning about the people who Richie Boucher met when he went to Europe last week being very happy with us.  The people Mr. Boucher had dinner with in Europe or wherever he was appear to be happy and the Minister for Finance said he was perplexed that everybody abroad seemed to be happy but nobody in Ireland is happy.  That is because the people in Ireland are facing the brunt of what is occurring.</P>
        <P>The Minister has spoken about finance ministers and other colleagues in European governments being supportive of what the Irish Government is doing.  Forgive me if I am wrong but I do not think I have ever seen a minister in the European Union criticising a colleague about anything.  What is this business about with people getting a pat on their back when they go abroad?  They seem to think that is the approval rating needed.  Of course, there is only one approval test and set of criteria by which we can meaningfully assess anything the Government is doing.  That is the kind of delivery that some of the speakers opposite, when they come to their senses, would apply to the debate; it concerns when there will be real lending available to businesses and people in the Irish economy.  There is no evidence that it has happened yet.  I am sure if the Minister could find a morsel of evidence for it he would tell us about it all the time.  There is no evidence.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to respond to some of the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.  It is almost laughable for him to come to this House speaking about the &ldquo;honest and full disclosure by the Government and its agencies of the appalling mess within our banks&rdquo;.  I cannot believe the term &ldquo;honest and full disclosure by the Government&rdquo;.  I did not know whether to laugh or cry when I heard him saying that.  What disclosure has occurred, whether honest or full?</P>
        <P>Where is the inquiry and the information for the Irish people so that we can assess what is happening?  Where is the clarity from the Government and where is the information from which any of us could make some kind of intelligent contribution to the question of Anglo Irish Bank, for example?  We can engage in rhetoric all we want &mdash; as the Minister might accuse us &mdash; but the fact is no direct and clear information has been made available to the Irish people even on something as vital as assessing the difference between letting Anglo Irish Bank go and continuing to bail it out.</P>
        <P>Mr. Alan Barrett of the ESRI, an independent commentator with an independent body who I presume commands respect on all sides of the House, was asked on radio what he thought of this vexed question of Anglo Irish Bank.  He said he was not in a position to answer the question.  It has been often said the Government holds office on trust for the Irish people, and it has no right to conceal information.  It has no right to put obstacles in the way of meaningful debate, whether in these Houses or in the public domain.  That is what the Government has continued to do.</P>
        <P>We have heard that we are turning the corner but every time an announcement is made it is the final frontier and the problem has been dealt with.  In the announcement before Easter the Minister said the latest measures were decisive.  I know the Minister must put something into his speeches that sounds halfway intelligible or interesting but people are reeling from <Col N="258"/>those announcements.  That is the level of people&rsquo;s response.  There is no notion of people being impressed that the Government has taken what the Minister calls decisive action.</P>
        <P>I will speak to the announcement on Bank of Ireland.  There will be an attempt to characterise contributions like this as negative but if there is some evidence that what happened with Bank of Ireland last week and announced yesterday represents progress, I would have no difficulty in putting politics aside and welcoming it.  I would say it is good for the country and banking system, and we will now see some change.  However, the speech of the Minister of State and his senior Minister is that the strongly recapitalised bank will now be in a position to provide credit to Irish businesses and households.  We should note the language.</P>
        <P>That is not what representatives of the bank say.  They characterise the measures last week as providing a strong capital foundation to support the bank&rsquo;s future growth and assist in its prudent disengagement from State guarantees.  The priority of Bank of Ireland is to unshackle itself from State involvement, which I remind everybody went up this week rather than down.  There is a celebration of what happened with Bank of Ireland but the Government has purchased over &euro;12 billion in loans from that bank, with only approximately &euro;5.5 billion performing, for almost &euro;8 billion.  The State has had to take action with Bank of Ireland, which as we know is the healthiest of the banks that the State is dealing with.</P>
        <P>It is not as if something suddenly happened and the State had to intervene in the way it has.  The Minister of State indicated earlier that he had listened to the Opposition and various other commentators, saying that a certain Opposition party &mdash; he was not sure which &mdash; had said all our banks should be nationalised.  I invite the Minister of State to tell us which party he had in mind.  If the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, were here I would ask him to indicate who he had in mind when he said yesterday that there were people in the Opposition advocating that the whole system be nationalised.</P>

If one is looking for the ruination of our economy, one need not go much further than the culture of secrecy and the lack of transparency within the banking system.  Thankfully, it is being addressed by people who have been given teeth to do so.  We will debate the Central Bank Reform Bill in the coming days.  It will give legal effect to the two positions to which I referred.</P><Col N="261"/>

It is not necessarily a vote of confidence in the bank but in the country.

They lied so much so that it could enter the eurozone, which has us in our current state.</P>

The German Minister for European affairs, Dr. Werner Hoyer, stated: &ldquo;I think there is a deeply rooted trust and confidence in this country&rsquo;s ability to sort out its problems . . . There is a fundamental belief that the Irish are going to solve it.&rdquo;  This is what we should be discussing in these Houses.

If there are green shoots of recovery and everything is turning around, the Minister of State gave no examples in his speech, which I read.  I join other Senators in saying that it is a bit disingenuous of him to discuss ethics and morality when those of the higher level of the banking profession have been lost.  We found them in the tent at the Galway races.  Mr. Fingleton was a guest of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Galway tent.  What was he doing in there?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the type of cosy cartel that has us where we are today.  Perhaps there are people in Fianna F&aacute;il who are embarrassed by the link between some bankers and members of the Government during the past 13 years.  They should be.  The failed policy has brought us to where we are.</P>
        <P>People discuss stopping the blame game, but that game must be out there if we are to learn how to move forward.  The banks lost the run of themselves.  There was no regulation.  The former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, must also be held to account.  A failed Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats ideology has driven us to this point.</P>
        <P>I told a number of my friends who are business people that the Seanad would be debating the banks today.  To a person, they told me that they could not do business.  They can lodge their money at 3.50 p.m. every day and they must pay for everything, including cheques and back-dated statements.  They told me the banks were impossible to deal with and would not do business.</P>
        <P>I know of people who have overdrafts.  As the Minister of State knows, the pendulum swings.  People have credit one week.  The next, when they are pushed to the maximum levels of their <Col N="262"/>overdrafts, their bank manager rings them to ask them to come in and discuss term loans.  The purpose of NAMA and the recapitalisation of the banks is, to use a great phrase, to allow liquidity to flow to small and medium-sized enterprises.  Like Senator Alex White, I know this is not occurring.  Bank charges and mortgage rates are all increasing.  People owe money.</P>
        <P>The banks have suddenly woken up to the light and decided that they do not want to get stung or be left holding the baby.  What are they doing?  They are passing everything on to the ordinary person struggling to survive.  All Government comment on this issue is to the effect that we must increase our exports, expand our manufacturing base and develop the smart economy.  However, the banks will not lend money and are putting the squeeze on ordinary people.</P>
        <P>I welcome Mr. Elderfield&rsquo;s comments, both in general and those he made at the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs.  He has indicated that he requires additional staff.  His admission in this regard indicates that when compared to the position internationally, the system of banking regulation in this country is not being enforced to an appropriate standard.</P>
        <P>Is the Government which is led by Fianna F&aacute;il going to give the banks an easy ride or a free pass?  Mr. Fingleton still owes &euro;1 million.  Last week Mr. Boucher was about to be given a &euro;1.5 million top-up in respect of a pension that will realise over &euro;300,000 per year.  In what world do these people live?  What society can sustain the payment of that type of retirement package to a person who, with his colleagues in the banking sector, got us into the mess in which we find ourselves?  Ordinary taxpayers are upset by the fact that the Government is bailing out the banks and that it is they who will be obliged to shoulder the burden of payment.  The people want the banks to lend money, jobs to be created, the lifeblood of the economy restored and those who caused this mess to be held to account in the strongest way possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the previous speaker on how the banks have behaved.  In short, they have behaved in an appalling manner.  The public will be obliged to foot the bill for bailing them out.  It is important to bear in mind, however, that a new Governor of the Central Bank and a new Financial Regulator have been put in place.  In addition, new legislation to support the activities of these two individuals is due to come before the House next week.  The legislation to which I refer will ensure there will be no light touch regulation in the future of the banking system.  From now on, that system will be properly capitalised and will, as should be the case, be run in a proper way.</P>
        <P>The previous system of lending money to people should not come back into play.  In recent years the banks became extremely irresponsible.  If someone sought a mortgage, he or she obtained 90% or 100% and was also given extra in order that he or she might purchase a new car or take a holiday.  That was ridiculous; it would never have been possible to sustain such a system of lending.  When the situation relating to the banks has been dealt with, we will owe &euro;32 billion or thereabouts.  There is, however, light at the end of the tunnel because important sectors of the economy are showing strong signs of recovery.  That is a welcome development.</P>
        <P>I defend the action the Government has taken to get the banking system back on track.  Two years ago everything was disintegrating and the Government was attempting to hit a moving target.  It did two things: first, it introduced the guarantee scheme; second, it established NAMA.  We would never have come to know what the banks actually owed if the latter had not been set up.  The banks came clean on the basis that they were obliged to do so in order that they might transfer loans to NAMA.  That is the only reason they revealed the actual position.  Representatives of the banks appeared at successive committee meetings and told lies.  They stated they did not want our money and that they would rather die than accept it.  Suddenly, however, they were obliged to admit that they were broke.  As a result, taxpayers are being obliged to bail them out.</P><Col N="263"/>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind that the Bank of Ireland put on a good show in recent days.  The fact that it is raising private investment shows that there is international confidence in the economy and the way the Government has reacted to the banking crisis.  The European Union, the United Kingdom and elements of the international financial markets are convinced that the banking system in this country is now properly structured and being supported by the Government.  The private sector is prepared to invest money in our new banking system.</P>
        <P>We must ensure the banking system will be competitive.  It cannot be the case that, ultimately, only two major banks will remain.  There must be at least four or five banks.  The position must be the same as that which obtains in respect of insurance companies.  In the interests of the economy, it is vital to ensure there will be a good, competitive banking system in place and that money will be lent, not for the purchase of luxury goods but for the right reasons.</P>
        <P>In the United Kingdom the banks that have been nationalised are prepared to accept 40p in the pound in respect of personal debt.  Banks in this country could take in much more money if they accepted 40 cent in the euro.  There is probably &euro;35 billion they could obtain in this way which they might not otherwise obtain.  I do not refer to those involved with NAMA in this regard, but rather to those who have personal credit issues.  On personal credit, there will be a further downgrading and the banks should begin to try to take in some of the money to which I refer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The banking sector is constantly changing.  It has certainly changed a great deal since this matter was last debated in the House.  While I welcome Mr. Boucher&rsquo;s decision not to retire at 55 years which would have necessitated the payment of &euro;1.5 million into his pension fund, I must question why the board of Bank of Ireland rubber-stamped a deal of this nature in the first instance.  Ordinary citizens are obliged to ask whether the people concerned live on the same planet.  Have those to whom I refer learned anything from the largesse, extravagance and mistakes of the past?  What were the public directors of the bank doing when these decisions were made?  How could the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance allow such a situation to develop?</P>
        <P>Following yesterday&rsquo;s announcement, the State&rsquo;s shareholding in Bank of Ireland will increase to 36.5% and the Government will retain the right to appoint 25% of the board of directors.  Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to appoint further public interest directors to the board of Bank of Ireland?  I am aware of the fiduciary duties of the bank in respect of public interest directors.  However, people have an expectation that the individuals concerned will be given specific riding instructions by the Minister and his Department in order that the public interest will be represented at all times.  Surely, that is why these directors were appointed in the first instance.</P>
        <P>What is the position on AIB?  The Government has capitalised the Bank of Ireland to the tune of 36%.  When will we be informed about the plans relating to AIB?  Surely, it will be necessary to increase the State&rsquo;s shareholding in this institution to a level above 50%.</P>
        <P>The boards of these institutions have still not been cleared out.  There are still people on them and in top management positions who sit comfortably in their jobs, despite the fact they presided over, to put it mildly, reckless practices.  All these people must be rooted out and replaced sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>I wish to turn to the European Union and its recent rulings in respect of NAMA.  Does the Minister of State envisage amending the NAMA legislation in view of the European Union&rsquo;s concerns?  For instance, what is the position with regard to vesting orders and what effect will the rulings in this area have on the NAMA legislation?  Moreover, how will the ruling on what the Revenue Commissioners can and cannot disclose affect the NAMA legislation?  These areas require clarification and there is a need for complete transparency on such issues.  The Minister of State should address these questions at the conclusion of the debate this evening.</P><Col N="264"/>
        <P>The Financial Regulator also has made proposals regarding the fitness and competence of directors and management of banks and financial institutions, as well as in respect of corporate governance, and I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in this regard.  In addition, what is the position with regard to the third force in Irish banking, as previously advocated by the Minister?  What is now envisaged in this regard, as not much has been heard about it from the Minister recently?  The Anglo Irish Bank debacle and whether it should be wound up must be debated in this House.  It is crucial that all the facts and figures are laid before Members to enable them to make an informed decision on this issue, which will have far-reaching consequences for generations to come.  The Government and the board of Anglo Irish Bank have not chosen to share with Members the basis on which they concluded that keeping the bank going is the least expensive option for the State.  I believe the European Commission&rsquo;s ruling changes the goalposts in this regard.  As a piece in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> stated, the European Commission&rsquo;s ruling &ldquo;has some bearing on the cost benefit analysis and in the interests of transparency some sort of clarification would be welcome&rdquo; on this issue.  I hope such clarification will be forthcoming this evening.</P>
        <P>In particular, in addition to those accountants and solicitors who represented developers and banks, the role of auditors also must be scrutinised and I do not subscribe to the proposition that their own professional bodies should investigate any malpractice in this area.  That is akin to saying one is going to court with the devil and the jury is from hell.  It is taking a long time to bring people to court for their apparent fraudulent practices but all the so-called professionals who bent and broke the law must eventually be called upon to account for their actions.  While the law must take its course, there is no doubt but that public patience is wearing thin in this regard.  I hope the Minister of State will answer the pertinent questions I have raised this evening in a comprehensive manner.  I refer in particular to those pertaining to the European Union rulings, on which he made little comment in his speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and welcome the opportunity to continue this debate on this important issue.  At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the sheer white fury that exists on the part of ordinary members of the public with regard to the banking situation, banks and bankers.  I am conscious of the thousands of front-line employees in banks who do the best they can and who perhaps have felt the brunt of this discontent and anger but it is not to them that I make reference.  Rather, I make reference to the horrendous economic situation in which we have found ourselves over the past 18 months.  Undoubtedly, given the international factors, we would have been exposed to very difficult times but it is clear the reckless and irresponsible actions that have been undertaken by some banks, driven by greed, have exacerbated our problems and have exposed us to incredible damage.  They have exposed ordinary families and individuals to incredible anguish, worry and anxiety, whereby they face the threat of losing their family home, of not being able to maintain their payments or even becoming concerned by the thought of a son or daughter returning home from school with a request for funding to go on a day trip.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, however, the actions that have been taken by the Government to restore banking also are essential.  Functional banks are essential to a functional economy and we have no choice.  However, I suggest an incredible lack of sensitivity has been shown by those who operate banks for the sensitivities of the members of the public who are feeling the brunt in this regard.  I refer, for example, to the contemptuous pay rise awarded before Christmas by one bank to its employees.  Although this bank had come to the State seeking financial assistance, when everyone else was being asked to take cuts, not only did it not do so, it actually intended to award pay increases.  Moreover, I refer to one of the two main Irish banks and not to Anglo Irish Bank.  Consequently, I call on the banks to demonstrate some sensitivity, appreciation and gratitude to the taxpayer for the support they are receiving.</P><Col N="265"/>
        <P>Small and medium-sized enterprises also are essential to our recovery but the banks now have swung to the other extreme in that whereas previously they had any amount of money to hand out, they now have none.  Not only are they withholding credit but they are withdrawing credit facilities with the result that small and medium-sized businesses are experiencing real difficulties in surviving.  I do not ask any bank to give good money after bad but all Members can provide examples of viable businesses that simply need to be able to maintain their overdrafts or that may need to access a small loan.  For this reason, I welcomed the measures that were recently announced and I welcome the additional funding in the form of the &euro;12 billion that will be provided by AIB and Bank of Ireland.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate whether the aforementioned banks yet have submitted plans as to how they intend to support the small and medium-sized businesses as they are required to do.  I understand the requirement was that they would submit such plans to the Department of Finance within six weeks.  Moreover, I welcome the credit review that will give an opportunity to anyone who has been refused credit.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On that issue, the credit review obviously is restricted to small and medium-sized businesses but I wish to speak briefly about families that face mortgage difficulties.  I welcome the code of practice that has been put forward by the banks and the prohibition for 12 months on any action to repossess homes.  However, the third point of the banks&rsquo; code of conduct states that where reasonable agreement can be reached between the mortgage holder and the bank, the latter will agree to it.  I request that a form of recourse should be put in place for those mortgage holders whose reasonable offers are declined by their banks.  While the credit review is in place for business people, no similar measure exists for a mortgage holder who runs into difficulty and puts forward a proposal to the bank only to receive a response indicating the bank will not accept the proposal.  At that point, there is nowhere else to go for the mortgage holder.  There is no recourse, no independent appeal process and no independent review for the mortgage holder.  Consequently, I ask the Minister of State to consider putting in place such a mechanism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on banking.  When one considers the banks over the past ten or 15 years, they have behaved abominably towards the people who invested in them and towards those who carried out their ordinary banking business through them.  A number of years ago, an issue arose in respect of foreign address accounts, whereby people were caressed into investing in such accounts by the banks.  Yet the banks have walked away scot free.  Shareholders and taxpayers have taken the hit.  Previously the ordinary person who invested in foreign address accounts, at the behest of the bank, were taken to the cleaners and the Government has let the banks off scot free.  All the banks are still in place &mdash; none of them has gone bust.  Anglo Irish Bank has been rescued by the taxpayer and probably the Irish Nationwide Building Society will also be rescued.  AIB and the Bank of Ireland and their personnel are walking away scot free.</P>
        <P>I previously asked where it all went wrong.  I have put forward my views, but the Government has not said where it believes matters went wrong.  It has blamed the crisis on a global issue.  Surely we have to examine our position.  We have to examine how taxes were raised, the amount of tax that was being collected from housing and property transactions and capital gains.  Surely the Department of Finance must have seen that matters were going out of kilter during the past four or five years.  They must have seen that, otherwise we need a drastic change in the Department of Finance.  We should own up to this.  We should put on record what was the thinking in the Department in this respect because matters went massively out of kilter.  Our economy was skewed and taxes were derived from construction, development and building.  We should have some statement from the Minister on this.</P><Col N="266"/>
        <P>Anglo Irish Bank was the greatest disaster to hit this country because it helped fuel the economy.  It drove AIB, Bank of Ireland, Irish Nationwide Building Society and others into competition.  They had to seek new business.  They had to find new ways of finding money, selling money and putting money into the economy.  I said in this Chamber about 12 years ago that there were too many financial institutions in this country and I was laughed at.  People said we needed competition, but it is unregulated competition that has put us where we are today.  In Castlebar, from where I come, there are 14 places where one can get, borrow or invest money.  Surely it was and is unsustainable for a town the size of Castlebar, with a population of 12,000 to 14,000, of which there are many similar sized towns throughout the country, to have that number of financial institutions trading in money.  There is no question about it.  One cannot have 14 or 15 of the most valuable pieces of property in small towns such as Castlebar competing against each other.  That must be examined.</P>
        <P>I feel very sorry for ordinary people, whether they work in the public or private sector, who had wage increases during the past number of years and then had their wages drastically cut during the past year and half.  They had budgeted for extra mortgages, perhaps for a second home, a new car or the security of their family in making provision for third level education.  Those people are now under enormous pressure and something will have to be done for them.  The mortgages these people have in most cases are enormous.  If a general election was called, we would hear some concrete proposals from the Government side but as of now it does not have any proposals.  The Minister must examine the provision of long-term mortgages, whether they be 50 or 90 year mortgages.  I urge the Minister to examine if 50 or 90 year mortgages could be introduced.  Such mortgages have been introduced in some countries.  Spain has recently examined the introduction of them.  I do not see any reason that cannot be done here for the hard-pressed people who are under enormous pressure trying to provide for their families, for education provision and so forth.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Burke asked where it all went wrong.  That reminds me of a good story about George Best, but I do not have time to go into it.</P>
        <P>To some extent, this is a good news story with regard to the recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland.  It means Bank of Ireland made fewer mistakes and was perhaps prudent &mdash; although that is probably not the right word to associate with banking given the fiasco that occurred during the past decade &mdash; or a bit more responsible than some of its competitors.  They fact that it will raise this funding from the market and that this measure is oversubscribed is good.  There are a few issues that arise.  The amount being raised is &euro;3.4 billion, &euro;2.8 million net, which leaves a gap of &euro;600,000 and I wonder what that gap will cover.  I know there are certain costs attached to these, but I hope it is not only fees and costs that make up that figure.</P>
        <P>In terms of the overall structure, the National Pension Reserve Fund is right to follow its investment by not allowing it to be diluted.  That is good and it is in the interests of the return to taxpayers.  It also underlines the good decision made by a former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, when Minister for Finance, in setting up the National Pension Reserve Fund.  Were it not for those moneys we would be in rag order in trying to deal with the current banking crisis.</P>
        <P>I very much favoured the structure that the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, put on this initially.  It was akin to what Warren Buffett did through Berkshire Hathaway when they invested in Goldman Sachs.  He put in his investment in shares but he also took a very significant stake in warrants and they would yield a good deal of money.  I am questioning the wisdom at this time of cashing in the warrants.  Perhaps it was necessary as part of the restructuring but it might have been possible for the warrants to be exercised at a later date.  Bank shares in Bank of Ireland will probably continue to rise quite significantly in the medium term and we could have got multiples of our investment because I am sure there was a price at which we could have exercised them.  That is a point on which I want to hone in.</P>
        <P>There is a need to examine the margins expanding within the banks because in respect of many people there will be collateral damage, which in turn will reflect on the banks and on their funding in the future.  People who got mortgages will find it extremely difficult to meet their repayments at present and that will magnify when the margins increase.  We should be getting the benefit of the ECB rate, which we are not getting, and I question that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Walsh for sharing his time.  I am conscious of the challenges facing small and medium sized enterprises.  For all businesses access to funding is highly restricted.  A recent survey by ISME indicated a refusal rate of 55% among companies which had made loan or overdraft requests in the three months to February.</P>
        <P>The new funding arrangements announced by the Minster for Finance are an attempt to regenerate enterprise in the country.  I would like to focus on the first two of them, the first being the new lending requirements for AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said in his speech in the D&aacute;il on 30 March 2010, that his overriding concern throughout this financial crisis has been to make credit available to viable small and medium businesses, sole traders and farm enterprises.  As of 30 March the Minister has imposed new lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland of &euro;3 billion each for 2010 and 2011.  This will mean &euro;6 billion this year and &euro;6 billion next year.  This new lending target must include funds for working capital for businesses.  Bank of Ireland and AIB are to submit, within six weeks of the 30 March announcement, small and medium-sized enterprise lending plans for 2010 and 2011.  These lending plans must consider geographical and business sector spread.</P>
        <P>The second initiative taken by the Minister is the new credit review process.  This new credit review office was established by the Minister on 30 March and the Government has appointed Mr. John Trethowen as head of the office.  As credit reviewer, he will examine the bank&rsquo;s lending policies and practices.  Applications for credit reviews are invited from borrowers who <Col N="268"/>have already undertaken an unsuccessful appeal to the bank through the bank&rsquo;s own internal appeals process and who believe the bank&rsquo;s decision is unjustified.  The banks currently participating in the credit review process are AIB, Bank of Ireland, EBS, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Those not included are Ulster Bank, Bank of Scotland Ireland and National Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>The bottom line of these changes is that if a company has been refused lending by a bank and if the credit review processor accepts it is not a high risk, the company &mdash; the sole trader, the farmer or whatever &mdash; can go to another bank and say the credit review processor said it is not a serious risk.  I hope this will deliver the goods.  Many people are sceptical but I believe this could be the beginning of green shoots appearing in the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate I am in injury time so I will be brief.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to speak.  I welcome the Minister of State and genuinely wish him and his Government colleagues well in trying to put structures in place which will make our banks work again, because we need to ensure there is a strong credit line and that the banking system is repaired.  We cannot have an economy and economic activity without a properly functioning banking system.  We have had many debates on the banking and financial crises, and we will need to continue to have more substantial debates.</P>
        <P>I refer to what Senator Mary White said.  I hope this credit review mechanism works because small business people, farmers and industrialists throughout the country are literally being shut down for the want of credit.  The expectation was that once NAMA and the new structures were in place, credit would be made available.  The Minister of State would have to concede that strong political signals were given during the NAMA debate that it was a first step towards ensuring credit would flow again.  The NAMA piece of the equation has been put in place but credit has not yet been seen.  We desperately need to see a return of credit facilities to enterprises and businesses.</P>
        <P>As I said recently, all our policies must be about job creation.  All legislation and regulations must have as their benchmark whether they will create jobs.  The NAMA and banking solution measures which the Minister of State and his colleagues are putting in place must be stress tested against that benchmark as to whether they will create jobs.  Unfortunately, jobs have not been created to date.  They are being lost because credit is still not available.</P>
        <P>I refer to householders, or mortgage holders, with unprecedented debt levels.  With the reduced level of economic activity, major job losses and major losses in disposable income, mortgage holders face a crucial point in their ability to repay their mortgages.  There is genuine fear among people &mdash; I know that is an often used phrase &mdash; that their houses will be repossessed.  It is much too simplistic to talk about NAMA for householders.  If life were that simple, we would have no problems.  The Minister of State and his Government colleagues must urgently try to put in place a workable scheme whereby people will be content their houses will not be repossessed and that there is a possibility of light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
        <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach suggested longer-term mortgages, which happens in a number of countries.  I am sure there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to the mortgage crisis.  Shortly, tens of thousands of people will have mortgages worth hundreds of thousands of euro on houses worth perhaps only &euro;100,000.  We desperately need to start to talk about those people and their problems.</P>
        <P>There is an old phrase that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  Every second person seems to be an expert on banking.  However, we need to have a robust and sensible debate.  We all must start from the point that we need a workable banking system.  I wish the Minister of State and his colleagues well.  I have grave doubts about what is happening but we need to continue the debate.  Will the Minister of State keep at the top of the agenda mortgage holders <Col N="269"/>who are desperately worried about their future and that of their families?  We need to keep people in their homes.  There is no other way out of this crisis but we must at least ensure people&rsquo;s homes are not repossessed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The financial and economic challenges have brought us all to a new level of deep concern and crisis.  The current banking crisis is different in nature from anything we have ever experienced before in this country.  It has enormous consequences and it is far-reaching and total.  It is felt everywhere and it fuses through every sector of our community.</P>
        <P>The public is anxious.  It knows it is not directly responsible and yet it is being asked to support difficult measures.  Certain actions by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, have hurt almost all of us in some form or fashion.  However, the Minister and the Minister of State have amassed great admiration at home and abroad for the difficult decisions they have taken.</P>
        <P>The global credit meltdown and the changing economic landscape have resulted in testing financial times for almost everyone.  The past few years have, at the very least, been trying if not downright scary.  Dramatic falls in house prices, pay cuts and increased unemployment have created difficult financial pressures on a sizeable proportion of the population.  I concur with much of what speakers said about home mortgages.  Many people have witnessed their personal wealth diminish, not only mortgage holders but people who invested in property, pension funds and so on.  Their burden of indebtedness has escalated.  While insecurity of income and employment are not one&rsquo;s own fault, when a number of calamities happen outside one&rsquo;s control, it is easy to see oneself as a victim.</P>
        <P>There are many variables and matters of opinion currently.  Fundamentally, the issue is how we got ourselves into this position and how we find a solution out of it.  There are many reasons to be optimistic, regardless of one&rsquo;s current circumstances.  A path to recovery is being laid by this Government.  Its decisions to date have proved to be the correct decisive decisions and that has been said at home and internationally by many eminent people.</P>
        <P>We all want the ability to cope without becoming negative and surrendering.  We need to be resilient to deal with adversity and we need the confidence and skills to address the difficulty, whatever it may be, and the ability to recover and take on the new challenges.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Government continued success in what now looks to be the turning point and in giving us the leadership necessary at this time.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators who contributed to this debate.  I will try to be reasonably brief in reply.  Not for the first time I was a bit taken aback by the extreme pessimism expressed by the Fine Gael finance spokesman.  He said there was not a hope in hell of getting out of this in the foreseeable future, regardless of what happens.  I do not accept that bleak perspective and also very much doubt if the Senator&rsquo;s party accepts it.  I presume Fine Gael believes that if it was in government, it would have some hope of getting out of the situation.  Developments in Bank of Ireland show an ability to bounce back.  My personal belief is that the bounce-back, when it occurs, will be quicker and stronger than anyone credits.  Without going into detail at this stage, the Government believes the State secured a good deal in its arrangements with Bank of Ireland. </P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole always makes a most interesting contribution.  He and several other Senators referred to the problem of banks not lending.  The Minister for Finance, in his statement on 30 March, directed Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland to make available a minimum of &euro;3 billion in each of the next two years for new or increased credit facilities, including working capital targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises in the real economy.</P><Col N="270"/>
        <P>I was asked where I was when much of the irresponsible lending took place.  As many are aware, I was in this House.</P>
        <P>I was also asked a question about Allied Irish Banks.  As I noted, the bank must submit a lending plan by mid-May.  A few years ago all of us had experience of banks pushing loans, credit cards, etc. at us and suggesting we borrow this or that.  An issue not often raised in public debate, one on which there is no disagreement across the House, is that the media, in their various supplements, also engaged in a tremendous hype of the property boom and bubble.  They show no sign of acknowledging co-responsibility.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>On 30 March life changed dramatically for people in Enniskillen, Navan, Blanchardstown, County Cavan and neighbouring counties.  Thousands of individuals and their families were plunged into uncertainty about their future following the hasty and undue action taken by the Financial Regulator to have provisional joint administrators appointed by the High Court to Quinn Insurance Limited.  This action was taken without notice being given to the company.  Four weeks to the day since the decision was taken, it is apparent that in excess of 1,000 jobs hang precariously, threatened increasingly by the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s refusal to permit Quinn Insurance to engage in a meaningful way in the United Kingdom market.  The minor respite allowed in respect of the provisional driver UK market, while welcome, is not sufficient to safeguard the jobs in question.  This market segment equates to only 10% of the UK business.</P><Col N="272"/>
        <P>Most, if not all, insurance customers of the Quinn Group report satisfaction and better value that enables them to keep costs down and continue a viable business.  The jobs we seek to maintain are not only those in Quinn Insurance but also those made possible by the competitive access to insurance facilitated by the presence of Quinn Insurance in the market.  Individual companies have stated this publicly.</P>
        <P>I am asking for every possible step to be taken to preserve and secure these crucial jobs, and to give reassurance to those families who do not know what the future holds and who now are facing anguish in respect of their homes, their bills and their children.  The most crucial step that can immediately be taken is for Quinn Insurance to be allowed to resume its place in the UK market immediately.  Whatever steps need to be taken to ensure proper practice must be taken.  Perhaps it is here that the Government can provide practical help.  Action to secure and preserve the jobs at Quinn Insurance is not just necessary for the retention of those jobs, it is also essential for all the additional jobs in many other areas as a direct result of these jobs.  I cannot stress enough how urgent it is for Quinn Insurance to be allowed to trade in further business lines in the Northern Ireland and British markets.  Every hour is crucial.  Every day is a lost opportunity.  I support fully the request of the employees that this access to the British market be finalised in a satisfactory manner with the utmost urgency.  The Quinn group continues to provide employment, employment opportunities and economic development in some of the most marginalised areas of the country.  These jobs are largely irreplaceable.  Many people were afforded the opportunity to return to their native county to work and raise families.</P>
        <P>Before the intervention of the Financial Regulator, Quinn Insurance had plans to create another 630 jobs over the next three years on top of the 1,430 who currently supply export services into Britain and Northern Ireland.  It also expected to create another 90 jobs as a result of increased business in the Republic of Ireland over the same period.  That is 720 jobs in the next three years in the insurance company.  The Quinn Group has planned the creation of another 300 full-time jobs in various other divisions, including new product lines.  That comes to more than 1,000 new jobs in the next three years in addition to the 7,000 existing jobs, 5,500 of which are on this island.  These proposed new full-time positions do not count the construction elements which would employ significant numbers of personnel during construction.  The overall impact of the group is immeasurable.  Therefore, the consequences of any actions which might threaten the survival of part of or the entire Quinn group is too calamitous to contemplate.  It would be Armageddon for counties Cavan, Fermanagh and Leitrim.  It would have a catastrophic economic and social effect on the entire island of Ireland.  In essence, Cavan would be plunged back to the 1970s, if not indeed the hungry 1950s.</P>
        <P>I know personally a large percentage of the employees in the company&rsquo;s headquarters in Cavan and they are very skilled, capable and committed workers.  They want to remain in employment.  They must not be denied that opportunity.  I urge the Minister to provide some peace of mind to those thousands of families and to County Cavan which is fearful for its very survival.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The Quinn group is a major employer in Ireland and Northern Ireland and we are all very anxious to see a satisfactory outcome to the current situation.  The Government is obviously concerned about the employment situation and about the Quinn group generally.  That is why the parties involved must continue to work to find a solution that addresses the issues of putting the company back on a sound commercial and financial footing.  This is the best way of protecting jobs and it is in the wider interests of the taxpayer.</P><Col N="273"/>
        <P>Quinn Insurance was established in 1996 and is the largest Irish-owned general insurer.  The Quinn group employs more than 6,000 people directly in its worldwide operations across a number of countries and encompasses a wide range of activities, including financial services, glass, building products, radiators, plastics, property and hospitality.  Approximately 1,800 people are employed in Quinn Insurance in Ireland, with a further 650 employed in the UK, including Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Quinn group is a valuable part of the Irish enterprise base.  It contributes to our economy through direct and indirect employment, through its spend on Irish materials and services, and through capital investment and tax revenues generated by employment and corporate taxes.</P>
        <P>The appointment of the administrators, pursuant to the Insurance (No. 2) Act 1983, to take over the management of Quinn Insurance was taken in the best interests of the firm&rsquo;s policyholders.  The appointment will allow the firm to remain open for business and to continue to be run as a going concern with a view to placing it on an ongoing sound commercial and financial footing.  I have been advised by the Department of Finance that one of the major concerns of the administrators has been to try to ensure the value of the business is maintained to make it as attractive as possible to potential buyers.  The key factor here is the reopening of profitable parts of the UK business.</P>
        <P>The first step has now been taken, as the Financial Regulator has modified the direction issued to Quinn Insurance to permit the company to underwrite motor insurance cover for provisional driving licence holders in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.  This took effect from 21 April.  The Financial Regulator took this decision after careful consideration and analysis of information provided by the administrators about important improvements in the company&rsquo;s underwriting model and a significant strengthening of its pricing structure.  The Financial Regulator consulted closely with the UK Financial Services Authority prior to making its decision.  It is hoped that further lines of business can be re-opened soon.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has supported the Quinn group over the past four years by providing grant support towards the creation of new jobs in Ireland and promoting the company&rsquo;s international growth.  Enterprise Ireland continues to support the Quinn group through this difficult period.  The chairman and chief executive met the senior management of the group earlier this month and there has been ongoing contact.  Enterprise Ireland will provide all possible support to the company with a view to maintaining the maximum number of jobs.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that these are difficult times for everyone involved with the Quinn group.  I am conscious of the effect the uncertainty has on the workers involved and their families as well as on the communities in which they live.  I assure everyone that the State agencies will give every support they can to Quinn employees to make this business viable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  He stated that one of the reasons the administrators were appointed pursuant to the Insurance (No. 2) Act 1983 was to: &ldquo;allow [it] . . . to continue to be run as a going concern with a view to placing it on an ongoing sound commercial and financial footing&rdquo;.  How in the name of God can the administrators run this business as a going concern when they are prevented by the Financial Regulator from underwriting new business in Britain and Northern Ireland?  He also prevented them from renewing existing business.  A total of 55% of Quinn Insurance business is in the UK, while 95% of the workforce is in this country.  When the Financial Regulator tied the hands of the administrators by preventing them from underwriting insurance cover in the UK, it affected the business and more than 1,400 individuals who are in danger of losing their jobs.  One does not have to be an expert economist to realise that if one cuts off the supply funds, they will eventually run out.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to thank all of my Oireachtas colleagues in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan who have worked so hard for the past month, since news came that the Financial <Col N="274"/>Regulator was going to the High Court to seek the appointment of provisional joint administrators to the Quinn Group.  They were joined by MLAs in Fermanagh and south Tyrone, as well as representatives of the Labour Party from outside the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  They have all been working with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, and me to try to find a solution to this totally unacceptable situation.  I am aware that the Minister is involved in intensive discussions, the details of which he cannot disclose to me or others outside the Cabinet.  I know that work is continuing.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to draw this urgent matter to the attention of his Cabinet colleagues and assist the Minister in getting the message across that we are within 72 hours of 1,400 individuals losing their jobs.  The bigger picture is that if the Quinn Group is not facilitated in continuing its ownership of the insurance company, some 5,500 direct jobs will be affected and at least double that number of indirect jobs.  That is how serious the problem is.  These 1,400 individuals are directly affected by this ludicrous decision of the Financial Regulator to stop Quinn Insurance writing new business in the United Kingdom.  I ask the Minister of State to please try to have this situation sorted out before we run out of time.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Wilson for his contribution and understand this issue is the source of extraordinary emotion in Cavan in his constituency.  We all know the extent and influence of the Quinn Group in terms of its contribution to employment and wealth generation in the country.  It is most extraordinary that the Financial Regulator has had to act in this way.  Everyone in government is working extremely hard to ensure the jobs are maintained, as opposed to the Quinn Group, its owner or those on high salaries.  The main priority of Government policy is to ensure the jobs are maintained.  It may be the case that they will be maintained by someone other than the Quinn Group, there may be someone else who will purchase it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House to deal with this issue on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Science, with whom I have discussed it, as well as with her predecessor, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  It concerns the system that operates when a school needs a teacher to cover for an absent teacher.  A teacher may be absent for a variety of valid reasons, including illness or attendance at a course.  In a small number of areas a primary school supply panel has been created.  Only 60 teachers in the whole country are involved.  However, the decision taken by the Government to abolish the supply panel is having a negative impact.  At a time when we are trying to adopt a positive approach to how the Government views education, the support structures in place are hugely important.  I accept there is a need to cut back on costs everywhere, but that is not what we are talking about in this instance.  However, the Minister needs to review the decision to abolish the supply panel.  She should investigate ways by which a more cost-effective or cost-neutral supply panel could be created.  In this regard, the decision to abolish the supply panel should be and could be suspended for one year.  Let the hare sit on it.  </P>
        <P>This is a major issue, particularly in the Dublin area, which is of critical importance in the discussions on the Croke Park agreement.  While it might seem like small beer in the Depart<Col N="275"/>ment of Education and Science, it is sending a completely negative signal at a crucially sensitive time.  I ask the Minister to respect and recognise this, as I am sure she must.  This decision should not be proceeded with now, if at all, certainly not at this time.</P>
        <P>I propose a different way of dealing with the matter.  Instead of abolishing the supply panel, the Minister should examine how it works and suspend for one year a decision on its abolition.  It should be determined whether the scheme could be made cost neutral.  This is a fair offer which I have discussed with the INTO.  I have spoken to its general secretary, Ms Sheila Nunan, about the issue and she is very supportive of what I have proposed.  I have also discussed it with the new Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Carey.  There are a number of supply panels in his constituency.  Having been a teacher in one of the schools in question, he fully understands the situation and completely supports what I am proposing as a good, sensible and positive idea.</P>
        <P>If a review were to be undertaken by the education partners &mdash; management, teachers, parents and the Department &mdash; they could examine how they might deal with the issue which the former Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, examined.  The last time I discussed it with him he said he had come to the conclusion that only 60% of the available teaching resources were being used all the time.  I hope the Minister of State will not say this.  From my experience, I cannot contradict this, but what I am being told is not at one with that viewpoint.  If the Department has come to the conclusion that only 60% of resources are being used, the Minister could do one of two things for the next 12 months.  She could increase the number of schools covered by the same number of teachers by 40% to provide 100% cover, if that is seen as fair, or she could reduce the number of schools being covered by the supply panel in order that requirements are met.  If the Department believes the available resources are not being used to the full, although that is not my information, let us look at the matter and prove the information to each other.  There is nowhere to hide on this matter &mdash; it is either right or wrong.  I am not saying for one minute that the Department is being dishonest in this regard, but if it believes this and teachers believe otherwise, let us find out what the facts are.  We could then adjust the number of schools or the number of teachers to meet demand.  It would also show goodwill.  In addition, it would show in recessionary times that while we have to cut back, we would not lose structures.  Structures should not be dispensed with, seeing that, according to the Government, we have turned the corner.  If we have done so, we will at some stage have to rebuild these processes and support structures.  We do not need to throw the baby out with the bath water.  If something needs to be changed, let us change it.  If something needs to be more productive and the Department is stating it is not meeting its requirements, let us adjust it in order that the Department meets its needs.  We should use our imagination in this regard.</P>
        <P>I know the Department will not accept this, but I think the Department of Finance said, &ldquo;Cut some money out of this,&rdquo; and the Department of Education and Science jumped, as it always jumps to the tune of the Department of Finance.  Let us examine this issue in a practical, educational and pragmatic way.  The way to deal with it is by negotiation.  There are different points of view, but everyone agrees it is a good idea to have teachers available for schools which need them.  It should be remembered that the schools covered by the supply panels tend to be mainly D&Eacute;IS schools.  The problem with such schools in disadvantaged areas is that they are always the ones which encounter most difficulty in finding temporary or substitute teachers because people tend to go to schools where there are fewer problems, less pressure and reduced tension.  Everybody agrees that the scheme was a good idea.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to reduce costs and there are several ways of doing it.  It could throw the baby out with the bathwater and get rid of the whole scheme, which is a bad idea and would not be a great saving as teachers doing the job currently would have to be reabsorbed into the system.  They would not be sacked but have redeployment rights as part of their contract.  Therefore, it is not as if the Government would save 60 jobs.  The teachers would <Col N="276"/>come into the system another way and the job they were doing previously would be covered by substitutes taken on board for a day or a week or two weeks, etc.  Rather than do that, the Minister should adjust the system by changing either the number of schools or teachers to better meet the demand.  She should do that in consultation with the education partners &mdash; the management, the parents, the teachers and the Department.  We need to come to a deal on this.</P>
        <P>Let us be conscious of the sensitive times we are in.  People are looking for every reason to show their distrust of Government and to show it does not care about issues of education and health.  I am not asking the Minister to do anything hugely significant in terms of savings to the economy, but I am saying she should hold off and review what is being done, establish the facts and adjust to meet the needs.</P>

	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue and will be glad to outline the general position on the supply teacher scheme at primary level.</P>
        <P>The supply teacher scheme was initially set up at primary level more than 15 years ago at a time when schools had difficulty getting substitute teachers.  The supply scheme operates on the basis of an additional full-time teacher being allocated to a school to cover certified sick leave absences in that school and a cluster of neighbouring schools.  If the teacher is not required on a given day to cover sick leave absences, he or she generally assists with other work in the school such as administrative duties. There are 60 posts allocated to the scheme.</P>
        <P>A value for money review of the supply teacher scheme was published in July 2006.  The Senator may not like to hear this but the review found that approximately 60% of these teachers&rsquo; time was used to cover sick leave absences, with the balance spent on various other school duties.  This reflects the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences.  While there are benefits for schools in having these full-time teachers, it is considered more cost-effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers on call all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.</P>
        <P>I do not have to outline for Senators the current economic, fiscal and budgetary challenges facing the State.  Addressing those challenges requires decisions that, if resources were more readily available, we would prefer not to have to take.  In that context, it has been decided to discontinue the supply teacher scheme from the start of the 2010-2011 school year.  It is expected that this will save &euro;400,000 in 2010 and &euro;1.1 million in a full year.  The teachers concerned will be redeployed in accordance with the existing redeployment arrangements to other schools that have vacancies.  I thank the Senator once again for raising this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret the fact the Minister has not moved one bit since we last discussed this issue.  We are dealing with the most disadvantaged schools in many cases.  The supply panel presents teachers who are qualified, experienced and vetted at a time when that is important.  Withdrawing the scheme is regressive in a way that lacks planning and vision.  I cannot understand the figures or how this saves &euro;1.1 million.  I cannot work that out and will come back to the issue.  I cannot see how it could possibly do that.  The teachers provide cover in the schools in question, but those schools will now have to put in substitute teachers and pay them daily.</P>
        <P>The removal of the scheme is regrettable, sends out a wrong signal and gives the impression the Government does not care.  I suggested a way of dealing with the issue and suggested it should be done in a cost neutral way, saving, for example, 50% or 40% of the cost.  The Minister of State has not quite said that the scheme is only approximately 60% effective, but that is what he inferred.  I suggest that if that is the case, we should save on 40% of the cost but keep <Col N="277"/>the structure.  The change should be cost neutral.  How can the Department of Finance argue against running the scheme on a cost neutral basis?  We should consider what needs to be saved and save it.  I regret that has not been done.  I urge the Minister of State to take my suggestion back to the Minister and ask her to reconsider the situation and put the plans to abolish the scheme on hold until we establish all the facts.</P>

    <Title>Sexual Assault Units.</Title>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this motion on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children.  I raise the issue following the publication of the report on sexual assault treatment units last week.  I welcome the fact there are six sexual assault units throughout the country, one of which is in Mullingar, providing equity of access to all victims of sexual crimes and welcome the publication of the report, which is important for the development of the service.  Some 500 people have had the unfortunate necessity to use the service, 50 of whom were in the Mullingar area.</P>
        <P>If people are to be able to defend themselves, they must have forensic clinical evidence, which is why these units are crucial.  However, there are difficulties with the unit in the Mullingar hospital.  Initially, some eight doctors and one clinical nurse specialist, CNS &mdash; sexual forensic examiner &mdash; were available for roster duty in Mullingar, but now there are only five doctors and one CNS available.  Initially there were also 12 assisting nurses, but now there are only 11.  The reduction in staff numbers has led to the service being inadequately staffed, a fact recorded in the report.  The staff shortage has also reduced the availability and timing of appointments for people who need to return to the hospital for an appointment to check up on sexually transmitted infections.  This service is now reduced to one and a half hours per week, which is inadequate.  To add insult to injury, the unit is located in a temporary facility.  It operates from one room which, according to the report, is not discrete within the hospital and lacks proper facilities such as a toilet or shower.  This is an insult to people who are already distressed and in difficulty.  A new facility has been identified within the hospital, but no date has been provided as to when it will be available for staff and patients.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am concerned about the situation in Mullingar.  In recent years there has been insidious downgrading of every facility that has gone into the Mullingar hospital.  The situation is very negative.  The consultants and staff have to fight tooth and nail to retain every service.  I fear that what happened with <i>post mortem</i> facilities last month, which were transferred to Tullamore, will happen again.  This downgrading is harmful, especially considering that Tullamore has no gynaecological or obstetric facilities.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure the staff complement is reinstated to provide a service 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  This serves the catchment area of Westmeath, Longford, Offaly and Laois.  People require the service and we have as much right as any other part of the country to a full and adequate service for people in difficulty.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>By the way, today ambulances were turned away from the Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital, Mullingar and Portiuncula Hospital as they were not able to deal with the numbers of patients in those hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  As she might be aware, last week in Letterkenny the Minister for Health and Children launched the annual statistics for the year 2009 from all six sexual assault treatment units.  Seeking support in the aftermath of a rape or sexual assault is a major challenge and the work of sexual assault treatment units, SATUs, play a vital role in assisting recent victims from a number of different perspectives, including the collection of forensic clinical evidence for potential future prosecutions, immediate physical and psychological care for the victim, and referral to longer-term support.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children took the lead in the national review of sexual assault treatment services launched in 2006 and I am very pleased to see that the implementation of its recommendations is essentially complete.  I am aware that the care delivered in SATUs since the launch of the national review in 2006 has developed and improved and now includes the provision of services to clients who choose not to report to the Garda and the inclusion of preventative care, for example, regarding sexually transmitted infections.  These improvements will soon be reflected in the new national guidelines on referral and forensic clinical examination currently under way, and the Minister looks forward to their publication.</P>
        <P>There were 51 attendances at the SATU in the Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital, Mullingar last year.  At the first visit patients are offered a clinical or forensic examination, psychological care and post-coital emergency contraception.  A screening for sexually transmitted infections is offered approximately four weeks following the initial visit.  Some 44 patients had a forensic clinical examination.  Six of the patients did not report the incident to the Garda and only had a clinical examination.</P>
        <P>Five doctors, one clinical nurse specialist and 11 assisting nurses are available to cover the SATU.  Since its opening in February 2009, the initial services were expanded to offer examination to post-pubescent 14 year olds, availability of services on a 24-hour a day basis to patients who do not wish to report the incident to the Garda, and availability of sexually transmitted infection screening post assault in the SATU.  Support workers from the rape crisis centre in Tullamore became a part of the on-call team in June and have been a welcome addition.  Finally, the SATU liaison committee was formed and held its first meeting in December 2009.</P>
        <P>On the specific matters raised by the Senator, I regret that owing to industrial action affecting the Health Service Executive, it is not possible for the executive to supply the information requested.  If this matter remains of continuing concern, I invite the Senator to raise it with the Minister again in due course.  It is a matter of profound regret that the industrial action by trade unions is inhibiting the legitimate right of Parliament on behalf of the citizens to elicit information of public concern and to public benefit.  That is one of the most dangerous parts of the dispute.  The right of Parliament to receive timely information on issues of genuine public concern is not being satisfied, which is one of the most regrettable aspects of the ongoing industrial dispute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is running the country?  The Minister for Health and Children should be able to give me the answer today.  What is the Department of Health and Children doing?  When will the new service open?  I regret the effect of the industrial action.  This is the second matter on the Adjournment on which I have received a similar reply.  I agree it is regrettable.  More than that, it is outrageous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot disagree with anything the Senator has said.  I believe people should reflect very carefully on the kind of action being taken at the moment, especially when it is action that affects the public in service provision in the Passport Office or elsewhere.  In some local authorities some councillors are getting responses and others are not, which is utterly wrong and inimical to the nature and spirit of our democracy that has developed to date in terms of service to the citizen.</P></Speaker>
