	<P>I have received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to clarify the remedial works, if any, carried out in Skibbereen, County Cork to alleviate or eliminate further flooding.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to make a statement on the need for a better flood warning system and the measures he has taken to improve early warning communication with residents and business people affected by flooding in Cork city.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to outline the reasons for the decline in television coverage for non-RTE stations in east Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and Buttimer as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Keaveney, as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion regarding European directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings, to be referred to joint committee, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 2, statements on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and conclude not later than 7.10 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for eight minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from leaders or spokespersons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a number of points about the taking of business in the House.  I note once again that no legislation has been included in the Order Paper.  I ask <Col N="836"/>the Leader to explain what is happening and why there is no Government legislation available for the House to deal with in its work.  A series of statements have been scheduled to be taken this week.  Will the Leader clarify the position?  What is causing the delay and why is there no legislation for the House to deal with?  Will there be legislation available to it in the coming weeks?</P>
        <P>The House is due to debate the Croke Park agreement tomorrow.  Many are asking what has been happening and whether any progress has been made under the agreement.  While I look forward with interest to hearing what the Minister has to say tomorrow, I ask that the Government circulate a briefing paper before the debate to give the House some indication on whether the work expected to be done has been done.  Has the Department submitted what was expected from it?  Have meetings taken place?  The House needs some background information.  There has been a curious silence about the agreement in the past few weeks and months.</P>
        <P>My third point concerns the letter from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to the party leaders.  Has he written the same letter to the Taoiseach?  I ask the Leader to outline Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s response to the initiative the Minister has suggested.  Does he expect support to be forthcoming from Fianna F&aacute;il?  Where does the initiative stand?  We need to be given this information.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said on Bloomberg in the United States that the welfare and pensions bills might be targeted in December.  While he was talking about the subject on television in the United States, many families here were concerned about the potential impact of cuts in welfare payments.  I note the House has not debated that issue.  It is very important that every Member is given the opportunity to express his or her views before the debate take place on the budget.  How does the Leader intend to organise the debate on the budget?  Last week I raised the question of whether the Government would change its traditional approach to the budget and be more open with the figures in this House, more open about targets and have a different type of discussion from the one we normally have.  I am interested in hearing the response of the Leader to my questions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">F&aacute;ilt&iacute;odh le d&eacute;ana&iacute; roimh an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; an strait&eacute;is foilsithe agus ar f&aacute;il anois.  T&aacute; moladh ann gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar an strait&eacute;is sa D&aacute;il agus sa Seanad.  I ask the Leader to arrange, chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir, go mbeidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sa Teach seo ar an tuarasc&aacute;il sin &mdash; b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir an tseachtain seo chugainn n&oacute; an tseachtain ina dhiadh.  I would appreciate it.  We were supposed to have a debate on the Irish language in the last session but we never had it.</P>
        <P>Last Thursday I spoke on the matter of consensus.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has rightly thrown the cat among the pigeons.  Who is afraid of consensus?  It seems that almost everyone is, including the main Government party.  People are watching what happens on this issue.  People want to know where we stand.  This is not about national government but about people working together, which are quite different things.  It is time for parties to tell us what they stand for and where they stand on issues.  The invitation to engage with the figures on the budget realities is something every party should be happy to do without losing its definition or independence within that process.  People are tired of political bickering and they want to see movement.  The antidote to political bickering is political policy.  Let us put it out there for a debate and engagement in order that people know the differences.  The Taoiseach was overly lukewarm about this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure he did not like the way it was done but this is the reality of political life.  He should grasp it, make it happen and take control of it.  We need to stop the phoney war of popularity.  It is not a populist beauty contest.  The country and the economy are at stake and the populism that is rife at the moment will melt like snow in the desert after an election.  People should examine what happened to Barack Obama and what is happening to David Cameron.  They can make fine speeches before the election but the world changes afterwards.  Based on my 25 years&rsquo; experience in this House, the next Government will emerge from the election in a wave of popularity and within six months it will be the single most unpopular Government in the history of the State.  It does not matter what the parties are.  I would not rush into that reality.  It is now time to engage to allow people to see where the world is at and do the business.  I look forward to people working together on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to the RTE &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme, where we heard Mr. Amadeu Altafaj Tardio of the European Commission office express his views and the views of the Commission on the budget setting process.  He said the European Commissioner would not interfere if we stuck to the agreed deficit reduction targets.  He would leave the details to Ireland.  That is very important.  From recent conversations and discussions, it is clear there are different opinions and options for how we meet the target budget deficit reduction.  This House can usefully debate these options.  Today we heard some ideas from the ESRI about insurance levies, pension levies and amalgamation into one levy.  We also heard discussions in recent days about corporation tax.  We could have a useful debate in advance of the budget where all parties can express their views on what to do to meet the target reduction in the budget deficit.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on mortgage arrears.  I am increasingly concerned about this subject.  In the revised programme for Government, it was one of the items the Green Party assured us was dealt with.  The revised programme for Government was produced more than 12 months ago.  The most recent figures from the Central Bank show 36,000 families more than 90 days in arrears with their mortgages.  Approximately one in 20 mortgages is more than three months in arrears.  It is a big issue, one that comes up all the time when one speaks to people at their front door.  It is not just a financial issue; it is also an emotional one.  People are worried about ending up on the street.  We have seen no action being taken by the Government on the matter.  I accept that recommendations were published as a result of the deliberations of a task force set up in February, but we need to see action at this stage.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Finance to come to the House to tell us what he is going to do about the issue of mortgage arrears.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the need for real consensus in the current political climate.  To be fair to this House, there have been many contributions on the Order of Business in recent months predicated along similar lines.  Part of the consensus would be that, regardless of the individual approaches adopted, there would be an acceptance that no policy option could be followed that would not be difficult or unpopular.  Until there is such an acceptance, anyone involved in political life is not only fooling himself or herself but he or she is also fooling the people he or she claims to represent.</P>
        <P>My party leader has proposed a Green Party initiative.  The letter he has sent is on Green Party headed notepaper and was shown to the Taoiseach who has accepted the general principles.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is waiting for a reaction from the Opposition parties and I hope it will be positive.  Without a positive reaction, we will have put into reverse the necessary measures that need to be taken in advance of the four year strategy, the budget in December and going back to the capital markets in January.  If we do not have consensus on the issue, not only will the business of Government be made <Col N="838"/>more difficult for the Government, it will also be made nearly impossible for any Government that would take office following a general election.  I ask Members to consider this most strongly.</P>
        <P>I request a debate in the presence of either the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the need for a review of safety procedures in the light of the ecological disaster in Hungary and how such an occurrence might be avoided in this country.  There are a number of tailing ponds attached to mining facilities and a major aluminium plant, Aughinish Alumina, in Askeaton.  The disaster in Hungary has concentrated a lot of minds.  It would be helpful to know that the Government is considering matters critically to ensure such an event does not happen in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>No. 22 on the Order Paper is the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) (Amendment) Bill 2008.  Perhaps the Leader might give an indication as to when we will take the Bill which would only require a short period.  As I understand the Minister is in favour of it, we could take Second Stage within an hour at some point.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Once again it appears Irish passports have been tampered with by agents of another country.  That is an infringement of our sovereignty and could impair our relations with other friendly countries and endanger the lives of Irish citizens.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, took minimal action against the Israeli Government early in the year following the abuse of Irish passports.  He needs to take strong action against the Russian authorities to immediately restore the integrity of Irish passports.  This is a very important issue, one that should not be treated lightly.  I hope, therefore, the Minister will act swiftly and decisively.</P>
        <P>The plight of cystic fibrosis sufferers has been highlighted in this House by several Members on a number of occasions.  Anyone with a heart who listened to people with cystic fibrosis and their families on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; with Joe Duffy last week speak about the conditions they had to endure in this country could not but have been moved.  We should hang our heads in shame, given the fact that hospital facilities and services have not been provided for persons who need single rooms with en-suite facilities.  It is ridiculous to place patients with cystic fibrosis in wards and accident and emergency waiting rooms.  Something must be done about the matter.  I believe tenders will be opened this week.  I hope hospital rooms will be provided sooner rather than later and that the promises made will at last be honoured.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Cummins, as do Members on all sides of the House, that the integrity and credibility of Irish passports have been seriously eroded by Israeli and now Russian actions; it is terrible.  At the time of the allegations involving the Israelis the Minister for Foreign Affairs requested a member of the Israeli diplomatic staff to return to Israel.  In fairness, that was not was a minimal response.</P>
        <P>I express concern at the ruling in the High Court that private Internet providers can continue to allow the illegal downloading of music which is having a detrimental effect on the music industry in general and jobs in Ireland.  There is a perception that the big five record companies, all international companies, have been ripping off the consumer for many years.  I do not want to be seen as an apologist for the music industry, but at the lower level I can give a specific example to highlight the impact of illegal downloading on Aslan, an Irish band.  It has sold <Col N="839"/>6,000 copies of its current album, but there have been 22,000 illegal downloads.  We are living in a technological age, in which increasingly members of the younger generation are asking why they should pay for a CD when they can go on-line and illegally download it.  Why must we wait for a High Court judgment to be made before we introduce relevant legislation?  This is not the first time it has happened in the copyright sector.  I was a Member of the House when we had to introduce copyright legislation to protect software because Microsoft and other companies which are providing thousands of jobs in this country did not have confidence in the Government&rsquo;s ability to ensure there would not be pirating of their copyright material.  We are in the exact same situation now and jobs are at stake.  I ask the Leader to convey the concerns of the House to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and to ask him what plans he has to introduce legislation to rectify this anomaly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks in support of the call by the Green Party for consensus.  Like him, I deplore the Taoiseach&rsquo;s tepid response and that of the other parties.  Professor R&oacute;n&aacute;n Fanning suggested the appropriate response to our structural crisis, the greatest crisis the State has ever faced, would be to establish a cross-party forum along the lines of the New Ireland Forum of 1983-84.  The merits of that idea are beyond argument.  As we face the budget, the facts of life are that the Minister for Finance has three choices: he can attack the productive private sector that generates all wealth and growth; he can attack the welfare class which is down and out, or he can look at the public sector, of which the pension liability alone stands at &euro;108 billion, three times the cost of the bank guarantee.  There are civil servants in receipt of a pension of &euro;155,000, while the Taoiseach and Ministers are paid far above European norms.  That is why we need a cross-party forum of some kind to take hard measures in the public sector, the elephant in the room.  Common sense dictates we should not come down hard on the productive private sector.  Common compassion dictates we should not come down hard on the welfare sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Common logic and arithmetic dictate we should look to the public sector to make savings.  Marc Coleman pointed out that if we were to look to the public sector alone, neither the welfare sector nor the productive private sector would need to be touched.  There are pension liabilities of &euro;108 billion, huge salaries, hundreds of thousands of euro being spent on hospitals that have not been built, consultant reports on ramshackle wastage, all kinds of carry on and codology and it all comes back continually to the public sector.  The managers are sitting and procrastinating and hoping for a change of Government instead of producing budget savings under the Croke Park deal.  They have not done so; they have not got on with it.  Common sense, common decency, common logic and common arithmetic dictate that we should look to the public sector and ourselves first.  We have no right to impose any cut on any section of the community, unless we in the political class take at least a 20% cut.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Is mian liom aont&uacute; leis an Seanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Toole maidir le strait&eacute;is na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; an tuarasc&aacute;il foilsithe agus t&aacute; s&iacute; ag Rialtas anois.  Bheadh s&eacute; cabhrach &iacute; sin a phl&eacute; chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir.  Given the interest of the Oireachtas in the Irish language, 80 Members attended the information seminar in Buswells Hotel last week organised by the Irish <Col N="840"/>language organisations.  This is a large number and indicates the significant level of interest in the Irish language.</P>
        <P>A passport is the most valued and treasured document any citizen in any country can hold.  When we travel abroad and produce our Irish passports, we invariably receive a warm response such is the status of the country and its passport.  Anything that diminishes that status must be contested.  A recent incident in which forged Irish passports were found in the possession of members of the Russian spy ring in America was notified to us by the FBI.  It is an exceptionally worrying development which not only strikes at the root of our sovereignty, it might also place the lives of Irish people in jeopardy.  We can take it for granted that wherever one travels with an Irish passport in the future, it will be examined more closely than was the case.  The House expressed its abhorrence of the abuse of Irish passports by Israel, but the punishment meted out at the time was not strong enough.  I hope the incident invoving the Russians will be highlighted and that there will be no repetition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all interested in seeking consensus, but I wonder whether there is something phoney about it all.  We all agree on the broad parameters and everyone has signed up to a debt figure of 3% of GDP by 2014.  I have no doubt my party will respond positively to this initiative, but there is something suspicious, not least about the reaction of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>Perhaps the Leader might organise a debate on the matter in this House.  In fairness, such a debate is often more objective and less partisan than in the Lower House.  Perhaps the Leader might lead the debate.  I throw out the idea for his consideration and have no doubt Fine Gael will be positive in its approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not ask for the old chestnut, a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as the Leader has already promised to arrange such a debate.  Will he arrange a debate with the Minister for Transport on the certificate of compliance with the code of safety for small vessels, a matter I discussed some time ago?</P><Col N="841"/>
      
        <P>Currently, there are 63 trawlers, each employing approximately four crew, tied up around our coastline, from Ros an Mh&iacute;l to Kerry, Cork, Waterford and into Wexford.  The situation is ludicrous.  I ask for an urgent debate with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, because this is not a fisheries issue.  In the first place, the marine survey office, which dictates the pace regarding certificates of compliance, is understaffed.  If all the boats in question required certificates in the morning they would not be able to get them.  Second, these boats are tied up now because the deadline was the last day of September.  Third, approximately 200 families are concerned, around the coastline.  Some of them land the fish we eat every day and that is available in our shops and restaurants.  These are small vessels but they are being asked to comply with regulations that affect large sea-going vessels which can travel for weeks and months at sea.  The boats which concern me are called day trippers and are 15 to 18 metres in length.  It is a disgrace that these family owned vessels are now tied up at piers, whether in Union Hall, Baltimore, Schull, Castletownbere, Ros an Mh&iacute;l, Dingle, Kilmore Quay or wherever.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I urge the Minister responsible, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to come to the House and debate this issue.  I see no reason a temporary licence could not be given to these vessels.  They are family owned and are not going to go to sea with sons or other family members taking any risks.  Most of these vessels are fully seaworthy and have complied with all kinds of codes of practice.  This is an extra layer of bureaucracy.  In many instances the owners have to get finance to comply with this code but the banks will not listen to or entertain them.  When we are crying out for jobs it is ludicrous that some 200 families along our coastline are now idle.  I feel very strongly about this issue because money was supplied under the Cawley report for decommissioning four or five years ago.  There is money left over in the Department of Finance which should be utilised to help these small fishing vessel owners to go to sea, catch their fish and make a living.  The day is not far short when we will have to depend on imports from Iceland and faraway places to provide the fish we take for granted.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to provide such a debate, if it is possible.  It will only take a couple of hours because I am sure there will not be many speakers.  I can promise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I acknowledge the passing of the late, great Maurice Neligan, an outstanding cardiologist and wonderful heart surgeon.  Many people are alive today because of his skill and his vocation.  When he retired he continued to be an advocate for the sick and the vulnerable in his column in <i>The Irish Times</i>, often criticising the Minister for Health and Children and Government policy on health.  His last article referred to the document A Vision for Change.  He asked whether we would continue merely to talk the talk or if we would ever walk the walk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very concerned about the great number of people who suffer from depression, especially as our country goes down the tubes, leaving people utterly stressed.  My concern is that we are going to turn a blind eye to these most vulnerable people.  Last Sunday was Mental Health Day.  Senator Maria Corrigan has called for a debate on A Vision for Change for a long time and I ask the Leader for such a debate.</P><Col N="842"/>
        <P>Mr. Maurice Neligan also spoke about the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, stating that the site chosen for it was entirely unsuitable.  I agree.  This hospital is for every child in the country, not merely those from Dublin.  Putting 16 floors into a squashed site on the Mater Hospital site is foolhardy.  There will be a piecemeal carpark where people will have no room to park.  The hospital should be built on one of the many sites available now because of NAMA.  There should be a greenfield site for a proper state-of-the-art children&rsquo;s hospital.  Instead of spending the money on a small site that will cost the earth, we should spend it wisely on a greenfield site that will be a proper place where children can get better.  I ask for a proper debate in which we can discuss this.  I am sure my colleagues agree.  Mr. Maurice Neligan would have been against co-location and a plethora of other policies that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has introduced.  We should honour him for all his great work.</P>

	<P>I welcome the constructive proposals from the leader of the Green Party, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and the comments made by our colleague, Senator Dan Boyle, on the idea of consensus on the future budget.  One saw that Senator Harris got a great reaction from the Visitors Gallery in this regard.  I ask the Leader to arrange, perhaps, for all parties to discuss this matter in the Seanad.  All the parties are represented in this House and could contribute to a debate on future budgets in the light of the four-year plan which is required.</P>
        <P>It should be borne in mind that all parties have a responsibility.  I have the manifestoes from the last general election which I believe are being shredded and are very difficult to find at this time.  Nevertheless, I have them and while I do not intend to go back over them because they are history, it is useful to have them because I can quote the fact that the Fine Gael Party was going to spend, over the past four years, the &euro;25 billion we invested in the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Let us make amends and the parties should now come together.  Could we have the opportunity prior to some of the Council of Europe meetings to hear some of the views being put forward in that forum?  In this regard it is in order to compliment our colleague, Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, for ensuring last week a motion was passed by the Assembly, contrary to the so-called McCaffrey resolution, which provided that no person, hospital or institution shall be coerced, held liable or discriminated against in any manner because of a refusal to perform, accommodate, assist or submit to an abortion.  That was passed because we have sent four Members of this House to the Council of Europe.  I support Senator Mullen in this regard.  He can take the credit for putting forward that motion at the Assembly last Thursday.  It would be very useful for us to have debates on what is coming through the Council of Europe before the eight members from Ireland attend meetings in order that we might have some idea of what is being proposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Leyden&rsquo;s congratulations to Senator Mullen.  He was alone among Irish members in attending that session last week, or so I read in one of the despatches.</P>
        <P>I support those colleagues who have called, once again, for some degree of consensus as the country faces the gravest challenge in a generation.  Again, I record my suggestion of a fortnight ago that we should put in place some type of political truce to allow the time and space for an economic consensus to be arrived at among the parties in order that we might put through a budget and start on the road to economic recovery.  I do not want this or any Government dependent on the beck and whim of a few maverick Deputies for whom constituency, not country, comes first.  I hope that all the political parties would be willing to work together in the resolution of the grave crisis we have.</P>
        <P>Along with some of my colleagues I attended the North-South parliamentary forum in Newcastle, County Down, and it certainly was something to reflect on when one saw members from all the political parties of every tradition and colour in Ireland, some of whom had fired shots at each other, now working together for the common good.  Northern Ireland, the greatest problem in the history of this island, was solved when people were willing to put aside petty party differences and work together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is the same level of crisis with our economic future.  In approximately five years&rsquo; time we will be planning for the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  Unless we get our economic act together, Ireland 2016 will not be an independent or sovereign republic.  It will simply be a province of the IMF.  We in this House and our colleagues in the Lower House must make a decision whether we shall put party politics before country.  I know what the public wants and I hope we are up to the challenge.  I hope there will be a constructive response to the recent beginnings of the debate on the need for consensus.  &ldquo;Consensus&rdquo; should not be a negative or dangerous word in politics.  It is the language of the courageous and the brave.</P>

	<P>I welcome the words of Senator Bradford, especially coming from a member of the Fine Gael Party.  This is something we need to consider on all sides of the House.  It would be good to have a debate on the need for consensus.  In this regard, I pay tribute to two brave men: Mr. Alan Dukes and Mr. John Hume.  Mr. Dukes came up with the Tallaght strategy in the 1980s, when I was growing up, and should always be remembered for this major contribution to the country.  It was a brave contribution and although it may not have garnered the thanks, politically, that some would have liked, it took us out of an economic tailspin.  New thinking is called for.  Therefore, the proposals coming from all sides of the House should be welcomed.  Mr. Hume was always quoted as saying no one had anything to fear from agreement.  That is what a consensus is: agreement by all parties.  Senator Harris made an interesting comparison with the New Ireland Forum, a good model which should be examined as part of this debate.  The one thing to be said about the forum is that it did include all parties.  We should include not only members of the two Government parties and the two main Opposition parties but all Members of the House, including Sinn F&eacute;in and Independent Members.  Consensus should mean consensus; it should not mean some are in and others are out.  We need to band together to get the country back on track.  Therefore, I would like to see such a debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As so often happens, I was moved by the stirring words of Senator Harris and agree with much of what he had to say.  He spoke about arithmetic, common sense and compassion.  Regrettably, this House has traditionally had little impact on budgetary matters; in fact, we are confined constitutionally in the changes we can make.  Thus, I will try to concentrate on the third of the items mentioned &mdash; compassion.  Once again, the most vulnerable elements of our society will be trampled on, to the encouraging cheers of the IMF and the ratings agencies &mdash; I can never understand why they have not been discredited.  I ask my colleagues to join me and Senator Bacik and sign my motion condemning, for example, the 50 cent prescription charge which has been extended to the terminally ill and the homeless.  How is that tolerable in what is described in the Constitution as a Christian country?  </P>
        <P>This House is the appropriate place in which to consider the detailed implications of some measures being considered such as the proposal to amalgamate PRSI, the health contribution and the income levy into one universal social charge.  In this regard, an academic paper has just been published which demonstrates clearly that the net impact would be that the bottom 10% would suffer a drop of just over 2% in their incomes, while the highest 10% would gain almost 2%.  That would not be appropriate.  It is in this area that the House can have an impact and I hope that is what we will do.  We have a responsibility to consider those who are suffering.  I am sure every Member receives the e-mails I do about people who are under so much pressure that they wonder whether life is worth living at all.  We must give such individuals a headline.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my frustration with the debate on the need for consensus which has been taking place for several weeks.  Last Wednesday week I raised the possibility of our dealing with tangible proposals on a whole-House basis, in the belief those in this room and the other House could come up with solutions to the problems we were facing.  Instead, the pantomime has continued with a call for a debate on consensus itself.  We know the benefits of consensus.  What is needed at this point are the tangibles.  We have to break what has become and is perceived as the institutionalisation of the political class, which consists of the Members of both Houses.  If we are to do that, and I agree with Senator Harris, then the efficiencies proposed in the Croke Park deal have to be achieved immediately, and not in the pedestrian way that is occurring at the moment.  That must be led from the front by the Members of these Houses.  If my salary today is around &euro;60,000 and that is in line with an income level of 2007, then that is too much because our income levels are 2003 and 2004.  While I, personally, have commitments in line with an income of that level, I will have to deal with that.</P>
        <P>The reality is not enough money is coming in and we will have to contemplate pay cuts.  Rather than do this in a superficial way by saying we should cut the number of Members and their salaries or abolish the Seanad, it must be done throughout the entire public service.</P>

Regrettably, times have changed and unless we want to go down with the IMF trying to pull us back up, it is time we faced up to it quickly in this House and came up with solutions.  Why did Fine Gael not specify the areas in which the &euro;6 billion in cuts Deputy Varadkar wishes to make would take place?  Had it done so, we on this side of the House could then have said which parts were good.</P>

We are here to reflect the public&rsquo;s thinking at this stage.  To get our country back, we need that cross-party discussion to tease out how best we can improve our economic position.  Otherwise we will not be doing so and will have outsiders coming in to tell us what to do.  I agree with the many speakers who say we must come together on the issue.</P>
        <P>Another serious issue that needs to be discussed in the Chamber is sham marriages.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister dealing with EU legislation to come to the House to discuss how we can improve the EU directive on the matter.  A number of very vulnerable young women from poorer EU members states are lured to this country for money and to avail of better opportunities and find themselves in sham marriages.  There is something wrong, given that there are more sham marriages in this country and the United Kingdom than elsewhere.  Is there any way we can tackle the problem?  The Garda is doing what it can to tackle it.  Registrars are also trying to do so but do not have the powers they need.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to arrange a debate to tease out the issue as to why this country seems to have so many vulnerable young women from poorer EU member states who find themselves in this position.  We have a duty to protect them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know it suits Government Members to seek consensus now.  For the first time in my eight years in the Houses I have started to hear the word being uttered.  Perhaps the issue is worthy of debate because the need for consensus in Northern Ireland was put to the people in a referendum.  For the people to buy into something, they need to feel part of it, but the Government does not have their confidence.  The Government insults the electorate by asking it to become part of government by consensus.  However, consensus is being sought in making certain sacrifices.  Perhaps the Government should bring forward a budget and call a general election on its four-year budget plan in order that the people could decide.  If the current incumbents, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, were to lose the election and not be part of the next Government, they could then offer their support to that Government for the following four years to implement the plan.  In the way they talk about consensus Government Members are insulting the intelligence of the electorate and being driven by a narrow agenda being pushed by a minority.  The Government needs to step back and look at what it is doing.  We do not have and have never had that type of government.  When Mr. Alan Dukes did it, he did it in very specific circumstances at the beginning of the life of a Government.</P>

If Government Members want to have a debate, they should try to be factual and realistic about it.  Consensus will not work at this point.  If they want that option, the best thing to do would be to call a general election and offer their support to achieve consensus afterwards.</P>

	<P>It has been interesting to hear this debate and to hear Senator Norris say this House has little impact on budgetary matters.  This House has the impact it deserves.  If we are to impact on budgetary matters it will be because we earned that respect, interest and the notice we get.</P>
        <P>When a family runs short of money because its income is not as big as its outgoings or when a business finds its income is not as big as its outgoings it cuts its costs.  Senator Harris reminded us earlier how we can do that.  In Britain yesterday, Sir Philip Green published savings to the British public sector and he said they were massive.  He had been given the job in August and reported in early October with those figures.  He was following what Colm McCarthy did for us here last year when he said we can save billions &mdash; not millions &mdash; in costs and then outlined the tough measures families and businesses would have to take to save those costs.  We have not grasped that.  We have not said we will do that and get over this problem much more quickly than otherwise.  What we do not want to do is allow this problem drag out to the extent that we do not manage to save our economy as well.  We need growth.  We need to get on top of the problem.  We can do so.  We had two different debates last week on the economy and in <Col N="849"/>those attention was given to some of the areas we can work on but we must identify those and take the cuts and the difficult decisions.  We must not damage the economy in the future.  We have it in our own hands.  We do not have to rely on anybody else to tell us what to do.  We can do it ourselves.</P>
        <P>To return to the point made by Senator Norris, those of us in this House must earn respect, interest and notification but we must work hard at it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was in this House that I learned about the candidate for the Louisiana state governorship who, having won the election, was asked by one of the people who reported on it how he managed to get elected.  He said his philosophy was: don&rsquo;t tax you, don&rsquo;t tax me, tax the guy behind the tree.  In a perfect world no one would need to be taxed but by the very next election that governor was out of office because he had misled the people.</P>
        <P>It is impossible for us as elected representatives not to put forward concrete proposals.  I commend those in this House who put forward proposals that are positive, make sense and are not ladened with phrases like those of Private Frazer in &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s Army&rdquo; who said, &ldquo;We are doomed&rdquo; but with positive suggestions as to how we can deal with our crisis.</P>
        <P>Not everyone did badly during the Depression in the 1930s.  A total of 25% had no cushion.  They did terribly badly but those who had work did very well because there was significant deflation.  If one had an income one could buy much more with one&rsquo;s money.</P>
        <P>In terms of people with public sector pensions, and I am thinking particularly about those at the top end who are on significant sums and who, even with a 10% cut, would not notice any difference in their net income because of deflation, surely that is an area we should examine.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Consensus should be an area where bridges can be built and common themes found.  It is disappointing to hear from the Government side nothing but divisiveness and personal attacks, which does nothing for building bridges and consensus.  If we are genuine about this, there has to be a real engagement from the major party in government &mdash; that is how it will be judged.  It is only two short years since I heard the Taoiseach say &ldquo;We will do it our way and no other way&rdquo;.  That kind of language must be left to one side if we are talking of building consensus.  Let us see genuine and constructive themes being built.  I am sure we can properly debate the issue at that stage.</P>
        <P>I agree with speakers who called for the protection of the integrity of the Irish passport.  It is wrong to see passports being passed around by criminals as if they are Christmas cards.  The Irish passport is a valued and internationally recognised entitlement of Irish citizens.  It behoves the Minister for Foreign Affairs and all citizens of this country to protect its integrity.  I ask the Leader to pass on those sentiments to the relevant Minister and Department.</P>
        <P>I have called on a number of occasions for an updated debate on the state of our housing sector.  Thousands of people are still on local authority housing lists while thousands of private houses have been built, resulting in an overhang in the Irish property market.  Over the summer period, an instruction was issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to local authorities that they would no longer build houses.  This is a major shift in policy for social housing and it is important that it is properly analysed by the Oireachtas.  The &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach will not fit every local authority.  While there is an overhang in much of the commuter belt around Dublin and in Dublin itself, there is still a need for local authorities to build houses to meet housing lists and social demand.  I want to know the position of the local authority in regard to the provision of social housing.  I ask the Leader to provide an opportunity at an early stage to debate the housing sector and the position of those on housing lists.</P>

	<P>Consensus politics worked for our country in the late 1980s but I do not believe it will work now.  It will not work now because things are so much more serious for our country than in the 1980s.  We have a banking system that is under catastrophic pressure, a higher rate of unemployment and our main export markets, on which we are so dependent, are not showing the flickers of life we need.  The politics that got our country through the 1980s and 1990s and into this century will not work now, and we need to change it.  We have to set aside the tribes of which we are all members.  While I am very proud to be a member of my particular tribe, we have to look above that and reflect the massive difficulty our country is in.  I do not believe a consensus will work because it is not strong enough; we need agreement.</P>
        <P>We need agreement on two issues, first, that our sovereignty is under threat if we cannot deal with this issue ourselves and, second, that we cannot afford to borrow on the financial markets at present.  We will go back in the new year to look for money, having eaten into our reserves for three months in the hope the interest rates will come down.  I do not believe the consensus form of agreement that may have worked in the past will be strong enough for our country to be secure in the future.</P>
        <P>At this stage, I ask all parties to do three things.  First, we must acknowledge the progress that has been made, given the two main Opposition parties stated they want to deliver a 3% rate of borrowing by 2014.  That is some place to start, so let us try to work backwards from that.  Second, I suggest all parties in Opposition have a responsibility to publish detailed plans about how we would handle this situation.  That is our responsibility, and I hope and believe my party will rise to that challenge.  Third, I ask the Government to acknowledge what has been done.  If an Opposition party spells out what it would do differently, that should be acknowledged.  If there is a good idea, for the sake of our country the Government should take it, and for the sake of our political system, it should acknowledge it.  If that happens, in the interests of all of us, it will create the new environment which is vital for our country to be secure.</P>

I very much look forward to the first debate on the Croke Park agreement which I have ordered for tomorrow.  I met the leaders of the groups in the House today and we are strongly of the view that we will have a debate on this issue once a month, and the Minister is very forthcoming and co-operative in this area.  The first of the statements will take place in the House tomorrow following the Order of Business and I look forward to as many colleagues as possible participating.</P>
        <P>The challenges facing the Government, which have been expressed in the House today by all colleagues, are formidable.  We are all agreed that the figure is a minimum of &euro;3 million.  Some strong views have been expressed today and there is a total commitment by the Irish men and women elected to represent the people of Ireland in the Upper House, Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is very uplifting to hear the determination and common sense that have been expressed here by colleagues on all sides of the House.  The proposal put before us by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, must be welcomed.  I know everyone wants us to put the country before party and before person.  As was said by Senator MacSharry, a young and dynamic Senator who wants to make his contribution, as we all do, and by those who have been here for quite a while and are extremely experienced, including those who were here when the last massive downturn happened in 1983-87, we all know what has to be done and we are all prepared to do it.  Whoever participates, all parties have the responsibility, not just the Government, because it is a worldwide problem.</P><Col N="851"/>
        <P>It amazes me when one sees what is happening in the United Kingdom, where all of the various strategies the British Government is endeavouring to achieve are practically the same as those that have come forward from our Government in the past 12 to 18 months.  We must be doing something right.  At the end of the day, it is action that is needed.  We will all support the Government.  Whatever time is needed in the House, I have no difficulty whatsoever listening to the ideas of individual Members and responding positively in regard to how Seanad &Eacute;ireann can make a difference at this very difficult time in our country&rsquo;s history.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan referred to mortgage arrears and the 36,000 families who are over three months in arrears.  This issue can be brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention when he is in the House tomorrow.  I have no difficulty having the Minister for Finance come to the House to update us at any time before budget day.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle raised the issue of safety procedures in regard to the experience of the unfortunate people in Hungary and called for the Ministers for Health and Children and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House.  I have no difficulty with this taking place.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins referred to No. 22 on the Order Paper, which concerns a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 in regard to registration in respect of the Administrative Panel.  I have no difficulty in supporting this proposal.  As Leader of the House and leader of Fianna F&aacute;il in the House, I fully support it and will find how it can be discussed at the earliest time.  It involves a short amendment to the Bill and I have no difficulty giving it our fullest support.</P>
        <P>Senators Cummins, Mooney, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Coffey outlined the serious breaches that have allegedly taken place involving Russian citizens in regard to Irish passports.  I fully agree that the protection of the integrity of our passport is vital.  It is what we have been respected and acknowledged for all over the world.  I fully support the calls and will pass them on to the Minister following the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of intellectual property rights and the High Court decision yesterday.  I was in touch with the industry today.  I will discuss this issue with the Senator following the Order of Business and I intend to lobby Government as strongly as possible.  The protections that exist for the Germans and the French can easily be duplicated in this country by amending the legislation as required.  The eminent judge made a strong remark in this regard in his summing up.  Anything that will interfere with intellectual property rights is important given the many thousands of people employed in this country by multinationals, so we cannot be other than 100% ethical in this regard.  If a short Bill is necessary, I will make the Seanad available for initiating the legislation in order that it can proceed to being approved speedily by both Houses.  It is urgently needed.  I fully agree with Senator Mooney&rsquo;s comments today.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan asked that the Minister for Transport be invited to the House to discuss the problems for small vessels which he highlighted, the regulations that are in place and the 200 families that are seriously affected.  I will see what I can do to speed this up and will refer back to the Senator on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden expressed her condolences to the wife and family of the late Mr. Maurice Neligan.  He was a wonderful person and I wish to be associated with the Senator&rsquo;s comments.  I knew Maurice Neligan personally and am proud to state that for many years I assisted on the first Sunday in May each year in fund-raising for his heart foundation.  What a wonderful man he was and what a massive contribution he made to Ireland and our medical sector.  I extend our condolences to his wife and family.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden also raised the issue of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital to be located at the Mater Hospital site.  I welcome the announcement today of the provision of &euro;650 million <Col N="852"/>for it.  The planning application has been made and work is due to start next year.  It is due to be completed by 2015.  A total of 400 single rooms of the highest standard will be available for sick children in this new magnificent setting.  I welcome the good news in the positive announcement today about the hospital.  I have been listening to debate on this issue for almost 15 years in the Seanad and Members on all sides of the House have been anxious to have this state-of-the-art facility available for children.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden and Senator Bradford spoke about Senator Mullen&rsquo;s achievement in the European Parliament last week in having his motion passed.  I join them in their comments.</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde asked that the Minister be invited to the House to discuss the new guidelines announced in recent days regarding sham marriages.  I have no difficulty with this taking place.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly requested that the Minister for Finance be invited to the House to give Members an update on corporation tax.  My understanding is that there will be no change in that tax.  The Minister will be in the House tomorrow to discuss the Croke Park agreement.  The corporation tax of 12.5% is sacrosanct as far as we are concerned.  It is fundamental to giving us a serious advantage in terms of securing jobs in this country from multinationals.  This is an island nation and we must have some advantage.  This is one advantage on which our position is &ldquo;hands off&rdquo;.  The Minister will be in the House tomorrow and Senator Daly can avail of the opportunity to have him confirm that.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn spoke about business.  We are all familiar with the Senator&rsquo;s many achievements.  He quite correctly pointed out that when overheads are too high, something must be done.  Business is not about turnover, but about overheads.  Savings must be secured.  I fully agree with the Senator regarding the difference we can make.  That said, we must work hard and earn a reputation for the Upper House.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey raised the issue of housing, the up-to-date position in the roll-out of housing stock and the latest position with regard to local authorities.  He sought a debate in the presence of the Minister.  I have no difficulty with such a debate taking place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for affording me the opportunity to address it regarding the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The agri-food sector is very important to the Irish economy and to our rural society.  It will play a vital role in our national economic recovery.  The Government has recently published Food Harvest 2020 which is an ambitious but realistic strategy for smart, green growth in the Irish agri-food sector over the next ten years.  The CAP will be a key instrument underpinning this ambition.  The negotiations on the future CAP are therefore of significant importance for this country because the policy decisions taken on foot of these negotiations will set the context and many of the conditions for the development of Irish agriculture in the years to come.  For this reason I appreciate the time allowed for this debate in the House as I believe there is a significant benefit in having widespread consultation and advice.  I am looking forward to the input from Members and I am anxious to hear their views.  I hope that, collectively, we can come to conclusions on the best and most appropriate policies for agriculture in our country for the years ahead and advocate for policies at EU level.</P>
        <P>When I addressed the House some five months ago, I outlined the background to and developments in the CAP discussions up to that point.  I would now like to bring Members up to date on the developments that have taken place since then and to share with them the views of the Irish Government.</P>
        <P>The basic context for these negotiations has not changed in that they are taking place against the background of an EU budget review and a new EU financial framework for 2014 to 2020.  There are clear pressures from some quarters for a reduction in the amount of funding to be set aside for the CAP, both as a share of the budget and in absolute terms.  While the overall EU budget and the share going to CAP are matters for decision by Heads of State and Government in the context of the negotiations on the next EU financial framework, it is inevitable that the distribution of CAP funds between member states will inform that process and that both sets of negotiations will become inextricably linked.</P>
        <P>As regards the timing of negotiations, a formal communication from the Commission is due to be issued on 17 November.  It is expected this will set out the general principles and policy direction for the future CAP.  This will be followed by full legislative proposals in mid-2011 and the plan is to secure agreement on an overall package in the first half of 2012.  The process will run in parallel with the negotiations on the EU budget.  These are issues of major importance to our country and indeed to the entire European Union.</P>
        <P>When I spoke to the House last May, I mentioned the high level of activity and debate even though formal negotiations had yet to commence.  This high level of activity has continued over the summer months, with formal policy debates taking place in the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers as well as informal contacts and meetings at bilateral level, the production of position papers by stakeholder organisations and a full-scale consultation process initiated by the Commission.</P>
        <P>My Department and I have participated actively in all of these discussions with a view to building up alliances and pressing the Irish viewpoint.  In addition to representing the Irish view at formal and informal meetings of EU Agriculture Ministers, I have had bilateral meetings with the Commissioner and with colleagues from a number of other member states.  Indeed, I travelled to Poland and Hungary last July to meet my ministerial counterparts.  I have come to <Col N="854"/>the House this afternoon following a meeting with Minister Ilse Aigner, the German Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection.  My French colleague, Minister Bruno Lemaire, will come to Ireland at my invitation at the end of the month.</P>
        <P>These contacts are proving very productive in deepening our understanding of each other&rsquo;s positions and in establishing support for the Irish position in the negotiations.  My meeting today with Minister Aigner was a case in point.  We had a comprehensive discussion ranging over all the main elements of the dossier and I am pleased to report that we share a lot of common ground on the importance of a strong and well-resourced CAP in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I had the pleasure of welcoming Commissioner Ciolos to Ireland two weeks ago.  It was an opportune time for such a visit just as the Commission was finalising its thinking on its formal communication.  We had very useful discussions and the Commissioner went on to address the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and to meet stakeholder organisations at a specially organised event in my Department&rsquo;s offices in Backweston, County Kildare.  In addition, the Commissioner was able to see at first hand the realities of Irish farming at a beef and sheep farm in north Kildare.  I would like to think that his Irish visit will bring a distinct Irish influence to the content of that communication and to the future direction of CAP policy after 2013.</P>
        <P>At official level we have continued our engagement with our colleagues in other member states, the Commission and the European Parliament.  This is the first time the European Parliament will have a co-decision role in this process.  There has been a number of bilateral meetings and contacts and we have shared information and analysis, discussed policy positions and explained the Irish context and viewpoint.  This work has also proved very effective in gaining understanding and acceptance of the Irish position.</P>
        <P>I am also continuing to consult widely on the domestic front.  I had the opportunity of addressing the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the occasion of the EU Commissioner&rsquo;s visit and of hearing the views of committee members.  Earlier in the year I established a consultative committee to advise me on the CAP after 2013.  That committee is comprised of all the major farming organisations and agriculture-related representative organisations involved in social partnership as well as a number of academics.  The committee had its inaugural meeting last May and went on to participate in the stakeholder event I organised during the visit of Commissioner Ciolos.</P>
        <P>Having brought the House up to date with recent developments, I would like to turn to the main issues emerging and to explain the Irish position on these issues.  In this connection I should mention that many Senators may have already seen a media report of a draft of the communication that is due to be released by the EU Commission next month.  As interesting as it may be, it is still a media report of a draft and subject to change when it is discussed within the Commission College.  Consequently, I do not intend to go into any detail on the contents of that draft nor to make specific comments on its substance.  Instead I will focus on the issues as they have emerged from the informal negotiating process over the last several months.</P>
        <P>As regards the general orientation of future policy, there is good support among EU Agriculture Ministers for Ireland&rsquo;s view that we need a strong and properly resourced CAP after 2013.  This was reflected in discussions held at the informal meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers held last May.  There was general agreement at that meeting that the agriculture and food sectors could make an important contribution to the EU 2020 strategy.  In addition, the need for a strong and well resourced CAP was emphasised by a majority of member states.  I welcome this endorsement.  This near consensus was repeated at our September Council meeting.  The key context for Ireland is sustainable and competitive food supply, and the sustainable manage<Col N="855"/>ment of natural resources, including mitigation and adaptation to climate change.  We want a coherent approach based on the family farm structure.  As an exporting country, it is particularly important for Ireland to focus on competitiveness.</P>
        <P>There is also an emerging consensus in favour of a two-pillar structure.  In our view a major purpose of pillar one is the support of farm income and the core function of rural development is to support farmers in developing their productive capacity while securing the environment and ensuring the well-being of the wider rural society.  In my view, pillar one should be financed fully from EU funds and there should be no requirement for co-financing from member states.  The introduction of national co-financing would have the effect, in my view, of fragmenting and re-nationalising the Common Agricultural Policy.  I also believe that the budgets for pillar one and pillar two should be fixed from the start of the next financial framework and there should be no question of modulation from one pillar to another.  There is much support for these views among other member states.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the biggest challenges ahead in these negotiations will be to reconcile the competing demands from the different member states for their fair share of the funds available, both in pillar one and in pillar two.  One of my priorities will be to preserve Ireland&rsquo;s entitlements.  Regarding the distribution of funds in pillar one, the two issues of the distribution of funds between member states and the distribution of funds within member states are often confused.  To clarify matters in the negotiations, we should look at the two issues separately.  There have been calls for some redistribution of pillar one funds between member states by flattening out average payment levels between member states.  It is my strong view, which I have repeated, that the starting point for our negotiations must be the current distribution keys for pillar one.  We must start any debate by looking at current national envelopes.  In any deliberations on this matter, it is essential we use the correct and most accurate measurement to determine average payment levels based on the eligible areas that we have invested great effort in measuring.  This is a critical point of detail and is fundamental to the eventual success of the negotiations.</P>
        <P>Our partners in Europe need to be realistic in their expectations.  Focusing solely on the distribution of direct payments without any reference to other EU funding is not balanced.  Fair does not necessarily mean equal.  To be fair, any new mechanism must take into account the wide diversity of farming between member states.  Pillar one direct payments are income supports and we must recognise that the cost of living and cost of farming vary widely throughout the EU.  Once the share-out of funds between member states is agreed, it will be necessary to agree on the criteria for distribution of these funds within member states.  Regarding the type of direct payment we should be aiming for and the criteria for distribution, a primary role of pillar one payments in the future should be the support and stabilisation of farm income.  Direct payments are fully justified on the grounds of support for farm income in a high cost environment, in recognition of the costs of meeting the EU&rsquo;s high standards and of the environmental and other benefits from cross-compliance.  There may be a need to sell these benefits more actively to those who are not farmers and to explain that the EU is supporting family-based farms engaged in sustainable production and meeting high safety and quality standards.  While public opinion in this country takes a broadly supportive view of the Common Agricultural Policy, the same can not be said for all of the other 26 member states.</P>
        <P>Decoupled payments are the most appropriate mechanism to underpin sustainable farming activity while allowing EU farmers to respond to market signals and achieve competitiveness.  Ireland has fully decoupled since 2005 and is ahead of most member states in this respect.  While I can accept that there may be a need to continue coupled payments in certain regions of the EU to counter severe disadvantages or natural handicaps, I do not support any large-scale reversal of the policy of decoupling.</P><Col N="856"/>
        <P>I favour allowing member states considerable flexibility in respect of the distribution of funds within member states, as is currently the case.  The agro-ecological and social conditions of farming vary hugely within the Union and we need to have the flexibility to apply the payment model that best suits our conditions.  I am not seeking to impose this model on other member states but I would like flexibility for each member state to decide on the payment model that best meets its needs.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s current payment system has the major virtue of focusing funding on active farmers.  As we are fully decoupled and apply cross-compliance, this has the effect of supporting sustainable production while not distorting competition or interfering with the farmers&rsquo; response to market signals.  The focus on active farmers is becoming a big issue in the discussions and there have been calls to limit payments to active farmers only.  While I fully endorse the principle, I will reserve judgment until I see concrete proposals from the Commission.</P>
        <P>Other ideas on the table for direct payments are the possibility of establishing upper ceilings or caps on individual payments and fixing minimum payment levels for small-scale farms.  I am open to looking at these ideas but I need to see more detail before taking a firm position.  There have been some suggestions that less favoured area payments should be moved to pillar one because they are annual payments primarily directed at supporting farm income.  I have a strong preference for retaining these payments in pillar two where they can be targeted at those most in need.  Not all member states utilise the option to pay less favoured area payments and it is difficult to understand in those circumstances the move from discretionary payments in pillar two to obligatory payments in pillar one.  Moreover, it would preclude the flexibility currently allowed to member states to respond to the specific local characteristics of their individual agricultural production systems and it would have the effect of neutralising the value of such payments on areas of natural handicap most in need of funding.</P>
        <P>As for market supports, there is an emerging consensus, with which I agree, that existing market support tools are appropriate and should continue.  There may also be a need for adaptation of these measures to address particular difficulties in the market as they arise and there is general support for this view among my colleagues in the Agriculture Council.  For the future, we need new tools to address increased market volatility.  Given the diversity of production systems and risks across the EU, I am cautious about establishing EU-wide insurance regimes.  My preference is to look at a suite of options for member states.</P>
        <P>As for rural development, the principles I outlined regarding the distribution of funds between member states apply equally in respect of pillar two.  The current distribution of funds should be the starting point for our examination of any request for redistribution of funds between member states.  The current distribution of rural development funds among member states reflects the actual record of countries in pursuing successful rural development programmes with co-funding from their national exchequers.  Even under the current severe constraints on the Irish Exchequer, Ireland continues to meet its co-funding responsibilities fully and to undertake additional national actions, for example, on forestry.  This should be fully recognised in the distribution of funds in the next programming period.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s share of these funds also reflects the fact that we account for a significant share of the EU&rsquo;s rural land area and modulation.  As to the policy itself, there is considerable acknowledgment among the Commission and member states of the importance of encouraging competitiveness.  I am pleased about this.  It should be a high priority within pillar two of the CAP.  Ireland&rsquo;s view is that the core purpose of rural development policy is to support farmers in developing their productive capacity while securing the environment and ensuring the well-being of the wider rural society.</P><Col N="857"/>
        <P>Measures directed at investment and which promote competitiveness perform a pivotal role in encouraging efficiency and innovation in farming for the future.  These measures are critical to the future of Irish and European farming and should be maintained and enhanced.  Investment measures that support competitiveness should be seen as a key Community priority in the new rural development regulation.  The other key priority for me in our future rural development policy is to have effective support for agri-environmental measures that contribute to the sustainable management of our resources.  In essence, competitiveness and sustainability should be the twin goals of our rural development policy of the future.</P>
        <P>We have a long way to go before we arrive at a conclusion to these negotiations.  The negotiations will not be easy but I am determined to fight for the best possible outcome for Irish agriculture.  Agriculture is our largest indigenous industry and we have much to gain from a successful outcome.  I value the input from Members of this House and members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Over the next two years we will have the opportunity to exchange views on an ongoing basis on this critical issue for our country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his endeavours to secure a package favourable to Ireland, its agricultural industry and our economy in the ongoing negotiations.  The Minister referred to welcoming the input and co-operation of all sides in this House.  On the Order of Business we had a debate on political consensus and I assure the Minister that in respect of this issue concerning the vital funding of Irish and European agriculture, there is broad consensus in the House.  We are all wearing the green jersey.  We are all committed to ensuring a package of measures will be arrived at which will retain agriculture in its key role as a driver of the rural economy, an employer and the centrepiece of farm families across the European Union.</P>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has been the most successful policy within the European Union, formerly the European Economic Community.  It has produced for the people of Europe at minimal cost a food supply, in terms of quantity and quality, not available prior to the foundation of the European Community.  The possibility of food shortages across the continent of Europe has become a distant memory as a result of the success of the policy.</P>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy needs a good public relations manager, as no policy is more wrongly maligned or misunderstood.  We see ill-informed commentary and articles written on its cost.  It is often reported that it uses up 40% of the entire EU budget.  We, therefore, need to get matters in perspective.  The total budget for the Common Agricultural Policy as part of the broader activity and income of the European Union is minuscule.  The current cost is approximately &euro;100 per head of population.  For &euro;100 per citizen we are guaranteeing a food supply in terms of quantity, quality and security that is vital to the economic and social well-being of the peoples of Europe.</P>
        <P>We should reflect more often on the situation in Europe just after the Second World War up until the mid-1950s when food scarcity was the norm.  There was no guarantee of a food supply.  As a result of the thinking behind the Common Agricultural Policy and the modest amounts of money spent on it, these worries are part of history and that is where we should leave them.  We must continue with an agricultural policy that provides for security of supply from both a quality and quantity perspective.  Beyond that simple equation of producing the basics for life, the Common Agricultural Policy has been the great generator of jobs in rural economies across Europe.  This country has been a major beneficiary.  We appreciate, however, that there must always come a time when we have to reflect on and renew policy.  The Common Agricultural Policy has changed dramatically since this country joined the European Union in 1973 and we are now back to the change agenda.  I appreciate that the matter is up for debate, consideration and, possibly, amendment.</P><Col N="858"/>
        <P>I was impressed by the performance of the new European Commissioner for Agricultural and Rural Development, Mr. Ciolos, at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food a fortnight ago.  He appears to have a broad grasp of the issues over which he has a great degree of control.  I know the Minister will engage closely with him in order to find a solution that is fair, balanced and good for the country and its economy and the broader population of Europe.</P>
        <P>My party wishes to ensure the maximum national envelope is retained.  Our priority is to secure a level of funding for Irish agriculture at least equivalent to what we currently enjoy.  There is a need for ongoing debate on how the money will be spent.  However, we in this House are united on the fact that we must maximise the funding the country receives from the EU budget.  For that to happen it is imperative that the agriculture budget retains a strong significance in the total budgetary expenditure programme of the European Union.  It is important that the Minister and his counterparts across the 27 member states of the European Union lobby in that regard and I accept that he is doing so.</P>
        <P>It bears repeating the success of funding for agriculture since 1973 and highlighting the need for it to continue.  We have received a significant number of submissions on how future moneys should be spent.  There is a wide variety of ideas on the best way of putting the money to use.  First, we must focus on the size of the budget and then move on towards analysing the historic payment basis and other variations of the theme.  We have become used to such payments.  It appears current thinking within the broader European Union suggests there will be a change.  However, if the change is carefully managed, it will allow new opportunities to emerge.  I took on board with interest the comment of the Commissioner that he was a practitioner of evolution rather than revolution.  Accordingly, he will, wisely, tread with a degree of caution.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been examining the subject in some detail and is drawing up a report on the matter.  We have expressed concern that major change could result in a regime of winners and losers.  However, we must recognise that even under the current system of historic payments, there are winners and losers.  I would be disappointed if those who have lost out under the current system were not given some hope that there will be flexibility under a new scheme.  Whatever scheme is put in place must allow an opportunity for new entrants to become involved in agriculture.  Too many have been shut out since the system of historic payments began.  The basis for new entrants should be commercial, with a reasonable income.</P>
        <P>The debate also centres on rural development and environmental measures.  Farm families have ensured a &ldquo;guaranteed Irish&rdquo; form of rural development.  Unfortunately, such families have disappeared in great numbers since 1973, which is understandable, given the introduction of industrialisation and modern technology.  I accept things never remain the same.  However, we must ensure farm families are recognised as offering the best guarantee of ensuring a strong rural economy and rural development.  I participated in and supported Leader and other rural development projects.  We must consider them as add-ons to the broader direct funding of agriculture.  We must try to maximise the amount for the direct support of agriculture.</P>
        <P>To return to the questions faced by the Minister, his colleagues and the Commissioner, the message must be sent from the House that retention of the maximum national envelope is our first and strongest request.  There is no point in putting our heads in the sand and saying things will remain as they are.  We must recognise there will be a degree of change, flexibility and, as the Commissioner described it, evolution.  If we can secure the funding we need, we can have an additional debate on how the money will be spent to keep farm families on the land, support active farmers and protect the environment and rural communities.</P><Col N="859"/>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy brought to an end food shortages and starvation in Europe.  It has been a tremendous success story at a very modest cost &mdash; &euro;100 per head per annum.  We need to see this investment continued.  I support the Minister and his colleagues in his endeavours to secure the best possible package for Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for coming back to us within six months on this important issue, the Common Agricultural Policy post-2013.  It bodes well that he knows how important it is to keep us informed of what is happening and what he expects to happen in Europe.</P>
        <P>The CAP post-2013 is at an early stage, with no final decision being made until at least 2012.  It is important our views are made known to colleagues across Europe.  I note the Minister is holding meetings with his European counterparts and had Commissioner Ciolos here two weeks ago to meet with all strands of Irish agriculture.  He met the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Food, the farming organisations and other stakeholders in the industry.  It was important that he was taken to a working Irish farm to see first hand how it operates because farming is totally different in his country.  Our family run farms are of great importance and the production of beef, sheep meat and dairy produce is mostly grass-based and as near to organic as can be found.  During the years, under the various schemes, and especially through REPS, the farming community has made the environment part of its green image.  That is why it is important to show the Commissioner our way of farming.  I hope the Minister will bring his ministerial colleagues on farm visits, particularly to marginal areas where farming is more difficult, such as in the north and west of my county, Mayo, and the west of his own county, Cavan, where the land is mountainous.  It is important they see how people farm land of that type.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Consumers in Europe must make up their minds between cheap food and food security.  If they want cheap food, they must accept imports of dubious origin and production compared to Irish products.  We cannot produce at the prevailing costs because we produce food at the highest level that is disease free and of a quality that is second to none.  To do this, the various payments from the CAP must be maintained and farmers paid to produce this.  The taxpayers of Europe must maintain their payments and that is why the envelope must be kept going for producers.  If not, the producers must give up and if that happens there will be a food shortage, something that would be detrimental to Europe.  There would be a panic and money would be given to farmers to produce.  Now is the time to batten down the hatches and ensure that food continues to be produced in the way it is done at present.</P>
        <P>It is vital that more funds are made available from EU funds and co-financing from member states is kept to a minimum.  Commissioner Ciolos made much of the fact that there are now 27 members where previously there were 15 and that there must be a massive increase in funds.  We cannot divide the present funds among 27 member states as there would be a massive shortfall for the developed countries, those that built up their agriculture regime during the years.  The incoming countries are entitled to funding but not to the detriment of the competitiveness of agriculture across Europe.  It has taken a long time to arrive at this point and we must keep it going.  In years to come, with population increases, we will need to produce far more.  In the Minister&rsquo;s recent paper on food until 2020, he outlined much of what we will need.  It is a great document and it should be read by all stakeholders in agriculture in the country.</P>
        <P>There is unity of purpose in this House and between MEPs in maintaining the national envelope.  I attended a meeting of the North-South forum last week and Jim Nicholson MEP spoke.  He was upbeat about agriculture but he saw many shortcomings.  I hope our 15 MEPs will come together to work for the common good of agriculture in the European Parliament.</P><Col N="860"/>
        <P>Senator Bradford made a fine contribution today and offered full support, which is welcome.  The green jersey is very important here, as the Minister appreciates when negotiating in Europe.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming and outlining to us what he envisages will happen in the coming months.  We will wait with baited breath.  There was a leak today in the media of a section of the report of the Commission that is to be published on 17 November.  I do not know the basis for that leak, we must wait and see.  The Minister and his officials will try their best to ensure Irish agriculture remains at the forefront.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am stepping into the breach for my colleague Senator Michael McCarthy.</P>
        <P>The future of the Common Agricultural Policy must be addressed now.  We are fast approaching 2013 and, with every day that passes, the situation for Irish farmers becomes more critical.  Agriculture remains at the core of Irish rural life and the CAP 2013 is vital to securing the viability of farming as an option for young men and women.  We must encourage young people to get involved.</P>
        <P>CAP reform must protect small producers who form the backbone of rural Ireland and it must ensure they are not neglected in preference to larger operations.  The single farm payment is key to the livelihoods of most small farmers.  Our Government must act in a decisive manner to protect the single farm payment from the threat posed by the future negotiations of CAP.  The CAP process is not something intangible: it is about real people, real families and real communities.</P>
        <P>I am glad this debate is taking place.  It is time for an informed debate to begin.  We cannot wait until 2013.  Now is the time for action, to decide what it is we want from the CAP and for the future of the agriculture industry.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Alan Kelly MEP, carried out a survey of farmers earlier this year.  The findings show that 97% of farmers believe the CAP is of major or vital importance to Irish agriculture but over 90% of them believe the future of CAP will have a negative impact.  He revealed these results at the &ldquo;Future of CAP &mdash; Crisis or Opportunity for Rural Ireland&rdquo; conference which took place at the end of March.  This conference was the first of its kind in Ireland and it saw attendees from across Ireland gather to hear speakers, including Deputy Eamon Gilmore and the IFA President, John Bryan, discuss the future of the CAP for Irish farmers.</P>
        <P>The CAP is worth over &euro;1 billion to the Irish economy in purely financial terms.  Unfortunately, because it is an agricultural issue and an issue for rural Ireland it does not get the attention it deserves.  We must present a united front in Europe to protect our national interests and ensure a future for Irish agriculture.  We need a strong vision for the future of the CAP.  We cannot have a CAP that provides almost random subsidies to large farmers and companies.  We need a CAP that will protect and foster the family farm structure.</P>
        <P>If we believe in the future of Irish agriculture, we need to structure the CAP in such a way that it fosters and encourages innovation, sustainability and quality.  My colleague, Deputy Sherlock, Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture, has been calling for this approach for some time.  As they say, the devil is in the detail and the CAP is no different.  It is obvious there are real concerns in the farming community that the CAP will lead to a significant reduction in income within the agricultural sector.  The fact that ever-increasing numbers of farming families have been awarded a payment under the farm assist scheme since the beginning of the year is further proof that many families in rural Ireland are on the bread line.  This is a worrying trend <Col N="861"/>and reinforces the need to ensure that any decision regarding the CAP will not further negate farm incomes.</P>
        <P>We often make the mistake of believing that the interests of those in rural Ireland are different from the interests of those who live in urban Ireland.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We are one Ireland and all our interests are intertwined.  Deputy Gilmore stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Real vibrant communities will not survive and thrive without some support.  As CAP moves more and more away from direct support for farmers, it can have a new role in protecting and enhancing rural life.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Small rural businesses, cottage industries and green energy can be supported through a restructured CAP.  We cannot hope to develop sustainable communities in rural Ireland unless farming is in a healthy and sustainable condition.</P>
        <P>If the global population is to increase from 6 billion to 9 billion by 2050, it is vital that the Irish agrifood sector is supported by adequate resources in both pillars of the CAP.  Global food security is a major challenge.  Coupled with increasing demand for dairy products in Asia, in particular China, this should see Ireland well placed to take advantage.  The economic downturn in Ireland can be tackled by ensuring the &euro;1.3 billion we get from the CAP will place an emphasis on the agrifood business.  There is considerable potential for growth in this sector and, if we go about it the right way, it could turn into a business with a turnover of more than &euro;25 billion.  I am glad the Commissioner has stated that direct payments are critical to the future of the CAP and that these would be backed by market measures.  The new round of the CAP must benefit those who are innovators within the industry and the Labour Party will press for its preservation.</P>
        <P>I welcome this timely debate.  It is time for the Government to engage with all stakeholders to ensure a fair and beneficial reform of the CAP for all.  I wish the Minister well in his discussions in Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House in an effort to keep us up to date regarding the forthcoming talks on the CAP.  I wish him well in those negotiations as he will have an uphill battle if he is to maintain Ireland&rsquo;s level of funding.  He should be fully supported by the farming bodies and all Members of the Oireachtas because the negotiations will not be simple.</P>
        <P>We come to this debate in the context of an ever-changing agricultural community.  On the one hand, some of its members are elderly and, on the other, so many young people are trying to become involved at various levels that our agricultural colleges were not able to accept every applicant this year.  The reason is simple.  While agriculture may have its ups and downs, it is more level and provides a better future for young people than some of the other opportunities that might arise for people from farming backgrounds.</P>
        <P>Major changes are under way in the food industry, which will have a significant role to play in the CAP negotiations.  People might not say that processors are producers, but those processors will need to become producers of food that is acceptable to people.  We cannot expect European farmers to produce food to the standard required by European consumers and still compete against other groups that produce food by various methods with cheap labour, cheap land and poor standards of quality and supervision.  This matter will lead to a major clash when negotiating the new CAP.  Certain countries within Europe will want cheap food irrespective of the consequences for consumers.  They will want it for nothing if at all possible.</P>
        <P>Globally, food prices are increasing.  Some commodities are worth more in certain parts of the world where they are unsubsidised than they are worth in Ireland.  Recently, the <i>Farming <Col N="862"/>Independent</i> reported that live cattle were worth $3,000 per tonne in Egypt, far in excess of the value of the same stock in Europe.  This raises a question.  Are producer prices being suppressed within the EU?  I honestly believe they are, but I am not in a position to do the research.  Irish farmers&rsquo; prices are being suppressed because they are being paid &euro;170 less for animals than they would were those animals processed in the UK.  This raises major questions about where the CAP is going and how producers will be protected from supermarkets and processors.  The margins being taken by some supermarkets are depressing the prices received by primary producers.  Neither are those margins always of great benefit to the consumer.   Europe&rsquo;s current food supply will only last 26 days.  This is a low stock of food available to people within the EU.  If the Irish rate of production continues to decrease as it has done in the past two to three years, we will have national problems with certain areas of the food industry within ten years.</P>
        <P>We need to strike a balance between what is paid to individuals and what they produce in return.  None of us wants to see the butter mountains or beef mountains of the past, but we want a reasonable level of production to be maintained.  If we allow production to diminish, we must accept the consequence of job losses.  If we are to produce, we must be able to compete with our fellow Europeans.</P>
        <P>That so much of our young stock is exported live for fattening in other countries and sold within the EU is terrible.  This is a loss to the economy because we are not able to command the final price commanded by the locals.  This phenomenal situation has an effect.  As the Minister is aware, the decrease in livestock numbers will lead to job losses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The dairy industry has been able to deal with the situation the best.  Most dairy co-operatives are growing rather than retracting.  It is important that they be encouraged because they have diversified into various dairy products that are consumer-friendly and are accepted by consumers as being of a high quality.  In many cases, the benefit of Irish food over food from elsewhere in Europe is removed because many of our producers and processors are forced to sell their food without the Irish brand attached.  If they used the brand, they would meet objections within certain EU countries on the basis that their food comes from outside these countries.  In France the situation is almost impossible for Irish companies which produce a superior product, especially of beef or meat, because in many cases supermarkets will not label the product as Irish but rather as of EU origin.  On the opposite side Kerrygold butter commands a premium price in many parts of Europe.  Labelling is to be introduced.  If a product is to be labelled as European, it will be branded and carry such a logo.  In the United Kingdom the red tractor symbol is used for all home produced products and can only be used on products produced in England, Scotland and Wales.  These are the issues that lead to problems in production.  We must opt for &ldquo;Brand Ireland&rdquo; as proposed and gain acceptance for this across Europe.  If we are to have national branding, let us give those who want to buy national products the opportunity to buy them, but everybody should have the right to brand and sell their product within the European Union.</P>
        <P>We could all speak further on this issue.  All I will say is we want consensus on the direction we should take in the overall renegotiation of the CAP.  We do not want to see anyone coming out with negative proposals which might have an effect across the board.  We need to get people to realise that food security and quality and food production methods must all be taken into consideration in that renegotiation.</P>

        <P>I come from a provincial town in the midlands which is supported to a large degree by people who earn their living from agriculture.  What I understand about the CAP is that heretofore it supported rural communities and provided safe and healthy food at an affordable price for the peoples of the European Union.  The Minister has indicated he does not wish to refer to the draft CAP reform proposals, but they were leaked last week and I am somewhat disappointed he has not given his opinion on the flat rate system for the single farm payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>

	<P>Fair enough.  That is very welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I did so last May.  The document to which the Deputy referred which was aired in the public media was the leaked draft communication.  A draft document has been sent to the college, or the Commission, for consideration.  I do not know how accurate the information in the media is; I am sure there are some accuracies.  I do not mean to interrupt the Senator, but&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the clarification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>We could not give credence to the leaked draft document that has not been endorsed by the college.  When the Commissioner brings the document to the college, as a meeting of Commissioners is termed, it will not be finalised until the meeting of the Commission on 17 November and that afternoon it will be presented to the European Parliament.  That is the reason I am reluctant to comment on the leaked draft document.  I hope Senator McFadden can appreciate this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I do totally, but the Minister can also understand that the said leaked document will have caused huge insecurity.  I, therefore, welcome his assurance which will go a long way towards reassuring the farming people of Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a further point to be made in regard to the flat rate.  We expressed a very strong view against a flat rate payment.  The Commissioner was constrained in what he was able to say to us when he was with us last Friday week, but he ruled out a flat rate payment in as much as he was able to do.  We cannot say he did because it all has to go before the college; therefore, to a certain extent, there is speculation on all our parts, but I believe he has ruled out a flat rate payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I read the transcript of the debate and discussions the Minister had and it seemed very much above board.  The Commissioner appears to have been very forthcoming and supportive of the Minister&rsquo;s position.  I wish the Minister very well in the negotiations.  So far he has done a very good job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Fine Gael spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Doyle, noted, the CAP is a victim of its own success because so far it has provided for a very safe, healthy and traceable food supply in this country.  That is very important, especially having regard to what is happening in South America.  Traceability is crucially important.  I noted that when Deputy Aylward asked questions, he did not receive very satisfactory answers from the Commissioner.  We are very anxious we should not again face the issue of Brazilian beef.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to fight strongly in order that we will be able to say we know exactly where our food comes from, how it is produced and how safe it is.</P>
        <P>Coming as I do from a rural town, I am aware of the devastation caused by the collapse of construction and how important it is that we go back to our roots and values in producing food.  As some Members, including Senator Ellis, stated, we could very easily find ourselves in a <Col N="864"/>situation where we would not have enough food or only a six-day supply.  Compared to other countries such as Russia, for example, with its adverse weather conditions, we are very lucky to have the ability to produce food because of our wonderful soil and weather conditions, etc.  It is important, therefore, that we contribute to the bank of food available.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to try to reduce the bureaucracy and red tape which should be brought to an end because they are the scourge of so many farmers.  It costs  &euro;1,800 to have a matter reviewed, perhaps 10% to 15% of an entire budget.</P>
        <P>I highlight the very important value to the environment of the CAP and biodiversity.  Farmers have taken on board the need to ensure the protection of wildlife and biodiversity.</P>
        <P>I refer to another issue about which the Commissioner spoke, namely, sheep farming.  Many rural parts of the country are extraordinarily difficult to farm.  The Commissioner has stated sheep farming is not only about the production of food; he has guaranteed its protection in order to maintain a rural way of life in Ireland, which is welcome.  He spoke about the Leader programme, which was also welcome because under the programme many grants have been provided for many rural pursuits and other items that have helped to sustain and maintain rural communities.  He also mentioned forestry and rural development.  Forestry is of huge importance in dealing with out carbon footprint.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has stated he intends to put in place as large a package as possible to apply across Europe.  It is, therefore, incumbent on the Minister &mdash; God bless and save him &mdash; to fight as hard as he can for us. He certainly will have the backing of the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Andrew Doyle, Senator Bradford and I, as well as all of our colleagues, in securing as good a package as he can.</P>
      
        
        <P Just="Left">The Commissioner said specifics would be taken into account. Please God the Minister will be able to outline the specific circumstances necessary for Ireland to get as much as possible in the division of the pie.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The outcome of the coming negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy after 2013 will have far-reaching effects for Irish farmers, agriculture and the overall economy.  The Irish economy is more dependent on a successful outcome to these talks than any of the other 27 countries in the EU.  The recent report, Food Harvest 2020, has clearly set out a vision of how Irish agriculture can play a significant role in the recovery of the national economy.  It envisages that by 2020 the agri-food and fisheries sector will have increased the value of output from farming and fisheries by &euro;1.5 billion, value added output by &euro;3 billion and increased exports by a total value of &euro;12 billion or 42% compared to the 2007-09 period.  The Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, has set up an implementation committee and given a commitment to provide the necessary provisions for the implementation of the Food Harvest 2020 report.</P>
        <P>The existing CAP model has successfully maintained a production base on Irish farms and helped maintain the family farm structure here.  The traditional family farm structure, with a strong work ethos and a good production base, will enable Irish farming to achieve the goals set out in the Food Harvest 2020 report.  It is essential to the future welfare of this State that agriculture is supported with a strong CAP policy at EU level.  I was pleased to hear the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Dacian Ciolos, on his recent visit here <Col N="865"/>confirm that he was committed to maintaining a strong CAP for the whole of the EU and would fight to secure a strong budget for the CAP.</P>
        <P>The EU CAP budget must be maintained and the current Irish national envelope protected vigorously to ensure it is maintained in the new CAP post-2013.  The reduction in farm gate prices plus the increased costs of production have resulted in a decrease in production due to reduced profitability in the mainland based farming sector and the EU is now no longer self-sufficient in beef or sheep meat.  Farm subsidies under the CAP are essential as a guarantee of food security and as income support for the maintenance of the family farm structure as a way of maintaining rural communities.</P>
        <P>Recent events such as the volcanic eruptions and the reduction in the Russian wheat harvest due to drought have shown the importance of the EU having a secure supply of food, produced to the highest standards for all of its citizens.  The EU has to be careful that it does not become dependent on imports for its food supply, thereby risking a crisis in that regard.  The CAP is essential towards maintaining production of high quality food that has full traceability and safety and is produced to the highest animal welfare standards.</P>
        <P>The protection of the environment has been a key element of the CAP in the recent past.  This has successfully ensured that through schemes such as REPS, where farmers are rewarded for adopting practices to protect and enhance the environment, our countryside and rural communities are pleasant places to visit or live in.  It is important that this policy is maintained and that CAP supports the policies that enhance the environment while maintaining production capacity not only in the bigger regions but in all rural areas.  Such a policy will ensure that Ireland, with its extensive grass-based farming enterprise, will be competitive on EU and world markets.  In that way EU consumers will be assured of secure, safe and fully traceable food that meets the highest environmental and animal welfare standards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the revised CAP policy there must be supports to encourage those grass-based enterprises, which by their nature have low levels of profitability and benefit in particular the environment, in disadvantaged regions.  While I welcome the supports the Government has given to the suckler cow and sheep sectors, it is important that mechanisms should be established in CAP post-2013 to give additional supports to these sectors.  The dairy sector has been highlighted in Food Harvest 2020 because of its potential for significant growth after the abolition of the milk quota in 2015.  The commitment set a 50% growth increase in milk by 2020 as a realistic and achievable target.  This would increase output value at the farm gate by &euro;700 annually.  In the run-up to the abolition of the milk quota in 2015, there should be more flexibility at EU level.</P>
        <P>Significant capital investment in stock and buildings is needed on many dairy farms to reach the target increase in milk output.  Much of this investment will be undertaken in the lead-up period to the abolition of milk quotas.  We should campaign for the gradual dismantling of the milk quota regime during the lead-up period rather than wait for complete dismantling in 2015.  This would reduce the risk of superlevies for those who increase production during the lead-up period.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue in the House.  Securing of a strong CAP post-2013 will enhance the profitability of Irish and European agricultural and rural communities.  I am confident the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, and his team will secure a deal that will benefit Irish agriculture and the economy.</P>

There are no cows in Cork city but there are cows in Cork South-Central and they do produce milk.  It is important to place this issue in context.  Agri<Col N="866"/>culture is important to our country, and we should not classify it as purely a rural issue.  CAP reform has implications for employment and for communities.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>As I am sure it will be on Twitter later on, I offer my apologies.  I was struck by the comment in the Minister&rsquo;s speech that fair does not mean equal.  In closing, he said: &ldquo;[W]e have a long way to go before we arrive at a conclusion to these negotiations&rdquo;, and he is right.  I urge the Government to use the phrase famously used by the former Minister for Agriculture, Austin Deasy, when he said there must be no capitulation.  Ireland cannot capitulate when it comes to the CAP.</P>
        <P>Senator Carty spoke about various issues in agriculture.  Last year, 2009, was a desperate year for farmers, with bad weather and falls in prices and incomes, although I am glad to say that this year has seen some recovery.  We have seen a complete change in the development of agriculture in this country.  Despite the cost of living, farm incomes have declined.  Diversification has become the norm in agriculture, and more people are becoming dependent on jobs off the farm, which is regrettable.  Senator Carty also mentioned the importance of the REP scheme and the role it played in rural Ireland, and he was right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A question that must be dealt with by the Minister and in whose answer there must be no obfuscation is whether we want cheap food or food security.  This issue was mentioned by Senators Carty and Bradford and is related to the debate on traceability and South American beef.  We must protect Irish consumers and farmers.  The discussions on the CAP are probably the most important we will ever have in an agricultural context.  All Members agree, I hope, that a strong Common Agricultural Policy is critical in ensuring the consumers of Ireland and of the EU have confidence in the produce they are buying.  We must strike a balance to ensure the economic future of our farmers in areas such as Ballygarvan, Crosshaven, Minane Bridge and Ballinhassig in Cork South-Central, as well as Mayo, Galway and other counties, is assured.  That is why it is important a fair and stable income is ensured for farmers in all these areas under the CAP.</P>
        <P>During the recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Andrew Doyle stated that Ireland needs to export 80% of what it produces and that the industry supports 250,000 jobs, which is a very large number.  That is the context in which this debate and the wider debate on the CAP takes place.  It would be wrong to focus on the CAP as primarily an issue for farmers, although it is.  It also deals with climate change, animal welfare, environmental protection, and the economic development of our country.  Senators <Col N="867"/>Carty and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in will not agree with me on this but Government policy has let down rural Ireland, and that needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford spoke about the issue of food supplies and the elimination of food shortages.  We must protect the quality of the food we produce and sell to consumers.  I would love to have a wider debate on the issue of food quality.  We can have a consensus, to use a word we have heard many times in the House today, on this decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should keep going.  He is doing well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am all for consensus, as Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in knows well.  Farmers also have a responsibility in this regard.  I commend the farming community and the IFA on the role they have played in the CAP discussions and the reasonable approach they have taken.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has stated that the priority must be to secure a national envelope of farm payments and protect the single farm payment.  This is critical in terms of protecting the family farm structure which is at the core of rural Irish society.  Listening to Senator Carty&rsquo;s contribution, I wondered what de Valera&rsquo;s comely maidens would have made of modern rural society.  Those times have changed but farming must still play a vibrant role in our society, and it can help us trade our way into economic recovery.  Support for farmers will help us to achieve our aims in rural Ireland and in the agricultural sector.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear the discussion at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with Commissioner Ciolos.  I am not sure how to pronounce his name because I am not good at foreign languages, apart from Gaeilge, although some would argue that our approach to the Irish language is not correct because it is not a foreign language.  The fact that we have not helped promote the Irish language at EU level is symptomatic of the problem we have with trade.  This was mentioned on the Order of Business by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  We have lost our sense of Irishness partly because agriculture has changed.  We have not promoted the Irish perspective on agriculture or the idea of producing food in an environmentally friendly way.  We have great produce but we should make more use of Bord Bia.  Commissioner Ciolos focused on the areas of quantity, quality and diversity in food production, and I agree with his comments.</P>
        <P>The agriculture sector is worth &euro;1.8 billion and supports a quarter of a million jobs.  Exports are critical to the economy and we need to ensure they are of the highest quality.  It rests with our producers, farmers and all those involved to ensure the Irish brand, whether it is on our beef, our lamb or our dairy products, is indicative of the highest quality.  Irish products should be gold-star quality.  I hope that CAP reform will lead to the enhancement and protection of our agriculture sector for the benefit of consumers.</P>
        <P>I conclude by quoting Austin Deasy, who said there can be no capitulation on behalf of the Irish farmer and the Irish consumer.  It is too important.  We are an island nation on the edge of Europe and it is important we have consensus on CAP reform, but it is also important that Ireland is not left behind by its fellow member states.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The consensus that is emerging here is quite important.  It is crucial that we all support the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to obtain the maximum for this country from any discussions at a European level.  I have heard various Senators discussing the wearing of the green jersey in the negotiations, and it is not a great difficulty for me to do that.</P>
        <P>The CAP developed as a result of a food security crisis following the Second World War.  The purpose of the CAP under the Treaty of Rome was to secure food, stabilise markets and increase productivity and quality of food.  It has achieved these goals to a large extent.  The proportion of the EU budget devoted to the CAP was roughly 48% in 2006 and it is due to be cut to 32% of the budget by 2013.  There are many challenges facing us in Ireland because the agriculture and food industry in this county is very important, and much more important than it is in many other EU member states.  The British jokingly talked about doing away with their food industry because it was roughly 1% of their total output.  That is not a joke we could make here because the industry is intrinsically a part of everything that we are.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Exports from Ireland are doing well at the moment.  Food exports traditionally represent about 8% of the export market, which is very significant indeed.  Senator Buttimer stated that roughly 10% of our workforce are employed in this industry, about 250,000 people.  The figure is a very sustainable part of our employment, so we need to underpin it.  I notice from the <i>Irish Farmers Journal </i> that the Commissioner is talking about different options.  The word &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; seems to be consistently coming to the fore and we in the Green Party definitely support that.  Sustainability is the way things need to go.  We need a sustainable food sector.</P>
        <P>We need to ensure that biodiversity and locally produced food are encouraged in agriculture policy.  In order to sustain vibrant rural communities, it is important that people do not depend on monocultures or industries that may disappear overnight.  It is important that we diversify.  We wish to encourage a greater degree of forestry, horticulture and organic food production.  This leads to my point about the ongoing debate of quality versus cost.  This is seen as a clean, green island by many people across the world and products such as Irish beef get premium prices in many countries.  It is quite important that we maintain that image and that we concentrate on biodiversity, and on the quality of our food.</P>
        <P>Our grass based system for livestock is quite unique and it allows us to maintain premium prices.  We already have products that are world leaders.  I worked for Baileys Irish Cream, which is a fantastic product.  It is often not seen as a dairy product, but the quality of that cream is second to none.  People have also mentioned Kerrygold, but there are many other brands and agribusinesses here.</P>
        <P>Low level sustainability is very important and local farmers&rsquo; co-operatives, markets and food movements are vital.  We should try to encourage people to buy food locally.  There is nothing worse than seeing potatoes being shipped out of Ireland, passing a ship that is bringing potatoes into Ireland.  It is crazy that broccoli and flowers are flown in from South America.  Flying agricultural produce around the world is not a good idea.</P>
        <P>We need to look at environmental standards when assessing quality.  We need to examine the notion that we can sell food in this country that does not adhere to the same environmental standards that we demand of our own producers.  The EU needs to look at this in a big way.  I appreciate there are international treaties on world trade, but we need to ensure the standards we demand of our own producers are equalled by those who are importing into Europe.</P>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy was first negotiated under the Treaty of Rome.  We came into the EU and the CAP was already in place, but we signed up to the Common Fisheries Policy after that.  About &euro;200 billion worth of fish has been taken out of Irish waters between 1974 and 2004, and that has not always been done sustainably.  That is a huge amount of money <Col N="869"/>and if the CAP is being cut, then we might need to look at the Common Fisheries Policy again.  There was a bit of a trade off at the time by the then Fine Gael leader, Garret FitzGerald.  If we are to see a reduction in the CAP we need to look at the fisheries policy again.</P>
        <P>People were talking to me today about bio-fuels.  We need to look at alternative methods for farm families to make an income through sustainable energy, green energy and ecotourism.  The future of Irish farming is not guaranteed, but we need to look at what is happening and do our utmost to support the Irish farm family on the land.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an phl&eacute; seo.  Is &eacute; seo an cine&aacute;l &aacute;bhair a bh&iacute; pl&eacute;ite go m&oacute;r ag an gcomhdh&aacute;il treas-Teorainn i gContae an D&uacute;in an deireadh seachtain seo caite.</P>
        <P>CAP reform was one of the big items discussed at the all Ireland parliamentary conference.  It is one of the areas where we can all agree, both North and South.  We need to benefit in the best way possible from the discussions on reforming the Common Agriculture Policy after 2013.  This is very important, given the drastic fall in farm incomes in recent years.  In 2009 farm incomes fell by 30% and average farm income is well below the average industrial wage.  It was interesting and welcome to note that Commissioner Ciolos, when he met members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food here two weeks ago, assured them that there would be no threat to direct payments.  He also stressed the need to preserve the European model of farming based on family farms and the centrality of food security for the future of the CAP and European farming.</P>
        <P>While my party and the farming organisations welcomed the introduction of decoupling and the advent of the single farm payment in 2003, it has not proven to be the panacea that many thought it would be.  While it has provided a certain level of income security, it is not sufficient to maintain farm families.  Nor have the market opportunities that were promised once payments were decoupled from subsidies and premiums in most cases materialised.  It has been somewhat of a missed opportunity and not what we expected in 2003.  The average single farm payment for most farmers is extremely low and a small percentage of larger producers receive the vast bulk of payments.  This has led many, including my party, to look at the structure of payments, which needs to be central to the negotiations on the post-2013 reform package.</P>
        <P>There are issues related to modulation on low payments, with a large proportion of the payments going to a small number of people many of whom, disgracefully, are not farmers at all, but agribusinesses which have acquired entitlements.  We will certainly be proposing changes both on a lower limit, below which modulation does not take place, and on an upper limit on the amount to which one single person or business ought to be entitled.</P>
        <P>There are other issues affecting food security.  Although the threat that seemed to be posed by the WTO proposals made by the former European Commissioner, Lord Mandelson, appear to have abated, it is vital that the EU ensures the CAP does not become a sacrificial lamb &mdash; pardon the pun &mdash; in any wider trade agreement.  That is vital not only in order to protect the interests of farmers but also to avoid having much of Europe&rsquo;s food supplies sourced from outside Europe.  Given that food security was the motivation behind the CAP in the first instance when the memory of the food shortages after 1945 were still very much alive, it would be criminal if that threat was revived as a consequence of a simplistic adherence to the so called &ldquo;free market&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The next reform of the CAP must also reconsider how farmers might be encouraged to engage in new forms of production, which was claimed to be one of the key factors behind the introduction of the decoupled single farm payment.  Farmers could take advantage of a number of areas both in food and in areas such as bio-fuels with the income security provided by the <Col N="870"/>single farm payment.  However, as I have said, that does not appear to be the case in the vast majority of instances.</P>
        <P>Domestic policy of course also has a part to play but we have been slow in devising a new strategy since 2003 to capitalise on new opportunities.  That has been addressed in two reports by my party colleagues, Deputy Ferris, who produced a report on farming post-decoupling in the west, and Deputy Morgan, who produced a report for his committee on the potential represented by the agrifood sector.  We need to reread those reports, which were adopted by all the parties in those committees, to establish how we can start to implement them.</P>
        <P>We need to focus on where we can gain comparative advantage, which needs to be a factor as we engage in the debate which is taking place on the 2013 reform.  I trust there will be close co-operation between the Departments and Ministers with responsibility for agriculture on both sides of the Border in the interests of farmers throughout the island.</P>
        <P>It was a unique experience to be in Newcastle, County Down, with 120 parliamentarians agreeing on a common framework.  While certain issues separated us in the past, on agriculture we had a senior Unionist, who has been an MEP for many years, and the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Michelle Gildernew, MP, MLA, talking about the threats and challenges that face us as an island after 2013 with both reaching agreement.  We need to capitalise on that aspect and approach the issue of what will happen post-2103 from an all-island perspective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte riomh an Aire St&aacute;it, Deputy Cuffe.  I believe it is my first opportunity to welcome him in his new capacity.  On a separate issue I compliment him on the initiatives he has taken on planning and the hopeful elimination of ghost estates, with which my county has been blighted as the Acting Chairman, Senator Leyden, will testify, living as he does in that part of the world, but sin ceist eile.</P>
        <P>When it comes to agriculture matters, colleagues on all sides of the House wear the green jersey, primarily because agriculture has been good for the country.  Since 1973 it has been the driving force, particularly in the rural economy where the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy has filtered down to every town and village.  This is sometimes forgotten in the argument about farmers gaining money for doing very little.  The reality is that towns such as my own, Drumshanbo, and many others in the west and rural areas in general would not have been able to survive without having the farming hinterland, where in recent years, particularly since decoupling, minimum payments have ensured the viability and survival of rural families.  If the political philosophy is that people should stay in so far as possible within the areas in which they have grown up, which is one of the objectives of the spatial strategy, why should it be any different in terms of agricultural supports?</P>
        <P>As mentioned by other Members, leaked Commission proposals have raised quite a storm.  For example, today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Farming Independent</i> reports:</P>
        <P LI="1">The IFA has called on the Government to &ldquo;totally oppose&rdquo; the CAP reform proposals contained in the leaked communication from the EU Commission.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">IFA president John Bryan claimed the Commission proposals would be devastating for the single farm payment for productive farms across all enterprises.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">&ldquo;The proposals would seriously undermine agricultural production in Ireland, with damaging consequences for the rural economy, agricultural output, food exports, jobs and farm incomes.  They must be rejected by the Government,&rdquo; he said.</P><Col N="871"/>
        <P FLI="0">From what I can glean, while it is very open in its generalities, it is short on details.  I presume this is because the budget elements of the new CAP regime have yet to be worked out.  While I understand the draft leaked documents have not received the formal approval of the Commission, they give an indication of its thinking.</P>
        <P>Most people would be concerned about the abolition of market support and income support measures, phasing out direct payments, giving only limited payments for environmental public goods &mdash; the term now being used, although not yet defined &mdash; and for specific natural constraint payments.  I agree with commentators that the agriculture committee in making its submission to the relevant DG seems to have one eye on the financial implications of the CAP in the current economic climate while on the other hand trying to provide some sort of reassurance that the money to be provided to farmers would have a public good element to it, with a more enhanced environmental programme.  Be that as it may, it will obviously mean more cost impositions on the farming community, especially here.  While on the face of it the sentiment behind the proposal, if it becomes effective, is to have a more equal distribution of the Common Agricultural Policy across European agriculture, one of the side aspects is of particular concern to me.  Declan O&rsquo;Brien, the farming editor of the <i>Farming Independent</i>, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">One proposal mooted is that member states would get a guaranteed percentage (possibly 75-80%) of the current EU average SFP of &euro;215/ha.  This would be a major boost [if it were to be applied across eastern European countries].</P>
        <P FLI="0">That seems to be the thrust of much of what the leaked proposals suggest about equality of distribution income.  He further stated that if that were to be the case and if it were to be implemented: &ldquo;For a country such as Romania where farmers get an average payment of &euro;31/ha, this would be a major boost.&rdquo;  I share the view and obviously the IFA and a number of MEPs who have spoken share the view that &ldquo;such a move would have to be financed by cutting payments to western EU members, and Ireland might not escape&rdquo;.  There are worrying aspects to the leaked proposals.  The fact that they have been leaked is a blessing in disguise because at least it gives all those involved in agriculture and those who represent them &mdash; the IFA and the MEPs &mdash; an opportunity to reflect on what is stated in the leaked proposals and how to debate them rather than be ambushed by them.</P>
        <P>I refer to comments made by the Agriculture Commissioner on his recent visit to Ireland.  He stated: &ldquo;The visit is very useful as it gives me a chance to learn more about Irish agriculture just as we are drawing up our blueprint on the future of the Common Agriculture Policy.&rdquo;  He said they hope to publish ideas in mid-November.  I presume those are the ideas that have now been leaked to the media.  He went on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1">Agriculture is not only important for its considerable contribution to supplying European citizens with safe and sufficient food, but it also provides increasingly important environmental benefits to society, for example, in Ireland, through the grass-based, extensive livestock tradition.  From a broader perspective, too, agriculture remains a major factor in maintaining the social fabric and landscape of rural areas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Commissioner further stated: &ldquo;I believe these benefits give us good arguments to support a strong, forward-looking CAP after 2013.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am especially pleased the Commissioner referred to the social fabric and landscape of rural areas.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy and the continuance of the support systems for those living in rural Ireland.  I do not want to be the rural equivalent of my good friend and colleague, Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor from Tallaght, in that every time an opportunity arises I put County Leitrim on the map, although my late father, <Col N="872"/>God be good to him, who sat in the Seanad at one time was admonished by the Chair, the late, great Patrick Lindsay, that he would rule him out of order if he was to refer to Drumshanbo yet again in another contribution.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator White.  I would like to continue partially in that tradition because if we take not just County Leitrim but the entire western area and the midlands, which are under the severely disadvantaged scheme, there is nothing else for rural families, particularly with the downturn in our economic circumstances.  Sadly, the only option now facing our educated children is to go abroad if they cannot find work here or to go on unemployment assistance, which is putting extra pressure on the Government&rsquo;s budgetary policies.</P>
        <P>There was a time when the safety valve of emigration was available but I suggest it is no longer available.  The English speaking countries to which the Irish tended to gravitate &mdash; England, Canada, America, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia &mdash; are closing their doors increasingly.  It is almost impossible now to get into the United States of America legally, although there are legal options, but it is increasingly difficult.  We are faced with a position where we need to sustain rural families and the best way of doing that is to support forward thinking and progressive views on the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
        <P>We hear, on the one hand, that the big challenges for this century will be climate change and food and that there may be food wars over the quantity of food because of burgeoning population, yet, on the other, we have a unique, grassland-based agricultural economy which we seem to be taking steps towards dismantling with questionable policies towards our new European colleagues in eastern Europe where farming technology has yet to catch up.  I do not want to go into that area in too much detail other than to say that all of the indications are that we in Ireland have got a very bright future in terms of agriculture.  Several statements have been made in that regard both by the farming organisations and the Minister, Deputy Smith, who I compliment on the initiatives he has taken, the public support he continues to give to the Irish farming industry, and the engagement that has taken place between him and the farming organisations with a view to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s case is strongly fought for in Europe.  I want to put that on the record of the House.  Media commentators who know nothing about agriculture and would not know one end of a cow from another sometimes make liberal comments about the actions of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as if they were somehow experts in that area.</P>
        <P>As recently as today the Minister referred to the Irish beef industry as being the fourth largest beef exporter in the world, with 90% of our output exported.  This gives another indication and a wider economic view of the reason this country needs the economic recession to end and consumer confidence internationally to kick-start the world economies because we have to export 85% to 90% of what we produce.</P>
        <P>The quote I am about to give is only about the beef industry.  I am pleased that at least the milk industry has got a very bright future.  Irish grain farmers also have benefited enormously from the increase in world prices this year.  I am aware that when one door closes, another opens.  The increase is mainly because of the downturn in the wheat harvest in Russia.  Speaking at the Beef Expo Ireland 2010 event in Kilkenny, the Minister said:</P>
        <P LI="1">[M]ore than 5,000 people [are] employed directly in the processing sector, which purchases the output of some 80,000 farmers, and exports a high quality, indigenous Irish product with an annual export value of &euro;1.5 billion.  Ireland&rsquo;s future economic growth will be driven by <Col N="873"/>exports of goods and services which will generate jobs directly in the provision of those goods and services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He also referred to: &ldquo;a farm sector providing a sound basis for sustaining vibrant rural communities and an indigenous processing industry providing secure employment as well as providing key linkages to a sophisticated international market place&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We are at the cutting edge of the food industry.  We have a wonderful name and a great international food brand.  I hope the combined efforts of the Government, MEPs and farming organisations will ensure that when the detailed discussions on the CAP commence, as they will do shortly, we will all wear the green jersey and ensure it is not a case of giving free money to farmers but of sustaining and developing the Irish agriculture sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood, fisheries and forestry is our largest indigenous industry.  Collectively, the industry employes 250,000 people either directly or indirectly and has an annual output in excess of &euro;24 billion, including an &euro;8 billion export industry.</P>
        <P>Three significant reports on agriculture, food and forestry have been launched in the past three months, one of which is Food Harvest 2020 &mdash; a vision for the Irish Agri-food and Fisheries by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment produced a report entitled, What is Required to Expand Employment in the Agri-food Sector?  The other report was produced by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, and is entitled, Trading and Investment in a Smart Economy.</P>
        <P>There are 250,000 people employed either directly or indirectly in the agrifood industry and it is an &euro;8 billion export industry.  The agrifood industry is indigenous in nature, has a regional focus and is international in orientation.  We are recognised internationally as a strong food producing nation.</P>
        <P>We have had good news in recent months with the improving exchange rate.  We have increased meat export volumes and a stronger export performance in the beverage, dairy and seafood sectors.  During the first five months of 2010 the value of exports was more than 8% higher than a year earlier at almost &euro;3 billion.  The rate of recovery has accelerated as the year has progressed, with exports up to May some 23% ahead of the same month in 2009.</P>
        <P>As every business person who is exporting understands, the exchange rate with sterling has been fairly bad in recent years but sterling is currently 6% stronger against the euro compared with this time last year.  Likewise, the US dollar is currently 12% stronger against the euro relative to September 2009.  Even if one is not exporting directly to the United States, many countries deal in the US dollar for their imports.</P>
        <P>Until we joined the European Union in 1973, the agri-food sector was based on small-scale and co-operative businesses engaged mainly in exporting live animals and basic commodities.  With EEC membership, the sector experienced substantial change and expansion of market efficiency in production facilities, technological development and improvement in market access and distribution systems.  A recent report by IBEC showed that Ireland was the biggest net exporter of beef and lamb in the European Union, the largest supplier of food and drink to Britain and produced 15% of total global output of infant formula.  Less than 17% of raw materials was imported by the sector, compared with a figure of over 60% for manufacturing generally.</P>
        <P>The challenges facing the agri-food sector include changes to CAP and WTO arrangements.  On 1 October I had the pleasure of attending the meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with the EU Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Ciolos.  The Com<Col N="874"/>missioner stated Ireland and the European Union shared two fundamental ideas, first, that the EU agriculture sector needed a strong CAP and, second, with tongue in cheek, a heavy purse makes a light heart, as can be seen in Ireland.  In other words, getting money from the European Union lifts our hearts and makes life easier for farmers and those involved in the food industry.  He also said a broad public debate on the future of the CAP had ended in July.  During the public debate, in response to questions about why we needed the CAP in the first place, the various contributors identified seven major challenges, namely, food security, the competitiveness of agriculture, globalisation, environmental change, territorial balance, diversity and simplicity.</P>
        <P>Based on the discussions with EU member states, the Commissioner said we could summarise the main objectives of the CAP as falling into three main priorities, the first being food production.  Food security presents one of the biggest challenges the world faces in the years ahead.  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization forecasts that global food demand will increase by 50% by 2030 and double by 2050.  The strategic importance of agriculture will increase significantly.  All 27 EU countries have a responsibility towards the citizens of the world.  We should maintain our capacity to help countries facing challenges in feeding their citizens without blocking the growth of their agriculture industries.  Two months ago I was part of a humanitarian mission to Malawi where I saw for myself the bare existence of the people.  It is our responsibility not to do anything that would prove detrimental to such countries and to let them develop their agriculture industries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our second main priority is to deal with environmental change, namely, climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity and depletion of soil.  Farmers are the first to be affected by climate change and extreme weather conditions.  Commissioner Ciolos has said agriculture can provide a major response to all of these challenges.  To fight them, we must maintain our production capacity throughout Europe, thereby ensuring a sustainable use of natural resources.</P>
        <P>Our third main priority is to maintain the vitality of rural areas.  The CAP, with its two pillar structure, allows for coherence between approaches in supporting agriculture and rural areas in Europe.  The first pillar would be our response to the major challenges, common to all EU member states, such as social, economic, environmental and territorial challenges.  The first pillar would provide support for all European farmers on an annual basis.  The second would concern the development of our agriculture sector and territories, addressing climate change and contributing to the sustainable management of natural resources.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner has said there is a crystal clear truth, namely, that direct payments are crucial for the future of European agriculture.  The direct payments provide income support for farmers.  The ways they are distributed will be adjusted, but the principle is not under discussion.  Direct payments are indispensable to ensure the sustainability of agriculture across Europe.  Without them, agricultural production would decline severely in vulnerable sectors or regions.  The economic and social damage would be considerable and the Commissioner has said he does not imagine for one moment that we are ready to take this risk.</P>
        <P>That said, Commissioner Ciolos did not advocate continuation of the <i>status quo</i>.  In these troubled times we have to make the CAP Europe&rsquo;s investment in its future.  This will not be the case if the support for our farmers is based on what they did in the past.  Direct payments must evolve towards better targeting of active farmers in order to optimise the use of public funds &mdash; this is on the agenda of the IFA in the form of payments to reward active farmers.  These payments must better reflect the care farmers take of the environment, thereby providing stronger incentives to engage in sustainable farming, but must also retain the elements of income support for the many farmers who need it.</P><Col N="875"/>
        <P>The reformed CAP must move to a system where taxpayers can understand what farmers are doing for them.  Under the current system there are considerable differences in the rate of aid farmers receive from one member state to another, which will not be justifiable in the period after 2013.  Direct payments must be more equitably distributed among member states, regions and forms of agriculture.  The aim of the 27 countries of the European Union is to bring forward a balanced solution acceptable to all member states.  We will not solve problems in some countries by creating difficulties in others.</P>
        <P>Another issue raised by the IFA is that of retaining market support measures to minimise the effects on farm incomes of price volatility.  The Commissioner has said the volatility and speculation in the markets have never had as much impact on farmers, processors and consumers.  The European Union must ensure hyper-speculation is not jeopardising entire sectors of agriculture.  New tools have to be put in place within the reformed CAP to address this extreme volatility in prices and farm incomes.  We need more progress on the question of distribution of bargaining power within the food chain.</P>
        <P>The future CAP will need stronger rural development programmes which will have to accompany agriculture on the path of modernisation, adaptation to climate change and innovation.  Agriculture has a crucial multi-functional role to play in all of the territory of the European Union.  I am confident that in the hands of the Minister, Deputy Smith, and Commissioner Ciolos we will have a reformed and successful Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe.  I am always glad to have an opportunity to discuss the Common Agricultural Policy, particularly as someone who does not have the same vested interest as someone who has a direct interest in agriculture.  However, as an Irish person, I have an interest in one of our most important indigenous industries and, more importantly, in how it will be developed.</P>
        <P>The last speaker referred to the Commissioner stating he was not interested in maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, an interesting remark which is to be welcomed.  Senator Bradford spoke about how the CAP was probably the single most successful initiative to be undertaken by the European Union in terms of food security and related issues.  I am sure the Senator has looked at this issue in depth and it is remarkable that a policy has been so phenomenally successful.</P>
        <P>I was also interested in what Senator Ellis had to say, namely, that the CAP had been hugely successful for some.  I know it has modernised Irish agriculture in the years since we joined the European Union.</P>
      
        <P>However, in many instances rich farmers received more money, while poor farmers were not left exactly thriving.  That is what interests me about the review of the CAP.  Who will get the money?  It is important to find out who will benefit from a revised CAP.  I am not very familiar with the language used, but I assume that when people talk about active farmers, they are referring to individuals who are farming themselves, not running a large-scale business.  However, even in that regard, there is a contradiction.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about how he had brought the Commissioner to visit a farm and Senator Carty said he was pleased that the Commissioner had the opportunity to see an Irish farm because our system of farming was essentially based on the family farm.  There is a small challenge involved in this instance.  I prefer to use the word &ldquo;challenge&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;contradiction&rdquo;, because I do not wish to say something is negative.  The Minister has spoken about what is really important and said the future of agriculture in Ireland is competitiveness, on which everybody is agreed.  Given that there is one common policy, I assume the Minister is referring to how European agricultural policy operates in the international context.  It must be competitive, yet our system, as acknowledged by other speakers who are more familiar with these <Col N="876"/>matters than me, is based on the family farm structure which is inherently uncompetitive.  It is a smaller operation.  There is a challenge in that regard which the Minister must face.  Senator Ellis put the matter well when he asked if we were considering food security or the production of cheap food.  Regardless, we cannot ignore the issue of competitiveness.  It must be the byword in a small economy such as Ireland&rsquo;s which is so export focused.  We must be competitive, but I accept that it will be more of a challenge in the context of our family farm structure.</P>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy as it applies to Ireland is not just about food production but also about rural livelihoods, the issue of sustainability and the challenge agriculture poses in terms of climate change, an issue in which the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, would have an interest.  We are making a good deal of progress in that regard, but it is something we must bear in mind.  The Common Agricultural Policy is about rural development and how we sustain economies, particularly in local, peripheral and marginalised communities.  These are places in which there are no great alternative employment opportunities; working the land is the one way in which people can provide for themselves.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is good to have a debate in the House.  I get the impression that the Minister is on top of his brief.  I get that impression as somebody who is not deeply involved in the agricultural sphere, although I take an interest in it.  I listened to him during the summer when he attended his local show, the Virginia Show.  I am sorry I did not know it was on because I would have liked to attend it.  I will make a point of going next year.  I think he is very impressive on what he is doing for the sector, his vision for developing the agri-food business and recognising the cachet Ireland has in the industry.  Others have spoken about how we are excluded from putting our best foot forward in so far as we are precluded from identifying a product as Irish, which is a hindrance.  We must examine how we should seek to change this.  I believe the Minister is very keen on expanding and modernising the agriculture sector.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford has spoken about the image we have of the CAP and said the main problem with the policy is that it needs a good public relations team to sell it well.  I agree.  Far too many who are not directly involved with the sector see the policy in a negative light.  I will not repeat the negatives Senator Bradford outlined because repetition gives them perpetual life.  It is necessary to convey a clearer message about what is good in the CAP and outline the facts about agricultural expenditure in the European Union.  It would be very beneficial for engaging people who are not directly involved in the sector on the importance of using our country to best effect in developing what we are good at in the sector, for example, beef production, and letting us do it.</P>
        <P>Although the Minister engaged directly with one of the previous speakers when she sought clarification on one of the issues in the leak today, it is a little disappointing that there is not more toing and froing in the debate.  This is only a criticism of the system we use in the House.  It is important to have some dialogue, particularly for Members who are not representatives of the agriculture sector, and to give them an opportunity to have an input into what is happening as regards such an important element of industrial policy in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome my county colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, to the Seanad for this debate.  This will be a pivotal issue for Ireland in the next couple of years.  Agriculture has regained significance with the downturn in the economy.  It is an indigenous and well organised industry that continues to offer potential for Ireland.  We talk about changes that will happen under the Common Agricultural Policy after 2013, but we should also talk about the history of agriculture in Ireland in the last 50 years.</P><Col N="877"/>
        <P>Technological changes on the farm where food is produced have been massive.  There has also been massive Government intervention in the agriculture sector by a number of Governments during the years.  This has improved food production, the quality of that production and the quality of the product we supply to European markets.  That technological change has occurred across the sector.  In agri-business there have been massive changes in food processing and marketing.  In earlier years we produced food, processed it very marginally and exported it.  Now there is massive value added to the produce we export.  However, there is still scope for Ireland to develop its agriculture business, give support to indigenous producers, both small and big, and maximise the return for the economy.</P>
        <P>The agricultural co-operatives were the mainstay of Ireland&rsquo;s agri-business for most of the 20th century.  Then the public limited companies, PLCs, came into being.  They are now seeking to disconnect themselves from the co-operatives from which they emerged.  This offers both threats and opportunities to agriculture for the future.  We should hold a separate debate on the future role of co-operatives and PLCs.  It must be acknowledged that one of the biggest changes in agriculture, with potential to improve the economy in terms of job creation and adding value to product, is the emergence of many small indigenous producers of very specialised products.  They have great scope for development in export markets if they are given support by the Government.  However, they are hindered because they have neither the capital nor the wherewithal to market their products.</P>
        <P>I refer to another great visionary of Irish business, Sir Anthony O&rsquo;Reilly, who is now better known for his role in Independent News and Media, but he started his career in the agribusiness sector with Kerrygold.  He was one of the first to catapult it into the international marketplace.  We need more people with his vision with a focus on the value-added products of the numerous small producers involved.</P>
        <P>The post-CAP period will entail significant changes in the agribusiness sector.  The Minister of State is well aware there will be significant cuts in the overall CAP budget and changes in how the money is spent.  The European Union has been enlarged and the new accession countries have underdeveloped agriculture sectors.  These countries will be looking for an increased share of a smaller pie.  Ireland must, therefore, make a strong case for itself if good support from the European Union is to continue to be received under the Common Agricultural Policy.  We must emphasise the importance of the rural economy, the role played by agriculture in rural Irish life and in the social fabric of communities.  Our society is not as urbanised as in many other European countries.  We still have a significant rural community whose way of life which must be protected.</P>
        <P>We must also protect the quality of Irish food.  We cannot compete against the produce of other countries outside the European Union.  This is often overlooked by the Union because it wants to find sources of cheaper food.  For example, an Irish cow or any Irish animal has a quality passport, but the same does not apply in other countries supplying significant amounts of produce to the European market.  There should be stricter regulations for food labelling.  A chicken produced in Ireland is subject to significant quality controls and standards of animal welfare, yet the same standards do not apply to chickens imported from Thailand and other countries in the Far East.  Such chickens are imported into a European country, re-labelled and sold as produce of that country.  We cannot compete with such produce.  The Minister of State needs to fight for our produce when he goes to the European Union and insist that these other products be clearly labelled for what they are.  European citizens should be asked if this is the quality of food they wish to buy or whether a higher standard should be insisted upon.  Food security is important.  We should insist that the basic staples within the food chain be protected and that quality control should form part of the process to ensure food security.  We should <Col N="878"/>ensure a quality product is available to the European consumer, as we do not wish to have health scares in the future following the importation of food of dubious quality.</P>
        <P>There is a constant battle between producers and processors; the family farm is competing with agribusiness to see who receives the lion&rsquo;s share of the price received for the final product.  The supermarkets are regarded as the winners by earning the highest profits from the sale of family farm products; however, there are a number of middlemen who also make a profit.  We must try to ensure everybody receives his or her fair share for what is produced on Irish farms, otherwise the business cannot be developed.  There is no point in just one sector of the food chain benefiting from the profits and perhaps putting the family farm out of business, which would result in the production of a lower quality product from another country.</P>
        <P>We have many issues to deal with in the agriculture sector and the Minister should deal with them, as well as the major changes in the Common Agricultural Policy post-2013.  This is the biggest single issue we will face because it will have such a massive effect on the potential incomes of family farms, but the other issues are just as important because they can help to sustain and develop our agribusiness, of which we are rightly proud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a very productive and interesting debate on the CAP post-2013.  I thank Senators for their constructive contributions.</P>
        <P>Before concluding the debate and responding to the comments made, I refer to a very important initiative in Irish agriculture.  The Department has recently published Food Harvest 2020, an ambitious but realistic strategy for smart, green growth in the Irish agrifood sector in the next ten years.  Together, agriculture, food, fisheries and forestry represent Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry, which sector is of vital importance to the national economy and rural society.  There are notable social, economic and environmental interdependencies stretching the length and breadth of the country.  The industry is responsible for 150,000 jobs and has an annual output of approximately &euro;24 billion, with a significant export orientation running into several billion euro.  The Food Harvest 2020 report was developed as a cohesive roadmap for the industry in order to build capacity, adapt to the challenge and grow in the context of emerging opportunities in the years to come.</P>
        <P>Food Harvest 2020 is not merely a Government initiative but was developed in collaboration with the agrifood sector and its delivery will be driven by that sector.  It is based on the premise of smart, green growth; smart in the sense of embracing innovation and new technologies; green in the sense of capitalising on Ireland&rsquo;s environmental credentials; growth in the sense of efficient and environmentally sustainable production, delivering significant growth and allowing the sector to play a key part in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  The CAP will be a key instrument underpinning this ambition.  The negotiations on the future CAP are, therefore, of great importance to the country.  We are all agreed on the need for a strong and well funded EU agricultural policy in the future.  There is also consensus in this House that this policy must support sustainable and competitive agriculture, notably the development of our vision for the sector as espoused in Food Harvest 2020.</P>
        <P>Dealing first with the funding issues, there will be stiff competition on a number of fronts to ensure Ireland receives its appropriate share of the available funds.  The first challenge will be to secure an acceptable EU budget and the second will be to ensure the share going to agriculture will be sufficient to provide a strong and supportive agricultural policy.  The third challenge will be to ensure the share of agricultural funds going to Ireland will be adequate for our needs, as emphasised recently and referred to by Senator Twomey.  One of our priorities in the negotiations will be to preserve the Irish national envelope.</P><Col N="879"/>
        <P>Our primary aim is to secure a direct payment system that will provide our fair share of funding and which will support the viability of Irish farming.  I note the claims from some member states for a redistribution of funds.  While we are prepared to consider all options, we will require partners to be equally realistic in their expectations.  It is important in the negotiations that we use the most accurate basis for comparison of funding levels, that is to say, eligible area.  We must also use the current distribution mechanism as our starting point.  We are opposed to an EU-wide flat rate payment because farming is very different across the 27 member states.  Ultimately, we want a distribution mechanism that is fair, underpins competitiveness and sustainability and takes into account the wide diversity in costs of farming across the European Union.</P>
        <P>We favour the two pillar structure with direct payments and market support measures in pillar one and rural development measures in pillar two.  A primary purpose of pillar one payments should be to support and stabilise farm income.  As for direct payments, we support the continuation of direct payments decoupled from production.  This model has been applied in Ireland since 2005 and allowed our farmers to respond to market signals backed by the safety net of the single farm payment.  We also wish to have flexibility in the distribution of funds within member states, as is currently the case.  The agri-ecological and social conditions of farming vary greatly within the European Union and Ireland needs to have the flexibility to apply the payment model that best suits our conditions.  We are not asking that other member states apply our system; rather, we would like flexibility for each member state to decide the payment model that best meets its needs.  We believe there are positives for Ireland in the increased emphasis on the delivery of public goods from farming and we are prepared to engage in this debate provided it does not come at the expense of the income support function of direct payments.  We should not forget that EU farmers are obliged to comply with the statutory management requirements of 18 EU regulations to qualify for payment.  These statutory management requirements cover the broad spectrum of animal health and welfare, respect for the environment and the sustainable management of our natural resources.  These cross-compliance requirements contribute substantially to the production of public goods from farming and we should not impose additional burdens on farmers without good reason.</P>
        <P>Several Senators referred to donning the green jersey in these CAP negotiations.  I appreciate the support of the House in this respect.  As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said earlier, his intention is to continue the dialogue in consultation with both Houses of the Oireachtas, MEPs and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food throughout the course of negotiations.  On my recent visits to the European Parliament, I have seen cross-party support from our MEPs.  That is welcome.</P>
        <P>Several Senators stressed the importance of a cap in ensuring security of food supply and its contribution to ensuring food is produced to high quality and standards.  The Minister indicated these objectives are high on our list of priorities in the negotiations.  We must ensure any imports to the EU meet the same high standards.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden referred to the need for greater simplification in the new CAP.  Ireland wants a policy that is simple to understand, administer and operate.  This was one of the issues discussed at a meeting between the Minister and his German counterpart.  Both Ministers agreed to meet in the coming weeks to propose a series of simplification initiatives for the current CAP with a view to submitting them to the Commission before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford mentioned the need for adequate transition periods for changes to the CAP and highlighted the need to cater for new entrants.  We have taken the Senator&rsquo;s comments on board.</P><Col N="880"/>
        <P>Senator Doherty referred to the benefits of North-South co-operation.  There will be a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council tomorrow and one of the main topics of discussion will be the CAP after 2013.  I will meet Michelle Gildernew tomorrow evening to discuss fisheries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We favour the continuation of market support measures at safety net level, together with some flexibility to adapt or enhance them as the need arises.  Over two years ago, when the CAP health check negotiations were in train, Ireland was in a minority of member states calling for these measures to be preserved.  In light of the crisis in the dairy market in 2009, I am pleased to say the value of these mechanisms carries far more support in the Agriculture Council.  There is general recognition that market supports such as intervention and private storage aid play an important role in stabilising the market and should continue.  We must examine the additional measures to address the much increased volatility of markets.  This view is widely shared among EU Agriculture Ministers.</P>
        <P>As for rural development, we must focus on the twin goals of competitiveness and sustainability.  Measures directed at investment and which promote competitiveness will perform a key role in encouraging efficiency and innovation in farming.  They should be maintained and enhanced in order that farmers can improve their performance and deal with structural issues arising from, for example, the ending of the milk quota.</P>
        <P>Consistent with green growth objectives, we must have strong agri-environment actions in our rural development policy, including targeted developments for public goods, support for the development of bioenergy on farms and for innovative actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.  Our off-farm rural development actions should be consistent with this while focusing on genuinely rural areas and emphasising job creation.  Looking to the CAP of the future, we must ensure it supports farm incomes and addresses the issue of price and income volatility while avoiding market distortions.  We must encourage competitiveness and innovation through appropriate measures, including support for farm investments and the promotion of sustainability in all its dimensions in order that farmers are rewarded for the public goods they produce.  By doing this, we will ensure the CAP delivers a secure supply of quality food to consumers and decent incomes to farmers while protecting and enhancing the natural environment.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and convey my gratitude for his interest in and support for areas affected by flooding.  This is a parochial matter for everyone.  The Minister of State was in Skibbereen and knows the area quite well.  The concerns expressed by the local flood committee relate to a number of items identified as housekeeping or basic works to be done on the River Ilen or the Caol Stream adjacent to it.  The Minister said that if Cork County Council made an application for emergency flood relief funding, he would not be found wanting.  I am not sure whether such an application was made.  The anniversary of the major flood is 19 November, which I remember well.  I was caught in the flood.  The town was flooded twice after that and survived a fourth attempt during the bad winter last year.</P><Col N="881"/>
        <P>A report has been commissioned which has been put out to tender.  There has been a long delay in the process which is causing concern locally.  However, I do not dispute that a report is required in order to prevent a major flood such as might occur every 50 or 100 years in the River Ilen catchment area and the town.  As someone who worked in the town for many years and still has a close association with it, the cleaning of the River Ilen is fundamental.  The Minister looked at debris that had either been dumped or collected near Kennedy Bridge close to the West Cork Hotel.  Debris had also collected in a relief channel, the Caol Stream and culverts.  If all of that work was done, it would probably ensure ordinary floods occurring once every ten years could be averted or, at least, diminished.  Flooding occurred in the area of Glencurragh adjacent to the GAA football pitch.  A retired man whose premises had flooded three times damaged a thumb when trying to cut a timber.  Such flooding had never happened before in the time he had been living there.</P>
        <P>Subject to correction by the Minister of State, I have deep concerns that the new Skibbereen bypass which forms part of the N71 contributed to flooding in certain areas.  Council workers and engineers who observed the flooding on the night it occurred said there was 2 m to 3 m to spare under the Kennedy Bridge near the West Cork Hotel which is on the way out of the town towards the sea.  They said there was plenty of room, but the water could not pass through where the new bypass had been built.  That matter should have been addressed when the work was being planned.</P>
        <P>It might not be a major issue, but the concern is that winter is approaching and weather experts are predicting a harsh one similar to last year, with a lot of rain.  We all remember what happened last year.  People in the town are conscious that as of now little or nothing has been done.  The council spent &euro;10,000 on preliminary work on the river, involving a machine cleaning one section, but owing to a lack of funding the work ceased.  Irrespective of what will happen following a flood relief study that might take another 12 months before it comes before the council or the Minister, it is essential that basic housekeeping is carried out, including the cleaning of culverts, the Caol Stream and the Riven Ilen of debris that has accumulated.  Perhaps some of the debris is due to the major sewage works carried out recently in the town.  If such work was carried out, local people would accept the commitment to undertake the work was being fulfilled.  Notwithstanding a major plan for the town and the Riven Ilen catchment area coming into Skibbereen to deal with abnormally high levels of flood water as occurs every 100 years, basic housekeeping would still be required.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State may not have received an application to do the work, but a three-stage plan was costed at approximately &euro;1 million.  The three parts were put before the Minister of State.  The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which is chaired by Deputy Fleming visited the town.  In the early part of this year the perception held by the community at large &mdash; I do not speak in a political way &mdash; was that essential remedial works would be carried out, but as of now little or nothing has been done.  I am concerned that if another flood occurs, adverse comments will be made against public representatives, irrespective of party, and county council engineers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Skibbereen has suffered a lot.  It is a relatively small town when compared to a city such as Cork or a town such as Ennis or Fermoy which are bigger.  A total of 200 premises, homes and businesses, in the town were affected by flooding.  A significant number of people were affected.  Old people were frightened out of their lives by the flooding and some had to move, not all of whom have been able to move back because the repairs have taken a long time to complete.  I will not address the question of insurance.  I seek a ray of hope from the Minister of State that the OPW through Cork Council or otherwise will do the basic remedial work to restore confidence to the people of the town.</P>

	<P>Like the Senator, I am very conscious of our vulnerability to the weather.  I welcome every day that is like today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>We all do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>While the long-term forecast, in so far as any faith can be placed in it, refers to a harsh winter, it does not refer to a very wet one.  We will see.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for giving me an opportunity to update the House on the progress made in addressing the flooding problem in Skibbereen since my appearance in the House on the matter earlier this year.  When I last spoke on the issue, I had recently travelled around the Cork area to see at first hand and discuss the impact of the severe flooding in November 2009.  I visited a number of locations in the county, including Skibbereen.  Having seen the damage and talked to many of the town&rsquo;s residents, I am acutely aware of the distress they suffered at the time and their concern that steps be taken quickly to prevent a recurrence.  I would like to assure them again of my determination to provide every assistance in that regard.  Before moving on to what is being done to address these concerns, I again acknowledge the tremendous contribution of personnel from Cork County Council, the Army and Civil Defence in combatting the flooding last winter which ensured the devastation experienced in Skibbereen was not even more severe.</P>
        <P>As I promised during my visit, the Office of Public Works has been working in partnership with Cork County Council to tackle the flood problem at locations throughout the county, including providing expertise and guidance on flood solutions for the Skibbereen area.  I had an informal meeting with the county manager in July which focused to a considerable extent on flooding issues.  The aim continues to be to ensure the preferred solution is one that will afford the required level of protection, while also addressing any environmental issues and providing the best value for money.</P>
        <P>In the aftermath of the November flood event, Cork County Council took the lead in addressing flooding in the town by commissioning an initial scoping report from consultants.  The consultants looked at previous reports on the problem and identified channel capacity and tidal factors as likely contributing factors.  A key recommendation of their report was that further, more detailed, analysis be undertaken which would take account of recent changes in the area, including urban development and climate change.</P>
        <P>The council subsequently submitted a number of applications for funding in respect of Skibbereen under the Office of Public Works minor flood mitigation works scheme which provides funding for interim works to address localised flood problems where a solution has been identified or can be identified readily.  To qualify for funding, proposals must be economically viable and environmentally sustainable and should cost not more than &euro;500,000 in each case.  The applications submitted by the council for Skibbereen were in respect of, first, a study focused on the River Ilen; second, interim flood mitigation works and, third, a flood warning system.</P>
        <P>Following an assessment of the applications submitted by the council, the Office of Public Works allocated funding of &euro;120,000 in 2010 for a comprehensive study which will examine the cause of the flooding problem in the town and identify appropriate, cost-effective solutions.  In addition to providing funding, the Office of Public Works provided substantial assistance for the council in developing the brief for the study.  The council has already completed the pre-qualification process to select consultants for the study and it is understood that it will seek tenders from the consultants shortly.  The council estimates that the study will take approximately eight months to complete.</P>
        <P>With regard to the council&rsquo;s applications for interim mitigation works, it was the Office of Public Works&rsquo; expert assessment that the proposals for which funding was sought which had a <Col N="883"/>combined estimate of cost in excess of &euro;1 million were premature in the light of the forthcoming study and would not have a significant impact in reducing flood risk.  It is the view of the Office of Public Works that, given the scale and relative complexity of the flooding problem, the recommendations of the proposed study will provide the appropriate context for development of proposals for major flood relief works.</P>
        <P>On the council&rsquo;s application for funding to implement a flood warning system to cover a number of locations, including Skibbereen, the proposed study will examine the viability of a range of options to address flood risk, including a flood warning system.  The OPW carried out preliminary work on the feasibility of such a system, which will feed into this process.</P>
        <P>At this stage, however, it is not possible to give a definitive timescale for the implementation of any works or other measures recommended by the study.  The timescale would be influenced by a number of factors, including the scale of the proposed measures and the associated statutory or other consent processes.  Every effort will be made to progress their implementation as quickly as possible in line with normal procedure.</P>
        <P>Pending the implementation of any major flood relief scheme the study may recommend, it would be open to the council to develop and seek funding from the OPW under the minor works scheme for, alternative proposals for minor mitigation works.  Any such applications that meet the criteria of the scheme will be given every consideration.</P>
        <P>I am committed to securing effective and appropriate solutions to the problems that have been experienced by the people of Skibbereen.  I am confident the approach being followed by the OPW and the council offers the best prospect of this objective being achieved.  Skibbereen, like Bandon, is on the radar as a high priority location.  I will take up the invitation to attend the Skibbereen forum, even if members might find the position I outlined disappointing.  Between now and then, the specifics mentioned by the Senator will be examined.  The onus, however, is on the council to put forward proposals.  Some of the things mentioned fall entirely within the council remit but we support those councils that wish to carry out minor works.  Money is not the issue, it is a question of the effectiveness of such measures.  I have no doubt significant works will be identified as a result of the studies under way and my office will give priority to addressing this issue.  It has not been possible to carry out many works before winter but there is no reason to believe the Irish climate is now subject to a monsoon season that starts in mid-November, although I hope I do not have to eat my words in a month.  I will come to Skibbereen and listen to what people have to say.  My engineers will be in touch with the council and if we can do anything in the short term to alleviate the situation, we will do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s sincerity in addressing the issue.  I am delighted he has agreed to attend the forum in Skibbereen, which is not just parochial.  The plan is to rotate to Ennis and other towns to achieve solutions to the flooding problem.  People in many areas suffered last year.  Cork city, Bandon and Skibbereen all suffered.  Skibbereen was on the long finger for many years because there had not been a major flood, but now that the town has suffered, I hope people, especially the elderly, will never again have to suffer what they went through on 19 November last year.  I am reassured the Minister of State will do everything possible.  I might put the squeeze on Cork County Council to ensure it is doing everything possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is extraordinary we have two motions on flooding in Cork on the Adjournment.  Last weekend in Cork city the first flood of the winter season took place.  There was a sense of fear and concern among the residents of the Marsh, the Mardyke and the Middle Parish and among business people that 12 months on from the flooding in 2009, there is still no early warning system and the quay walls at Grenville <Col N="884"/>Place have not been repaired.  There is concern there is no early warning system that uses text messaging, e-mail or the postal system.  Last year there was terrible flooding and Cork was visited by the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Many of us worked with the residents and there are still people who have not been able to return to their homes.</P>
        <P>We all want an improved flood alert system but what measures have been taken by the Government to advance this?  People are concerned about the availability of sandbags for residences and businesses.  I read the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan but progress has been slow.  There has been a lot of hyperbole and hiding behind reports and studies.  We have ruled out the major works scheme in Cork city that would cost nearly &euro;100 million and have agreed to minor flood relief works.  If we cannot get the major works, can we at least get those minor works done, particularly the repairs to the quay walls at Grenville Place?</P>
        <P>We must invest properly in flood protection measures.  The start of that for the residents of the Middle Parish, the Marsh and the Mardyke is to have a flood alert warning system that would allow for a traffic light-style indication of risk.  We must reassure residents that works will be carried out, that we will put in place an adequate flood warning system and that what happened to them last year will not happen again.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will be positive in his reply.  He has been attentive in the past and has listened to residents in the Middle Parish.  We must have more than just listening, however.  Money must be invested in order that there is a tangible outcome for residents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Within the past six weeks we approved the repairs to the quay walls and they are about to commence, if they have not already started.  Notwithstanding what I told Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, it was an exceptional minor relief works measure costing almost &euro;1 million.  It was a little outside the parameters of the minor relief works scheme.</P>
        <P>Another relevant matter involves the 12 km stretch between the Inniscarra dam and the outskirts of Cork city.  We are undertaking works that will strengthen the banks, meaning there can be a higher outflow from the dam without flooding so as to reduce the risk of a repeat of the events of last November.</P>
        <P>The catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study identified a series of works in the River Lee catchment area.  I do not interpret this as meaning we or successor Governments will not be spending substantial sums of money, but the question was whether we would be committing ourselves at this stage to spending a sum of &euro;120 million or so.  The answer may be decided in the light of experience, but County Cork is on the front line and its CFRAM study will finish first.  As I have often stated, we are spending at least 20% of the national budget in County Cork, although I appreciate some of the works are not directly relevant to Cork city.  Therefore, County Cork is high on the radar screen.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Buttimer for giving me an opportunity to update the Seanad on the progress made in addressing flood forecasting and flood warning.  The issue of a national flood warning system was raised with me by a number of public representatives during the severe flood event of November 2009.  At the time I gave an undertaking that the OPW would examine the issue and table recommendations.  Flood forecasting and flood warning can help to reduce flood damage and help people and authorities to be better prepared.  However, they cannot prevent a flood occurring.</P>
        <P>A number of issues must be considered.  The effectiveness of a flood warning system depends on a number of factors, including reliable rainfall forecasts, accurate flood forecasts based on rainfall, upstream river levels and lead time that can be achieved at the area in question, <Col N="885"/>effective communication and dissemination of a warning, and the preparedness of the emergency response services and the public in general to react to the information provided.  The issue was reiterated in the fourth report of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, The Management of Severe Weather Events in Ireland and Related Matters, published in July.  Recommendation No. 15 provided:</P>
        <P LI="1">Appropriate flood early warning systems should be put in place by the OPW on all major river systems or parts thereof where a substantial ongoing flood risk in known to exist.  Providing some degree of early warning system in such places should not need to await the detailed studies planned under the CFRAM process.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the CFRAM process in the Rier Lee area is advanced, it is not really a relevant consideration in this respect.  The OPW has commissioned consultants to prepare a strategic review of options for flood forecasting and flood warning.  The purpose of the study is to examine the potential benefits that flood forecasting and warnings could achieve in Ireland, identify and assess the options for delivery of such a service, including the associated resource requirements, and develop an appropriate and sustainable strategy, including consideration of the potential impacts of climate change, for flood forecasting and flood warning.  The study will also examine the procedures and infrastructure required for a flood forecasting and flood warning service, including the resourcing, installation, maintenance and operation of any possible system or systems.</P>
        <P>To this end, the consultancy firm appointed to carry out the feasibility study, JBA Consulting, has undertaken to deliver its review in a five-stage programme.  Stage 1 is the examination of the existing context of and current arrangements for flood forecasting and flood warning in Ireland.  Stage 2 consists of a significant review of existing and emerging international best practice in flood forecasting and flood warning.  Stage 3 is an assessment and evaluation of these international options with respect to their feasibility in Ireland.  Stage 4 consists of the identification of the preferred or recommended option or suite of options for flood forecasting and flood warning.  Stage 5 is the development of a programme for effective implementation of a recommended option or suite of options.  This five-stage delivery programme is scheduled to be completed within a ten-month timeframe and conclude in the first quarter of next year.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A major conference for stakeholders was held last month.  Those attending the workshop included representatives of all the primary response agencies in the major emergency management framework.  An extensive schedule of consultations was carried out at the conference.  I do not wish at this stage to pre-empt the outcome of the review.  Nevertheless, I look forward to receiving a draft report on the review in early 2011 and will consider the options and recommendations arising therefrom with great interest.  I am greatly encouraged that the commissioning of this important report is well on schedule and that it will advance a thorough evaluation of this important requirement in a quantum manner.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention the existing catchment-based flood forecasting systems being piloted at Mallow and Clonmel in conjunction with demountable flood defence systems in these towns.  These systems, operated by the relevant local authorities, have proved, in the flood events of November 2009 in the case of Mallow, to be highly effective in assisting in the management of demountable flood defences.  They were also of considerable assistance to the emergency services in Clonmel which had approximately eight hours notice.  It is a lot of time in which much can be done.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, I launched the CFRAM study for the River Lee in early 2010.  One of the recommendations made in the report was that the assessment, scoping and development of fluvial and integrated fluvial-tidal flood forecasting systems should be examined.  Work is <Col N="886"/>progressing with Cork county and city councils on developing this recommendation.  There was some tidal flooding in the city without any fluvial flooding earlier this week.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that international experience elsewhere points to the relative ineffectiveness of some systems adopted in other jurisdictions where insufficient thought was given to the deliberative and planning phases of such systems.  Clearly, the feasibility of any system or systems which the report may propose will be predicated on the ability to resource not only the commissioning of any such system but also its ongoing implementation and operation.</P>
        <P>Reverting to the matter of the quay walls at Grenville Place, the local authority is taking the lead and the OPW has provided funds.  It is anticipated that the contractor will be appointed in November.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not mean this in a personal way, but it is extraordinary that it takes so long to get things done.  After a period of 12 months the quay walls at Grenville Place will be restored.  According to the Minister of State, a report has been commissioned and will be concluded in 2011.  We have already had our first flood, although it was not as bad as last year&rsquo;s.  Business people and homeowners are not confident that they are being heeded and that there will be a proper response if there is a recurrence of last year&rsquo;s events, which I hope will not be the case.  I hope we can expedite the matter.  It is unacceptable that there are no quay walls or an early warning system in place 12 months on.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the advantages of genuinely minor relief works under &euro;100,000 is that one does not have to go through many procedures to procure them.  With the more valuable contracts, unfortunately, one is obliged to go through public tendering procedures.  The European Union does not give us a choice in the matter.  Many minor relief works are relatively simple and can be done quickly, but the more complicated a task is the more it requires thought, work and research to be effective.  </P>
        <P>I hope, as I am sure the Senator does, that the weather will give us some breathing space.  Based on existing criteria, many of these flood events are supposed to occur once in a period of several decades.  There is a real problem in Cork, but I hope we will have some breathing space and have advanced further by the time the next serious flood event occurs.</P>
