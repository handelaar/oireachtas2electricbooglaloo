	<P>I have received notice from Senator Marc MacSharry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to introduce immediate legislation to increase the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to secure the conviction of illegal moneylenders in Irish society and offer increased protection for victims and members of the public to encourage them to come forward in cases of illegal moneylending.</P>

        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to outline the timescale for a new post-primary school in Gorey, County Wexford; if all years will be accommodated from the beginning and when she expects a patron for the school to be announced.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Dominic Hannigan of the following matter:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>

	<P>Why is no legislation scheduled for the week?</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader outline the work programme for the House in the weeks to come?  Why is there no legislation before the House?  Why is the Government not giving this House legislation?  Why is no legislation being initiated here?  Has the Government run out of steam to the extent that no legislation is ready to be put before these Houses?  At a time of unprecedented social and economic turmoil in this country, and with these Houses not having sat for 12 weeks, it is extraordinary that the Government has not prepared any legislation.  It is quite unacceptable.  Will the Leader provide an explanation to this House as soon as possible, preferably when he is replying at the conclusion of the Order of Business?</P>
        <P>We have heard again today about the extraordinary waste of money on electronic voting machines, in F&Aacute;S and in the HSE.  It is very difficult for people who are under so much pressure and who are having their electricity cut off or are having to watch every penny or deal with their incomes being halved or lost to see such a waste of money at Government level.  It is quite extraordinary that the culture of Government has not changed.</P><Col N="715"/>
        <P>I want to make a point about the role of the Opposition at budget time.  There has been a great deal of discussion about the possibility of a national Government being formed in the national interest.  As an Opposition, of course we have the national interest at heart and will do the right thing.  I challenge the Government to do things differently in the run-up to this year&rsquo;s budget.  The role of Opposition in this Parliament involves talking constructively about the challenges facing this country.  Will the Government set out what it will do to change the way it behaves when making budgetary decisions?  Will there be advance scrutiny of the options being considered by the Government?  Will we have an opportunity to amend the proposals that will be made by the Government?  Will targets be set for individual Departments?  Will such targets be evaluated and monitored?  As we can see from all the waste that is reported in each day&rsquo;s newspapers, that has not happened to date.  The system must change, as we can no longer have this all or nothing vote on budget day.  I challenge the Government to specify what it intends to do in the national interest to change the culture it has allowed to grow in the past 12 years in setting and debating the budget in the Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also raise the question of the reason the House did not sit yesterday.  While I acknowledge the Leader comes under pressure from the Government, all Members were under the impression that the Seanad would sit three days a week from the outset of this session last week.  It is embarrassing, gives snowballs to those who are critical of the House to throw at Members and completely unacceptable.  The Government should be ashamed of itself for not bringing forward legislation.  I recognise that the economy correctly is taking up 99% of the Government&rsquo;s time.  However, does this mean there are departmental draftsmen doing nothing?  Members are waiting for legislation to be presented.  To be helpful to the Leader, I remind him that there are 12 Private Members&rsquo; Bills, including some produced by one of the Government parties, on the Order Paper.  Some of the aforementioned legislation was withdrawn on the basis that the Government would make progress on the issues involved.  I refer, for instance, to the Credit Union Savings Protection Bill which I introduced, Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Climate Protection Bill and the Construction Contracts Bill produced by my colleague, Senator Quinn, among others.  The Members concerned await replies on issues that were meant to be dealt with at departmental level.  I suggest to the Leader that Members should begin to make progress on some of this legislation to show the world that this House can operate, legislate and deal with issues of importance to ordinary people, even if the other House is in a legislative stasis.</P>
        <P>Last week, in common with three or four other speakers, I raised with the Leader the importance of having a debate on the Croke Park agreement.  Over the weekend I noticed that some Departments of State still had not brought forward their cost cutting and savings proposals for implementation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Who will ask the reason for this and examine what they are saying?  I ask the Leader for a date on which the Minister of State with responsibility for the public service will come to the House to explain to Members some simple matters such as the objectives in this regard, the exact numbers he expects to cut from the public sector, the exact number of millions of euro that must be saved and how this will be achieved.  He should do so in order that everyone can get behind it, as there are examples of waste.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by referring to an extraordinary case that came to light over the weekend.  Six months ago a homeless man walked into a supermarket in Galway and stole a &euro;6 bottle of wine.  He was put in jail in Cork where he has been kept for six months.  He appeared in court last week and the regulations require that three members of the Prison Service bring him there <Col N="716"/>and back.  It is time we began to examine such matters, asked the reason and when it is going to stop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, the judge complained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  However, Members of the Oireachtas introduce legislation and the regulations to deal with such matters must be examined.  For instance, the House recently passed the Fines Act and dealt with other related matters.  I ask that Members get their act together and deal with business of relevance to the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader and colleagues for their gracious remarks.  As for the failure of the House to sit yesterday, I agree with my colleagues that it is embarrassing.  However, it is just as embarrassing when one considers not so much the quantity of Seanad sittings but their quality.  The Cathaoirleach should bear with me, as I do not for one minute suggest debate in the House is not of high quality; when it happens, it is.  However, I agree with Senator Fitzgerald who touched on this issue, that the procedures must be loosened in order that Members can genuinely delve into and scrutinise subjects, particularly the four-year plan the Government is to bring forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Members cannot simply have a set piece debate, for which a Minister comes into the House to make a speech, followed by others by a series of Members.  Instead, the quality of discussion must be examined, as well as the ability of Members to make a genuine contribution to the public debate that must happen.  This is not taking place, although Members on all sides of the House have been calling for it for years.  This is not to point the finger at anyone, except to state Members have taken an overly conservative approach to how they organise their business.  They could be doing a great deal more and make a much better contribution, even in respect of Opposition proposals.  Members on the benches opposite like to have the odd cut at the Opposition that it lacks proposals, disagrees with any proposals made and so on.  Such proposals should be discussed, debated and scrutinised on the floor of the House.  In that way, we could make a genuine contribution to the public debate that needs to happen.  I ask the Leader once more to determine whether we can put our heads together in dealing with this urgent question in order that we can genuinely earn our keep in the Upper House, a real issue for the people.  I refer not only to the number of times we sit but also to what we do when we sit.</P>
        <P>In the next day or so will the Leader find out what the position is on the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights?  What is the position on setting a date, on which the Government has been cogitating for the best part of a year, certainly eight or nine months?  It is simply not acceptable.  The Minister said the relevant proposal had been submitted to Departments.  I believe it was the Deputy Leader who said on the last occasion that he had been briefed that the proposal had gone around Departments and that responses were awaited from them.  What responses have been received?  If Departments have given their responses, have they been discussed by the Government?  In view of the fact that a commitment has been made on the holding of the by-elections, the writs for which are apparently to be moved by the end of March, is it intended that the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights will take place on the same day as the by-elections?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a special debate in the House on the four-year budgetary framework which will certainly be produced before the budget in December and determine our economic future.  The four-year period will encompass the next general election, irrespective of <Col N="717"/>the composition of the next Government.  All parties in both Houses should be fully and actively involved in dealing with the framework.  How it is to be quantified or qualified is for the parties to consider.</P>
        <P>Let us consider today&rsquo;s announcement by one of the credit rating agencies.  We have not been led too much by rating agencies.  The Fitch agency has marginally downgraded the country&rsquo;s debt rating from AA- to A+.  It attributes this to uncertainty over a broad political consensus on our future economic approach.  Above all else, this is the issue we all need to face.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When people talk about the failure of the Tallaght strategy, particularly as it affects the Opposition parties, the remarks do not bear comparison with reality.  The strategy which was adopted in 1987 was followed after the general election of 1989 by an increase in the number of votes and seats won by the Fine Gael Party.  It has not had a higher number of votes or seats since.  The return of lower vote totals and numbers has been related to a return to oppositional politics.  The last thing the country and economy need is oppositional politics.  If we are to proceed by way of a collective approach to the next budget under the four-year budgetary framework or a different Government composition, or have an election before or after such a process, it behoves us all to enter into the debate and decide how we can deal with these problems.</P>

	<P>Is advertising relevant to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The advertising is peripheral.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe it is.  I want questions to the Leader.  I do not know whether he will answer on what the Senator has just stated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer to waste in F&Aacute;S, the HSE and CIE, organisations to which the Government, under the Taoiseach, has made appointments and which share responsibility.  We did not have to wait for Senator Ross&rsquo;s book, in that successive reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the extraordinary catalogue of waste in public bodies.  The problem is solved, however, because the Taoiseach said, yesterday I believe, that the Government would not condone waste. It is interesting that most of the information highlighted in the newspapers, Senator Ross&rsquo;s book and other reports has come via freedom of information requests, yet only one year ago the Taoiseach was saying such requests were a waste of time and that the freedom of information system was being abused.  However, it is that system that ensures people can hold the Government to account.  It has exposed the waste we all condemn.  We should have a debate on the issue of waste and loss, at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense, in these organisations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the budgetary issue, we are in a perilous economic situation.  We have a short window of opportunity within which to get things right if we are to go back into the international markets next year.  It is important that the Government works with the Opposition in resolving the problems.  It is not good enough to say to the Opposition to put forward any good ideas it might have for the Government to kick about.  There must be a change of attitude by Government which will bear a heavy responsibility during the next few months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I condemn the bombing last week outside a hotel in Derry which, fortunately, did not result in any loss of life.  I and many of my friends in Northern Ireland had <Col N="718"/>thought that day had passed.  People in Northern Ireland do not want a return to having to look over their shoulders in case a bomb goes off and maims or kills people.</P>
        <P>The PSNI is doing a reasonably good job and must be credited on having recruited in recent years many Catholic young people from the Nationalist side of the community.  Any movement which seeks to prevent that is not good for the body politic of this island.  It is a retrograde step.  That this bomb went off at a time when the former President of the United States, Mr. Clinton, was in Northern Ireland to send out positive vibes to the communities was a travesty of justice.  It is a shame this happened at a time when Members from this House and the Lower House are due to meet our counterparts in Northern Ireland.  We have more in common with the people of Ireland than we acknowledge.  We should assist in every way we can to ensure a normal life for the people of Northern Ireland.  This House should condemn in the strongest possible terms what happened in Derry last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The debate on taxis on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; television programme on Monday was interesting.  It was the type of debate that should take place in this House.  One person was missing from the debate, namely, the taxi regulator who refused the invitation to attend.  I assume the regulator is a paid public servant.  If there is a case to be made for taxi regulation, and I am sure there is, the regulator should attend such debates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know why the regulator refused to attend.  There is no excuse for it.  Will the Leader ask the Minister whether this is a policy of avoiding confrontation and explanations, a policy that should not be supported?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Some time ago, I complained in the Chamber about the loss of a dermatologist from the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar.  I am pleased to advise the House that a replacement has been found.  Dr. Barbara Wynne commenced duty in the hospital last Monday.  She has a staff of two, including a secretary and a nurse, and will have backup from St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on diabetes with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney?  This is not the first time I have raised this issue in the House.  I raised it on many occasions during the last session.  I ask that the Leader, in co-operation with Senator Feeney, our spokesperson on health, would arrange for a long and meaningful debate on diabetes.  I spoke recently to a general practitioner who told me that he discovers, on average, two new diabetics every day he practises, which is a frightening statistic.  I do not propose to discuss in detail the implications of the condition and will withhold my comments until the debate takes place.  I hope it will be held early in the session because during the previous Seanad I sought a debate on the issue for more than two years.  It was eventually held, but only 75 minutes were provided for it and I believe only one spokesperson from each side had speaking time.  One Senator, in particular, the late Kate Walsh, was very exercised about this at the time.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Boyle for his advice.  Given that the Green Party is in danger of extinction, he is as well giving it now.</P>
        <P>The threat posed by the Real IRA and other so-called dissident republicans was highlighted again this week when a car bomb exploded in Derry.  Although these groups have little or no support in their communities, they continue to pose a threat to peace on the island.  I commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI which are working closely together to gain intelligence that will put the individuals in question behind bars where they belong.  While the forces of law and <Col N="719"/>order have had many successes, the groups in question continue to pose a threat to citizens, the institutions of the State and peace on the island.   I urge that all necessary resources be made available to put these criminals out of commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I bring to the Leader&rsquo;s attention the results of a recent survey carried out by the Irish Bank Officials Association of the abuse of bank officials by members of the public.  I am not referring to Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick or Mr. Michael Fingleton but to ordinary bank clerks who do a decent day&rsquo;s work and have always paid their taxes.  They have suffered greatly as a result of the bank crisis in so far as their jobs are on the line and many of them have lost out, as the values of bank shares provided as part of profit-sharing schemes have fallen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will give the House an idea of the abuse faced by bank officials.  The survey found that 75% had reported abuse at work, while a further 20% had reported abuse, including verbal and physical abuse, being spat at and so forth, by members of the public outside their workplace.  While there is anger in the community, some of it justifiable, I am becoming alarmed because a certain group appears to believe that being angry is a licence to abuse people.  When one hears anger <i>Meisters</i> such as Joe Duffy and others in the media orchestrating public anger, I wonder how it will be directed.</P>
        <P>We have had a garda abused in the performance of her duty in Leinster House and an absolute idiot trying to drive a concrete mixer through the front gates.  He even had sympathisers among members of the public.  I am beginning to wonder whether people are losing the run of themselves.  I ask the Leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have been personally abused on the issue of the banks by people in County Kerry, many of whom did not pay their way even when times were good.  We need to get some perspective on the matter. </P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Like other Members, I question why the House did not sit yesterday and why more legislation is not being taken in this Chamber.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole indicated, there is a great deal of legislation on the Order Paper.  I introduced No. 13 on the Order Paper, the Climate Protection Bill, three years ago this week.  This legislation deals with a critical issue facing the country.  At the time, the Government promised to introduce its own legislation.  I understand the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security was due to sit at 2.30 p.m. today.  According to the Twitter grapevine, however, that meeting has been postponed.  Will the Leader and his deputy indicate why this is the case?  I will call a vote on my Bill tomorrow if I do not receive a satisfactory answer today.</P>
        <P>I wish to seek a debate not only on the economy and the budget but also and specifically on the alternative proposals for the economy that were put forward earlier today by the community and voluntary pillar and the Wheel, which comprises 17 different NGOs.  We were provided with a very useful briefing by representatives of these organisations at a meeting held earlier in Buswells Hotel.

	<P>The net result of the litany of waste relating to many State organisations such as the HSE is that services cannot be accessed by the most vulnerable who need them.  An example of this is the fact that cystic fibrosis sufferers have been promised adequate facilities, on a national basis, to meet their needs.  The Government and the HSE have consistently failed to meet those needs.  It is a matter of getting our priorities right, of tackling the waste to which I refer and of holding the relevant organisations to account.  We must also have a Minister who can be held to account.</P>
        <P>A matter of extreme concern arose at the weekend, when four teenagers, one of whom is only 14, were admitted to the adult psychiatric facility in Waterford.  This is an indictment of the health service.  A great deal is said about A Vision for Change and the mental health services.  How have we arrived at a situation in 2010 where a 14 year old is held at an adult psychiatric facility?  What happened at the weekend was wholly inappropriate and is in complete contravention of the policies adopted by the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  How was this allowed to happen?  The Minister for Health and Children should come to the House to provide answers.</P>
        <P>Agencies such as Barnardos and the Psychiatric Nurses Association are very frustrated because their members are doing their best on the front line but are not in a position to provide the services required by the most vulnerable in society.  This is a direct result of the litany of waste that bedevils the HSE.  There is a need for an urgent debate on this matter and the Minister for Health and Children must come to the House to account for what is happening.</P>

I am in the process of putting a motion on the Order Paper and I thought it might have been on today.  It concerns a really shocking development.  I was staggered when I heard the HSE proposes to impose a 50 cent prescription charge on all medications.  It specifically indicated the terminally ill and the homeless.</P><Col N="722"/>
        <P>This is the most disgraceful measure I can ever remember from a public authority.  It is also dangerous for the health of the people involved and it oppresses the marginalised and vulnerable.  On top of this, it exposes the public to health risks through the potential spreading of infection.  It is problematic to get patients who are mentally ill, such as those with schizophrenia and other difficulties, to come to clinics to take medicine anyway but this constitutes the erection of another dangerous barrier.  It is shameful and I call on the House to condemn it outright.</P>
        <P>I regret the current position in the House with regard to legislation.  I will consider the positives.  My colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, underestimated the contribution of the Independents and private Members from all sides of the House.  There are no fewer than 16 Bills from private Members as opposed to the three which the Government has managed to squeeze from the bureaucracy.  Every Member in the Independent group has presented significant legislation in the past year, which is an important and interesting point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support Senator Quinn and I was not aware that the taxi regulator had refused to turn up.  The taxi regulator is not a popular person with the taxi industry.

There is a taxi man outside Leinster House on hunger strike as we speak in this Chamber.  Luckily, the taxi organisation has put its members in touch with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service as they cannot afford to go to the dentist.  They are working 17 or 18 hours a week; it is a dangerous issue which must be discussed.</P>

	<P>I do not often disagree with my colleague, Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan, but I must do so on some of his points today.  I wholeheartedly agree that any abuse of bank officials in their work or on the street is unacceptable but the Irish people have shown extraordinary forbearance in the past six to 12 months in light of the economic position that has developed in the country.  If Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan believes people are showing too much anger, perhaps he should get out a little more and talk to them.  They are being extraordinarily understanding of some of the decisions that his friends in government made over the past eight years that have brought us to the pass at which we are now.</P><Col N="723"/>
        <P>I agree with Senator Boyle about changes to the budgetary process.  He spent years in the other House talking about how the process should be changed.  Now, however, he is in a position to do something about it.  Fine Gael has produced alternative budgets for the past three years and brought forward numerous proposals, none of which has been listened to by the Government.  It was interesting to hear Senator Ormonde and others on the Government side speak about confrontational politics.  They want to listen to the Opposition now that they have made a hames of everything.  They did not listen to us for the past seven years when we had constructive proposals, especially for dealing with the excessive reliance of the economy on the property sector.  I even recall the Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, laughing from the ministerial chair in the Chamber at Opposition Senators who warned about the difficulties in the property market.  I will not be lectured to by Senator Ormonde on this or any other issue.</P>
        <P>I join colleagues in expressing disappointment with the lack of debate in the House since the return from the recess and that it will sit for two half days again this week.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business concerning school transport, a small but significant issue for the families concerned.  For the past 18 months I have asked the Leader for a debate on the allocation of catchment areas in the school transport scheme.  In my part of County Kilkenny it is a significant issue because the areas have not been revised since the 1960s.  It is time they were revised because many families throughout the country are undergoing hardship as a result.  Why can this issue not be debated after Private Members&rsquo; business is concluded?</P>

	<P>On Sunday, 26 September at the Augustinian church in Drogheda, I had the honour of being invited by Fr. Iggy O&rsquo;Donovan to give the sermon at a celebration of positive ageing week.  For Senators who may not be aware, Fr. O&rsquo;Donovan supports allowing women to become priests.  More than 500 people were in the church that day.  Never did I think I would have the experience of speaking from the altar in a Catholic church on positive ageing and the contribution of older people in society.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, a sponsor of my all-Ireland inspirational life award, seeks nominations for the award of people and organisations which have helped enhance the lives of older people.  I am supported in this endeavour by Dame Joan Harbison, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s advocate for older people.  I suggest Senators get their copy of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  As I am Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on older people in the Seanad, I have put my heart and soul into getting this award to be an all-Ireland one, to cover both North and South.</P>
        <P>North and South working together will also deal with those responsible for the recent atrocious bombing on the Culmore Road in Derry and who threaten lives in Northern Ireland and its political stability.

	<P>Questions for the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise the matter of the relationship between the Government and the Opposition, one which I raised last week.  I am glad I did because it has caused some debate since then.  I raise it in the context of the call for a debate by Senator Boyle on the four-year agreement that will be negotiated between the Government and the European Commission.  I have three questions for the Leader.  This is a hugely important matter, if not the most important, that the country is examining.  If there is no consensus in the Houses of <Col N="724"/>the Oireachtas on the targets of the programme, what right does the Government have to negotiate a programme which it will not have to implement, as in all likelihood there will be a new Government after the next general election?  The agreement which it is in the process of negotiating will determine not only the budgetary priorities but also how it will spend money.  The Leader&rsquo;s party will not be in government to implement it.</P>
        <P>My second question concerns the discussions which will take place this month at the European Council on a proposal made by the European Commission that if a member state breaches the terms of an agreement it has made with it, that member state should be fined by it for not delivering on the programme.  A new Government could find itself in a situation where it would have to deal with a programme it had not negotiated, to which it had not agreed when in opposition and then be fined by the Commission for not implementing it.</P>
        <P>I want to conclude with a political question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Leader&rsquo;s party is in opposition after the next general election, as I hope it will be, I assume it will be bound by that agreement and that it will not be able to oppose a new Government in its implementation.  While the question of agreeing to a Tallaght strategy is one all Members of the House need to consider, it is one Fianna F&aacute;il should be considering seriously also.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>On that issue, to suggest the Government of the day cannot put together policies covering a number of years is ridiculous in the extreme.  A Government has ownership of particular legislation, development plans and so on.  Obviously, if and when one is in government and disagrees with things, I am sure one can go and try to renegotiate.  In the meantime, something unprecedented and historic has happened in recent weeks.  Last weekend the Taoiseach indicated to the Opposition that dedicated personnel within the Department of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I, for one, hope and I am confident that this process will not be superficial because, as I said last week and Senator Bradford and many other Members said in the past few days, we must have some input to what will clearly be an extremely difficult and painful process.  It is essential that the public has a sense of public ownership of the policy that will be adopted, or the country will be in serious trouble.  If Members on the other side of the House believe the process is superficial and that the proposals they have brought have not received a good hearing, let us debate the matter rather than participating in a constant Punch and Judy show in which people say one should <Col N="725"/>have done something else, that their manifesto and bicycle are better and all that kind of rubbish which, unfortunately, is strangling the country.</P>

Clouds of resignation prevented us from moving forward.  She also said the clouds of indignation today could paralyse us.  Let us not let that happen.  Let us proactively bring proposals forward together.  Let us embrace what the Taoiseach has suggested in a positive manner.  Never before in the history of the State has the Taoiseach of the day invited Opposition parties to come with their proposals which will be costed by the Department of Finance.  If they are worthwhile, we will embrace them in order that all of Irish society can have a sense of ownership of the budgetary framework.</P>

Now I want to say to Fine Gael that it is disgusting to listen to it resile from the move it made last week towards talking to the other side, and no other explanation can be found for it except that it is because of a problem that it has with its leader.</P>

That is the kind of politics we are getting from this House today.  The retreat from cross-party co-operation is pathetic.  Even if Fianna F&aacute;il was looking for cross-party Government only out of desperation and weakness, it is what the people want.  They want some kind of civility while the Government winds itself down.  They want the Croke Park agreement discussed.  So what if it is a sign of weakness by Fianna F&aacute;il?  Have Fine Gael Members not got the magnanimity, courage or decency to rise up as they did last week and make the offers they made last week?

Why does Fianna F&aacute;il not present its four-year plan, go to the people and then offer its support to the new Government?  We all know that what will happen when Fianna F&aacute;il comes back into power is it will continue with the same old nonsense, which it perpetuated in the past couple of decades, of attack, attack, attack.  Its members have never in their lives understood the meaning of consensus.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;how to work consensus politics in this country if it is necessary.</P>
        <P>I would not take too much from what the Department of Finance is saying.  It is the same Department that has been advising the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for the past two years on his banking policy, which is turning out to be more like a Monty Python film than high finance.  Two years ago the Minister told us it was going to cost us nothing to bail out the banks, then it was going to be &euro;4.5 billion and now it is turning out to be &euro;50 billion.  How can one believe that you can trust somebody within the Department if that is where he is getting his advice from?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need a new Government because the people are angry with what the guys opposite have done.  This is not a four-year county development plan, as Senator MacSharry might like to point out.  This is about how the Government has eviscerated the economy, destroyed people&rsquo;s lives and put 450,000 out of work.  That is what this debate is about.  That is why the guys opposite need to walk off the pitch and then support the new Government in trying to get this country back on level pegging again in the next number of years.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I cannot let Senator Twomey get away with what is gross historical revisionism.  Briefly, as has already been referred to, if one looks at the record of Government, from 1994 to 2007, there has been unprecedented growth in this country.  There are more people at work in this country than there were in 1997.  There are more teachers and doctors.  There are more people who are out working and there are more people contributing to this economy.  I hate this sort of revisionism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who was the first Minister in recent times in the Government to at least stand up to Mr. Vincent Browne, as one of a range of political commentators who have somehow created this urban myth that Fianna F&aacute;il has somehow destroyed the country.

	<P Just="Left">I was going to raise the issue of a vacant stand at a food fair in Brussels last week which was one of the first opportunities we had to generate new employment in the country, but the constant calls for a consensus approach from the Government side, and the call, in particular, for a debate from Senator Boyle this morning, must be addressed.  I ask <Col N="729"/>the Members opposite for one example in the past five years when they have taken on board one constructive creative idea from the Opposition, either in this House or in the other House, because that simply has not happened and it would never happen while Fianna F&aacute;il is in government.  Earlier this year we had a debate about water services following weeks of a drought in particular parts of the country and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government sat there and smirked across at us at our idea of generating a single national water authority.  There was one fantastic idea that could have been taken on board by the Government but was not.  What made that approach even more laughable was that the very same idea was contained within his own Green Party plan for economic recovery.  It is now time to acknowledge that Fianna F&aacute;il does not understand consensus nor has it ever understood it.  The bedrock of our recovery economically must be based on trust.  Benjamin Disraeli once said that all power is a trust.  That trust has been shattered by Fianna F&aacute;il and, unfortunately, by the Green Party by its association with Fianna F&aacute;il.  Fianna F&aacute;il has chosen to break the people&rsquo;s trust.  A national Government is not what we need.  A new Government is what we need, and one without any Fianna F&aacute;il presence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have two requests for the Leader.  I would like an urgent debate on the need to save Galway Airport for one reason, namely, thousands of jobs are at stake.  Some 82% of local and multinational businesses in Galway and the region have stated that Galway Airport is essential for connectivity to international markets for our exports, which is what is needed for the economy.  Exports are the shot in the arm, straight into the vein, that is needed.  I request a debate on that matter, with the Minister for Transport in attendance, as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I request a debate on another matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Taoiseach in attendance.  I am calling for truth from this Government.  I am unhappy with how Ireland&rsquo;s case is being perceived internationally and with how we are being presented internationally, largely because I do not know what deals have been done by the Minister for Finance.  I have three questions in this regard.  Who exactly is insisting on the 3% borrowing limit by 2014?  Is it the bondholders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the EU.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Why exactly is the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, so keen to protect the bondholders?  Has a deal been done on our corporation tax rates?  Is that really what this is about?  Bondholders are the biggest risk takers there are.  Why have we not at best negotiated with them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulator said today that we should do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>We are beholden to everyone except our own.  There was no sovereign responsibility to the bondholders.  Our sovereignty is now on the line and we must protect it.  What I am asking for a little bit of honesty.  I request the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to address those questions.  I second the amendment to the Order of Business.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, Regan, Bacik, Ormonde, Donohoe, MacSharry, Harris, Hanafin, Twomey, Mooney, Cannon and Healy Eames gave us the benefit of their serious concerns about everything that is happening with the banks and the proposals for the next four budgets.  In response to points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and colleagues regarding the Croke Park agreement, I gave an undertaking to the House last week that I would arrange for the Minister to come to House on a bimonthly basis.  I have arranged for an all-day debate on the Croke Park agreement next Wednesday, with the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, and the Minister of State and the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Curran, in attendance to deal with various aspects of the agreement.  It is my intention to roll over the debate into the following week if colleagues wish to have further clarification and an update on progress on the agreement.</P>
        <P>With regard to the sitting days of the House, we always returned from recess one week after the D&aacute;il.  That was not possible on this occasion because the D&aacute;il had to deal with urgent banking legislation and the Seanad also had to pass it by midnight last Wednesday.  I then afforded the House the opportunity, with the permission of all colleagues and party leaders, to commence a debate on the economy, to which all spokespersons made their contribution last Thursday and that debate is continuing as and from today.  The House will sit three days every week from now until Christmas with the exception of the bank holiday weekend when the D&aacute;il and the Seanad do not sit on the Tuesday after the bank holiday weekend, as has been a long-standing precedent  Those are the arrangements for sitting days and I thank all colleagues and party leaders for their co-operation.  I take seriously the views of all colleagues in the House on the running of the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White raised the matter of making the House more relevant and put forward proposals in that respect.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges, under the stewardship of the Cathaoirleach, can tease out this matter.  I am duty bound, in accordance with the Standing Orders of the day, under the stewardship of the Cathaoirleach, to run this House and make proposals to it in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, Phelan and Harris raised the matter of the next four annual budgets and the need for a broad consensus of appeal in this respect about which everyone is talking.  Senator Harris is an independent observer.  He is very respected and his column is read every Sunday and believed, which is very important nowadays, especially in the case of the Sunday newspapers.  It behoves us all to bear in mind that neither the person nor the party takes precedence over the country.  Everything Members of both Houses do for the duration of their membership during these difficult times must be in the national interest.  I welcome the comments of quite a number of colleagues, including Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s, who wish to proceed down that road during these difficult times when we are experiencing a downturn in the economy which, as Senator Mooney said, is worldwide.</P>
        <P>I watched the coverage of the speakers at the Conservative Party conference last week, with that party having came to power in England with a brand new mandate.</P>

	<P>I ask the Senator to afford me the opportunity to continue uninterrupted, as I did not interrupt him.  The one-liner &mdash; more for less &mdash; was used by speakers at that conference.  The British are experiencing the same difficulties as those about which the <Col N="731"/>Taoiseach has been telling us for the past 12 months, and quite a number of other countries are experiencing similar difficulties.</P>

	<P>We should be honest with each other.  We all want to make effective use of our time here.  We make a difference by being Members of this House, as do Members of the D&aacute;il.  I welcome the views and help offered by various Senators on the Opposition benches and we will continue to work with them as closely as is possible in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Regan called for a debate on the waste of funds in organisations and I will have no difficulty in arranging such a debate.  Senator Carty and Cummins condemned the bombing in Derry and complimented the PSNI on the serious and difficult work it is doing in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland and in the interests of maintaining peace.  I, too, was uplifted by the visit of the former president, Bill Clinton, to the north of Ireland last week and I look forward to attending an event in Newcastle tomorrow with parliamentarians from the Assembly and from D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann to work in co-operation in the best interests of the people of the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Quinn and Harris raised the issue of the major difficulties being experienced by those in the taxi industry.  I can give a commitment to the House now that I will endeavour to have a debate on this matter take place within the next two weeks.  Taxi drivers are under siege in their fight for survival.  The money they are earning currently is embarrassing.  It is an insult to any person in the industry to be just trying to survive, sitting in a car 14 or 15 hours a day, for the small income he or she earns. We all know that too many licences were granted and we have to do something about this.  It is an issue for the local authorities and should be left to them to deal with.  This matter must be addressed.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Glynn called for another debate on diabetes services.  I will have no difficulty in allocating time for such a debate.  I join the Senator in welcoming the good news from the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar in which a dermatology unit is now up and running.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Sullivan and Phelan raised the position of Irish banking officials whose jobs are on the line and who have suffered losses in terms of shares they were given as bonuses.  Front-line people in general across the State are experiencing difficulties they have not experienced previously because everyone is hurting.  Everyone is experiencing difficulty in one line or other in terms of their family members.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik spoke about the need for the Government to come forward with Bills.  I hope to announce the list of proposed legislation for the current session in the House tomorrow.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey mentioned the issue of cystic fibrosis.  He also highlighted the case of four young children who were admitted to an institution over the weekend.  No one can condone what happened.  I will endeavour to have the Minister come to the House to update Members on that incident and to speak about the health portfolio in general.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in spoke about the governance of this country.  I have given a commitment to have a discussion on the Croke Park agreement in the House next week.  I will pass on to the Minister Senator Norris&rsquo;s strong views on the recent introduction by the HSE of a 50 cent per item charge on prescriptions for medical card holders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ormonde asked me to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, to the House to give Senators an update on Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to overseas development aid.  I <Col N="732"/>understand that, for a nation of its size, Ireland is seventh best in the world in providing overseas aid.  I do not have any difficulty with such a debate taking place.</P>
        <P>Senator Phelan suggested that the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, should address the House on the proposal to revise the school transport boundaries.  As I have fully supported the calls for school transport boundaries to be changed, I would have no difficulty in arranging such a debate.  I am sure the Minister of State will be agreeable to coming to the House.  I will ensure such a debate takes place in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mary White spoke about positive ageing week.  The Senator is doing great work in leading the way with and sponsoring the all-Ireland inspirational life awards.  Her efforts to encourage a positive attitude to ageing offer a huge ray of hope to senior citizens.  I have no difficulty in supporting the call made by the Senator.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe spoke about a proposal with regard to fines, which will be considered at a ministerial meeting that will take place this month.  That can be discussed during the debate on the economy that will take place after the Order of Business in the presence of the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Hanafin outlined his strong views, which we welcome, on the need for balance in the media.  I have given a commitment to arrange a debate on balance in the media, which is urgently needed, during this session.  The media has a responsibility to report on both sides of the difficulties and both sides of the successes.  I do not know whether that is happening in the print, radio and television media.  It does not appear to be and it is our duty to ensure there is balance in all sectors of the media.  That is why they got their licences.  They have to tell the truth of the news rather than transmit the image of continuous bad news that is coming all the time.  As I said in my local newspapers this week, this country does not want three general elections.  We need one election in a five-year period.  If the Government has done anything, it has established a five-year cycle of government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to return to the discussion that took place on the Order of Business.  It arises with great regularity in the House and is taking on an air of unreality.  Both sides of the House must face up to the issue.  I refer to our discussion on the need for co-operation and the level of debate across the floor on the economic measures that require to be taken, the budget, etc.  With all due respect to the Taoiseach, it does not really represent progress for him to say the Opposition can avail of what is, metaphorically, a suggestion box to be placed outside the door and that if it has any ideas, it can toss them into it for the Government to look at.  That is essentially what has been said.  If we are to have a debate at a level beyond the somewhat cynical approach suggested by the Taoiseach, we must all participate in a deeper discussion of the options.  I am willing to concede the four-year programme mentioned by the Minister and announced by the Government which is intended to be published in November could offer us a very useful opportunity to debate, perhaps in this House, the various options facing the country.  We all accept big decisions require to be taken, but we do not accept there is only one set of decisions, or one set of solutions.  As one approaches the <Col N="735"/>budget which is only a few weeks away, one can have less confidence in the willingness of the Government, perhaps any Government, to engage in a lengthy debate on the options.  Perhaps the time to do this was earlier in the year, but I would like to have that debate tomorrow.  However, I am being realistic because when it was suggested last year that the Opposition might bring forward proposals and they did so &mdash; just to remind people I will outline some the proposals made by the Labour Party &mdash; they were completely ignored.  There was no genuine engagement.  </P>
        <P>With respect, Senator MacSharry was wrong when he said the announcement by the Department of Finance that it was prepared to brief Opposition parties was unique because it briefed the Opposition last year.  However, the problem is that the detail available to Opposition parties dried up as we got closer to the budget, perhaps understandably on the part of Department of Finance officials.  It is a pity all of this happens so quickly and in such a rush over a period of a few weeks.  I hope the four year programme will contain options, as much as purported decisions by the Government which will not it appears be in office for too long beyond the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The outgoing Government &mdash; that is how I regard it &mdash; could serve the country well by setting out the various options in detail and costing them.  This would inform a general election campaign and the debate that would require to be held in the course of such a campaign.  There would be political pitfalls in this for all sides.  However, we have moved beyond the day when we can afford to allow ourselves to be influenced by pure political considerations in terms of what is in the interests of the Labour Party or Fianna Fail as political parties.  There are greater issues at stake.  Let us have the price tags, for example, on what appear to be the unmentionables, namely, property taxes, water charges and corporation tax.  If one even utters the words &ldquo;corporation tax&rdquo;, people conclude one is seeking to increase it.  What I am talking about is facilitating a meaningful public debate on the cost of a range of measures.  We could then engage in a fight.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Alex White to continue, without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator mentioned corporation tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes.  For example, prior to last year&rsquo;s budget, the Labour Party, following a briefing by the Department of Finance, proposed a higher income tax rate for higher earners.  The price tag in introducing a third rate of tax of 48% on earnings over &euro;100,000 was &euro;355 million as costed by the Department.  Informed by the contents of the report of the Commission on Taxation, we also proposed a reduction in pension relief and the price tag was &euro;330 million.  We did not make up that figure, rather it was based on information provided by the Department of Finance for us.  We proposed modifications and reductions in investment property relief and the price tag was &euro;430 million.  The same applies to property schemes.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar, when describing the Labour Party proposals on the revenue side, was, I believe, misled into thinking the Labour Party was proposing an attack on the middle classes to the tune of &euro;2.5 billion.  I would like to debate that figure with him.  Few people, middle class or otherwise, would be affected by many of these reliefs which, in many cases, ought not to have been introduced in the first instance.  They ought to have been curtailed more quickly.  According to the Commission on Taxation, there is no genuine compelling economic benefit to be gained from their continuation and they should be removed.  A debate on these measures <Col N="736"/>would be helpful.  The only measure in the list brought forward on the revenue side last year by the Labour Party that could conceivably be regarded as an attack on the middle classes is a third rate of tax at 48% on income over &euro;100,000.</P>
        <P>A real issue of equity arises.  I had an interesting discussion last week with a colleague from the opposite side on the general economic environment.  I agree with him that until people believe there is equality and fairness in the Government&rsquo;s approach to economic recovery, whether in terms of taxation measures or the configuration of cuts in public expenditure, there will not be the public confidence, involvement or a shoulder to the wheel which the Government rightly, in a rhetorical sense, seeks all the time.  That simply will not happen.  I agree with what my colleague had to say during that general private discussion.  Many people feel the same way.  At the time of a general election the reality is that the public will have to be persuaded by way of debate that there are, regrettably, some public services that we simply are not able to afford.  We can have the debate on how we have come to be in this situation at another time, but I will be happy to participate in it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What upsets me a little is that people do not yet seem to understand or to have analysed what has gone wrong.  Colleagues opposite have the idea that this has been a golden era and what we are facing is a blip caused by the international recession, but that is completely wide of the mark.  We are where we are because Government decisions that ought to have been made were not.  In the future there will have to be public discussion of and confidence in measures that will be extremely difficult and affect ordinary voters, citizens and families.  People will not buy into these decisions, unless they can see fairness across the board.</P>
        <P>When speaking about how we order business in the House, I had in mind that which goes beyond the structured debate we are having today in which the Minister of State &mdash; I accept he is only doing what he is required to do and that he does it well &mdash; has made a speech and will reply to questions from colleagues.  I would prefer if the two or three organisations with big picture proposals, including Social Justice Ireland, could be invited to come to the Seanad Chamber to defend their proposals.  We could then pursue and scrutinise them with them, with the benefit of advice and information from the Department of Finance or the Civil Service.  This would allow genuine public debate rather than set piece debates.  That is what I had in mind in regard to how we could change the way we do business in the House.  I urge the Leader to seriously consider how best we might do this.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the four-year programme being produced.  There is an air of unreality in terms of what some Government Members appear to expect from the Opposition.  Without information and the facts, there will not be a genuine debate.  I am, however, prepared to have a truce for a short while if we can receive the information we require.  We could then have the argument, but this cannot be done the other way round.  One might say this could be done in a general election campaign because that is when such things are done.  The big issues will be debated in such a campaign.  We want a general election but cannot have one because the Government intends to remain in office for as long as it possibly can.  Short of having a general election, let us try to facilitate genuine debate.  We could start by doing so here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  There is no harm in indicating that we had an earlier Celtic tiger.  In the period 1994-99 we had a genuine Celtic tiger economy, during which Ireland experienced super growth, with an annual average increase of 8% in GNP.  This growth was based on exports and competitiveness.  During the second Celtic tiger period between 2002 and 2007 the annual growth rate averaged 5.4%.  While this figure was somewhat below the previous &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; period, it was well ahead of the general European Union growth rate.  However, as we now realise, the second Celtic tiger was to a <Col N="737"/>great extent an illusion and a mirage based on unsustainable increases in bank lending.  These reached 30% per annum and fuelled personal spending, property development and construction at a time when our export competitiveness steadily eroded.  The price being paid for these excesses is clear, namely, a collapse in construction, bank bailouts on a global scale and tough and painful measures to return the public sector deficit to a sustainable level that is acceptable to the European Union.</P>
        <P>Premature assessments that the economy has emerged from recession create scepticism and frustration in a large part of the business community, namely, the tourism sector, retail trade and domestically orientated enterprises where business remains tough.  Companies are still collapsing at an unprecedented rate and the average waiting period for outstanding credit has extended to approximately 70 days.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has two economies.  The exporting sector is dominated by foreign direct investment and a growing band of indigenous exporters, including high-tech global companies.  These are currently the main sources of growth in the economy.  I cannot recall how many times I have pointed out that unless we produce products or provide services that people want to buy or attract tourists, the economy will not go anywhere.  Without exports, we will not make money.  I am proud that Lir Chocolates, which started in Connie&rsquo;s Kitchen, is primarily an exporter and employes 250 people in Navan.</P>
        <P>The human impact of the recession is stark.  For example, the downward trend in suicide in recent years has gone into reverse.  We are all aware of prominent business people who have taken their lives and the indications are that many others have been overwhelmed by the debts they face.</P>
        <P>The live register figures published every month are the most frequently referenced measures of unemployment.  The figure of 450,000 for August is the most commonly cited figure for unemployment.  Last week, the September live register figures showed a decline of 5,400 to 449,000.  This fall is believed to reflect the intake of students to third level colleges.  The live register, as the note provided each month by the Central Statistics Office makes clear, is not an accurate measure of unemployment.  It is worth reading the note in full because it is ignored in public discourse:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time workers (those who work up to three days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance.  Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey and the latest seasonally adjusted figure, for January to March 2010, is 277,000 persons unemployed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The average number of people on the seasonally adjusted live register in the period from January to March last was 433,000 or an overstatement of 156,000 when compared to the figure the CSO considers to be the proper measure of unemployment.  It is not politically correct to point this out even though most employers do not regard the live register as an accurate measure of labour availability.</P>
        <P>To balance this analysis it is only proper to consider changes in emigration as measuring another part of the human impact of the recession.  Emigration in the most recent year &mdash; to the end of April 2010 &mdash; was 65,000, of which 28,000 were Irish nationals.  In recent years, the level of what may be termed &ldquo;normal voluntary emigration&rdquo; of Irish nationals has been 13,000 per annum.  One can, therefore, reasonably conclude that approximately 15,000 Irish people emigrated in the most recent year as a result of the recession.</P>
        <P>Public and media commentary tends to take the most extreme of the unemployment and emigration data to portray the most negative version of economic affairs.  When combined with <Col N="738"/>the daily diet of banking bailout news the resulting continuous negativity in public discourse creates a highly discouraging environment for enterprise.  I know young, educated Irish people who are happy to escape such an environment to move to more positive growth economies such as Singapore and other countries in Asia.</P>
        <P>Despite the current uncertainty and challenges, the price we are paying for borrowing, the ultimate cost of the bank bailouts and the tough budget that lies ahead in December, the economy will experience a real GNP growth of more than 2% next year.  According to the Economic and Social Research Institute, annual growth will reach an average of between 3% and 4% in the years from 2011 to 2015.  Most significantly, the ESRI expects employment to expand by an average of between 1% and 2% in each of the next five years.  I conclude on that optimistic note.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Senator Pearse Doherty.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, who is a regular visitor to the House.  Before Senator Mary White leaves the Chamber, I should point out how impressed I was, as usual, with her balanced and considered contribution, which offered a mixture of realism and hope for the future.  This is terribly important at such a critical juncture.  Tomorrow morning, I will speak at a breakfast for a group of significant international figures.  While I will certainly face the situation as it is, I will also give the optimistic view about the resources of this country, intellectually, in our young people and in the imagination and capacity we have.  I will say a little more about this as I go along.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are difficult times.  I felt a shudder of fear when the Minister recently announced that Anglo Irish Bank could cost &euro;34 billion.  This upper figure, which is the more likely cost, is particularly shocking because it appears we will get nothing back from it.  Having stated previously in the House that the figure would most likely be &euro;34 billion, it did not come as a complete shock to hear the Minister refer to a cost of &euro;34 billion.  I placed it on the record of the House not because of my own innate genius but because I had been contacted by Peter Mathews as a result of earlier comments I made in the House.  Mr. Mathews is a very driven man, which can alienate some people, but his figures have been consistently right.  I ask the Minister to consider taking advice from a group of people whom he may not find completely sympathetic.  I could list individuals such as Peter Mathews, Dr. Constantin Gurdgiev and Professor Brian Lucey from Trinity College.  It would be good if the Minister were to take advice from this group on how to get rid of Anglo Irish Bank at the cheapest price possible.  That is one suggestion.</P>
        <P>I note that the Fitch ratings agency today downgraded Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating again.  It has a hell of cheek.  I suspect the Minister of State may agree with my view that there should be a radical examination of the role played by all the ratings agencies and they should be replaced by an agreed international, independent, professionally qualified and good ratings agency.  That is the least we are entitled to following the kind of nonsense with which we have been faced.</P>
        <P>It is daunting that nearly half a million people are unemployed, even though the position appears to be marginally better, if one factors in all the other elements, than it was during the last really difficult recession through which I lived.  I have made many comments about this, but I will not repeat them here.  The Minister is aware of these comments and may or may not agree with them.  However, I have come up with original ideas in respect of the economy.  I will not rehearse them, but I will support some proposals brought forward by others, of which I have recently become aware.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I have pointed out that on today&rsquo;s Order Paper there are three items of Government legislation and 16 Private Members&rsquo; Bills.  However, one item is missing.  I was <Col N="739"/>listening to a discussion on radio in recent days involving distinguished politicians, thinkers and economists and was immediately struck by one of the suggestions made.  Ireland is paying three times the amount in interest that Germany is paying on its bonds.  There is approximately &euro;24 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and a technical glitch is stopping us from purchasing our own bonds.  Is buying our own bonds not an obvious course of action to pursue?  Is it not possible to examine the legal hitch that is preventing action being taken in this regard?</P>
        <P>Let us consider the benefits to be gained in pursuing this course.  We would be investing in our own country and paying these absurdly high rates of interest to ourselves.  The money would not go to the international market but remain at home.  I am not claiming credit for this proposal, as it was not my idea.  However, when I first heard it being espoused, I thought it was a damn good suggestion.  I inquired of colleagues whether there was a legal hitch and was informed that there was such a hitch.  We can, however, get rid of it.  In the absence of Government legislation, let us take the relevant Private Members&rsquo; Bill in order that we might obtain the interest to which I refer.</P>
        <P>We could raid the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  We should take a risk in this regard.  I am a pensioner and of the view that either the country will go completely down the drain or we could use the money to which I refer and get it back later.  Let us consider the position of small and medium enterprises which are starved of cash.  The banks are still not shelling out.  There are companies which are going to the wall but which would not be doing so if they had access to what are pitiful sums of money.  Let us take a small proportion of the money in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and allocate it to the small and medium enterprises which we know will thrive.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the suggestion I am about to make is original, but it strikes me as being bloody obvious.  An estimate has been made of the value of the gas and oil resources that will be taken from the Corrib field during its lifetime and the number those involved arrived at is &euro;500 billion.  That is ten times the level of our complete exposure to the banks.  However, we have given this money away.  That wonderful philanthropist and former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, gave the resources of the people to Shell.  It is time we renegotiated with it.</P>

	<P>We should invite those involved in Shell to come on board.  We should tell them that the country is in dire straits, that their company is extracting the country&rsquo;s resources which it obtained for nothing and that they have trampled all over the people of the west.  I made similar comments at a conference in Athlone, at which representatives from Shell were present.  They came to see me very quickly, but I did not withdraw one word of what I had said.  I informed them that I would meet them for lunch in Leinster House in order that we might discuss the position.  By coincidence, on the train to Athlone I became involved in a discussion with a group of four men, a father and son and two others, who worked in the Corrib field.  One of them informed me that there was even more gas to be found.  Let us use this resource.  Why put people through misery if we can obtain money for this gas?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is a decent and humane man and I am sure feels the same as I do about the most disgusting imposition on people I have ever witnessed, namely, the 50 cent charge on prescriptions.  When this new charge was announced, the terminally ill and the homeless were targeted.  I hope the Minister of State will use his good offices to try to have this charge withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I visited a sheltered workshop in Blanchardstown.  The people employed there produce needlework etc.  They are absolutely fantastic.  One woman approached me and said I should not let the Government take their teachers or their funding away.  She also informed <Col N="740"/>me that they would not stand for this and stamped her foot.  I thought she was a great girl.  We must find the money to support people such as those to whom I refer.  We must not allow multinational corporations to raid the cupboard completely.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight a couple of positive developments.  Like Senator John McCain during the US presidential election, I recently had a &ldquo;Joe the plumber&rdquo; moment.  I may have related this story on a previous occasion in the House, but I do not recall whether that is the case.  Some months ago, following a Seanad sitting, I flew to Cork and travelled to Clonakilty to meet some transition year students and view their projects.  The one which gave me hope was the brainchild of a group of 15 or 16 year olds.  The rich effluent which flows from our farmlands creates a bloom of sea lettuce which is a form of seaweed and which, when washed ashore, creates a stink and acts as a disincentive to tourism.  The girls in question collected samples, analysed them chemically and discovered that it was possible to compress this bloom and produce briquettes which have the same heat equivalent as turf and which burn for twice as long.  Such ingenuity must be encouraged.</P>
        <P>In recent days I spoke at the launch in Malahide Castle of a wonderful invention, the brainchild of a woman, Ms Sheila Byrne, whose daughter is dyslexic.  When she was helping her daughter to read, she noticed that the girl&rsquo;s eye was moving erratically between lines of text.  In exasperation, she cut a piece of cardboard from a Corn Flakes packet, removed a strip from it and placed the device over the text.  As a result, her daughter was only obliged to focus on one line at a time.  This made matters much easier and the girl made great progress.  Ms Byrne has developed the product &mdash; Readassist &mdash; which she designed in co-operation with the Fingal Enterprise Board and Spear Technology, a commercial company, and is now being marketed.  It is a fantastic product and involves an idea as simple as that which led to the development of the safety pin.  It will have not only an Irish but also a worldwide application.  The product is beginning to be manufactured here and will be exported.</P>
        <P>I have provided but a glimpse of the ideas, ingenuity and originality still prevalent in the country.  I will be repeating to the people from Shell, with whom I am meeting tomorrow, what I have said today.  I appeal to the Minister of State to come up with some radical solutions.  The current Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, tore up the agreement his country had with Shell and we should do the same.  If Shell gets a sniff of what else might be brought ashore from the waters off the west coast, it will not turn down our demand to renegotiate in respect of the natural resources which belong to the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing time.  I thoroughly enjoyed his contribution and agree wholeheartedly with what he said about a renegotiation in respect of our natural resources.  I also agree with his comments on the 50 cent charge on medical prescriptions.</P>
        <P>We have discussed on many occasions the Government&rsquo;s failure in respect of the bank guarantee and the collapse of the banking sector.  Last week we were informed that the final cost of the Government&rsquo;s actions might be anything up to &euro;50 billion.  If we add the various costs relating to the banking collapse and the Government&rsquo;s response to it, including NAMA etc., the final bill for taxpayers could be in the region of &euro;100 billion.  Leaving that fact aside, we know where we now stand.  We also know who got us into this mess, who is robbing the taxpayer and that they have no mandate for doing so.  Those to whom I refer are, of course, in government.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on the direction we are to take.  The Minister for Finance has repeatedly stated fiscal retrenchment through immediate and deep public spending cuts to reduce the fiscal deficit will help to restore the confidence of financial markets in the economy.  He has <Col N="741"/>also stated that if we keep interest rates low, we will secure economic recovery.  The Government has declared that this is the only possible credible course of action.  The difficulty is that the current Administration dismisses anyone who considers that fiscal deflation on the scale outlined, particularly at this delicate stage, as completely unwise.  The political and media consensus dictates that the deficit is the only issue that matters in the context of economic policies, that the measures to be set out in the budget in order to reduce this deficit are unavoidable and that there is no alternative to the budget plan and timetable set out.  That is where matters stand.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in offers a different view.  It is the only party in the D&aacute;il which has not subscribed to the need to cut spending in order to reduce the deficit.  Those in government might try to pigeonhole Sinn F&eacute;in, but the reality is that there is an alternative.  We are not opposed to deficit reduction but believe the 2014 deadline is unrealistic, particularly when one takes the Government&rsquo;s bank bailout plan into account.  We are against spending cuts to reduce the deficit.  Our approach to the economic crisis is as follows.</P>
        <P>We need to design a realistic deficit reduction strategy based on overhauling the tax system, eliminating wasteful public spending and investing in jobs.  That will in turn increase revenue coming into the State and lessen the burden on the social welfare bill.  We believe a stimulus will reduce the deficit and the Government&rsquo;s spending cuts plan is not merely unfair but also fails to reduce the deficit in any meaningful way.  The public finance facts support us in this and the recent Exchequer figures show that income tax revenues are down by 6% on the same period last year and 4.4% on the Government&rsquo;s estimate for the period.</P>
        <P>There is something wrong with the Government strategy, which is dangerous in its prescription for the future.  The Government and Minister for Finance believe they can slash public spending, bring low earners into the tax bracket and cut benefits, taking billions of euro from the economy and people&rsquo;s pockets, but that none of it will have any impact on unemployment and growth.  It is the stuff of fantasy.  Not only have we been thrust into a position where we have massive structural deficits caused by an unchecked property crisis but drastic spending cuts are throttling the domestic economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need a number of set principles which can lead us to economic recovery.  There are four of these.  Public spending cuts and tax increases on low income earners are not part of the solution but part of the problem.  The economy should be grown to shrink the deficit, as repairing the public finances is dependent on repairing the economy and reversing the rise in unemployment.  Through investment we can repair the major infrastructural, social and enterprise deficiencies in the economy.  Increasing taxation will yield higher Exchequer savings than spending cuts, although these must have an impact primarily on high income earner groups.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward proposals and there has been much discussion about how the Seanad should be used, consensus and all the rest.  I will take one of our alternatives as an example.  I will not speak about a wealth tax that countries in Europe have introduced, with the French version much higher than what we propose.  That would take in in the region of &euro;1 billion.  Considering the discretionary tax reliefs, we are the first party to come up with standardised discretionary tax reliefs, which makes the system fairer.  Everybody would get the same relief, regardless of income.  I listened last night to the comments of Senator Marc MacSharry, finance spokesperson for the Government in the Seanad, saying he agreed that the issue was a &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;.  The idea was coming from Fr. Healy in that case but if it came from Sinn F&eacute;in, it would probably have been dismissed like the rest of the party&rsquo;s ideas.</P>
        <P>We need to increase taxation but there is an alternative to the slash and burn policies.  Senator Norris spoke about the 50 cent prescription charges on the homeless when we could standardise reliefs for high-income earners and introduce a third rate of tax for those earning <Col N="742"/>above &euro;100,000 per year.  We could also introduce a wealth tax for those with assets, excluding the family home and farm, above &euro;1 million.  We should take in new money instead of cutting young people&rsquo;s social welfare payments, charging people without homes for medication and slashing and burning right across the economy.</P>
        <P>That is the deflationary strategy that has been implemented for the past two years and it is time to be brave and indicate that the Government got it wrong.  We cannot borrow any more because the markets do not trust the country.  Our Exchequer figures have decreased because we have deflated the economy and if we pursue the course of action that other parties have signed up to of taking at least &euro;3 billion from the economy for the next four years, it will completely deflate the economy.  We need a stimulus package.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The debate occurs across the world as to whether stimulus or austerity works.  Unfortunately, in this Parliament Sinn F&eacute;in is the only party arguing for stimulus.  We need to consider other avenues as this is about the future of our country and the hardship people face.  The Government should forget that the ideas come from another party in opposition but take them on merit.  Why would any of the proposals put forward by my party and me, which are costed by the Department of Finance, not work?  We should have that debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to come after Senators Doherty and White, as they have made a constructive contribution by laying out their party philosophies on how to emerge from this economic crisis.  That is to be applauded but the Senator will be unsurprised to know I do not agree with his comments.</P>
        <P>My comments are not a direct criticism of the Senator&rsquo;s proposals, although they have shortcomings, but we should consider the strategy followed by this and other Governments over the years.  When this country reduced taxation rates, the intake to the coffers doubled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The tax intake doubled from the property boom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Senator should not shake his head.  I am talking about well before that, going back to the 1980s.  We need a constructive debate in this respect.  In dealing with the economic crisis, there is a fundamental difference between those who follow stimulus and those who make cuts to deal with the deficit.  The right approach is somewhere between the two, as there must be a level of austerity in decreasing the deficit.  It is a major problem from which we cannot escape.  We must equally consider that if we cut back, we may suffocate the economy.  It is a major dilemma and somewhere between the two approaches lies the answer.</P>
        <P>We should consider the experience when we cut taxes, as there were benefits in that the tax intake doubled.  We must not ignore the fact but analyse it.  We must be fair to people and keep an enterprise culture going in the country.  If there is one thing we learned since the last recession in the 1980s it was that tax rates do need to come down.  We should not impose taxation on work &mdash; we should avoid that at all costs.  The experience of the past 20 years has shown us that.</P>
        <P>The low taxation economy and enterprise culture also gave us what was effectively full employment.  That is completely forgotten about now but I ask Senators to think about it.  The Government may have taken other measures that were not correct in economic policy but what I have mentioned is fundamental to an economy.</P>
        <P>Effectively full employment and a high tax take meant we could enhance public services.  We are in a dreadful position now but our income up to now has brought us what will be a complete motorway infrastructure in the country and proper wages for nurses and people like them who <Col N="743"/>were not being paid appropriately.  The money was also invested in school buildings and better resources for disadvantaged people.  That is what a Government should be doing.</P>
        <P>We should not lose sight of such achievements despite the current awful position, which came about as a result of some banking policies.  I take issue with Senator Doherty&rsquo;s philosophy because we cannot ignore that we live in the global economy.  We cannot ignore the markets as we are completely at the mercy of them on a weekly basis.  We can see how important the message we send to the markets is, as the traders on international markets can sink the country.  The Government must deal with such issues constantly, which is not really appreciated.  We are a proud sovereign nation but if bond holders choose to sink the country, it will be done.</P>
        <P>Two years ago the bank guarantee was put in place and the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance were in the firing line when they had to make a decision.  All of us have the benefit of hindsight to decide if we should have done this or that.  On the night in question, the Government had to make a decision to prevent the country from being traded down.  Since then, few have realised this country has stayed the right side of the brink.  If we had followed the Labour Party&rsquo;s policy, we would have certainly gone over that brink resulting in the International Monetary Fund intervening.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Alex White&rsquo;s calls for a constructive debate on the economy, not one in which Members just knock each other&rsquo;s ideas.  A stimulus package, for example, is a good proposal for debate.  While I also have concerns about the effects cutting back too much in the forthcoming budget would have on economic growth, I would also be concerned about a government not tackling a soaring deficit.  If we do not stick to the short timescale of the four-year economic plan, we will have problems with raising capital in the markets.  The European Union, in turn, would also not lend us the moneys required and, therefore, our corporate tax rate would be in trouble.</P>
        <P>Most other political parties agree keeping our low corporate tax rate is of vital importance.  We cannot take off in a fit of pique to go it alone by defaulting on the markets.  We are in this together with our European partners in the euro zone.  I do not want to sound alarmist but we need to have a reality check about how close the International Monetary Fund is to taking charge of the economy.</P>
        <P>I am tired of listening to people claim the Government does not have a right to govern or that it is on borrowed time.  A government has a five-year term.  The election was held in 2007, meaning the next should be in 2012.  I accept there has been an economic decline since 2007 but nobody knew then what we do now.  The Government is not robust enough in fighting its corner.  It has every right to govern for the remainder of its term while it enjoys a majority in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Government should be more vigorous in pointing out it was chosen by the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government will last its full five-year term.  I accept it is not popular but then those that cut back services and introduce austerity measures never are.  When one is doing the right thing, it is not necessarily appreciated.  I understand people&rsquo;s fears and anger about where we are at.  This must be harnessed, however, in a constructive way.</P>
        <P>Regarding the four-year budgetary plan, the Government has the right to make up an economic plan to run until 2012.  If it is going the right way, it will be evident by the next election.  It is also important that all other political parties which aspire to be in government make a constructive contribution towards the budgetary plans.  It is preferable that others will have bought into these solutions.</P>
        <P>The notion that this is a limping caretaker Government is nonsense.  It is time people appreciated the Government has a responsibility to bring down the deficit, which is far more important for the economy than the banking situation.  The Government must make difficult choices at <Col N="744"/>this point, for which it will not be popular.  Senator Norris spoke of the worst cutbacks such as homeless people being charged 50 cent for medical card prescription drugs.  While it may seem obscene, unfortunately these difficult measures will have to be taken.</P>
        <P>I want the Croke Park deal to be re-examined.  How the public service works is vital, particularly when we look at how much the bill for public sector wages and social welfare payments takes from the tax intake.  We must think about how all of us can make savings by working differently.</P>
        <P>It is also the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to use the resources it has for the benefit of those who cannot provide for or support themselves.  How many are in receipt of an annual public pension above &euro;100,000?  While it may not save much money and primary legislation may need to be amended, no public service pension should come to over &euro;100,000.  We simply cannot afford this.  I accept such recipients have given service to the State and have contractual expectations.  However, all our expectations have changed.  Why should public servants be any different?  An annual pension of &euro;100,000 is plenty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is an extremely difficult time.  Everyone harping on about having another election, however, is not going to help.  A cohesive and coherent response to these economic difficulties is required.  Another reason not to rush into another election is that the two parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, likely to form the next Government are not agreed on as fundamental a matter as solving the banking crisis.  That should be a concern for the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In March 2006 Michael Dell summed up the relationship between Ireland and his company:</P>
        <P LI="1">I do not think it is coincidence that Ireland and Dell share the same character and connection.  Every success we have achieved around the world has been due to the old Irish recipe of big dreams, hard work and strong relationships.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Unfortunately, three years later Michael Dell terminated that relationship and took 2,000 Irish-based jobs to other countries.  He did so due to several facts, most of which were actually within our control.  I advise Senator Alex White that extreme caution should be used when beginning any discussion about our corporation tax rate.  Just having such a debate would send alarm bells ringing in corporate boardrooms across the world.  Other countries and some Swiss cantons are offering 0% corporation tax for international start-up companies.  In an environment in which every country is clamouring for foreign direct investment, having such a debate is unwise.</P>
        <P>Michael Dell was correct that we are a people with big dreams and a talent for innovation and hard work.  We still have those people, who given support and encouragement would lead us out of the dark place in which we find ourselves and restore our national pride.  These people are the Irish business owners up and down the country who provide employment for up to 800,000 people and they could provide significantly more if they were listened to and supported by the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The biggest failing of the Government&rsquo;s focus on jobs is that it does not address the tough decisions and actions which need to be taken to get jobs back into the wider economy.  While a number of actions would require investment on the part of the Government, a number of them would not.  The businesses that employ 800,000 people are getting hammered in the recession from high Government charges, a completely outdated commercial rating system, no credit from banks and suffocating red tape.</P>
        <P Just="Left">None of the recent announcements, made with much fanfare by the Government, will do anything to aid these businesses.  If we are to create the number of jobs required in the economy <Col N="745"/>to fight off the recession we need to address the real problems in the economy.  The Government announced another strategy last week with the claim of creating an extra 300,000 jobs before 2015.  However, it contained no new policy or budgets and was simply a rehash of existing policy from tourism bodies, the revised national development plan and the smart economy policy, with a new jobs target stuck on top.  The Government plan also proposed to create a new agency to co-ordinate all the existing State agencies.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is interesting to note that at the very first opportunity which presented itself to this new agency and to other agencies like the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in Brussels the week before last to showcase Irish artisan food producers, we were the only country out of 27 EU countries with an empty table.  We had a plastic Irish flag and an empty bottle of stout sitting on the table.  That was our response as a Government to the jobs crisis.  The sad part of all this is that rather than setting up a new agency perhaps the Government should listen to our existing agencies, one in particular, namely, Forf&aacute;s.  It has already provided the Government with a blueprint for recovery within the indigenous Irish business sector.  Most of the structural problems for Irish businesses and the actions needed to overcome them were outlined two weeks ago in a Forf&aacute;s report, which the Government happened to slip out late on a Friday evening with little or no fanfare.</P>
        <P>The recommendations in the Forf&aacute;s report focus on reducing Government-controlled costs in the economy, which is key.  It also recommends investing in key economic arteries such as broadband, opening more of the economy to competition and cutting duplicated red tape on small business.  Many of these policy actions have been key parts of Fine Gael&rsquo;s job message over the past years.  The Government said it is seeking consensus and the sharing of ideas and approaches.  If it is, it is only fair that I outline Fine Gael&rsquo;s job message.</P>
        <P>Our NewERA strategy was recently described on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; by economist David McWilliams as making absolute sense.  If his opinion was worthwhile seeking late at night before the banking guarantee, I am sure it still holds some weight.  Under NewERA we would use the National Pension Reserve Fund, private pension funds and sales of non-strategic State assets to accelerate investment in high speed broadband, clean energy and water, all of which are things we need to make Ireland a better place to do business in and to create jobs.</P>
        <P>We would be well advised to follow the lead of the Finnish Government when, some weeks ago, it took the very progressive step of becoming the first country in the world to make broadband a legal right for every single citizen.  Under NewERA from Fine Gael this could happen.  We could rebuild our broadband, energy and water infrastructure.  Our plan can build these new projects, create over 100,000 jobs in the short term and develop a better economy, all paid for off the Government balance sheet.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael would also reform the tax system to ease the tax burden on employment.  This would take the form of a decrease in tax on employment to support jobs.  Employers&rsquo; PRSI is the most direct tax on employment.  The changes we suggest would result in a reduction of &euro;887 million in employment taxes and costs for the 175,000 Irish businesses registered for employers&rsquo; PRSI.  These changes would have the effect of reducing average pay costs by<?oasys _jy ?>2.5%, resulting in 30,000 extra jobs by 2015 according to the ESRI&rsquo;s rule of thumb.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s recent target for job growth in tourism was immediately under pressure as it refused to scrap the nonsensical passenger tax.  I am certain in the long run this tax will prove to cost more in lost revenue than it will collect.  The tourism sector is still in for a tough year unless the Government introduces friendly policies to get more people to visit Ireland.  In this context, the passenger tax makes no fiscal sense whatsoever.  The CEO of every major airline operating in this country, not just Michael O&rsquo;Leary, has called for the tax to be scrapped.  During the crisis in tourism the Government set up a tourism renewal group to report to <Col N="746"/>the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Hanafin.  It reported last year and one recommendation it made was the scrapping of the &euro;10 travel tax.</P>
        <P>Let us do two things.  We should scrap the tax for a year and call the bluff of Michael O&rsquo;Leary and other CEOs.  Michael O&rsquo;Leary says that without the tax he could increase passenger numbers by millions and create 6,000 jobs in the process.  Let us give him that chance.  Let us call his bluff and give him two years without a passenger tax, and if by then he has not delivered on his promises we should perhaps consider reinstating it.  However, we should at least give Michael O&rsquo;Leary and others such as bed and breakfasts and hotels the injection and opportunity they need to pick themselves up off the ground once again.</P>
        <P>Despite what our banks might say in public, they have simply shut up shop and are hoarding capital.  Every single cent of what we have invested in our banking system is sitting in bank coffers and not one cent of it has made its way into the real Irish economy.  Last week I met a businessman based in Galway who has been operating in China for the past 20 years, forging very strong links with the Chinese Government and industrialists.  He said he has four ideas at the moment that he is convinced, with his experience, would create up to 2,000 jobs in this country.  He has approached three different banks, none of which is willing to offer him the support he needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The ECB has confirmed to us in the past few weeks that we are not lending.  Truly viable SMEs are under severe pressure as credit lines dry up.  Fine Gael supports a Government partial loan guarantee scheme for SMEs that is based on the principle of risk sharing between the State and banks.  If that option was open to the businessman in Galway to whom I referred I assure the House he would have availed of it and, with his experience and expertise, would have gone on to create the jobs which he mentioned.  In addition to restoring some credit lines, the scheme would be necessary to start the rebuilding of relationships between small business and banks and to encourage better business analysis skills among banking employees because that relationship has broken down completely.  There is now no communication between the banking sector and small businesses in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will also publish an action plan for implementing the recommendations of the Government&rsquo;s National Competitiveness Council and the Competition Authority.  Of the 168 specific recommendations made by the Competition Authority since 2002 only 71, or just under half, have been implemented.  Tough decisions are now needed by Government to open the economy to greater competition in order to drive down costs in the economy, especially in the area of legal fees.</P>
        <P>Some three years on from the publication of the Government&rsquo;s business regulation forum report, only 4%of the targeted red tape reduction on business has been achieved.  The forum estimated that Government regulations alone are costing businesses up to &euro;500 million each year which could be completely avoided.  In today&rsquo;s fiercely competitive business environment that &euro;500 million is the difference between a lot of businesses surviving or going under.  To date, only &euro;20 million in savings out of a possible &euro;500 million have been achieved.  The overhauling of business regulations and cutting out unnecessary red tape must be a policy priority for any Government as we work to make the Irish business environment competitive again.  For most politicians in this House, our ongoing assessment of how businesses are doing is based not only on the experience of our own businesses but also on the coming into contact with other businesspeople throughout the country.  I can tell the Minister of State, from my interaction throughout the summer, that businesses in County Galway are suffering like they have never suffered before.  One of the biggest challenges they face is the payment of commercial rates which are now hopelessly out of date and bear no relationship whatsoever to their earning capacity.  During the summer I spoke to numerous Galway business owners who are faced with <Col N="747"/>the stark choice of either paying their 2010 rates bill and closing the door on their business or seeking a reduction in their bill and surviving.  In 2001, when the new rates Valuation Act was passed, a commitment was made by the then Government that in every one of the 88 rating areas there would be a complete revision carried out by the Valuation Office.  On that basis, many businesses held out hope that at long last the revaluation and revision would offer them the lifeline that they needed.  Almost ten years later, of the 88 rating areas, only three have seen a revision and there has been an average reduction of 30% in rates.  For many businesses, that reduction of 30%, if applied across the entire 88 rating areas, would mean, I am certain, the difference between survival and going under.</P>
        <P>I recall the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, speaking in the House on the night the bank guarantee was introduced.  At the time I remarked to him that he was fortunate to be in the position he was in and still make that point and claim.  This crisis, the darkness in which we find ourselves, offers a fantastic opportunity to do things and innovate and reform like we have never done before.  Therefore, can we, please, let this crisis mark the beginning of a new and genuine approach to supporting our job creators?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  It is always a pleasure to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who was a very distinguished Member of this House.  He is playing a role in what is perhaps the most focused Department of all, not only because of the time of year but also because of the times in which we live.  I could not help but reflect on the opening lines of <i>A Tale Of Two Cities</i> by Charles Dickens which, if memory serves me right, read: &ldquo;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&rdquo;.  Perhaps, in a way, that sums up where we are.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to reflect on the state of the economy and offer some hope to the people that the answer and solution to the crisis we face as a country can be found in these Houses.  I remember speaking some time back about the economy with a good friend of long standing, Deputy Gilmore, with whom I served for many years at the Council of Europe.  During the discussion he stated the answer needed to be found in these Houses; otherwise democracy itself would come into question.  I have never been one to bandy slogans about or scare the living daylights out of people by suggesting our democracy is in any way at risk.  However, it has often been stated democracy is a fragile flower which needs to be constantly encouraged and nurtured.  Therefore, the debate taking place on the state of the economy and the contribution that all those elected to represent the people in both Houses can make through an injection of new ideas and adding a new dimension to existing policies is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, we are political in the Houses and the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, got it right last evening on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; which, by the way, I suggest is required viewing for those up late enough at night to get an insight into Vincent&rsquo;s own particular interests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Last evening the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, nailed a particular canard among the chattering classes, as they are generally referred to and which include the Dublin media and the Dublin 4 set, an abstract concept, that the problems of the country would be more effectively solved by having a national Government.  Usually, a comparison is drawn <Col N="748"/>with the position in wartime Britain.  While we are in a war, I hardly think the comparison holds up.  As the Minister pointed out very gently, despite the best efforts of Mr. Browne to stop him from expressing his opinions &mdash; of course, everybody knows how Vincent operates on television&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a national government would not be in the best interests of the people because not only would we have consensus but we would also have no opposition.  The Minister trailed off, but he went on to infer that the next step in going down the road towards having a national government which would stifle and probably eliminate Opposition voices was a dictatorship.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>From that point of view, the debate under way on how we should fix the economy is to be welcomed.  </P>
        <P>I particularly applaud the initiative of the Taoiseach who in recent days has made it clear that he would welcome a significant input from those who oppose the Government in both Houses and has designated a senior civil servant to act as a liaison officer.  This suggestion has been rubbished, which is rather interesting because, if memory serves me right, it has always been the case, certainly in the most recent past prior to general elections, that the Government of the day has invited the Opposition to the Department of Finance to look at the books.  In fact, it was based on that initiative &mdash; I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that prior to the 2007 general election the main Opposition parties were provided with this facility and it was on the basis of the information provided by the Department at the time that they created and presented their manifestoes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I stated on the Order of Business, we have indulged in a form of historical political revisionism from 2007 when of the three major parties vying for government, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was the most prudent in what it offered to the electorate.  Unlike other parties, it did not propose to engage in extra spending.  I do not particularly blame them because at the time the economy was considered to be robust and vibrant.  It is rather sad in one sense, that somehow &mdash; it is a political charge that has been thrown around like snuff at a wake &mdash; the Government has been held to be mainly, solely and exclusively responsible for the state in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Earlier this week I was looking at the unemployment figures.  Interestingly, in 1997 approximately 1 million people were employed in this country.  By the latter part of 2007 the figure stood at 2.25 million which, by any standard, is a phenomenal increase in a short space of time considering our history.  Of course, those on the live register are suffering grievously.  I was among the unemployed and do not particularly need to be reminded of what it is like to be out of work, not have a focus in life and not have the dignity that work brings to the human soul.  Like every politician in the House of whatever hue and colour on both sides, I understand this and I am striving to try to correct it.</P>
        <P>What is interesting is that the unemployment figure began to rise in the first quarter of 2008.  Strangely, it coincided with the emergence of the international banking crisis which has subsequently led to a downturn in consumer confidence throughout the developed world which has resulted in fewer people spending money and led to a significant downturn in exports.  It is phenomenal that in this country the savings ratio has gone through the roof.  This is an open economy and it has often been stated we have to export 80% or 85% of what we produce. <Col N="749"/> However, time and again, not only in the economic and political areas, we compare ourselves with the United Kingdom, as if somehow this republic of 4 million people can in any way be compared economically with a country with a population of more than 60 million.  There is a strong and vibrant domestic market in the United Kingdom which has its own currency and can dictate how much money is put into the economy.  It is now called quantitative easing.  When I was a child, it was called printing money.  We cannot compare what is going on in England.  If one produces a product in the UK, one has a market of 60 million people initially who will buy it.  If one produces a product in this country, one has an all-island market of a little over 5 million.  Therefore, we must export.  That is the key to our future prospects &mdash; the surge in exports coupled with the policies the Government is pursuing.</P>
        <P>I applaud the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is coming under enormous pressure and unfair criticism for having been lied to for the past two years and about whom people are saying he did not tell the truth.  The people on whom he was relying were not telling the truth.</P>
        <P>We are where we are, which is an awful phrase to use.  I commend the Government on the policies it has undertaken.  I hope this current debate that is engaging all the political brains of this country will result in a positive outcome that will benefit the people who need it most.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my appreciation to the Leader of the House for the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I know my colleague, Senator Coghlan, does as well.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, for spending his time in the House for these two debates.  It is important that what people have to say is put on the record.  It is important that the Government would listen to and engage with it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I speak as someone who has supported every one of the Government&rsquo;s major proposals from the deposit guarantee two years ago.  I have recognised what it is doing.  I have stated on many occasions that some of the Opposition&rsquo;s proposals have not been without merit but that on balance I have supported the Government on those issues in the past two years.  That is where I come from.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I must make an important point in this regard.  When the Government talks about consensus and the ratings agencies look for political consensus, it is good to remember that consensus is a two-way track.  The Government must show me, as an Independent Member, how many of the Opposition&rsquo;s proposals it proposes to take on board or has taken on board in the past two years.  Regrettably, I have seen very little of it.  I see this argument from all sides.  It would be nice to see consensus, but consensus is a two-way street and both parties must buy into it.</P>
        <P>I am getting the negative stuff out of the way at the beginning.  In terms of the blame game, it is crucial to recognise the blame game is an important part of this process.  People ask where it gets us.  One might as well say we should get rid of the courts.  We must look at how decisions were made, and the Government can see that from, for instance, Professor Honohan&rsquo;s report <Col N="750"/>on banking.  In many ways, that report exonerated much of what the Government has done.  It was very fair but found aspects that were wrong in what the Government did.  I go along with the view of former Taoiseach, Dr. Garrett FitzGerald, that one cannot blame the Government for all this, although perhaps one can blame the Government for some of it.  It is important to look back and see where we came from in order that we learn from it.  If we do not learn from it, we are creating a moral hazard.  This idea of not playing the blame game is almost a licence for people to make mistakes in the future.  If mistakes have been made, it is a moral hazard not to recognise them and indicate them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The parties opposite, because they are in government, will pay the price at the next election.  That is the way politics works.  Regardless of whether they are fully responsible for all that went wrong, that is the way the world works.  The question that needs to be asked to give balance to what I am saying is whether we would be in our current position if Fine Gael was in government.  I believe that if Fine Gael was in government, we would still be in a bad position.  I will let Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il argue among themselves whether we would be in as bad a position as we are.</P>
        <P>We need to look at where we are going and the positives as well.  My view of the world is one I would recommend to most people.  I only listen now to commentators who have some basis on which to comment.  I look at the names of those writing front page stories and tend not to read those stories unless they are written by someone who has a basis for writing them.  I do not care whether I disagree with them.  I would be a long time in disagreement with Mr. Dan O&rsquo;Brien, the economics editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>, but since he has moved from <i>The Economist</i> to <i>The Irish Times</i> his commentary has been extraordinarily balanced.</P>

	<P>No, I agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. O&rsquo;Brien has been critical but has attempted to find balance, and we need more of that.  While I do not mind people with whom I disagree offering their point of view, we need to be careful.  Someone mentioned &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo;.  I watched that programme last Wednesday night when one of the experts said that if the Government had to put money into AIB the following morning, and by that stage we all knew it would, then we were in worse trouble then ever before and the yield on our bonds would rise.  Someone, I think it was Mr. Vincent Browne, suggested perhaps in that case we should not go into the bond markets for the next few months, to which the reply was were we to do that, the yield would go through the roof.  It was interesting, because one very rarely catches out economists, that precisely the circumstances he outlined occurred in the following 24 hours but the reverse of what he expected took place in that our coupon rate fell instead of rose.  We should recognise that, because these people are putting themselves forward as experts in this regard.</P>
        <P>An important point about the positives and the importance of exports was raised by Senator Mooney.  This is a point I did not see on any front page.  This country exported more in August of this year.  I think the figure was &euro;40 billion.  It was the largest level of exports ever in the history of this State.  It is important to recognise that.  With all of the bad news, that is good news.</P>
        <P>It is also important to look at employment.  Our employment rate has now gone up to<?oasys _jy ?>86.4%.  Being an optimist, I always prefer to look at the number in employment as opposed to the number in unemployment.  Therefore, 86.4% of the workforce go out to work every day. <Col N="751"/> As well as that, there are many pensioners who are comfortable and who get their pension every month or every fortnight.</P>
        <P>In the middle of all of this, there is a substantial level of saving, as was mentioned by a number of Senators.  We must unlock those savings but we cannot do so unless people have certainty.  Ordinary people are the same as companies or entrepreneurs in that they need an element of certainty.  If, for example, a Minister says the Government will cut back pensions and salaries, a couple thinking of going away to Cavan for a weekend, putting in new windows or extending their house will change their mind, ask whether they can afford it and decide they had better wait and see.  The Government worsens the situation.  One must create an optimistic certainty among people.  This is not foolish optimism but a certainty of knowing their income will be maintained.  One of the values of the Croke Park agreement is that it should commit public sector workers to spending their money rather than saving it for the rainy day because it will not come in the next two to three years.</P>
        <P>I rarely quote ISME reports with any sense of confidence but I nearly swallowed my egg last week when I heard ISME state that the position between banks and the small and medium-sized enterprises had improved.  It was the first positive note I had ever heard from Mr. Mark Fielding.  He normally depresses me.  There are pieces of good news.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise that the disaster with Allied Irish Banks was not caused by anything going bad in the economy.  To make assurance doubly sure and for belt and braces, the Financial Regulator has insisted the amount of money the bank needs in assets should be raised from &euro;7.5 billion to &euro;10 billion.  That is the reason AIB has had to get the extra funding.  It is not that the prognosis has got worse.  There are issues in that regard we need to examine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also need to look at an ongoing major debate on whether pension funds &mdash; not just our own but also private pension funds of pension companies &mdash; should be allowed invest in our bonds.  I hope the Minister of State responds to this.  Many pension funds are invested abroad at 2% or 3% at a time when they could be invested in Irish bonds at 4% or 5%, but they can only do that with a change in legislation and I ask the Minister to do that.</P>
        <P>The points made by the voluntary and community pillar in recent days are worth looking at.  They were positive, optimistic and certain about what they could do and I agree with them.</P>
        <P>The tax take needs to be increased.  If I were to find fault with the Government, it would be on that issue.  The tax take is far too low.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to participate in the debate.</P>

	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State.  I found much of what Senator O&rsquo;Toole had to say refreshing.  We all accept that he is fair and independent-minded.

        <P>We all know from those involved in the business world that we are in a bad place.  We are crippled by costs that we are not able to control or get around, but we have to travel on with hope.  I believe Fine Gael and, no doubt, the Labour Party will independent-mindedly examine the books.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A sensible proposal was made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole in regard to pensions and restrictions on pension funds.  It would be worth examining in the national interest and the amending legislation should be introduced as a matter of urgency in order that we could invest in ourselves, so to speak.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael also agrees that the debt to GDP ratio must be reduced to 3% by 2014, the target agreed by the Government and the European Commission.  We also accept that, because of higher debt servicing charges and a projected lower growth rate, the fiscal adjustment required needs to be at an amount above what has been agreed.  We will make independent-minded decisions on what expenditure and tax measures are required to achieve the targets set.  We will not be bound by the decisions made on particular expenditure cuts and tax increases which the Government may announce.  We have had an enlightening chat about the matter, as one would expect.  We are not, as Senator Mooney said, into having a one party State or one party rule.  We do not need a national Government at this time for these and other allied reasons.  We will continue to play a constructive role in the forthcoming debate on the budget.  However, there will not be a second Tallaght strategy, as we all accept the context now is different.</P>
        <P>Everybody is appalled at the waste of funds and the new revelations yesterday of F&Aacute;S-style waste in the HSE.  Colleagues spoke about the issue on the Order of Business.  Unfortunately, I was not called to speak about it, but sin ceist eile.</P>
        <P>It is important that we hear from the Minister with responsibily for the public service.  No one seems to know what cost reductions and savings are being made in any Department.  The message seems to be that some Departments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have no doubt the Minister of State is top of the class.  I would not expect him to be anywhere else.  However, there are Departments which we are led to believe are lax and I have no doubt this is true.  I was appalled recently to hear about an official in a certain Department &mdash; I will not name the official or the Department &mdash; who had told a person in a body under the aegis of the Department that he was not interested in making savings.  He wanted something else, a direct contribution, but was not interested in making savings.  That was a crazy comment for that public servant to make.  Allegedly it is true; that is the story as it was relayed to me.</P>
        <P>There is so much we could say about the banks, but I will not go into that matter now.  I hope we will have a full debate on the issue in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I thank all Senators for their contributions to what has been a very good debate and will try, with whirlwind speed, to go through some of the points made.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey asked for a progress report on the Croke Park agreement, an issue which, I gather, was also raised on the Order of Business today.  It is a very important part of the reform programme in respect of the public finances, certainly in the case of my own quasi-Department, the Office of Public Works.  I discussed the matter only yesterday with the chairman who, in turn, was due to meet trade union representatives on the subject.  Obviously, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  It is fair to say the agreement was subject to reconsideration if there were certain dire financial circumstances, but I am certainly in favour of seeing whether we can make it work to release some blockages in the public service.</P><Col N="753"/>
        <P>In an ideal world one would maintain capital spending.  In the very early stages of the crisis that was the Government&rsquo;s intention, but that did not prove to be tenable.  Our capital spending is still relatively high compared to most EU member states, but obviously it cannot be excluded from the savings programme.  I watched with interest the debate within the Labour Party on the subject of metro north, the immediate short-term cost of which would be very small.  Like the DART, it would be financed over a period of 20 years.  I personally would like to see it happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Twomey made a point, with which I agree.  He said the next Government &mdash; I mean this in a broad sense &mdash; would be tied to commitments entered into by the Government.  I have seen this operate at eurozone meetings and it is nothing particularly new.  I remember that in the late 1980s the incoming Fianna F&aacute;il Government spent three years paying the housing grants granted by the previous Government.  Obviously, the current context is much more serious, but, in terms of broad parameters, the commitments made will, under the Stability and Growth Pact, bind a successor Government.  In case that seems intimidating, the main Opposition parties agreed the broad parameters &mdash; a cut of &euro;4 billion &mdash; in the budget last year; therefore, it would not be an impossible challenge.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry raised a number of questions about pension liabilities.  I will give him a more detailed note later, but the net point is that, because the Government took over certain pension schemes from universities and non-commercial State bodies, there was or will be no payment into the fund in 2010 or 2011 and there will be only a partial contribution in 2012.  The Senator also made a point about the current pension fund standard.  That matter is under examination.  In reply to Senator O&rsquo;Toole, many issues relating to pensions will be considered and reviewed in the context of the budget.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley spoke about pension payments of &euro;100,000 per annum.  The real cost of pensions can be associated with the large lump sums that are paid.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn rightly highlighted the importance to commerce of services.  Many job announcements come from that quarter.  One also needs fundamental sources of production, such as manufacturing, agriculture, tourism and forestry.  Germany, which is the most successful economy in Europe, has not abandoned manufacturing for services.  That would be a more accurate description of the British model, which I am not sure is a good one.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with a point made by Senator Boyle.  I try to restrain myself from offering any false confidence because it elicits a negative reaction, rather than a positive one.  I agree with his point that in the last 20 years, we have acquired an entrepreneurial belief in ourselves &mdash; certainly inside this country &mdash; for the first time.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Burke, I am conscious of the importance of tourism.  We need to do our best to improve, make accessible and keep open the heritage facilities that come under the aegis of the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Senator Burke&rsquo;s comments about the visit of the Minister for Education and Skills to the United States.  Education is one of the services we can supply to the US and to more distant places like China.  There is great potential in this area.  I accept his point that the visa situation needs to be straightened out in some instances.  A Bill on that issue is being discussed in the other House.</P>
        <P>I believe in cutting out waste.  Since 2008, my office has cut its budget by 35%.  I have also slashed the cost of my personal office.</P><Col N="754"/>
        <P>A number of speakers, including Senator Hanafin, emphasised the importance of relations with China.  I fully agree with them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I appreciate that people should always tell the truth, at the beginning of a crisis period it is not always realistic to expect people to be able to get immediately to the bottom of every aspect of a fast moving situation in which judgments may have to be revised.  I accept that some things may have been said in bad faith, or may have been hopelessly over-optimistic, but I do not think it should be assumed that everything that has since been proven to be wrong was necessarily said in bad faith.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reference was made to Commissioner Rehn&rsquo;s comment that Ireland will cease to be a low-tax country.  Ireland ceased to be such a country in late 2008 or early 2009.  A table in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers indicated that Ireland now has the sixth highest level of income tax in the EU.  On the other hand, our level of PRSI is very low by comparison with most other countries.  I heard somebody say we should decrease it further.  We are very competitive with other countries on that front.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Alex White suggested the House should hear submissions from organisations like CORI.  The committee system is in place to bring such organisations in, question them and allow them to make presentations.</P>
        <P>I am afraid that reluctantly, I do not agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments about the nominal 50 cent prescription charge.  Perhaps I would have agreed with him 20 or 30 years ago.  The evidence of the introduction of the plastic bag tax etc., suggests that a great deal of waste can be cut out by means of a very low nominal charge.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />that the head of IDA Ireland recently stated that Ireland needs to address competitiveness issues such as energy prices in order to grow and win more business;</P>
        <P LI="1">and calls on Government to postpone the introduction of the PSO levy on electricity prices.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to the House to discuss this motion, which affects every household, large business and small corner shop in the country.  In a modern society, the price of electricity is one of the main facets and energies of every household and business.  Everyone depends on their source of electricity.  As a society, we have all become very accustomed to electricity.  It is only on those rare occasions when we do not have electricity &mdash; I refer to blackouts, for example &mdash; that we truly realise the value and importance of electricity.  It keeps our households lit and warm and keeps our businesses functioning and working as best they can.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to explain why Fine Gael has tabled this motion.  The Minister will probably give the House some very good reasons for the introduction of the PSO levy.  We are concerned about <Col N="755"/>the hardship and devastation that is being experienced in the current economic climate, which is unprecedented in Ireland&rsquo;s modern history.  Many large businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises are struggling to stay competitive on a daily basis.  The introduction of this levy will push many of them up to the threshold, or over the threshold, so they are no longer viable.  The same thing applies to domestic households.  The Minister can probably give the House the relevant figures for the large increase in the number of disconnections.  This issue has been played out in the media in recent weeks.  ESB Networks is disconnecting domestic households even though the people in question may be in dire circumstances.  It is a reflection of the substantial financial pressures they face as they try to pay their everyday bills.</P>
        <P>I am sure Members will agree that people do not pay their electricity bills because they have little or no other option.  The introduction of the PSO levy will bring a new raft of people into the category of those who are struggling to pay their bills.  As far as many of them are concerned, it might be the last straw that makes them unable to afford to pay their bills and keep their electricity switched on, especially as we enter the winter period.  It would represent common sense, particularly in light of last year&rsquo;s cold snap, one of the worst for over 100 years, for the Government to review this policy and postpone its implementation until the economy is more stable and people&rsquo;s homes and businesses have more secure futures.  Agencies such as the IDA, ISME and other business organisations do not normally come out so strongly or state quite so categorically that the Government should postpone the increase in the public service obligation, PSO, levy on electricity prices.  They are saying this because they know the people with whom they work and the members of their organisations are put to the pins of their collars to remain competitive, viable and in business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The lifeblood of electricity is an area that has been identified in the EUROSTAT figures.  It is highly worrying to note that Ireland has the fifth highest domestic and sixth highest commercial electricity prices among 31 countries in Europe and that the Minister now proposes to introduce such a levy at such an economically sensitive time for everyone.  This does not show much consideration for the hardship and realities that obtain in all our communities.  The Minister will argue the reasons for the original introduction of the public service obligation, namely, to secure energy supplies and competitiveness in the market and to introduce new suppliers.  While that is all well and good, there is a time and a place for so doing.  Were the Minister to consult the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, MABS, the Department of Social Protection or any other agencies that deal on a daily basis with people who struggle to pay their electricity bills, he would realise there is great hardship.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Department of Social Protection has announced a package of &euro;12.6 million to assist those in receipt of the electricity allowance under the household benefits package.  However, it appears quite crazy that one Department must hand out such entitlements and benefits to try to cover costs imposed by another Department and a great irony exists in that regard.  I always will argue the case for those whom I describe as being from middle Ireland who are working hard &mdash; those who are lucky to have jobs &mdash; but who receive no benefits.  What about those people, who are put to their pins of their collars to pay their mortgages, as well as their education and medical costs?  Although they pay for everything at this time in this society, this proposal constitutes another increase on the monthly bills they also will struggle to meet.  The timing of this introduction must be reviewed.  While I understand the reason for a public service obligation levy and the reason this area requires attention, the Fine Gael Party believes this increase should be postponed.</P>
        <P>I must declare a slight conflict of interest as I worked for the ESB for 20 years, albeit on the network, rather than the supply end of it.  I do not believe the people, the Minister or anyone else realises the frustration experienced by the electricians of ESB Networks who must cut off families&rsquo; electricity supply.  I worked for the ESB when it was the main supplier and even the <Col N="756"/>electrician who went out to cut off supply to a house could always engage in a certain degree of negotiation with the relevant householder.  Were such an electrician to receive a fiver on having been called out, he could drive the van away and not disconnect the house.  However this can no longer happen because the entire market has shifted with the advent of the new suppliers, such as Airtricity, Bord G&aacute;is and many others, including Electricity Customer Supply.  Once an instruction to disconnect comes from those organisations to ESB Networks, the same electrician who went out ten years ago to cut off supply to a house but who could turn away the van without disconnecting the family concerned no longer has such a choice or discretion.  This point needs to be made and it is a sad indictment of our society that hard-nosed business decisions of suppliers now come into play and that the ESB Networks technicians who are sent out to disconnect a house or business for non-payment of bills over a period now are obliged to proceed with that, even if the affected bill payer makes offers or pleas.  This is a sad development in our modern society because discretion, understanding and human feeling are gone.  Without the protection of organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and the MABS associations nationwide, people literally would be on their own.</P>
        <P>Members will have noted a case a few weeks ago in which a man chained himself to the nearby ESB headquarters.  This man genuinely was trying to address the backlog in his bills but because of the hard-nosed business attitude of suppliers, which do not appear to recognise the hardship that exists on the ground, his offer to try to pay off his backlog over a period was rejected.  This is not the kind of society we need to develop as one cannot lose sight of real need, especially in a recessionary time.  I remember when the ESB operated retail departments and people could buy appliances such as washing machines using their ESB bills.  However, as I have told many people, those who could not qualify to have the price of their washing machine put on their ESB bills and who were struggling with their bills, qualified for mortgages shortly afterwards.  This demonstrates how the ESB always had a responsible role in the manner in which it managed its customers and bills.  It had the track record of not lending to those who it knew could not afford such appliances.  Shortly afterwards however, banks, credit unions and other institutions lent money hand over fist to such people, who then got into difficulty and tried to repay the loans through recourse to moneylenders and others who prey on such vulnerable people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are the matters that must be considered before coming up with the great principles and policies of increasing the price of electricity simply to secure our energy supplies.  Our energy supplies will survive and have done so since the original setting of the public service obligation levy to zero.  Moreover, they will continue to survive in the next few years because those companies and the State are strong enough to carry it.  However, many of the people who will be cut off will not survive and this is the reason I have tabled this motion.  It is an appeal for common sense to enter the debate to reflect the pure pain being experienced on the ground at present during the current recession.</P>
        <P>On the subject of energy supply and security, some Members of this House serve on the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and progress has been made on the main interconnector to the United Kingdom.  However, I have always thought it would be better to build a second interconnector to mainland Europe to facilitate the establishment of a ring main encompassing Ireland, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe.  We then could consider all the possibilities of getting highly competitive prices from mainland Europe and the United Kingdom.  This would introduce the necessary competition into the markets and also would enhance security of supply because we no longer would be an island sitting out in the Atlantic Ocean but would have a ring main, similar to that which can be found in any commer<Col N="757"/>cial installation or household, whereby in the event of one element of the ring main being unable to provide supply, one can always divert to the other.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Moreover, there is potential in such an approach because one can also export, were we to develop some of the renewable energies about which one likes to hear.  Other speakers may develop the point further to the effect that many barriers exist to the development of wind energy farms.  Some that come to mind are the problems associated with offshore licensing and the lack of a long-term spatial planning strategy for wind energy.  There are areas of detail that must be ironed out to introduce proper competition in the area of renewable energy.  Many barriers exist to companies that are interested in investing in renewable energies, both in the planning and regulatory systems, that must be ironed out.  This is how competition and security of supply should be introduced.</P>
        <P>I conclude by noting that my former employer, the ESB, pays millions of euro in dividends back to the State.  I understand that &euro;74 million was paid a couple of years ago and the amount probably was greater this year.  Surely some of these millions of euro in profit could be diverted into postponing this PSO for the reasons I outlined previously.  I refer to the humane reasons that would help people who now are put to the pins of their collars to meet their weekly and monthly electricity bills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion so ably proposed by my colleague, Senator Coffey.  There is no question but that high energy prices cost jobs.  Utility costs such as energy usually make up most of the non-labour related costs of businesses.  When international companies come to Ireland or elsewhere seeking countries in which to establish bases, they examine closely how the economy&rsquo;s cost competitiveness compares with other countries.  High Irish energy prices remain a top concern for businesses and enterprise agencies that are tasked with selling Ireland as an investment location.</P>
        <P>The head of the IDA, Mr. Barry O&rsquo;Leary, stated recently on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that a number of barriers to growth and winning more business had been discussed and that it is quite clear we need to be more competitive in areas such as energy.  That statement is by a man who is trying to bring businesses to Ireland.  He is stating clearly the cost of energy is inhibiting businesses from coming here.  Surely we must listen to the man who is trying to sell Ireland and bring businesses here.</P>
        <P>The latest EUROSTAT statistics on energy prices, which were outlined in part by Senator Coffey, show that Ireland has the sixth highest domestic electricity prices of 31 countries in Europe, behind only Luxembourg, Austria, Italy, Germany and Denmark.  When tax is excluded, prices in Ireland are the third highest, behind only Luxembourg and Italy.  With regard to my point on business costs and competitiveness, Ireland&rsquo;s electricity prices for businesses are the sixth highest among the 31 countries.  These are facts, not just statistics, and we must listen to them, especially when preparing policy.</P>
        <P>The public service obligation, PSO, levy is designed to support the policy objectives of security of energy supply and the use of indigenous fuels, such as peat, and renewable energy sources in electricity generation.  Specifically, the proceeds of the levy are to be used to recoup additional costs incurred by energy suppliers in having to source a proportion of their electricity supplies from such generators.  The PSO levy is entirely a decision of the Government.  It will indiscriminately increase energy bills for all users.  It is estimated that household bills will increase by approximately 5% and small businesses will end up paying more for their annual energy at a time when they are on their knees.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection announced that welfare payments, made available via the household benefits package, will be increased at a cost of &euro;12.6 billion.  In essence, one <Col N="758"/>Department is increasing welfare payments to cover charges set by another Department.  This is ludicrous.  That public spending has increased as a result of the Government imposed levy exposes the dearth of sensible policy on the part of the Government.  There is no vision, no joined-up thinking and no plan such that people can be confident in the policies advocated by the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many in this House never witnessed hardship, yet there are many people suffering hardship.  They are unable to make mortgage repayments and to pay ESB and other utility bills.  As Senator Coffey stated, when a person cannot pay his electricity or gas bill, he is certainly on his knees and in dire straits, yet we are talking about increasing bills.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coffey, who worked for the ESB for many years and who is well aware of the circumstances affecting the organisation, has outlined the current position on suppliers.  It is disgraceful that people are cut off and then charged exorbitant fees in order be to be reconnected.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have appealed to suppliers.  I appeal to the Minister to make representations to suppliers to cut reconnection charges to a minimum.  Such charges are another burden imposed on people.  Being cut off is bad enough but having to pay a reconnection fee that is even greater than the sum owed in the first instance is crazy.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Coffey in asking that the Minister postpone the introduction of the levy until there has been a full re-examination of the circumstances that obtain.  I hope he will not give us any lectures on renewable energy.  Let us speak about ordinary people who find it difficult to pay their ESB and gas bills at present and who will be asked to pay more when the PSO levy is introduced.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;commends the Government for:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />its comprehensive actions to deliver a secure, sustainable and competitive energy supply, including its commitment to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices in the long term, and improving the regulation of energy markets, with resultant benefits to consumers;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />its policy of enhancing security of supply and reducing our exposure to volatile international fuel prices through increased fuel diversity, with particular focus on indigenous resources;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />its decisive actions to mitigate energy costs for large energy users as well as its supports for domestic consumers; and</P>
        <P LI="1">recognises</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />that Ireland faces particular challenges in terms of energy cost competitiveness, including significant dependence on volatile imported fossil fuels, particularly gas and a requirement for major investment in energy infrastructure, following two decades of under-investment;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />that the implementation of Government policies, along with falling natural gas prices, has led to significant reductions in Irish electricity prices in recent years, bringing them <Col N="759"/>closer to and in some cases below EU and eurozone averages for both domestic and business consumers;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />a significant number of domestic and business customers could reduce their electricity bills and more than offset the cost of the PSO levy by availing of reductions offered in the competitive electricity market or by engaging in Government supported energy efficiency programmes;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />that the PSO scheme and levy, which has been in place since 2001, is to support the continued contribution of peat-generated electricity, to increase security of supply and to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s 40% renewable electricity target, which in turn will contribute to achieving Ireland&rsquo;s legally binding EU renewables obligations.&rdquo;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Brady for allowing me to speak.  I am very glad to have the opportunity to set out some of the details of our energy policy and the crucial issue of pricing for householders and businesses.  I want to correct what I regard as some of the misapprehensions about the competitive position of electricity prices.  The opportunity afforded to me by the Seanad in this debate is very welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Electricity prices for businesses and households have fallen dramatically in the past 18 months.  This has delivered real savings for consumers and has pushed prices in certain key categories below the eurozone average.  That is the reality and it is important we let people know it and not instil greater fear in them and generate considerable negative sentiment that is not backed up by that reality.  Given the challenges we face and the need to be competitive, we need to lower prices.  We need to keep them down and help out families who face real difficulties at this time.  We will do that.</P>
        <P>Let me set out the background and some of the challenges faced in this regard.  The challenges arise from a lack of historical investment in infrastructure.  Our prices spiked very high because, for a long period, especially through the 1990s, no price increases were granted.  Demand rose as our economy grew and we had to make a very dramatic and quick catch-up investment, which in itself increased the price of electricity.  There was a great increase in demand and we had to invest in our networks such that factories would not have to switch off.  The main disincentive for investment would be if a company such as Intel ever had a power blackout because we did not have the network in place to deliver the electricity.  That would have been the biggest killer of investment.  It was crucial we invested and made up for the lack of investment that occurred throughout the 1990s.  That imposed a cost, particularly in the early and middle part of the last decade.</P>
        <P>One reason our prices were high was because we used a very high proportion of imported fossil fuels, especially gas, in electricity production.  We were over-reliant on imported gas from which an excessively large proportion of our electricity was derived.  We had no gas stream of our own and it was all imported.  We did not have control over the price of gas and when it spiked, we were caught out along with Italy and the Netherlands.  Comparable countries had a similar proportion of gas in their electricity production sources and, consequently, had similarly high prices.  This is one reason our prices were high.</P>
        <P>One reason we introduced a PSO in 2001 was that we recognised we had to move away from over-reliance on a single fossil fuel.  We had to have diversity of supply for security and pricing <Col N="760"/>reasons and to ensure we would not be caught out when, as the International Agency Energy stated, fossil fuel prices started to rise, as they were expected to do.  We also have an issue by dint of our geography in the sense that this is a small island with many power stations which tend to be less economic.  This, unfortunately, helps to push up prices.  We also have a different geographic structure from neighbouring European countries with which we must compete.  While Holland, Denmark and other countries have dense population structures, we have the exact opposite.  Some 40% of houses here are one-off houses in the country and attaching wires to them is expensive.  On the distribution network, the average length to a home in the United Kingdom is 25 m.  In Ireland, it is 75 m and we all have to pay for the extra 50 m of wire and cable.  A number of factors are driving up prices which we have to take into account.  However, there are also a number of factors now driving prices down.  We should be honest in politics and recognise this rather than engage in point-scoring all the time.</P>
        <P>One of the benefits in recent years has been the move to having a single electricity market on the island, North and South, an historic development.  Its achievement was a huge engineering feat and is helping to bring prices down.  We have a bigger market and do not now have to have two spinning reserves, North and South.</P>
        <P>We have also succeeded in bringing about competition.  We deregulate not for some ideological reason or free market ideology but because competition works.  We have significant companies involved in the electricity market, including the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is, Endesa which has invested massively in this country in recent years, Scottish and Southern Electricity and Veridian.  These large companies with international expertise are competing for Irish customers.  This, too, has helped to bring down prices and overcome some of the disadvantages I outlined.  We have also, using these market mechanisms, seen significant new investment and are beginning to have larger more modern and economic power stations, two of which were opened this year in Cork.  These are the plants that will produce a more competitive supply.  This has all happened in recent years because of the good policy set out in the White Paper and recent Government papers.  Endesa has brought a large amount of money into the economy.</P>
        <P>We recognised a year and a half ago that, owing to our overdependence on fossil fuels, the fact that our networks had increased prices and that we were in an economic crisis, we had to bring down prices.  With the regulator and in a proper fashion so as not to disrupt a regulated market, which allowed the continuation of an all-Ireland approach, we brought down prices for large energy users by up to 45%.  These are price reductions that have occurred in the past two years and improved our competitiveness.  More than &euro;500 million was taken from the ESB and used to achieve lower prices for other consumers.  That is the reality of what happened as a result of Government action and it has had a beneficial effect.  Two or three years ago the head of Intel was screaming that prices here were too high.  He recently acknowledged that something has been done and that it was starting to work.  Therefore, let us not scare the people at a time when they are scared enough.  Let us acknowledge that certain things have been done which help to achieve competition.</P>

	<P>We did more.  This was the first country in Europe to introduce a tax on carbon for those utilities in respect of which there is a windfall tax up to 2012 and we are <Col N="761"/>reallocating the money to industry because we recognise there is a competitiveness agenda which we must support.  A number of changes were made.  This should be recognised.</P>
        <P>Many statistics are being bandied about for different categories of users and so on.  There is a range of statistics available.  It is complicated stuff.  EUROSTAT, the official European institute which collects and collates information from all European member states, sets out, as published in May by Sustainable Energy Ireland in its report, Electricity and Gas Prices in Ireland, the statistics for the Irish domestic electricity consumer, the average Irish household, and they vary.  For example, the cost of electricity in a holiday home is higher.  Prices are higher in small holiday homes because they only use electricity for a few months of the year.  In the case of the average Irish household &mdash; approximately 50% fit into this category &mdash; they were 2% below the eurozone average after tax, not including purchasing power or taking parity into account and so on.  These are the European statistics.</P>

Our position improved further in the first half of this year.  As in 2009, we tended to see greater reductions than other eurozone countries.  Each category changes, as there is a complex pricing mechanism.  However, the cost to small Irish businesses was 3% below the eurozone average.  For the average Irish household, it was 2% below the eurozone average.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;wants the Irish consumer to face a difficult price increase.  What we need is diversity of supply.  The PSO was introduced in 2001 to protect the consumer in the <Col N="762"/>long run and develop alternative supplies which would be less volatile.  No one wants to increase prices.  The PSO was introduced for strategic reasons which made sense.</P>
        <P>As well as prices for the average Irish household being about 2% below the eurozone average, there is an opportunity, because we have introduced a competitive market, for householders to shop around and obtain a further 10% to 14% reduction.  Approximately 30% of householders have already done this and there is nothing to stop the remaining 70% from obtaining this reduction by switching supplier.  This has been done to ensure we will develop a competitive market and it is possible with one telephone call.  This facility is not available in Northern Ireland or other European countries.</P>
        <P>We have a competitive market here as a result of the adoption of a good policy approach which is overseen by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Last Friday the business market was deregulated.  This means it is now fully competitive, with five or more serious competitors seeking customers&rsquo; business.  Similarly, we will move in the domestic sector to adopting such a deregulated approach, which is the right way to keep operators honest and ensure they keep their costs down.  They know they must compete with other supply companies and thus keep down prices for the Irish householder.  The CER implements a range of European regulations, from which we benefit.  It has introduced a regulatory approach, as well as competition, and fundamentally changed the market from one in which there was a monopoly ten years ago to one which is made up of five serious competitors, plus a range of other suppliers, willing to offer an electricity supply to Irish households.  It has worked and is resulting in reduced prices, in a way with which we should not interfere or distort.</P>
        <P>The PSO levy was, as I stated, introduced in 2001 by way of legislation.  I did not introduce it and cannot remove it.</P>

	<P>He does this within a fixed timetable as prescribed in the legislation.  There is no discretion.  The PSO levy is in place to compensate suppliers using a range of strategic sustainable local energy resources that we need to encourage in order that we will not be completely reliant on imported fossil fuels.  This makes sense for us as one of the countries most dependent on imported fossil fuels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our AER contracts and other support contracts for wind energy projects were below the market price when gas and electricity prices increased.  In the past four or five years, they subsidised the rest of the market to the tune of approximately &euro;250 million.  Using wind energy continues to keep prices low because when the wind blows expensive plant is switched off and we switch to using wind energy for which the fuel price is zero.  The support provided through the PSO levy means wind energy project operators know that when electricity prices decrease, as they have done in the past two years, they will continue to receive a steady return on their investment.  This enables them to secure financing for their sites and projects.  This is the approach taken by every country that is succeeding in developing renewable supplies.  Feed-in support prices are intelligent and they work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Fine Gael Party should be careful about threatening to cut the legs from under the wind energy industry if it gets into government because it will kill a sector that is involved in spending a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be the outcome of the Fine Gael policy of no longer supporting wind energy.  The party cannot, on the one hand, talk about NewERA this, that and the other, while taking an approach that reveals old era thinking.  It is a throwback to Charlie Haughey&rsquo;s strategy on electricity prices.  Investment in renewables would cease if the Fine Gael Party were to pursue some of the policies set out in the motion.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I know what I am talking about.  I have outlined what would be the effect of the Fine Gael proposals.  The party should be careful about adopting such an approach in Government because not only would it kill an industry but it would also lead to increased prices.  The alternative, local, cheap supply of wind energy is the Irish consumer&rsquo;s protection against the high price of fossil fuels.  If Fine Gael were to follow the strategy it appears to be advocating, it would kill that supply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The bulk of the money generated from the public service obligation is allocated to peat- fired power plants.  More than &euro;90 million of the &euro;156 million derived from the PSO has gone to such plants.  If the Fine Gael Party is advocating switching off these power stations, perhaps its spokespersons should talk to its Deputies and Senators from the midlands.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to the motion which seeks to stop the public service obligation.  I have set out the effect of taking this course of action.  I do not have any interest in price increases but I have an interest in ensuring this country is not left exposed by being completely reliant on imported gas as its source of electricity.  Such an eventuality would present a real threat to our long-term interests.</P>
        <P>I can work with the Fine Gael Party on the basis that we need to protect those who are most vulnerable.  I was pleased the Minister for Social Protection was able to provide increased funding to ensure those on low incomes and at risk of fuel poverty will not be affected by any increase in the public service obligation.  This is an appropriate and correct response.</P>

	<P>They are having their electricity supplies disconnected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that we must be sensitive with regard to disconnections.  I followed with interest the discussion at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources last week at which the utility companies set out the reality regarding disconnections.  Many people are experiencing budgetary difficulties and we must be sensitive and careful to ensure, as we do, that codes of practice are in place and consumers are able to avail of mechanisms such as the Money Advice and Budgetary Services and direct contact with the utility companies.  The companies in question must treat consumers in a fair and appropriate manner to ensure people do not have their lights switched off unjustly.  I understand the Commission for Energy Regulation agreed last week to review all these methods and mechanisms.  We must look after those who are experiencing budgetary problems in these difficult times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must also recognise that now is not the time to shut down or achieve economic recovery through contraction alone.  We need investments, even in these difficult times.  A large percentage of national income was invested in Ardnacrusha at a time when national income was relatively small.  This decision, in which the Fine Gael Party was involved, has benefited the State for the past 80 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>

	<P>Senators must cease interrupting the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It was right to build Ardnacrusha and now is the right time to build a grid infrastructure that will secure the future wealth of our people by tapping into the renewable resources available to us.  This is not the time to shut off investment in this area.  Between grid investment and expenditure on renewables, we are spending the guts of &euro;1.8 billion per annum.  This investment is lifting the country.  As we are raising international finance to pay for this infrastructure; the money does not come from State coffers.  Raising this finance creates construction jobs, puts money in the economy and gives the country a lift.  We need to be careful that we do not kill this investment at a crucial time.  It will be paid back over generations to come as we tap into the cheap and abundant renewable power supplies available to us.</P><Col N="765"/>
        <P Just="Left">The reason I am concerned about the proposals set out in the Fine Gael Party motion is that not only would they kill that party&rsquo;s NewERA policy but they would also kill any prospect of an alternative energy policy being delivered.  I am pleased to be able to raise this reality and I look forward to debating it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister read the motion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes, and the mechanism it proposes, namely, abolishing the PSO, would stop investment in wind energy projects and result in the immediate closure of peat-fired plants.  Is that the intention of the Fine Gael Party?  If not, I ask the Senators to amend their motion.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not read the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I did read it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on mounting a spirited, energetic and enthusiastic defence of his policies.  While he appears to be on top of his brief, I have some difficulty with the figures he has provided as they do not correspond with the figures available to me.</P>
        <P>We need investment to return the economy to growth.  We must find a way of achieving this objective.  As a grocer, I learned many years ago that one can increase one&rsquo;s revenue by reducing one&rsquo;s margin or rate.  This occurred in the area of taxation, for example.  When the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, announced a reduction in betting tax from 20% to 10%, many of us howled.  Following that reduction and a subsequent further reduction to 5%, revenue from betting tax increased.  It is possible, therefore, to increase income by reducing taxes.</P>
        <P>In the case of energy we must ensure we are competitive.  I am slightly confused by some of the figures the Minister has used because according to my figures, business electricity costs remain above the European Union average.  We must keep costs in line with our competitors in the EU.  Closer to home, it is astonishing that customers in the North pay much less than we do for electricity.  The Minister indicated that this is not the case, whereas my figures show that customers in the South must pay 15% more per annum than customers across the Border.  As we have seen, businesses on this side of the Border are struggling to compete and many are losing the battle to survive because of higher costs.</P>
        <P>According to IBEC, 60% of Irish companies cite energy costs as the greatest non-pay problem for their businesses.  I am not sure if the Minister disagrees.  However, the businesses IBEC represents are under intense pressure to cut costs in order to compete in a very unforgiving international market.  Their competitors in that market enjoy lower energy costs.  The introduction of the 5% PSO levy on ESB bills, which the Minister defended, is regrettable because it will put even more pressure on SMEs in particular.  We also really need to reduce costs such as those relating to network charges, which represent approximately 20% of a typical energy user&rsquo;s bill.</P>
        <P>We must also bear in mind that the wholesale energy market rose by 2% last month and the latest Bord G&aacute;is energy index would have hit a two-year high had currency movements not absorbed the increase in prices.  It was primarily the strengthening of the euro against the US dollar and sterling that prevented energy reaching a record level not experienced since October 2008.  The largest move in the energy index was recorded in respect of oil, which increased by <Col N="766"/>10% in price during September.  Electricity prices rose and the increase in demand due to darker evenings resulted in more expensive electricity peaking plants to be called upon to produce power.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This brings me to one of my favourite topics.  I have said on previous occasions that moving to central European time would make for brighter evenings and would have the effect of reducing energy consumption, thereby leading to a decrease in the energy bills of householders and businesses.  In the context of reducing carbon emissions, this would give rise to economic benefits such as increased time for tourists to visit different places and increased energy savings.  When one considers what is happening in the UK, it is obvious that we in Ireland may have no choice in this matter.  A Private Member&rsquo;s Bill on daylight savings time has just been proposed in the House of Commons by Ms Rebecca Harris, a Conservative MP.  In addition, the Energy and Climate Change Committee at Westminster has indicated that this month British MPs plan to examine whether to extend daylight saving hours in order to save energy.  This committee, which scrutinises British Government policy on reducing greenhouse gases, electricity generation and transportation fuels, will hold an evidence session on 28 October.</P>
        <P>An argument has been put forward to the effect that, in the context of daylight savings time, road safety is a major issue.  However, much of the negativity comes from just one study carried out in the 1960s when Britain and Ireland moved to central European time for a three-year period.  The study in question suggested that, during the period to which I refer, there was a small increase in accidents in the mornings but people forgot that there was a dramatic reduction in the number of accidents which occurred in the evenings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is amazing that despite the decrease in prices during the past two years, Ireland remains the second most expensive economy in the eurozone behind Finland.  I do not refer to energy costs alone in this regard.  Overall costs in this country are a massive 16% higher than those which obtain in Germany.  We are becoming much more competitive as an economy and this is despite the fact that certain commentators indicated we could not achieve this.  We need to continue this drive towards competitiveness and to reduce rent, wages and energy prices.  Our costs are still much too high.  This is because we failed to benchmark our costs, such as, for example, energy costs for businesses, against those which obtain in other EU countries.</P>
        <P>There are exciting new projects which will hopefully contribute to a reduction in energy costs for consumers.  GT Energy, a geothermal energy company which is exploring the potential for a geothermal energy plant in Newcastle in south County Dublin, a project of which the Minister will be well aware, has, in the hope of constructing Ireland&rsquo;s first geothermal electricity facility, lodged a planning application with the council there.  The company states that the proposed facility at Newcastle could provide up to 4 MW of electricity, which could provide power for up to 8,000 homes.  This energy would be fed directly into the grid.  GT Energy has operations in both the UK and Iceland.  According to Iceland&rsquo;s Foreign Minister, the energy source is &ldquo;the cleanest, most stable, probably cheapest source of renewable energy in Europe&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In light of recent renewable energy targets and possibilities, it is interesting that Denmark has recently announced its intention to abandon all energy produced from fossil fuels in the future.  A report compiled by its climate commission indicates that Denmark could create an energy network completely free of fossil fuels by 2050 as a result of falling renewable energy costs combined with rising oil and gas costs.  The report predicts that biomass and wind energy could provide the majority of the country&rsquo;s energy needs.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is extremely enthusiastic about renewable energy.  However, he has not been enthusiastic with regard to even opening the door to the possibility of nuclear energy.  I am of the view that this is the wrong approach.  We should at <Col N="767"/>least give consideration to the matter.  I am not sure that it is the right thing to do but if we are going to compete, we should not exclude this option.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fifth Irish Sustainable Building Show begins at the RDS tomorrow.  A Dublin architect, Mr. Patrick Daly, who owns the first zero energy house to have been built in Ireland, will speak at the event.  It will be interesting to hear what he has to say.  While innovations such as those developed by Mr. Daly are very exciting and will bring down energy costs in the longer term, we must, at the very least, bring our energy costs in line with those in Northern Ireland.  Energy is a major factor for businesses, which are currently feeling the pressure.  In fact, the cost of energy is the primary non-wage consideration for these businesses.  We must also give serious consideration to the energy savings that would accrue if we moved to central European time and had an additional hour of daylight as a result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our task now is to ensure there will be no future hikes, particularly any which are sudden in nature and which give rise to major job losses.  If we reduce energy prices, more businesses might be in a position to compete.  When businesses remain in operation, it leads to additional revenue being brought in for the Government.  This would be a preferable development.  I am of the view that we can do things ourselves and that we need not rely on others.  However, we must be competitive.  To achieve the latter, we must ensure we take action in respect of the various matters which make us uncompetitive.  Energy is but one of those matters.  I urge the Minister to ensure we do not allow energy costs to run out of control again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the previous speaker.  Every businessperson and householder I have met in recent months made the point that the cost of energy, particularly as it relates to business, is too high.  This cost is one of the major overheads which affects all businesses.</P>
        <P>I have never spoken to a member of the public who fully understands what the PSO levy involves.  This mechanism was never explained to energy customers or the public at large.  There are some Members of this House with whom I spoke earlier who know nothing about it.  The levy was not explained in an adequate fashion and there is much confusion in respect of it as a result.</P>
        <P>Competition should drive down prices but this has not happened in the energy market.  The cost of electricity has increased.  Householders and businesses are obliged to consider their budgets.  Service providers should be conscious of this fact and take it into account.  I am not sure whether, in the motion before the House, Senator Coffey is stating the PSO levy should be put on ice temporarily until matters resolve themselves and in order that householders and businesses might enjoy some breathing space.  I believe that is the approach he is suggesting.  On the other hand, if I heard him correctly &mdash; he can clarify the position for me later &mdash; the Minister is stating that if we do not proceed with the PSO levy, we may not have a continuous supply of electricity, particularly if difficulties arise in respect of oil or gas supplies.  The Minister also appeared to indicate that if we do not diversify into the area of alternative energy, we could find ourselves in a bad situation.</P>
        <P>It seems Senator Coffey is posing the question as to whether we should give people more time and diversify at a later stage when we are in a better position to do so.  Individuals outside the Houses have suggested to me that perhaps we should not proceed with the PSO levy and that the ESB should increase its prices in order to pay for the cost of diversification.  I am of the view that this is a risky approach because, irrespective of who operates the mechanism, customers will end up in the same position.</P>
        <P>We do not want a situation to develop whereby other countries might perceive Ireland, if it does not proceed with the PSO levy or diversify into the area of alternative energy, to be <Col N="768"/>refusing to co-operate in respect of dealing with climate change.  That is not an issue but it has been mentioned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coffey also mentioned Airtricity and wind turbines.  It is true that Airtricity has provided a number of these throughout the country.  </P><P Just="Left">They interfere with television reception and the people affected are receiving no assistance from the company, we should look into the matter.  The Senator also mentioned the old system of ESB disconnections where an electrician would call out.  That still happens and I witnessed it approximately eight months ago when I met a constituent.  The ESB employee called out but we made an arrangement; he rang his office and did not disconnect the customer.  The employee may have acted on his own but it was nice to see the gesture.</P>
        <P>I am very reluctant to go along with the motion in the current circumstances, although I empathise with many of Senator Coffey&rsquo;s points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I will speak on two issues relating to contradictory policies being pursued by the Government.  There is an idea that people will no longer be able to pay for their electricity usage in the post office because they will not be allowed to pay less than &euro;20.  Like Senator Coffey I am a former employee of the ESB and I know many people paid &euro;5 from their ESB bill on a weekly basis and maintained their budget as a result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The public service obligation, PSO, is a classic example of one hand not knowing what the other is doing, with policies cancelling each other out.  The objective of this Government should be to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and our dependency on fossil fuels.  The levy will not achieve this.  We should also consider business, and small businesses in particular, which will end up paying &euro;100 extra.  I wonder how that will help small businesses to be competitive.  The small boys will end up paying for the big boys yet again, which I object to.</P>
        <P>Fairness, in my estimation, is about making those who are better off pay more but this is not necessarily the case with this PSO levy.  As I mentioned, the big boys will get away with it and the smaller people will end up having to pay for big business.  How will another levy on small business help them in competitiveness?  It will bring them in the opposite direction.</P>
        <P>Professor Richard Tol from the ESRI, an environmental economist, has indicated that the PSO levy will cancel out what people hope to gain from it.  He spoke about how the money will be spent, with the levy raising &euro;157 million.  Some 9% of this will go to the public service, with &euro;78 million going to subsidised peat-powered electricity.  The remaining &euro;43 million will go to wind power.  Although we all agree wind power is the way to go, it is horrendously expensive but has the benefit of reducing our carbon footprint, which we are desperate to achieve.  It is worth paving the way for reductions in carbon emissions by investing in wind power.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The investment of &euro;78 million from the PSO levy in peat is extraordinary.  I agree with Senator Coffey in asking why we cannot invest in cheap interconnectors to Europe to access nuclear power, which is much cheaper.  If that came about, we would not have to invest as much in wind power.</P>
        <P>Other speakers mentioned how &euro;33 will impinge on household budgets.  I am aware of so many households having their electricity cut off as we speak, and I am canvassing houses where there is no light or heat.  I welcome the introduction of a grant by the Minister for Social Protection that will help some of these people but those on middle incomes of approximately &euro;20,000 per year who are just about managing will be penalised.  There is a grandiose campaign about &ldquo;The Power of One&rdquo;, which encourages people to leave appliances unplugged or only <Col N="769"/>boil a cup of water, which is to be commended, but a levy of &euro;33 per annum is being put on these unfortunate people.  It is wrong.</P>
        <P>We should postpone the introduction of the levy until the economy recovers and we are more competitive or the people are able to make ends meet.  That it will cost somebody &euro;99.88 to have their electricity disconnected is bizarre.  I do not understand how the Government can stand over that.  The Department of Social Protection has to bail out those on low incomes while another Department increases the PSO levy.  That makes no sense and is not sound economics.  It is daft.</P>
        <P>I have a concern with regard to jobs and competitiveness.  How will the levy create more jobs?  If we are serious about creating more jobs, how will a PSO levy to this extent help create more jobs?  It will not do so as businesses cannot be competitive while paying it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the public service obligation, peat is a relatively expensive way of generating electricity per kilowatt-hour.  As long as oil prices are high, peat will be competitive as power can be produced at roughly the same cost as oil.  When oil prices drop, as they have done, peat becomes an expensive way to produce electricity.  Without the levy, the people working in those power stations in the midlands, close to the Senator&rsquo;s home, would temporarily lose their jobs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A portion of the levy goes to the production of wind power, which is also more expensive to produce per kilowatt-hour than oil at current prices.  If the price goes to &euro;100 a barrel again, wind generated energy will become a competitive alternative.  If it goes to &euro;147 a barrel, a price at which it spiked in July 2008, wind will become much cheaper.  Arguing whether wind energy is cheap all depends where oil prices stand.  Everyone accepts the day will come when the price of oil will go back to &euro;147 a barrel and never go down again. <Col N="770"/> We need to be ready for that day.  Squeals of protest would rightfully come from Members opposite if there were a lack of preparedness and forward planning for such an inevitability.  The current measures being adopted will prepare us for this.  I ask the Opposition to spare us some of the nonsense I heard earlier.  Such a structure is inevitable for what will be a demanding energy future.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate the Opposition chose a report that gave the average usage of 3,300 kW per year, some 2,200 kW below what the average household uses.  When one gets into the 5,000 kW hours per year category, which 55% of Irish households are in, Irish household electricity prices are actually 2% below the European average because of the pricing band applied to such average use.  I understand the reason the 3,300 kW figure was used was because of the abundance of holiday homes in the country which brings the average down to lower usage but for which prices are higher.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Band 1A, consumption of 20 MW a year, will cost a business 16.9 cent per kW hour, 3% below the European average.  The majority of small businesses in Ireland are in this category.  I challenge Members opposite to refute this as I am one of those businesses and know this price.  As the Minister of State pointed out earlier, as of last Friday, competition in this sector will be able to take full effect.  Now that the shackles of price control have been taken off the ESB, I expect it will be a new force in a fully deregulated market.  The same will happen in the domestic sector when the ESB&rsquo;s share of the market is reduced from 75% to less than 60%.  This will only happen when another 15% of domestic users change from the ESB to Bord G&aacute;is or Airtricity.  By doing so they will be able to avail of a 14% reduction in charges for year one which will offset the 5% PSO charge.</P>
        <P>I accept the PSO charge is regrettable but it is in place for historical reasons since the 1990s.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Someone who changes supplier will get the 5% PSO charge back plus another 9% in savings.  That is sound advice to struggling households to assist them in finding a way out of the difficulty in which they may find themselves.  The majority of householders, however, have not yet done that, with only 26% making the change.  I know the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has come in for some criticism for encouraging people to switch from the ESB.  However, we need to encourage people to shop around for a different electricity supplier.  Once the ESB&rsquo;s share of the domestic market is reduced to 60%, we will have a fully deregulated domestic sector.  It behoves all of us to encourage such a development by advising those who visit our clinics to make the switch to save 14% on their current bills.  MABS should do the same.  This should also be presented in an honest way by the Opposition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I accept there are larger users which need to enjoy competitiveness in energy prices, many of which are lobbying for it.  For example, while IBEC&rsquo;s chief researcher, Mr. Fergal O&rsquo;Brien, recently asserted electricity prices are higher in Ireland, its pre-budget submission does not quote any statistics to back this up.  Mark Fielding, chief executive of ISME, never tires of saying Irish energy prices for his members are among the highest in <Col N="771"/>Europe when in fact they enjoy prices 3% lower than the European average.  Many of the claims about Ireland having higher electricity prices seem to be anecdotal.</P>
        <P>I accept there are price bands which are 12% higher than European averages, however, which need to be tackled.  There are different truths according to the different bands in which companies find themselves.  Some will find the market competitive; others will not.  We must, therefore, continue to drive competitiveness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On average, Irish small businesses enjoy slightly cheaper electricity prices than their European counterparts.  Domestic customers enjoy prices fractionally below the European average.  Those households which will feel the effect of a &euro;30 addition to their bills have a way out by switching user.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The future is in renewables, not in nuclear generated power.  Senator Coffey likes to present the nuclear option as one in which we build a nuclear power station and just plug it in.  One has to build a massive regulatory and inspection regime&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are living in uncertain economic times in which people, particularly those on middle and low incomes, have seen their take home pay reduced.  We are about to face the harshest budget ever to be delivered in the history of State.  We are aware of what brought us to the brink of economic collapse but people are still struggling.  The banks have received much support from the Government but have not returned it to people and small businesses.  An increase in electricity prices will put pressure on households, particularly those with young families, and struggling businesses.  I have spoken in the House on several occasions on measures to promote the rural economy which are revenue neutral.  We must do more to <Col N="772"/>help the rural economy.  It is all very well to tell people to switch supplier but there are many who will have to bear the brunt of the increase in ESB prices.</P>
        <P>The ESB&rsquo;s latest annual report informs us its chief executive officer has an annual salary of &euro;458,000 per annum.  When a bonus, pension contribution and other benefits are added to this, his total package comes to &euro;654,000 per annum.  That is insane.  No one is worth that kind of money.  If action is not taken on salaries like this in semi-State companies, what message will be sent to the thousands who have already lost their jobs or face losing them in the near future, to those households which have seen their incomes reduced and to those on social welfare rates, the lowest possible earners in the State, who are on very tight and strict budgets?  In the current environment it is immoral and situations like that should be examined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent weeks, I had occasion to deal with a couple, both of whom were pensioners.  The man died and I attempted to transfer, in a case which is still ongoing, the household benefits package, the recipient of which is now deceased, to his next of kin.  In so doing the ESB wanted the surviving partner to switch to direct debit.  The person concerned does not want to use direct debit and is not into that kind of detail.  Direct debit is something the individual has never done, yet the ESB wants the person concerned to switch to direct debit because it would collect the bill every month or two months from her.  I rang the ESB and explained the situation.  The only alternative the person concerned can have because she does not have a bank account is to pay a &euro;300 fee which is repayable after 14 months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With all due respect, for people who are pushing 80 years of age that kind of scenario is not good enough.  For the individual to have to pay &euro;300 just because he or she will not use the direct debit, even though the case involves the transfer of an existing scheme for which the Department of Social Protection has responsibility, is difficult. The household benefits package is a very good scheme, in particular for those who are dependent on welfare to eke out an existence in the current economic turmoil.  It is not good enough that a company like the ESB, which has already entered into this agreement with the Department of Social Protection, should impose such charges.  Since the scheme was opted into the direct debit system is obviously the sole way of collecting the money, but a &euro;300 charge to a pensioner, who is now grieving the loss of a partner, so as to avoid direct debit is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>I will be making my views known to the Minister of State because I do not believe anybody would stand over this.  I accept that the ESB does its business in a particular way and that we all use Internet banking and direct debits, but there are still sections of society that do not use and will not use such services.  To expect anyone to pay the kind of money to which I referred, which is repayable after 14 months, needs to be examined.  I will communicate my views to the Minister of State in order that such an anomaly can be addressed.  It is bad enough that someone would bury someone close to him or her, but to then have financial hardship inflicted on him or her in order to continue a service which has already been provided is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to take my points on board in regard to the salary of the CEO of the ESB.  It is immoral and insane.  During the Celtic tiger era there was a lot of mist surrounding these issues but now that the mist has cleared there is a real forensic examination of the manner in which CEOs of semi-State companies are being paid.  If somebody on &euro;30,000 has his or her salary reduced to &euro;28,000, why should someone then be paid a package worth &euro;650,000?  It is absolutely criminal and I urge the Minister of State to take my points on board.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Much of the debate has not referred to the motion or the introduction of the PSO levy, which is imminent.  My information is that the PSO levy was introduced in 1999, 11 years ago.  I do not quite understand the point that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Senator will recognise, the whole point of the PSO is that it is a balancing act.  Opposition is a wonderful place to be and right now it is an absolutely fantastic place to be because the wonderful thing about it is that it is quite possible to put forward points by talking about one side of the balance sheet and not the other side.  It can talk about all the good stuff while ignoring the harsh realities of how to raise money to pay for it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have the wonderful NewERA document from Fine Gael which refers to 105,000 new jobs spread evenly, region by region, between every region in the country.  The reality of the PSO levy is that it is largely paying for three turf-powered stations in the midlands which would undoubtedly have to close if the PSO levy was not available.  I would like to know from Fine Gael what other area it is prepared to cut to raise that revenue instead of allowing the PSO levy.  Is it going to borrow the money on a year by year basis or start up a building boom?  What exactly is it going to do to get that money?</P>

	<P>The NewERA document refers to an investment of &euro;7 billion to create 105,000 new jobs, yet these particular jobs would be under threat if the PSO levy was removed, and that is a reality.  I would like Fine Gael to come clean and say if it is in favour of closing the power stations to which I referred.  Is it against jobs in the turf powered stations in the midlands?  One cannot really have it both ways, otherwise it has to be absolutely clear what money it is ring fencing to substitute for the 5% levy.  Let us be absolutely clear about this.</P>
        <P>In terms of electricity prices, Senator Dearey has already made it quite clear that the electricity price we currently have is roughly 98% of the European average.  The figures are being disputed here.  My information is that the figures being quoted in the latest EUROSTAT document, according to Fine Gael, are three years old.  I am not quite sure whether it has the latest <Col N="774"/>EUROSTAT figures or whether it is called in from old figures before the Government came into power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is said there are lies, damn lies and statistics, and people can quote all sorts of figures.  However, the reality is that when we came into government the price of electricity was considerably higher than it is post-PSO levy.  That is a reality and if Fine Gael wants to refute that point I would like to see its figures because the figures are quite clear that electricity prices are much closer to the European norm now than they were when the Green Party came into government.  That is the reality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Dearey has also pointed out that energy regulation in terms of other electricity suppliers such as Bord G&aacute;is and Airtricity allows for substantial reductions in electricity prices.  I do not want to see electricity prices increasing.  This is a good motion in some ways.  It is starting a good debate.  We are asking questions in regard to the various costs to business.  One of the key costs to business is power, including electricity and gas. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Ultimately, I do not want to see turf-powered stations in the future.  Turf is not a renewable energy resource.  We have decimated the Bog of Allen, in particular.  It is not environmentally friendly.  I would like to see them replaced, but I would also like to see the jobs retained.  I would like to see the replacement, on a gradual basis, of that energy source with wind energy in that region and swapping jobs.  That is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the NewERA document.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is the way to do it, with the bogs to be restored, and it is possible to do that with revenues from wind energy and perhaps other types of biofuel energy projects in the midlands region.  A lot of damage has been done to the ecosystems in the Bog of Allen and that is what the PSO levy is partly used for.  There are serious environmental issues around this.</P>
        <P>The point Fine Gael is making is that in these hard-pressed times small businesses are struggling to meet their costs, but there is a range of costs.  If one considers the percentage of costs which involve electricity prices for any particular business, one will find some businesses are hit much more than others.  We can examine imaginative ways to deal with that.  In terms of the percentage most businesses spend on energy costs, the actual cost of the PSO over a year in many cases will be &euro;200 or &euro;300.  It is a slight exaggeration to say small businesses are closing on the basis of &euro;300.  If we look at domestic rates which were discussed earlier, we could achieve far greater cost savings.  I wish we could see local authorities which are mainly controlled by Fine Gael doing something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in for engaging in the debate and I will respond to the points made by him.  With respect, Members on his side of the House are missing the point, as has the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  If the Senator reads the motion carefully, he will see that it draws attention to the hardship experienced by householders and businesses in meeting their energy bills.  That is what it does.  We have asked the Minister to consider postponing the PSO levy until this issue can be reviewed or until such time as the recession has come to an end and there is stability in the economy.  Small businesses and householders cannot afford to pay the increased electricity costs.</P>
        <P>A number of attempts have been made to misrepresent the Fine Gael position, including by the Minister.  I want to make it clear that it is not only Fine Gael who is stating this.  Mr. Barry O&rsquo;Leary, the head of the IDA, has stated Irish energy prices are too high and that the high cost of energy acts as a barrier to growth and is impeding the country&rsquo;s ability to attract more international business.  On 10 August Mr. Mark Fielding of ISME stated the levy was an additional cost on business and that our electricity prices were already 15% ahead of the EU average, which puts us at a distinct disadvantage with our international competitors, as it puts further pressure on Irish jobs and livelihoods.  I do not know what statistics the Minister quoted because the EUROSTAT statistics dated May 2010 clearly indicate that of 31 countries Ireland has the fifth highest domestic electricity prices in Europe and the sixth highest business prices.  This is not the time to increase energy costs.</P><Col N="776"/>
        <P>I acknowledge the investment made in electricity networks and infrastructure.  Investment in interconnectors should continue, a matter about which I spoke earlier.  Work on the east-west interconnector is progressing and there should be further investment in a ring-main interconnector to mainland Europe.  We would then have energy security and real competition and it is possible we would not have to build nuclear power stations.  However, we would be able to buy cheaper nuclear energy supplies.  If we generate large amounts of energy from renewable resources, we can export supplies to the United Kingdom and mainland Europe.  It is our job in opposition to make these points and highlight matters of concern for individuals and businesses.  In our excellent NewERA policy document we show new ways of finding capital to invest in infrastructure that would ensure security and competitiveness in the Irish energy sector.</P>
        <P>Will the increase in the PSO result in an increase in household bills of 5%?  Words of sympathy are no good because people have been put to the pin of their collar.  The Minister mentioned a new code of practice in disconnecting customers, something I welcome.  It should be robust, firm and flexible to protect, in particular, domestic householders who are struggling.  The Minister attached much of the blame for the PSO levy on the regulator.  The Minister has discretion to postpone the levy by way of a statutory instrument until individuals and businesses are in a better position to pay their electricity bills because they are certainly struggling.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  I am glad he has taken the time to hear this motion.  As he is no doubt aware, as the nation has had to contemplate the introduction of painful measures that affect all households, there have been an inordinate number of financial pressures on families such as coping with mortgage repayments and increased bills.  The difficulty of getting credit to cover these bills has caused great distress for families and, in many instances and not least in my area of Sligo, has given rise the spectre of illegal moneylending, about which I am unhappy.  Having researched the position through a group I established, the prevention of family home repossessions group, and having been further informed by a community group in Sligo called Communities Against Illegal Moneylending, the members of which comprise representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, RAPID, elected members, the regeneration project at Cranmore, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, the credit union, various community groups, social services and other community groups, we learned from that group&rsquo;s research and mine that the fear of violence and the difficulties faced by families as a result of illegal moneylending are palpable in the extreme.  This issue requires urgent attention.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will no doubt be aware that there have been few convictions for this crime nationwide.  I would say the number is under six.  There is a good reason for this.  The criminal nature of illegal moneylending is to force people to repay exorbitant interest rates of 200%, 300%, 400% and more under the threat of violence and criminal damage to one&rsquo;s property, oneself and others.  I am not confident the Garda has the appropriate powers to deal decisively with this issue.  People are afraid to come forward because of the threat of violence.</P>
        <P>I ask most respectfully that due consideration be given to the introduction of adequate legislative reform, especially of section 11 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act which deals with the threat of harm or intimidation of a person for the non-payment of a debt.  Although that law is in place, a conviction is difficult to achieve because people are reluctant to come forward and co-operate with garda&iacute; because the threat of harm and violence is too much for them to bear.  I suggest we examine the introduction of additional measures in this area and not rule out draconian measures similar to those that had to be implemented to deal with the IRA and criminal organisations whereby the sworn testimony of a superintendent or a chief superintendent would be enough to convict people engaged in illegal moneylending.</P>
        <P>It is a disgraceful and worsening situation that is not getting the kind of national coverage required.  While I appreciate there is a considerable body of law in place to deal with this issue, the enforcement of this law is very difficult owing to the natural fears people have about coming forward.</P><Col N="778"/>
        <P Just="Left">I ask that additional measures be introduced to support groups such as Communities Against Illegal Moneylending in Sligo.  Similar groups should be formed elsewhere and unite to promote and encourage people to come forward and co-operate with the Garda in this regard.  At a minimum the Department of Justice and Law Reform should make a modest fund available to promote measures and provide support for people who have suffered the impact of this crime and wish to come forward to report it to the Garda.  Such support mechanisms are not in place.  There needs to be education about this area and people should be told about the State and the laws that are in place.  They should be encouraged to come forward by being offered protection against these criminals.</P>
        <P>There is wholesale illegal moneylending activity throughout the country.  It has come to my attention that a moneylender in one town is lending alleged criminals bail money when they go to court.  If the bail money is, say, &euro;100 or &euro;200, the moneylender will tell the person on leaving court that they now owe him &euro;600.</P>
        <P>Apart from those persons, it is the families who are genuinely struggling with the difficult measures that have had to be implemented recently and who cannot get credit who are being forced to turn to illegal moneylenders.  We need to take decisive action to wipe out this activity.  It is not getting to the surface.  We need to do more.  Section 11 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act could be amended to give a chief superintendent in a divisional area the power to get convictions on his sworn testimony.  Garda sources tell me they know who is involved in this activity in the various communities but they cannot get convictions because people are afraid to come forward.  There is an onus on us as legislators to take the appropriate action to deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>While this is not specifically the Minister of State&rsquo;s area, we need also to focus on a maximum lending rate.  Legally one can charge an interest rate of 187% in this country, and that in itself is criminal.  While this is not relevant specifically to this matter, it is another area that might be examined.</P>
        <P>Two issues need to be addressed.  New legislation is required to give the Garda adequate powers to deal with this activity, and support mechanisms need to be put in place to help those who want to come forward.  The people concerned must be given the protection they require.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue which is clearly one of concern to him and, I am sure, all other Members of the House.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for legislation on the regulation of moneylending and the prohibition of illegal moneylending lies with the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  Comprehensive legislation targeting the illegal lending of money has been on the Statute Book for some time, and has been strengthened in recent years.  Licensed moneylenders operate under the regulatory control of the Financial Regulator who can impose administrative sanctions against moneylenders licensed by it for prescribed contraventions of legislation or regulatory rules.</P>
        <P>The focus of this debate is illegal moneylending which is addressed by section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which prohibits any person from engaging in the business of moneylending without a licence.  Acting as an agent of an unlicensed moneylender is also prohibited.  A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has considerable powers under the Act where he or she has reasonable cause to suspect that a person is engaging in the business of unlicensed moneylending.  The member may, without warrant, stop, question and search that person &mdash; if need be, <Col N="779"/>by force &mdash; and remove from him or her any documents or money which the member reasonably believes may be in his or her possession for the purpose of moneylending.  It is an offence to obstruct or interfere with a member of the Garda in using such powers.  It is also an offence to give a garda false or misleading information or fail to comply with a request made by a garda in using these powers.  The primary offence of engaging in unlicensed moneylending is indictable.  It is noteworthy that legislation introduced by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Investment Funds, Companies And Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005, increased the penalty for this offence to a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both.</P>
        <P>The Minister shares the Senator&rsquo;s concern for those who, because of financial and other pressures, fall victim to unscrupulous individuals who prey on their fellow citizens.  The House will agree that the powers granted to the Garda to address the problem and the penalties available to the Judiciary in this regard are considerable.  The Garda achieves its greatest successes when it enjoys the support and assistance of the community.  If people have information on the activities of illegal moneylenders in their communities, the Minister urges them to let the Garda know in order that it can investigate and prosecute these criminals.  As citizens, it is incumbent on all of us to play our part in combating crime.  The Minister thinks it is important that we reflect on the positive steps which those who are under financial pressure can be advised to take to avoid falling into the traps of money lenders.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service is doing excellent work to advise individuals and families under pressure on how best they can manage their debts.  It can advise people on how to reach accommodations with credit institutions and avail of the exceptional needs assistance available from community welfare officers.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and making a number of suggestions, particularly in relation to the need for new legislation.  I will bring his proposals to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister of State will be able to reflect what I have said.  The problem of illegal moneylending is much bigger than we realise.  While I appreciate some of my suggestions may be somewhat draconian, the time has come to use powers such as those we used to deal with subversive activity.  We cannot allow this practice to continue to affect innocent families that are struggling in these difficult economic times.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  As this issue relates to his Department, it is good that he is present and I hope he will be able to give me a comprehensive answer.  </P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Skills is evaluating the patronage of a proposed new post-primary school in Gorey, County Wexford.  When I attended a recent meeting hosted by the Department, at which the two interested parties outlined their cases for assuming patronage of the new secondary school, I was struck by the similarities between the potential patrons.  Both of them are capable of bringing a new form of diversity to education in County Wexford.  They intend the school to be multidenominational and to teach the same curriculum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to explain why I am offering my support to one group rather than the other.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, to give strong consideration to Educate Together being given responsibility for the new school.  All of the post-primary schools in the Gorey district are VEC run or partly run by it.  Both Educate Together and the VEC already enjoy the confidence of the local community and the Department.  The VEC is a State-supported organisation, whereas Educate Together is a private charity with a strong education providing ethos for the past 30 <Col N="780"/>years.  Although Educate Together has mainly been involved in the primary sector, it has now branched out into the post-primary sector.  Parents are very involved with both types of school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we were to allow Educate Together to assume responsibility in this instance, we would add to the diversity of post-primary education.  This would contribute to the ethos of education in County Wexford.  Such diversity in education could be replicated throughout the country.  There is diversity in educational ethos in most parts of the country.  The secondary schools in Wexford town, where I am based, include the local community school; St. Peter&rsquo;s College, originally the diocesan college, and the Loreto secondary school.  The various schools all offer something different and pupils are attracted to them for different reasons.  This is an opportunity to bring such diversity to another part of the county.  It would benefit parents, students, teachers and the community as a whole.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on this once in-a-lifetime opportunity for the pupils and parents of the county.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  </P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position on the process for establishing new post-primary schools in general, with particular regard to the ongoing process of establishing a new post-primary school at Gorey, County Wexford.  The proposed new school is due to commence operation in a temporary location from September 2011.  In July this year the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills announced a significant reform of the recognition process for new second level schools.  The new framework to be established will involve the setting out of clear criteria against which new second level school applications will be assessed.  It will increase the transparency of decision making by establishing a small expert group to advise on second level patronage applications.  The T&aacute;naiste plans to establish this group shortly and seek its input prior to the finalisation of detailed criteria and procedures.</P>
        <P>Regarding the two new schools to be established in the near future, the T&aacute;naiste has announced that the new second level school in the Clonburris area of Lucan will be established as a VEC school, formally in partnership with Educate Together.  Regarding the new second level school to be established in Gorey, the T&aacute;naiste is advancing a process, whereby a decision on patronage will be made by the end of October or in early November.  As the Senator said, two expressions of interest have been received from prospective patron bodies that want to manage the new school.  The bodies in question are County Wexford VEC and Educate Together.  The process under way involves a survey of the views of the parents of primary and pre-primary children in the Gorey area.  In addition, the applications of the prospective patrons will be assessed against the criteria set out for the establishment of new post-primary schools.  In making her decision on the patronage of the new school, the T&aacute;naiste will consider the outcome of the survey with regard to the general criteria she set out in her recent announcement on the new framework.</P>
        <P>As the Senator mentioned, officials from the Department recently held a public meeting in Gorey to outline the process being undertaken.  The meeting included a question and answer session with the general public on the process.  A range of issues were dealt with at the meeting, including the timing of the establishment of the new school and its proposed location.  Representatives of the prospective patron bodies were given an opportunity to outline their proposals for the new school which will commence operation in a temporary location from September 2011 and enrol first year students only for the 2011-12 school year.  It is proposed that the temporary school will be located adjacent to the site of the permanent school site in the Creagh area of Gorey.  The T&aacute;naiste wishes to acknowledge the assistance of the local <Col N="781"/>authority in acquiring this site.  The new school will be built as a public private partnership project.  Accommodation will be provided to cater for an enrolment of up to 1,000 pupils.  It is expected that the procurement, design and planning process will be completed in 2011 and a contract is expected to be awarded at the end of 2011.  Construction will commence in early 2012 with a view to having the permanent accommodation ready for September 2013.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position on the establishment of new post-primary schools generally and in particular the process under way to establish a new post-primary school in Gorey, County Wexford.  I attended a VEC conference dealing with community education in Gorey last Friday and, as Members would expect, the chairman and chief executive officer of the VEC took the time to brief me informally from their perspective on their application.  I appreciate the case made by the Senator and I have no doubt the T&aacute;naiste will take into consideration all these views when she makes her decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Both patrons offer great potential as both are highly regarded in the field of education.  Diversity should be the key in this regard for Educate Together and I hope the Department can continue providing the appropriate funding for the VEC because it is the major provider of education in County Wexford.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am pleased he is taking this Adjournment debate because he has an interest in and knowledge of primary schooling in County Meath.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The population of County Meath has grown significantly in the past 15 years experiencing an increase of approximately 200%.  This has meant there have been many requirements for new school places throughout the county.  Many members will be familiar with the position of towns such as Laytown where a couple of years ago students could not access school places.  I wish to discuss in this debate the position of a school in Johnstown, just outside Navan town, which has been brought to my attention by the Labour Party&rsquo;s local councillor, Jenny McHugh.  At present, 500 students attend school in a leased building because the Department has not procured a new school for the children.  Moreover, the leased building leaves much to be desired.  For instance, there is very little car parking for parents who drop off children and it has no green area for the children to play in during breaks, which clearly is not satisfactory in this day and age.  The school is spread over three floors and that is not very comfortable for younger children.  According to Councillor McHugh, the Department is spending up to &euro;200,000 per annum on refurbishing this old Dickensian-style building.  This constitutes a clear waste of money when one considers that a new school would not incur such refurbishment costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a proposal to build a new school and a site of four acres has been identified in Johnstown.  Little progress has been made between the Department and the local authority.  The Minister of State should comment on the current state of play.  Is the Department in consultations with Meath County Council or the owner of the four acres?  It is clear this is costing everyone money in the long run and is unsustainable.  Moreover, in respect of social benefit, it does not wash its face and the new school should be provided now.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State comment on the matter?  I attended school in Cushenstown, not far from there, and it is the same school the Minister of State&rsquo;s own father attended back in the 1930s.  The Minister of State is probably familiar with the school because he takes a great interest in the area.  I would appreciate his comments on this issue and I certainly will revert to Councillor McHugh.  If there is anything that can be done locally, it certainly will be done and we will work with the Department to make progress on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  </P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the process being utilised to ensure there will be adequate accommodation in schools at primary and post-primary level in all parts of the country.  The forward planning section of the Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, owing to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary level in the coming years.  This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection, as well as with reference to recent schools enrolment data.  School accommodation requirements in the Navan area have been considered as part of this detailed study.  Indicators are that approximately 69 additional primary classrooms may be required across that area to cater for increased enrolments up to the school year 2014-15.  The Department is considering options to meet the deficit identified.</P>
        <P>On the specific issue referred to by the Senator, the Department is engaged in ongoing negotiations with a landowner to acquire a site with a view to establishing an educational campus on the site.  It is intended that this site will be master planned to cater for a 32-classroom school, a special school and a 1,000-pupil post-primary school.  The Department has been engaged in discussions with the local authority on this matter.  The Senator will appreciate that, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on these discussions.  Once a suitable site is acquired, the progression of the accompanying building project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school buildings generally.  In September the Department also recognised a new community national school under the patronage of the VEC.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on the matter.  I have listened to the points he made and appreciate that he wishes to further this process.  I will take his comments on the negotiations with the landowner and the local authority back to the Department to ascertain whether these matters can be finalised as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for a comprehensive answer.  Is he able to provide a timescale for the end of the aforementioned negotiations?  I presume the Department hopes to conclude them shortly.  Does the Minister of State happen to know how long that might be?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, I cannot put a timescale on it, given that these are discussions and negotiations.  I appreciate the point made by the Senator about this matter and about how all concerned are anxious to advance this issue.  I will take this on board, bring it back to the Department and try to have these discussions finalised as soon as possible.</P>
