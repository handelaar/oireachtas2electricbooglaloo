	<P>I have received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to impose regulatory restrictions on recreational lobster fishing.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ciaran Cannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the reason it is not possible for HSE West to appoint a permanent senior audiological scientist while more than 1,000 hearing impaired children in County Galway await a hearing assessment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maria Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to give an update on implementation of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 with regard to the designated professions and to indicate if a timeframe can be estimated for consideration of the request made by the Institute of Clinical Hypnotherapy and Psychotherapy to be registered as a designated profession within the meaning of section 4 of the Act.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to clarify the plans, if any, he has to regulate or licence under the Maritime Safety Act the use of jet skis, especially for the category of those under the age of 18 years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to outline the progress made, if any, to introduce a broadband scheme to provide broadband coverage in areas outside the scope of the rural broadband scheme such as the townland of Drumkeen, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill, Cannon, Corrigan and Keaveney as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators &Oacute; <Col N="286"/>Domhnaill, Cannon and Corrigan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Keaveney may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the Adjournment matter raised by Senator Doherty, as it is repetitious.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">R&oacute;is&iacute;n Ingle&rsquo;s first two sentences on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning are revealingly chilling and I am sure for many they were overwhelming.  Everyone who read them will have been hugely moved by them:</P>
        <P LI="1">At 3.25 p.m. yesterday, with the sun beating down on a packed Guildhall Square in Derry, a pair of hands poked through the metal grille covering the windows high up in the building.  They gave the thumbs-up sign to loud cheers from thousands of locals gathered below.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That marked the arrival of public vindication, the acknowledgement and recognition for the relatives of those killed on Bloody Sunday in January 1972.  As we know, they had waited too long and had to fight too hard.  I welcome the heartfelt and much welcomed statement of the British Prime Minister yesterday.  I asked yesterday for a debate on the report which for many families in Northern Ireland and wider society was a long time coming.  As the banners on the streets of Derry read yesterday, &ldquo;Set the truth free.&rdquo;  We all welcome the Saville report and its findings.</P>
        <P>In its report the Mental Health Commission referred to the inhumane conditions in psychiatric hospitals and mental health facilities in 2010.  We have all been horrified by what we read about institutions in the Ryan and Murphy reports.  Irish society was appalled last year when we saw documented what individual children had gone through in these institutions.  It is extraordinary that we have institutions that are totally unfit for purpose.  So unfit for purpose are at least three adult psychiatric hospitals that today the Mental Health Commission indicated they should not take in new patients from January and February next year.  They should not take in new patients from today.  The question is: what has been happening to our mental health services?  Why did they not receive priority during the Celtic tiger years?  What will happen now that resources are more limited?</P>
        <P>How can we, as Senators, try to give greater priority to dealing with mental health issues?  There is no doubt mental health services have been the Cinderella of the health service.  Many Senators on both sides of the House have spoken about the issue on a number of occasions.  We must use our collective will to ensure action is taken.  The Minister has the blueprint.  What the Mental Health Commission states today is that this issue is still not receiving priority and that there is no clarity on the funding mechanisms to be used, despite all the promises and good intentions of the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney.  I accept he is well intentioned and wants to achieve change, but he will not witness that change, unless he has momentum behind <Col N="287"/>him.  This House could help him in that regard.  I ask the Leader to arrange another all-day debate on mental health services before the end of this Seanad term to bring momentum to the debate and secure political action in order that people will not face the kind of services we were ashamed to reveal were prevalent 50 and 100 years ago.  They cannot be allowed to continue.  We must do something now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>During the years we have been regularly critical of much of what the United Kingdom has done on this island but one can only stand in awe at the performance and sheer raw courage of Lord Saville in putting the Widgery report to the sword and the facts in front of us.  The statement by the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron &mdash; I am not his greatest fan &mdash; in the House of Commons yesterday was uninhibited and breathtaking.  In many ways, it was also unexpected.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, it brought extraordinary vindication and consolation to those who had spent a lifetime dealing with an issue of justice, defending and trying to restore the reputations of innocent people killed on Bloody Sunday.  I support strongly the need for a debate on the Saville report in order that we can record our appreciation and acknowledgement of what has been done.  It is not easy for a sovereign government to put up its hand and state it made a mistake and got it wrong.  A lesson can be learned by politicians on this island also.  It seems the old mantra of &ldquo;Never explain, never apologise&rdquo; went out the door at approximately 3.20 p.m. yesterday afternoon when the Prime Minister spoke in such terms.</P>
        <P>Another lesson can be learned from the report in terms of the tribunals.  It is interesting that there is a rule that people may not criminalise themselves in the evidence they give to tribunals, except in one significant regard, namely, that if they swear to tell the truth, they can be found guilty and charged with perjury, a serious charge.  It is something worth remembering in the tribunals, given that issues arise in terms of obstruction and non-co-operation.  I would like the Leader to assist in providing a clear understanding of this point.  Those who do not tell the truth in their evidence to tribunals under oath cannot be dealt with by way of criminal charges, but I assume they can be charged with perjury.  I look forward to having a debate on the Saville report.</P>
        <P>One other issue came to the fore some weeks back, namely, the proposal to computerise all the records of the Land Registry.  What is left of our history as a nation is to be found in Land Registry offices which contain information on how we divided our land, shared, bequeathed and bought it.  We could learn more from the Land Registry records than from many history books.  Our history, culture and heritage are bound up in its offices.  As I understand it, the proposal &mdash; daft as it seems &mdash; is that once the information has been computerised, to destroy all of the hard copy records, as it is considered there will no longer be any need to hold them.  We should stand firmly against that proposal.  I do not know if Members have followed the work of Diarmaid Ferriter, not just in his programme that was broadcast last night but during the years, almost all of which is based on the extant records available to him in order to learn how we have lived our lives culturally and otherwise.  This is invaluable documentation.  I ask that the appropriate Minister &mdash; I think it is the Minister for Justice and Law Reform &mdash; be invited to come to the House to explain his plans for the documentation held in Land Registry offices and also to allow us to have a free and open debate with him.  It is not a political matter; it is one on which Members on all sides would share a view.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  </P>
        <P>I agree with my colleagues on what occurred yesterday.  Senator Fitzgerald captured the essential emotion of the occasion.  It was a deeply, searingly emotional event for the people directly involved, the people of the city of Derry, the wider population of Northern Ireland, this country and the United Kingdom.  It was an event of truly momentous importance, not just for what the Saville report states which is at the centre of it, but also for what it means at a very high level for the quality of democracy.  We should not forget that for years on end many of us had bemoaned the fact that the British establishment was so protective and defensive, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, but given what it has now done, it behoves those of us who were so critical to acknowledge that Britain has found within itself the ability to acknowledge gross and grievous wrongdoing.  That is what occurred yesterday.  The statement of the British Prime Minister is extremely welcome in that context.  I accept clich&eacute;s are common in debates of this nature, but it genuinely is a milestone for democracy internationally because it shows that in a democracy there is and should always be available an independent judiciary and option to scrutinise, analyse and, if necessary, criticise the actions of the state.  One of the tests of a democracy is the availability of an independent facility in the system that can deliver this kind of report and analysis.  It has taken many years to produce the report, about which many would be critical and sad.  People will also be critical of the expense and very often the over-legalisation of the process.  Despite the fact that we may be critical, including of tribunals in this country, of the time inquiries take and delays, we should never be tempted to throw out the really sacred, important democratic facility to call on an individual such as Lord Saville, an independent judge, to examine carefully, without fear or favour, the actions of the state and produce a report such as he has produced.</P>
        <P>There are lessons for us to learn.  Yesterday was about Derry and the events of Bloody Sunday which Senator Dearey stated yesterday that he remembered.  I am sure everybody in this Chamber remembers them.  I remember being off school for the day of mourning.  I regard the report as the bookend at the other end of the process that ensued.  Yesterday was such an important day.  There are lessons to be learned, not just those mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole but also the wider lesson on the need for independent scrutiny.  Let us not, when talking about the tribunals, be tempted to set aside this crucial facility in a democracy.  Yesterday was genuinely a great day for democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the welcome given to the Saville report.  The events of Bloody Sunday were most unfortunate.  There is no doubt that they were a catalyst in the elevation of the then civil protest to an all-out war.  Many lives could have been saved during the years had the matter been dealt with appropriately in the early stages.  When the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, spoke out on the issue, he was ignored internationally.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 which is to be taken in the House today.  I ask the Leader for clarification thereon.  It was introduced to the House approximately three months ago and dealt with over two or three weeks.  It has not been dealt with for about two months and I am concerned that it is being rushed through the House today on the basis that amendments will be made in the D&aacute;il.  That is the understanding I am being given.  If so, it demeans the constitutional status of this House.  It demeans it if we are being asked to vote down amendments tabled by Fine Gael today only to find out next week or the week after that they will be accepted in the D&aacute;il and that the Bill will be brought back to this House in three or four weeks in order that we can rubber-stamp it.  Senator Coffey has put a lot of work into the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot pre-empt what will happen with the Bill which will be before us later.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="289"/>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  As deputy leader, I am flying the flag to state this type of process is disingenuous and devalues the status of this House, for which we are always making the case.  I do not mind Bills being tweaked as they move from one House to another, but if substantial amendments are being made in the other House, it throws cold water on this House and those who hold particular views on the Bill in question.  I welcome the Bill, on which I spoke on Second Stage.  We are receiving dishcloth treatment if we are being asked to do what I have described.  I am very concerned that it will happen and we should oppose it.  If there were only one amendment rather than a series of substantial amendments, matters would be different.  If a Minister consciously allows what I am concerned about to occur, he has scant regard for this House.  I want to fly the flag in that regard today.  I am deeply concerned and ashamed that it should happen.</P>

	<P>The Senator should put questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is whether the Leader recognises that that Fianna F&aacute;il Government reintroduced car tax and that water rates are about to be introduced.  Does he recognise that the people are being taxed far too much by his party in government?</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is absolutely right.  I ask the Leader to intervene before we take the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to spare him and his colleagues the ignominy and embarrassment of having to vote against what are recognised as fair amendments by this side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator pre-empting what might happen with the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Cathaoirleach knows what will happen also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill will be taken shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to intervene with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to accept the fair-minded amendments proposed by this side of the House.</P>
        <P>I reiterate my comments of yesterday and call for a debate on the Saville report.  As one who has a deep interest in what happened on Bloody Sunday, I pay tribute to the families of those who died and were injured on that awful day for Irish society.  Yesterday, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly said, was a day we learned about the need to have an independent judiciary.  This should always be the case.  I welcomed the report yesterday.  Importantly, the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, showed himself to be a real leader yesterday by his remarks in the House of Commons.  The report banishes the Widgery report and, more importantly, promotes civil and human rights and shows we should all be proud in standing up for them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="290"/>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to those welcoming the Saville report.  It is a great day for this country.  Despite all the bad and negative political developments in Ireland, all people and parties can be proud of the work done to help bring peace to the country.  Our model is unprecedented historically and everybody in the House should be proud of it and his or her part in achieving peace.  Circumstances seem to be improving.</P>
        <P>I want to back up the remarks made on the Property Registration Authority.  It is very important from an historical perspective and Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a very good point.  We should debate in the Seanad the need to keep the records, although I welcome computerisation and the freeing up of the Land Registry.  It is important that the public can gain access to it easily and simply.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Alex White, I want to mention Bloomsday.  It is important to mention that it is such a beautiful day.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the patronage of schools.  Such a debate has been called for before.  It is particularly poignant because the recognition of ABA schools is about to occur in terms of patronage.  I refer to the recognition of schools for people with special needs.  We need to have a debate on what exactly constitutes patronage.  Is it concerned with religion or the ethos of a school?  In the view of Educate Together, it is a philosophy of educating pupils from different walks of life, with their parents.  Patronage has changed completely.  We need a debate on how we govern our schools and the nature of patronage.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House for such a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>If anything has eased the pain of the Troubles in the North, it is acts of empathy with the other side, walking in other people&rsquo;s shoes.  I remember, in particular, when Mr. Alex Maskey of Sinn F&eacute;in moved towards the Protestant community in regard to the First World War and how deeply and profoundly it affected him.  I am somewhat concerned that in our tributes to Lord Saville and Mr. David Cameron we forget that those who died in Derry were not the only ones who died.  Mr. Tommie Gorman who showed all the power, empathy and emotional intelligence he has shown all his life, including during the Troubles, reminded us last night of what had happened at Teebane, Whiterock, on Bloody Friday and in the La Mon restaurant bombing.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I still remember the night I saw on the road the false teeth that belonged to a Protestant workman who was taken out of a van at Whiterock and gunned down.  I ask Members to understand the feelings of the Protestant community when they look at what happened in Derry yesterday.  It was a moving and wonderful occasion for the Nationalist people.  However, everything is connected in this world &mdash; &ldquo;only connect&rdquo;, said Shakespeare &mdash; and the Protestant community must have felt left out in a way.  It would not be good for Seanad &Eacute;ireann to convey the feeling that we are unaware of or are insensitive to the other tradition and what it suffered.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A question for the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="291"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The conclusions of the Saville report are clear.  There is no doubt that what happened on Bloody Sunday was &ldquo;both unjustified and unjustifiable&rdquo; and wrong.  The command to go into the Bogside in Derry should not have been given.  These were the words of Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, yesterday and they are most welcome.  For the families and community of Derry it was an emotional and healing day.  It improved the relationship between these islands.  It was a Conservative government under Mr. Ted Heath, as far as I know, that gave the order to go into the Bogside so it is right and proper that a Conservative Prime Minister apologised to the people of Ireland and particularly to the people of Derry and the families of the 14 dead and the injured.  It puts an end to the whitewash of the Widgery report, which was a sham.  This is an excellent report.</P>
        <P>The decision to hold the Saville inquiry was part of the Good Friday Agreement.  It was a condition laid down by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and former Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair.  They should be recognised for their contribution in this regard.  Mr. Blair told the then Taoiseach that he would do his utmost to arrange for the new inquiry and report.  It was a precondition of the negotiations.  For the former Taoiseach, who has sometimes been misrepresented, yesterday was a special day as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday&rsquo;s report from the Mental Health Commission made a recommendation that no further admissions be made to three institutions after next February.  This is a serious matter.  I welcome the report.  One of the institutions is St. Ita&rsquo;s in Portrane.  I grew up in Portrane and many of my social activities as a young man took place around the hospital in terms of playing sports, socialising and dancing within the hospital and with the community there.  We were on first name terms with many of the inmates.  I have a great attachment to Portrane.</P>
        <P>Deputy Moloney is a very convincing Minister.  His brief is this area and I do not doubt his commitment to it.  Last week I visited Portrane with the Minister with regard to inching forward the opening of a unit there for intellectual disability, even though it was ready last September.  However, we are getting closer to it and I respect his position.  The Mental Health Commission recommendation will bring the matter to a head, and for that reason I welcome it.  There will be no further admissions after next February.  However, what about the people who are currently there?  What about the inmates who will continue to be there after next February?  What will happen to them?  They will remain there and continue to suffer.  Many of the reports use the phrase &ldquo;inappropriate conditions&rdquo;, but &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; is not an adjective that conveys the real problem.  &ldquo;Disgraceful&rdquo; is the adjective that should be used, and everybody should be aware of that.  For the people working there, Portrane has been allowed to become run down over many years.  Several Governments of different shades have been involved in this.</P>
        <P>Deputy Moloney must be given every resource and support to accelerate the solution to this problem, including for the people who are in the institution and will be there after February.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harney.  It must be elevated to that level and the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, must be given whatever supports he requires to bring this matter to a speedy conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In congratulating Senator Leyden on the anniversary of his election to the Oireachtas I note that my father, Paddy Keaveney, lost his seat on this day in 1977.  That is the other side of the coin.</P><Col N="292"/>
        <P>With regard to the phrase that the Saville report sets the truth free, I hope the truth being set free frees the lives of many people.  Without taking from their memories of their loved ones who were killed and injured that day, I hope it frees the lives of the many people who have spent the last 38 years seeking justice to get back into real life.  When I turned on the television yesterday afternoon I had already received a text message from some of my family in Derry saying that Derry was manic that day.  They considered it manic due to the helicopters flying overhead.  It was reminiscent of what might have been the scene on that particular day.  It was definitely the scene in the days afterwards just in terms of audio.  There is much discussion in the context of the World Cup about the use of the wonderful plastic tubing that makes a great deal of noise.  The helicopter flying over Derry was very much part and parcel of daily lives.  It was funny and strange to turn on the television yesterday and hear the intense noise of the helicopter again but to hear it in a fresh context and a new environment, where good news was due to emerge and there was good support for the families.</P>
        <P>The civil rights song was &ldquo;We shall overcome&rdquo;.  This particular quest for truth took 38 years for this group of people.  How would history have been changed had this action been taken much earlier?  What would have been the difference?  We cannot deal with that but I agree with Senator Harris that if we cannot deal with everyone&rsquo;s past, we cannot move on for the future.  That is part of the debate I am seeking from the Leader.  Yes, it should be about the Saville report but also about how we can deal with the past for everyone so they can be set free too.</P>

	<P>I too welcome Lord Saville&rsquo;s report.  Thirty-eight years is a long time to wait for justice but, thankfully, the victims and the families feel that justice has been done.  Everything is connected, as Senator Harris said, but the moment yesterday when people felt vindicated in their great loss was needed.  What I considered most striking was the merit and bravery of the new Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, saying: &ldquo;We got it wrong and we are sorry&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I believe that bravery is needed by this Government.  Last night, I was struck by the denial yet again of the Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, on the &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; television programme that this was a home grown crisis.  This denial makes the pain of the recession and its fall-out greater for families who are suffering.</P>

	<P>I was particularly struck by the grandparents and parents of young graduates whom I met last week when the Seanad did not sit.  There are three graduates in one family, highly qualified solicitors and psychologists, with no hope.  They are in pain and are now seeking passports to travel.  I ask the Leader to ask the Ministers, Deputy Mary Coughlan and Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to present solutions to this House so we can keep our graduates in this country.  Our country has invested in these graduates, as have their parents, but now we are prepared to let them go.  We fervently state education is the way forward, but yet we are prepared to throw it all away so easily.  It is time we looked to the hope of the young generation and invested in keeping them here.</P>

	<P>Like my colleagues, I warmly welcome the developments over the past 24 hours on the publication of the Saville report on Bloody Sunday.  As most have said, at last we now seem to have the truth and acknowledgement of actual events by the most senior officials.  Like others, I can remember those events.  I was at that stage a young person who could be easily influenced, I suppose, by what I was witnessing in my country and the emotion <Col N="293"/>that went with it, and was happy to lend my solidarity to go on the protest march here in Merrion Square and participate in the events that happened at the embassy at that time.  I would like to think we would have a long and fulsome debate on the report and I will look to the Leader to give details of when he intends to take that debate and what length of time he will give to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader indicate where one may source the required information to participate fully in debate because I am somewhat perturbed about the health debate today?  I am not happy with the briefing documents that have been made available and I am not too sure what briefing documents have been made available by the HSE or the Department of Health and Children other than the briefing documents available from the Leader&rsquo;s office.  Yesterday, I raised the issue of the need for a paediatric immunologist and the fact there is not one in Ireland.  Today, I read in the newspapers that there are over 120 posts vacant in hospitals which will bring some of them to closure.  Surely if we are to have a health debate we should have this type of information available to us, either from the HSE or the DOHC, so we can make a meaningful contribution to the debate.  I ask the Leader to respond.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday, I joined thousands of people in Derry, in Roosevelt Street, to complete the march that was due to complete 38 years ago from Roosevelt Flats to the Guildhall.  It was an experience that will be etched on my memory for many years.  As we gathered, there was the tension and anticipation of not knowing whether the findings of the Saville report would exonerate the civil rights marchers on that day.  There were the scenes in the Guildhall Square as we got information coming from the families that, indeed, the Saville report had justified the claims that have been made for the families for the past 38 years and have proven for once and for all that those civil rights marchers were innocent and that on 30 January 1972 the British Army did, indeed, murder 14 innocent civilians on the streets of Derry and injure 13 others.  It was an important day for Derry.  It was an important day for the whole of the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>There has been much talk since about whether there should be prosecutions, what about other victims and what about victims from the Protestant community.  When we have a debate &mdash; I am sure we will have a debate in this House and the findings of the Saville report deserve a full and lengthy debate &mdash; we also need to look at the issue of all victims.  My party has always stated there can never be a hierarchy of victims&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;whether that is British Army personnel, an innocent civilian on the streets of Derry or somebody who was involved in armed activity from any of the other armed groups.  There can be no hierarchy of victims.  Each father, each mother, each son and each daughter all grieve the same.  To take this process on instead of only reflecting on the findings of the Saville report, which needs to be done, we need to look at how we bring justice to all others and how they find the truth also.  We know of the Ballymurphy massacre where 11 persons were killed by the same paratroopers.  We know of Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson and the Bloody Sunday inquiry.  I welcome the statements made in the House of Commons by <Col N="294"/>the British Prime Minister Cameron, but let there be no doubt that if it was not for the families&rsquo; 38 years of labouring for justice, we would not have got to that point.  We need a truly transparent independent international inquiry.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an important moment to remind ourselves that after the partition of Ireland in 1921 the Catholics were discriminated against in housing, jobs and justice, and the civil rights movement of the 1960s was killed off by the events of Bloody Sunday.  Yesterday, I listened to the live speech by David Cameron on BBC in my office.  It was a momentous event to see and hear a British Prime Minister admit that the British state had killed innocent people.  As has been stated already, it was the families of those who were killed on Bloody Sunday who drove this, sought the truth and overrode the whitewash of the Widgery inquiry.</P>
        <P>The question in <i>The Guardian</i> yesterday &mdash; I do not want to delay but I want to put it on the record &mdash; was: &ldquo;should the paratroopers held by Saville to have been out of control and to have lied about their actions afterwards, be prosecuted, either in a criminal case or a private, civil action? ... Murder is murder&rdquo;, wherever.  I am a pacifist by nature.  I have total empathy for all the innocent people who died over the 30 years&rsquo; civil war, but it must be said that the Nazis were pursued after they killed innocent people in the war and there is no doubt that Saville left it open and did not give immunity to the paratroopers.  Yesterday, the <i>Financial Times</i> stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The 1998 amnesty of paramilitaries, essential to the peace process, and the lapse of 38 years, makes prosecutions problematic &mdash; but that it is now up to the Northern Ireland&rsquo;s devolved justice system.  For now, the UK state has apologised.  The Parachute Regiment should follow, as should compensation for those unlawful killings.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I want to comment on the issue regarding the mental hospitals.  I ask the Leader to have an urgent debate on this issue.  Specifically, a number of facilities are due to close in February with no alternative in place and it seems strange that one agency in the State can dictate that these centres are supposed to close in February next and that the other State agency responsible for looking after patients who have mental health problems states it has no money to provide alternative accommodation.  We will see patients with mental health problems being essentially squashed in to existing overcrowded facilities and that will not work.  I want a serious debate on that issue and answers from the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, when she comes in.</P>
        <P>We all welcome the Saville report but the insight of an Irish version of the Saville report would not go astray either.  We are good at commenting on incidents that happened outside of this jurisdiction but often we have failed to have clear, transparent and accountable versions of the Saville report for atrocities that happened during the Troubles on Irish territory.</P>

	<P>We have no clear answers on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, what exactly happened and if there was collusion, or on a number of other incidents.  We are good at being critical or supportive of what happens outside this jurisdiction, but we are poor at looking at ourselves and openly discussing some of what happened on this territory during the course of the Troubles.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with others in seeking a debate on the Saville report.  The joy of the people yesterday was something to behold.  There was a stark contrast between the state corruption of the Widgery report and the integrity of the state yesterday, both in the content of the Saville report and also in the comments of the British Prime Minister.  They were welcome and have helped to bring healing and closure to the families involved.</P>
        <P>I support the comments of Senators Harris and Keaveney to the effect that many other victims of the 30-year Troubles are still endeavouring to come to terms with them, including the victims of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, as Senator Twomey stated.  I have taken a particular interest in that matter, since I was involved in the hearings of the Barron report, and I renew my call to the Taoiseach, the Government and the Houses to re-intensify their efforts to give those families closure.  The D&aacute;il decided to refer the report to the House of Commons, but I understand nothing has come of it.  We should pursue the issue.</P>
        <P>On a note of joy, while everyone is enjoying the GAA championships and the World Cup, we should not forget the success of Mr. Billy Walsh, coach of the Irish boxing team, and the team itself in Moscow.  They brought honour to themselves and to this country.  Knowing Mr. Walsh as I do, no finer person could achieve and enjoy such a success.  He has dedicated himself to the sport of boxing.</P>

	<P>In the Leader&rsquo;s reply to me on 12 May, he mentioned he was endeavouring to bring the leaders of the various groups together to respond on the issue of the tribunals.  He suggested he would be meeting the leaders a short time afterwards to determine whether it would be possible to agree an all-party motion on the serious challenges facing the State in terms of tribunal costs.  The Leader rightly stated that the leaders needed to come together to formulate a motion.  Doing so would be of major significance to the Seanad.  Has the meeting been held and what were the responses of the other leaders?  I have spoken with a number of them and I understand there is support.</P>

	<P>In <i>Ulysses</i>, James Joyce reminds us all of our shared humanity.  Bloom, as he walks around Dublin, considers his repressed Jewish people all over the world.  I never believed I would see a Nationalist crowd in Derry applauding a British Prime Minister who told the truth fearlessly.  It was extraordinary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Bloom would use the imaginative force so movingly evoked by Senator Harris to encompass also the plight of the Palestinians.  I am unashamed to condemn utterly the murderous assault on the peace flotilla.  In what was the equivalent of Bloody Sunday for the Israelis, a group, nearly equal in number, of innocent and peaceful protestors against an outrage against humanity in Gaza was slaughtered by Israeli commandos.</P>
        <P>Unlike some of my colleagues, I welcome that the Government has expelled an Israeli diplomat.  It did so in a dignified way and made clear there was no specific accusation against that person.  It was to show our complete disapproval of the way in which the Israeli authorities secured and wrongly used passports from friendly countries to murder a Hamas person in a third country.  The worst aspect was the use of false information by Mossad agents to suggest they were the children of Holocaust survivors to get special German passports.  This was a betrayal of everyone murdered by the Nazis.</P>

        <P>Yesterday, the German Government shamefully and forcibly deported a series of Roma people and their children back to what are effectively death camps in Kosovo.  They are located on top of a great concentration of lead, mercury and other heavy metals where children have been dying for years under the administration of the United Nations.  Will the Leader bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs so the latter might ask for this process to end and lodge a protest with the German Government?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>All right-minded people would have to welcome the result of the Saville report and the comments of the British Prime Minster, David Cameron, MP.  To some extent, the report is cold comfort to the relatives of the 14 people who were murdered, but there are many more victims, as Senator Harris stated.  As to whether the people who committed the Bloody Sunday atrocity should be tried, the answer is, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  When one hears of an individual twice firing on a wounded person on the ground to ensure he or she had conclusively &ldquo;done the job&rdquo;, to borrow a phrase, there is only one place for that person, namely, a court of law where justice would be meted out in the appropriate way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like other Senators, I have repeatedly articulated my opinion on the adverse effects of the substances sold in head shops.  It gives me no pleasure to inform the House that, over a five-day period, young men and women numbering in the double figures were admitted to the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar and treated appropriately.  This number does not take into account the people treated by general practitioners and MIDOC.  In the main, the substance used was Whack.  It is time we whacked the head shops and the peddlers therein and put them out of business once and for all.</P>
        <P>Having mentioned the regional hospital, I am pleased to be able to report that, following my statements in the House last year regarding the loss of our dermatologist to Beaumont Hospital <Col N="297"/>because she did not get the appropriate supports from the HSE, a replacement consultant dermatologist has been offered the job and will be taking it up during the coming months.  This is good news.</P>
        <P>I will refer briefly to the comments of Senators Ryan and Twomey.  I support the closure of the old psychiatric hospitals, having worked in one for more than 30 years, but they must be replaced with appropriate facilities.  I will tell the Minister for Health and Children that, when the health boards&rsquo; visiting committees &mdash; the Cathaoirleach was a member on one &mdash; visited those institutions, the adverse conditions were reported and addressed.</P>

	<P>I join with others in welcoming yesterday&rsquo;s publication of the Saville report.  We would all welcome the clear findings vindicating the innocent victims of that terrible atrocity and allocating blame.  All of us have also welcomed the British Prime Minister&rsquo;s apology yesterday.  It was good to hear, but matters must move on and the findings and facts of that day must be examined in the context of a criminal investigation to determine whether prosecutions can or should be taken.  This is clearly the next step and is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland.  I call on the Leader for a debate on the matter, as it is important that people in the House and elsewhere discuss the findings further.</P>
        <P>I join with others in calling for a debate on the report of the Mental Health Commission and its concerning recommendations that three psychiatric institutions should take no further admissions from next February.  Senator Ryan spoke in eloquent terms about the appalling conditions in Portrane.  As we all know, we have been containing members of our communities with psychiatric illness in the most appalling and inhumane conditions for far too long.  I am glad that the spotlight has been placed on these institutions and I hope there will be a report.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Norris, who yesterday referred to the visit of the Iranian foreign Minister and the brutal manner in which his private security guards manhandled certain people who were democratically protesting against his visit.  With justification, they were protesting against some of what he had to say and the appalling human rights breaches of his Government.</P>

As a result of the humble and accurate way the British Prime Minister spoke yesterday, in a mature way it will improve relations between the two sovereign states, and it has done a lot of good in terms of healing an open wound.</P>
        <P>Many Senators spoke about all the victims of violence and it was heartening to see the minute&rsquo;s silence in Derry yesterday for all the victims of violence.  We should remember them.  We should also remember what Bishop Daly said, namely, that the Saville report puts this issue to rest.  There is no doubt that when we consider Northern Ireland today and the relations between the two sovereign states, the United Kingdom and Ireland, we have a position where civil rights have overcome injustice.  That is a great day.</P><Col N="298"/>
        <P>I ask the leader for a debate on the shadow financial market because the difficulties that were created in the international financial market have not been properly addressed, and they need to be addressed at EU level.  In other words, the danger has not dissipated.  It could happen again.  The type of financial instruments that were used, the misselling and the lack of regulation must be dealt with now.  The amount of moneys involved are enormous but let us not forget that it was not just the fall of Lehman Brothers that caused the problem.  It was the misselling of products and the fall of Bear Stearns, J.P. Morgan, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, AIG, HBOS, Lloyds and TSB.  It was the fall of all those banks that created an international financial difficulty.  We must address that matter.</P>

Whatever about the issue of whether prosecutions will follow, I hope everything possible is done in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is important to say that yesterday was a celebration of the telling of the truth.  The people who committed evil acts in the past know the truth about what they did is now out.  I hope that sends a message to evil doers everywhere that in time the truth does come out.

        <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children heard some interesting comments yesterday from the Carer&rsquo;s Association.  Clare Duffy was pointing to the fact that there has been a massive under-reporting of the number of children under 18 who are caring for relatives.  It is probably not something we think about much and when we do we probably think there is much good in terms of the emotional maturity and compassion of the person but there is also the danger for young people in caring roles of lost opportunities in life and that their emotional growth could be damaged.  It appears there are 28,000 such young children and we should be grateful to the Carer&rsquo;s Association for what they had to say but we should also note what the chief executive, Enda Egan, said in pointing out that this is not an issue on which there has been specific focus in our society, nor are there specific State supports for such carers.  I ask for an early debate on that issue to allow us discuss it.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, O&rsquo;Donovan, Buttimer, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, Harris, Leyden, Ryan, Keaveney, Healy Eames, Callely, Donohue, Doherty, Mary White, Twomey, Walsh, Norris, Bacik, Hanafin, Mullen and Glynn &mdash; 22 Senators &mdash; welcomed the Saville report.  Yesterday was a historic day, and thank God we all lived to see it.  It was one of the most important days for anyone to be a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.  I think of very sad days, and I congratulate RTE for its tremendous live coverage which allowed the people of Ireland see that justice was done for the 14 innocent people who were murdered, their families and all the victims, as mentioned by Senator Harris and many other colleagues, and the minute&rsquo;s silence that took place to remember all of them.</P>
        <P>I recall being in Derry ten days after Bloody Sunday and being taken out on the bridge, left with my hands up over my head for an hour and a half in pouring rain.  That is the sort of torture that went on for the people of the North of Ireland in those times.  It was hell on earth for anyone trying to make a living or run a business in that part of the country.  I feel proud and privileged to be here today and to look back on that time.  The events that took place were wrong, and we must remember all those of all political persuasions who put their lives on the line, the almost 100,000 innocent families who were maimed and also the 3,000 who died in that terrible period of 30 years or more.</P>
        <P>Yesterday was a splendid day and I wish everyone well.  I am aware the Taoiseach is meeting the relatives today.  The church leaders will have met them by now to congratulate them on their determination and hard work over the 38 long years they waited to see the events that happened in Derry yesterday.  I will allow the longest time for a debate.  I will consult with the leaders after the Order of Business to see how we will allow every Member of this House to welcome the news and the Saville report.</P>
        <P>Lord Saville was a man of courage.  I agree with the sentiments expressed here today.  The British Prime Minister made the utterances we all wanted to hear on television yesterday.  I want to mention all taoisigh of our country including the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Tony Blair played a huge role also.  Our current Taoiseach and all past taoisigh and Ministers for Foreign Affairs played a major role in ensuring this day would happen.  I congratu<Col N="300"/>late everyone concerned on all sides.  As I said, we will allow the longest time possible to ensure all Members of this House can make a contribution in regard to welcoming the report for which we all waited so long.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Ryan, Twomey and Bacik called for an urgent debate on mental health and referred to the three institutions that were unfit for purpose and about which we heard on our radio stations this morning following the publication of the Mental Health Commission report yesterday.  I have no difficulty in asking the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to come back to the House.  The Minister has been very generous with his time.  He has come to the House on every occasion he was asked to do so.  As we are all aware, he got a reasonable allocation in the budget despite the fact that resources were very scarce.  I welcome the new 55 bedroom unit, the foundation stone for which he laid in Mullingar last Monday week.  Under his remit of mental health he is endeavouring to do his utmost in regard to improving the standards in that area.  He deserves all our support and I have no difficulty in the House having this issue discussed before the summer recess, on which Senator Fitzgerald asked for a commitment.  I have no difficulty with such a debate taking place.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer pointed out that on this day 33 years ago in 1977 a good Corkman, Mr. Jack Lynch, took the position of Taoiseach, an event of which we are all so proud.  It is extraordinary how time flies.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh has also offered his congratulations to Mr. Billy Walsh and the five young men who brought back medals from the European boxing championships.  I have already welcomed this and congratulated everyone involved on the Order of Business yesterday.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in have raised the matter of the Land Registry&rsquo;s proposal to destroy its hard copy records once it has computerised them, records which cover our history and heritage for generations.  This is a matter we in the Seanad should take to our hearts and on which we should get the Minister to attend a debate.  I accept that to gain speed and efficiency documents in the registry must be computerised.  Under no circumstances, however, should its records dating back 300 years be damaged.  They are a great advantage to the country in terms of tourism.  We all saw the huge interest in the 1911 census when the returns were published on-line.  I will have a debate on the matter in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and Buttimer referred to the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill which will be debated in the House today and tomorrow, if Senators so wish.  I assure Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and the House that the Bill will not be rushed.  I will do anything I can to assist colleagues in their serious concerns about the legislation and ensure its passage.  Many Members on all sides of the House made contributions on the legislation in good faith.  We are trying to assist in making it acceptable to the people we represent in the House.</P>
        <P>Senators Healy Eames and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for a debate and an update from the Minister on the issue of schools&rsquo; patronage and provision for special educational needs.  Senator Healy Eames also raised her serious concerns regarding education.  I have no difficulty with having such a debate at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely sought briefing documents for the forthcoming statements on health services.  As Leader of the House, I have one job and another as leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il group.  Senator Alex White wanted an update on how I assisted colleagues on the Fianna F&aacute;il side.  I always do my best for any Senator who seeks a personal verbal or written briefing.  If any other party leader wishes to avail of the assistance that colleagues need in the House from time to time, I strongly advise them to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a large amount of very valuable briefing material available to Members.  I work closely with our colleagues in the Oireachtas Library and advise any Member who wishes to be briefed on any matter going back to the foundation of the State to use the facility.  The Oireachtas Library service is <i>par excellence</i>.  I cannot speak highly enough of the assistance its staff give Members on an hourly basis, not just a daily basis.  I hope that clarifies the matter for the good Senator.</P>

        <P>Senator Walsh raised the length and cost of the ongoing tribunals of inquiry.  I will discuss this matter with the other leaders at our next meeting and endeavour to arrange a debate on them before the summer recess.  As Senator Walsh rightly said, we waited 12 years for the Saville report which cost &euro;200 million.  The tribunals of inquiry have cost &euro;1 billion, which is unacceptable.  The length of time they are taking needs to be discussed by colleagues.  We will endeavour to have an all-party motion on all the tribunals, their length and cost before the summer recess.  I will allow the amount of hours and days required.  It will be discussed at the next leaders&rsquo; meeting to see how it can be placed on the Order Paper.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the plight of the Palestinians.  I fully support his sentiments regarding the Minister for Foreign Affairs expelling the Israeli Embassy official who allegedly had misused Irish passports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>

	<P>I beg the Senators&rsquo; pardon.  It was done by the Israeli authorities.</P>
        <P>I wish Senator Norris a very happy Bloomsday, in respect of which he is one the greatest ambassadors.</P>
        <P>I will bring the matter of the Roma sent back from Germany to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn raised the matter of a new substance, Whack, available in head shops.  The Minister for Health and Children will be in the House after the Order of Business for statements on health service provision.  She can be asked if a simple ministerial order will automatically ban each new substance at new substances come on stream nearly every day.  We in the Oireachtas would have no difficulty in giving her the responsibility to make such ministerial orders.  As Senator Glynn has pointed out, it is alarming what we are being told in Mullingar about this new substance, Whack, which is really dangerous.  I know colleagues will raise the matter of its availability with the Minister later.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the recent appointment of a much needed dermatologist at Mullingar hospital.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on shadow financial markets and the mis-selling of financial products.  This would be a timely debate which I hope will take place before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen raised yesterday&rsquo;s proceedings at the Joint Committee on Health and Children which highlighted the work done by 28,000 young people in looking after our senior citizens.  I congratulate everyone concerned.  As I have always said on the Order of Business, <Col N="302"/>every carer deserves a gold medal for what he or she does.  They are brilliant.  We certainly will not be found wanting in terms of any support we can give them and having the issue debated in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen wished the President, Mrs. Mary McAleese, and the Minister well on their visit to China, one of the largest markets in the world.  I know there is a huge opportunity in terms of job creation for our people in doing business in that market.  I was part of a trade mission at one time and it was a wonderful experience.  There are many opportunities available to all of our large Irish companies to export to this market.  I also take Senator Mullen&rsquo;s point on the issue of human rights in China, a view we all share.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy called for a debate on marine related activities.  I will have no difficulty in arranging such a debate in the future.</P>

    <Title>Provision of Health Services by the HSE: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great pleasure to be here to discuss the health services.  I propose to make some opening comments to set the context of what we are doing with our health services and then, by way of reply, to deal with the issues raised by Senators.  One measurement used in any country to establish the quality of health services is life expectancy.  When we joined the EU, life expectancy in Ireland was two years below the EU average.  Today, it is one year higher.  We have added four years to life expectancy during the past 12 years.  A child born in Ireland today will live longer than a child born in the UK, Denmark, Germany and many other countries, something of which we must be proud.</P>
        <P>Patient safety and quality guides me in the reform of the health services.  We live in an era in which standards, monitoring and enforcement are at the heart of everything we do in health care.  This dictates how and where things happen.  If we are to be concerned with good outcomes for patients, we must be up to the consequences of patient safety and evidence based medicine.</P>
        <P>At the heart of the cancer control plan was the fact that all the evidence from Ireland and outside suggested that when breast cancer patients were treated in a centre dealing with 150 new cases per year, their outcomes improved by between 20% and 25%.  What does this mean?  It means one in four or five women who would have died will survive breast cancer.  I am pleased to say we have transitioned our breast cancer services from 32 hospitals some three years ago to eight centres now along with the satellite centre in Donegal.  I am pleased to acknowledge the recent data published by the cancer registry showing that between 1996 and 2006 the survival rates for breast cancer in Ireland went from 70% to in excess of 80%.  What does this mean?  It means ten women who would have died in the mid 1990s are now surviving breast cancer.  The improvement is even greater for prostate cancer.  It has increased by 23 percentage points.  Some 23 men who would have died in the mid 1990s are now surviving prostate cancer.</P>
        <P>What else are we doing in cancer care?  We are establishing rapid access clinics for lung and prostate cancer at the eight centres.  Most of these are open and the remainder will open later this year.  This will ensure that men with symptoms that could cause prostate cancer can rapidly be accessed and this is equally the case for lung cancer.  We are also rolling out our screening programmes.  Last year, 122,000 women were screened as part of BreastCheck.  This has now been rolled out to every county in the country.  Last year, 280,000 women between 25 and 60 years were screened for cervical cancer.</P><Col N="303"/>
        <P Just="Left">Recently, we began the introduction of the vaccine.  Some 80% of women who go for screening will be prevented from having cervical cancer.  The belt and braces approach will add a further 20% to the numbers receiving the vaccine and, hopefully, 25 years from now, will prevent young girls from getting cervical cancer.  The first screening programme to involve men will begin on 1 January 2012 when we introduce the colorectal screening programme.  Unlike other screening programmes, it will involve a good deal of self screening and the kit will be sent to people in their homes.  A person will carry out his or her own test and send it back.  Approximately 6% of those tested will require follow up measures such as a colonoscopy and approximately 12 hospitals in the country will provide colonoscopy suites.  Between now and then we need a significant public awareness campaign but it must be informed by research and that research is under way.  The reason for the research is because it is the first time people will have been involved in self screening and it will be the first time we have a screening programme involving men.  Although the participation rate for BreastCheck is more than 70%, one of the highest in the world, we anticipate the rate for the new programme will be 50% which, by world standards, would be good.  However, we need public awareness campaigns to be informed by good research and this is under way.  Also, we need to train nurses to carry out colonoscopies and to ensure the infrastructure is in place throughout the country for the follow through.  This is the reason it takes a period of between 18 to 24 months from the time one agrees to carry out a screening programme to its introduction.</P>
        <P>I refer to infection control.  I am pleased to say that in the past two years the rate of MRSA has declined by 39%.  We have set remarkably ambitious targets for the reduction of health acquired infections, including MRSA.  Targets include a reduction of 30% for MRSA and a reduction of 20% overall for health acquired infections as well as a 27% reduction in antibiotic consumption.  Why has this taken place?  The reduction has taken place because a focus has been applied to it and because we are measuring.  It is not possible to manage anything or reach targets unless one measures what one has.  In recent years for the first time we have been carrying out infection and hygiene audits within our public hospitals.  They are proving to be remarkably successful because there is now a focus within the acute hospital environment on the need for infection control.  Hand washing is the most basic and effective tool for minimising the spread of infection in an acute hospital.  There has been a very significant increase in the number of health care professionals and visitors who participate in hand washing.</P>
        <P>Earlier, I remarked that the focus is all on patient safety, patient outcomes and evidence based medicine.  We have 57 hospitals in the country and 37 accident and emergency units.  For a population for 4.3 million this means that the various services provided will change.  There is no question of downgrading hospitals.  At issue is upgrading patient care.  This means we must enter a period of constant change.  Ireland is no different to any other country in this regard.  For example, our cancer control plan is being emulated in other countries.  Several people have come to Ireland and met me and I have met people at international conferences interested in the manner in which we have introduced a very successful evidence based cancer control plan.  Equally, we must learn from other countries the most effective and safest way to provide services for patients especially when it comes to acute hospital services.  For more serious and acute illnesses, that service must be provided in larger hospitals where there are a larger number of expert staff working together in multidisciplinary teams with the patient at the centre of their care.  It does not mean there is no role for smaller hospitals.  Smaller hospitals can do more in respect of diagnostics, elective work and community based facilities.  The future for health care is not a hospital future.  Throughout the world, health care systems are minimising services provided in a hospital environment.  The hospitalisation model is neither desirable nor affordable.  More than 90% of our health needs can be provided in primary, community and continuing care, the reason there is such a focus on these areas.</P><Col N="304"/>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to care of the elderly.  The Fair Deal is providing equity of access and treatment as far as funding is concerned for every older person and their families.  No longer are siblings or children responsible for paying the long-term care needs of their family members.  No longer will people have to mortgage their house to pay for their parents&rsquo; long-term care.  Everyone is treated on the same basis whether they are in a public or private nursing home.  Of the 27,000 people in long-term care in Ireland, approximately 10,000 are in public nursing homes and 17,000 in private nursing homes.  Heretofore, some 90% of the care cost in public nursing homes was paid for by the State.  In respect of private nursing homes, approximately 40% of the care costs was paid on average and some 60% had to be paid by the individuals and their families.  This placed an undue financial burden and a burden of trauma and concern on individuals and their families.  Many of us are aware of a litany of family experiences whereby loans had to be taken out to fund the care.  That was not desirable, fair or equitable and I am pleased it has been brought to an end.  This year, more than &euro;1 billion will be spent on long-term care of older people.  As far as older people are concerned, the policy is for care in the community.  Some 95% of older people can be cared for in their own homes and communities.  From a starting point of zero some five years ago, there are now 11,000 people per year with home care packages and 53,000 people with home help.  In fairness, home help has been in place for a considerable length of time.  However, home care packages are a new part of the support mechanism at community level to support older people at home.  Community services that traditionally would have been provided in acute hospitals are now being provided at home and older people in particular are the beneficiaries.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In addition to patient safety and evidence based medicine guiding what we do and where we do it, we have seen the emergence of great clinical leadership here.  Dr. Barry White heads up the HSE quality control and clinical affairs division, a new division in our public health system.  He has appointed a number of key leading clinicians to head up different care programmes.  They are leaders in their fields who have considerable peer support and credibility among colleagues.  Their remit is within the resources they have because we do not have additional money.  The public health services were reduced by &euro;1 billion this year.  I refer to the resources being spent on these care areas.</P>
      
        <P>They must come up with new and innovative ways to ensure their parents are cared for.  I have seen fantastic clinical leadership such as that shown by Professor Keane.</P>
        <P>Last week I published the new cardiovascular strategy which for the first time includes stroke patients.  Each year in Ireland 2,500 people die from a stroke, 10,000 people have a stroke, there are 10,000 cardiovascular deaths, while 30,000 people live with the residual disability.  For certain stroke patients, the effects of a stroke can be reversed if they are thrombolysed within four and half hours.  A lead clinician has been appointed to roll out thrombolysis services throughout the country.  Instead of thrombolysis services being provided in just a small number hospitals, they will be provided in every network.</P>
        <P>Equally, in the case of acute coronary syndrome, if somebody is subject to stenting, or PCI, within 120 minutes, one can reverse the effects of a heart attack.  Currently, stenting is done in four or five hospitals, but we will be moving to a situation where it will be done in ten hospitals.  The lead clinician is Professor Kieran Daly from the coronary care unit in University College Hospital, Galway.  He is a leader in his field both in Ireland and overseas.  The leader in the case of stroke patients is Professor Peter Kelly from the Mater Hospital in Dublin, while the leader in the case of patients suffering from heart failure is Professor Ken O&rsquo;Donnell.  I mention them because, like many other senior clinicians, they are prepared to put their heads above the parapet and show genuine leadership in rolling out programmes within the budgetary constraints within which we are operating to provide care for patients.  They are optimistic they <Col N="305"/>can do this and very often it is about working in a different way.  For example, if stroke patients are cared for appropriately as soon as possible, it reduces the length of time they will have to stay in hospital and greatly improves the outcome in terms of disability.  Two years ago we had one stroke unit but now we have 12.  However, we need a number of others.  This greatly enhances the outcome for patients and reduces the burden and the cost on the hospital and the public health system.</P>
        <P>The accident and emergency unit is seen as the shop front in terms of hospital activity.  Four years ago few patients were seen within six hours, the target we had set.  Today I happy to say 87% of patients are seen and sent home or otherwise within six hours.  The vast majority of the remaining 13% are seen within 12 hours, but the target is six hours.  We are determined to reach that target.  There are six hospitals, in particular, which have not been in a position to reach it.  They include among them the large acute hospitals in Dublin which require medical assessment units which are being put in place.  I expect the improvements we have seen in Waterford, Letterkenny, Sligo, Portiuncula, the Midlands, Mullingar and many other hospitals to been seen in Beaumont, the Mater and Tallaght hospitals.</P>
        <P>The new chief executive officer in Tallaght hospital, Professor Conlon, is making great improvements in the operation of the hospital and  I expect to see similar improvements elsewhere.  A new chief executive officer, Dr. David O&rsquo;Keeffe, has been appointed in University College Hospital, Galway and I expect his clinical leadership, experience and managerial skills to bring great improvements.  Even though we have made huge improvements, we still have some of the journey to travel.  In our criticism of the deficiencies, we must be fair about the positive outcomes achieved.</P>
        <P>Mental health services were referred to this morning on the Order of Business, to some of which I listened.  For many years these services were the Cinderella of the health service.  However, in 2007 we published A Vision for Change which is the future of mental health services and into which everybody has bought.  It is about providing for community based services.  I  come from the Ballinasloe area of County Galway, as does Senator Mullen.  When I was a very young girl, I remember visiting Ballinasloe and hearing about St. Brigid&rsquo;s.  If memory serves me right, there were close to 3,000 patients there when I was a child.  The story was that if one went into it, one had little chance of ever coming out.  That is the dark past as far as dealing with mental illness is concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am happy to say the vast majority of mental health patients are now in a community setting being cared for at home or in day services, but we still have facilities which are not fit for purpose such as those mentioned by the Mental Health Commission in its 2009 report &mdash; St. Brendan&rsquo;s, St. Senan&rsquo;s and St. Ita&rsquo;s hospitals.  I was asked earlier by the media what one had to say to the patients still in these facilities.  The first thing is that it is not acceptable and that it will end.  The new unit in Blanchardstown has been completed.  Some 100 additional psychiatric nurses are being appointed and 30 of them will be appointed to that unit, to which the patients from St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital will move shortly.  A new acute unit is being built in Beaumont Hospital for patients from St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, while new facilities are being put in place in Wexford for the patients of St. Senan&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>I say to the patients and their families that in the past this would not have been commented upon.  Today we have an independent commission, a statutory body, the sole focus of which is on the interests of patients.  It is the voice of patients and carries out inspections without fear or favour.  Whether they are for mental health patients or elderly patients &mdash; there has been controversy about some of the inspections which have taken place of places in which elderly patients are cared for &mdash; if buildings or services are not fit for purpose, it must be brought to an end as soon as possible.</P><Col N="306"/>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, has put in a huge effort.  However, there are still industrial relations issues which must be addressed.  We require psychiatric nurses to move from the hospital setting into the community but this still has not been agreed.  The Croke Park agreement has huge potential as far as public health services are concerned and I hope we will achieve redeployment.  Nobody will lose his or her job.  We are asking people to work in a different place in a different way.  If we all put patients first, we can meet the challenges in the mental health services.</P>
        <P>As Senator Prendergast is in the House, people in Clonmel, in particular, were not happy about moving into community facilities.  However, I understand much good work has been done since our meeting with Oireachtas representatives in order that we can proceed with the &euro;10 million project to improve community services in Clonmel and remove patients from the awful acute facilities that have been the hallmark of mental health services in the area.</P>
        <P>I recently announced new proposals on behalf of the Government in regard to private health insurance.  Half of the population have private health insurance policies.  Notwithstanding the recession, the rate of decline has been less than 2% &mdash; I believe the actual figure is 1.6%.  This indicates that there is strong support for the private health insurance market in Ireland.  One can argue about why that is the case, but in a society in which people like me and most people in this room can afford to make a contribution towards their health costs, they should do so.  The reality is that we have one company which has a disproportionate share of those over 65 years.  VHI has 90% of the over 80s, 80% of the over 70s and 70% plus of the over 65s.  Last year it lost &euro;170 million on the over 65s.  I am equally aware that it has a 60% share of the health insurance market and that many of its competitors believe that is disproportionate.  Asking its competitors to transfer money through the tax relief at source system from its younger members to it is a huge bone of contention.  It is the Government&rsquo;s strong view, based on the advice available to it, that as long as we remain the owner of a company and the regulator of the market, that is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>There are no good health reasons the Government needs to own VHI which must be authorised on the same basis as the other companies which must put aside 40% of their premium income for their reserves to meet the solvency requirements of the regulator, but VHI does not have to do this.  That is grossly unfair from the point of view of promoting competition in the market.  VHI needs capital if it is to be authorised.  The Government is willing to bring forward that capital on the good investor principle on the basis that when we sell VHI, the money will be returned.  It would not make sense to sell VHI before it was capitalised because its value would decrease hugely.  Most important, without a sustainable business model, VHI would not be attractive from a State or private interest perspective.  To make it attractive, we must ensure older people are supported by younger people.  That solidarity is the hallmark of our private health insurance market &mdash; that we pay more than health insurance should cost when we are young in order that older people do not have their premiums hiked up by virtue of their age or medical condition.  This is known as risk equalisation.  If we want community rating of policies, whereby we all pay the same for the same policy and do not discriminate or show bias based on age or medical condition, that requires younger people, under a risk equalisation model, to support older people.  Our model of risk equalisation introduced in 1996 was struck down by the Supreme Court in July 2008.  We must reflect on this.  It is an extremely complex issue, but in the meantime we are using the taxation system to transfer money from younger to older people.</P>
        <P>By 1 January 2013, the intention is to have a new risk equalisation model based not only on age and gender but also on health status.  In the meantime, we must use the scheme we have <Col N="307"/>as a transitional measure to make sure we continue to support older people, who are an increasing cost for health insurers.</P>
        <P>In addition, insurers are required to comply with minimum benefits legislation.  In other words, there are minimum benefits that they must cover but they are outdated now in light of our current experience and policy.  For example, the legislation does not require insurers to cover primary care or preventive care.  I will amend minimum benefits insurance later this year to require a heavy emphasis on primary care and preventive care.  It should not be that one&rsquo;s insurance only covers episodes in hospital or diagnostics provided in a hospital environment.  That is not desirable from a cost point of view or from a patient experience and outcome point of view.  That will also be addressed.  This will fit in with the new eligibility legislation we are preparing regarding what we are entitled to in the public service.</P>
        <P>Evidence-based patient safety is at the heart of everything we do.  Clearly, we must continue to encourage the clinical leadership that has emerged.  We must also get more from less, as we will have less money next year than we have this year.  We have taken &euro;1 billion out of our public health service this year.  It is a challenge but when we are challenged in Ireland and when we are ambitious, it is amazing what we can do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have seen fantastic examples of more being done for less.  Senator Quinn is well experienced in this from a business perspective.  When people apply their minds to how they can do things differently and in a more innovative way, it is amazing what can happen.  For example, with less money this year Beaumont Hospital has treated more patients than last year.  It has fewer inpatient beds and less money but more people are being treated because they are being admitted on a day case basis without the requirement for 24-7 cover.  <?oasys _dc18- ?>The ambition is that every patient will undergo surgery on a same day basis, given 80% of those<?oasys _dc0- ?> who require surgery can come in the morning, have their surgery and go home.  That is best practice internationally.  We are a long way off but we are moving in that direction.  Anyone who needs diagnostics should not, unless it is essential, have to be admitted to access that service.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the contributions of Members and to responding to the issues raised.  Our health services have improved enormously.  There are 6,000 people alive today who would have been dead ten years ago because of the cardiovascular interventions we now have.  I instanced the improvements in cancer outcomes and they will improve further with the new services we have in place and the multidisciplinary care.  Ireland is fortunate for its size to have clinicians of a world standing for a number of reasons.  We can attract and financially reward clinicians as well as they are rewarded almost anywhere in the world.  We have attracted high-powered, talented and experienced clinicians, including nurses, to provide world class services to our patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are deficiencies, some of which resulted from the fragmented nature of the service we provided.  If one spreads one&rsquo;s resource too thinly in terms of expertise, one does not achieve value in terms of outcomes.  We have learned that from the cancer service and we must learn it in other areas.  Instead of people becoming obsessed with institutions, we need to become obsessed with services.  Patients ask me where they can get the best service when they are sick or where they can get the best service for their child.</P>
        <P>Last week I met members of Helping Hands.  This is a wonderful organisation based in the west of Ireland and its members move into the home when a child has cancer and the parents must travel to Crumlin hospital in Dublin where all cancer treatment for children is centralised.  That is why we have one of the best outcomes in the world for childhood cancers.  They move in and look after the rest of the family.  They take the other children to school, provide food <Col N="308"/>and so on.  It is a fantastic organisation.  I was talking to one of the parents whose child has survived six years.  She said the service in Crumlin hospital was fantastic but when she hears some of the debates, she said, &ldquo;I feel like ringing up Joe Duffy just to tell him of the experience we had&rdquo;.  I encouraged her to do so.</P>

	<P Just="Left">That is how parents feel when they experience a terrific, successful outcome to their child&rsquo;s serious illness.  Well-informed patients also have that perspective and the challenge for us in politics is to support the best outcome for patients whatever that involves for us as politicians.  It requires courage and leadership but there never has been a better time to show that than in the Ireland of 2010.</P>

	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I agree with the Leader&rsquo;s comment about the time she gives to the House and I thank her for that.  She listens to the contributions we make and takes up the issues we highlight.  She gives a response in so far as she can on the day on the issues we raise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">She referred to improved life expectancy as one of the factors that proves we have a better service.  However, the overall social and economic context is a huge factor and not just the direct experience of the health service.  We know that internationally, as the social and economic circumstances of a population improve, the health outcomes improve dramatically.  That is one of the reasons good health policy means a focus on prevention as much as possible.  I agree with the Minister that we have not focused on this enough and there is great scope to focus more on prevention of a range of diseases and illnesses to save money and to ensure better health outcomes, which is important.</P>
        <P>She stated the health service is moving to evidence-based quality services with high clinical leadership and a monitoring of outcomes.  She is correct and I support her move to specialties and excellence, the benefits of which can clearly be seen in breast cancer services.  However, there has been slow progress overall in the move to cancer screening.  Many counties had to wait a long time for the breast cancer service.  I acknowledge we are there now but I would hate to think that when it comes to rolling out screening for colon cancer, cervical cancer or prostate cancer, it could take the time it did to deliver the breast cancer screening service nationwide.  That was not acceptable because the political will and vision was there but the implementation of the programme was unbelievably slow.  It was incredible that it took ten to 15 years from start to finish, which was too long.  That issue must be taken on board.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned reducing infection control, which is also important.  The criteria she listed were evidence-based, patient safety, a quality service, high clinical excellence and monitoring outcomes.  I can only focus on a number of areas but serious questions have been raised about each criterion even in the past few weeks.  It is one thing for the Minister to say she wants quality patient outcomes, patient safety, clinical excellence and so on and I totally respect that is the model she is operating on, but questions arise about each criterion.</P>
        <P>The Minister will acknowledge that is still a real issue.  For example, maternity services were in the public arena recently.  The very least a woman expects if she has had a miscarriage and goes for a scan is that it would be accurate.  I had two miscarriages and like every woman in the country when this scandal emerged, my mind flashed back to the experience I had and I went through what happened to me.  The Minister and I do not create panic because miscarriage is common.  However, the very least one would expect when attending a hospital for a scan is <Col N="309"/>standard routine procedures, clinical excellence and proper monitoring with information from around the country about the service available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister should compare what she said in her introduction with the experience of patients.  The women concerned were intuitive but it is difficult to be that intuitive when one is dealing with a medical issue because one feels one should trust the medical information.  I became involved in public life because of my concerns about maternity hospitals and the lack of voices women had.  It sparked my interest in policy issues.  The Minister must explain why, for example, when the HSE had the experience of an incorrect diagnosis of a miscarriage in UCHG in 2006 and set down a standard operating procedure following a review, that was not rolled out throughout the country.  Why did the HSE not learn from that?  This is one example, but there could be many more.  Why did the HSE not move to the type of model the Minister is talking about, in that most recent example, which is quite extraordinary?  It is a good example when putting it to the Minister that although she has the model and the approach, what about the implementation?  We are talking about the delivery of services by the HSE.  Obviously, the country is extremely concerned about the management issues that arise in relation to the HSE.</P>
        <P>Take the child care issue and the lack of a death mechanism review.  Again the Minister talks about the importance of having statistics.  If one takes the social aspect and the child care area it is clear that monitoring, consistency and feedback were missing.  What was also missing was having child care at an appropriate level within the HSE, in terms of reporting, management and budgetary levels.  The Minister might confirm whether it is true that only very recently has child care been on the agenda of the board of the HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If something like child care services is not an agenda item for discussion by the board of the HSE, that tells us all we need to know about why we have had the sort of problems we have seen.  I have limited time, but I would like the Minister to inform the public on what plans exist in relation to prioritising child care issues so they are dealt with at the right management level, with appropriate budgets within the HSE.  There is so much criticism of the HSE structure not delivering that she has to address this issue.  The minute I say this we come up against a problem, because the whole question of the Minister&rsquo;s relationship to the HSE and the political accountability her office takes in that regard is one that seems very fluid.  Again, I ask Deputy Harney as an experienced Minister for Health and Children, to outline how she sees that relationship.  How can she be certain that she has the political accountability to ensure that what she said in her introductory words to this House, for example, happens in relation to child care or maternity services?</P>
        <P>These are the key issues.  It is about the relationship between the two.  The Minister has the model and says she wants to see it delivered and yet, again and again on the ground, there are examples of where there are problems.  Tallaght hospital X-rays is such a problem area, as is not knowing the number of children who died.  The colonoscopy area is another example.  I ask the Minister to update us on Tallaght, to reassure the House that those letters have now been read, systems are in place, we understand why this happened and that the lessons learned from that review will be spread to the other hospitals where the same thing could happen, and indeed, where there were reports to this effect.  These are the key questions about delivery and the patient experience.</P>
        <P>The Minister rightly says that what is important is the quality of the patient&rsquo;s experience, and I totally agree.  However, the examples I am giving impact on and are at the core of patient safety.  The statistics are still incredibly worrying.  They are about the numbers still on trolleys and the loss of patient beds.  I would like the Minister to return to the bed issue.  On 23 May we were told that 333 beds were closed in hospitals around the country, owing to cost savings, infection control or refurbishment.  The Minister is apparently planning also more than 1,000 <Col N="310"/>closures, while originally she had promised 3,000 extra beds.  Could she comment on that?  If 300 people are on trolleys on a daily basis, 900 operations were cancelled in the first half of last year and more than 270,000 bed days were lost due to delayed discharges, what is the plan in relation to beds, and what is the Minister&rsquo;s estimate of the number of beds necessary to give people the services they need?  Co-location was the Minister&rsquo;s plan, but clearly that is not being developed as she intended.</P>
        <P>I want to move to the area of primary care.  The Government programme is way behind in the delivery of primary care centres.  Again, in the current economic climate what is the response to those who wish to develop primary care units?  What state of progress is the Minister at in relation to the development of further primary care systems?  A quick glance at the statistics will show that the rhetoric and the theory indicate that while we want to move towards the development of primary care, there is nothing on the ground to show we have anything like the level of units needed.  If the Minister is going to close the beds and move away from a hospital admissions regime as much as possible, which is the right thing to do, obviously people must have a service locally.  They must be able to avail of it in terms of primary care.</P>
        <P>There is a problem as regards moving to specialist centres before the services are developed in the specialist hospitals.  This will result in the same problem we saw as regards maternity services, namely, registrars, senior house officers and consultants who are so rushed and pressurised because of pressure from outlying hospitals being closed that they are not able to respond to the woman, for example, who needs to be given sufficient time if her scan is to be read properly.  This is very problematic and I do not want to pretend that running our health services is easy since it is enormously complex.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nonetheless, we are investing &euro;20 billion a year, &euro;16 billion of which is in the public health system.  Fine Gael has looked at other countries.  Ireland is investing an enormous amount of money in health, but it is not getting value in terms of the outcomes, despite the improvements the Minister has referred to in terms of extension of life etc.  We are not getting the quality levels we should be, given the amount of money going into the health services, and everybody knows that.  I do not, for a minute, want to criticise front line staff.  I absolutely acknowledge the pressure that nurses, doctors and hospital staff are under and the efforts they make, but I would like the Minister to speak about the way the hospitals are being administered and the interaction between the HSE and herself.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister commented on today&rsquo;s report on mental health and the closure of the hospitals.  I too acknowledge the personal efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, but where are the people whom the Mental Health Commission says cannot now be admitted to St. Ita&rsquo;s, St. Brendan&rsquo;s or St. Senan&rsquo;s, from January, going to get a mental health service, if the mental health teams are not at the levels that are needed?  Is the Minister planning some emergency response for beds for individuals with mental health difficulties, because it seems to me there is going to be a crisis?  Again, given that this is such a vulnerable group, and people with mental health problems can be so easily marginalised, it is absolutely critical that if those three hospitals are going to be closed and not be allowed to admit patients, we need to know that the plans are in this regard.</P>
        <P>There are quite a number of other areas I should like to touch on, but I shall go back to the question of colonoscopies.  Will the Minister inform the House as regards the waiting times, because this is an area in which she has taken an interest?  She wants to see patients who need colonoscopies getting them in a speedy manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and, like Senator Fitzgerald, thank her for spending so much time in this Chamber.  I am sure <Col N="311"/>all Members will agree it was a treat to listen to her excellent presentation.  She has an incredible grasp of her brief down to the most minute detail and appears to deliver on it with such ease that I imagine, were Members to ask about paper clips on a hospital trolley somewhere, she almost would know about them.  It is such a treat to listen to her that I told the Leader I wished she could speak for an hour because Members could have listened to her for that length of time.  This particularly is the case when she speaks without a script.  I noticed that although Senator Fitzgerald sought a script, there was none.  Sometimes it is somewhat sad not to receive a script from the Minister because there always is so much to take from the speech and one must try to scribble as many notes as possible.</P>
        <P>As one would expect, having listened to the Minister, I genuinely disagree with Senator Fitzgerald in her claims to the effect that there is not value for money.  Sometimes the Opposition opposes for the sake of it and perhaps the glass is half empty rather than half full and Members are not looking for the positive outcomes.  I acknowledge the subjects about which the Minister spoke do not always get the headlines on the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; because they are positive and do not have a negative twinge to them.  However, I was thrilled to hear the Minister&rsquo;s presentation and rapid round-up of the things that are happening.  For example, Beaumont Hospital now treats more patients for less money, while 6,000 people are alive today who would not have been ten years ago owing to cardiovascular treatments.</P>
        <P>The Minister has spoken of men whom I have encountered during my time on the Medical Council.  Professors Daly and Kelly and Dr. O&rsquo;Keeffe are all young men at the pinnacle of their careers who are Irish-trained, who went abroad to gain expertise and then returned home.  They now are at the head of these wonderful units that have Ireland at the pinnacle of such research.  It was great to hear the Minister state other countries were following our example.  However, there still is a huge road to travel, on which we are advancing all the time.  I was delighted to hear the Minister mention the training of nurses for various procedures, particularly cancer screening.</P>
        <P>In common with Senator Fitzgerald, I take my hat off to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, as Members have done many times in this House.  Like the Minister, he spends hours in this Chamber laying out his brief and usually comes without a script and speaks from the heart.  In this context, the Minister has rightly pointed out that an independent Mental Health Commission has been established and that this sector can no longer be treated as a Cinderella.  I note her acknowledgement that it had been so treated in the past.  I again revert to my wonderful experience on the Medical Council, on which I served as a layperson representing the public interest for five years.  I visited two new mental health units, one in Portlaoise and the other in Tallaght hospital, and look forward to the day when all the antiquated buildings are closed and mental health patients are treated in a unit within a general hospital.  I ask the Minister to keep an eye on adolescent psychology services, particularly in the ring-fencing of beds for eating disorders which are a major problem and a silent killer.  However, because they affect a small group of people, they do not have a strong voice.  While they are wonderful people, perhaps they do not shout loudly enough.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to keep an eye on them.</P>
        <P>When preparing for this debate, I examined the entire list of activities covered under the HSE.  One might conclude that it is no wonder things go wrong because there is a huge number of activities to cover.  However, having listened to the Minister and read through some briefing notes I received through the Leader&rsquo;s office and that of the Minister, I take my hat off to the hard-working staff in the HSE.  As the Minister has pointed out, at a time when they are almost battling a tsunami and although the budget has been cut back by &euro;1 billion, there are positive outcomes.  I will pick a few areas that I would like to discuss.</P><Col N="312"/>
        <P Just="Left">While Senator Fitzgerald  has stated there still are lengthy queues in accident and emergency departments, they certainly are being reduced.  They are 50% shorter today than five years ago.  Sometimes, no more than our national broadcaster, a spin is put on the length of time people are obliged to wait in accident and emergency units.  People such as the general secretary of the INMO, Mr. Doran, probably have a different slant on matters than the HSE.  However, I have personal experience in this regard because one of my siblings was admitted when very ill with severe chest pains to the accident and emergency unit in Tullamore hospital.  He was rapidly assessed and found to have a punctured lung.  He was then admitted to a bed and well looked after.  The following day he asked for a private room because he had VHI cover.  His consultant kindly told him that while this would not be a problem, in so doing he would be obliged to cease treating him.  He would be obliged to refer him to another consultant colleague because he was one of the new public service-only consultants.  Because my brother had been getting such good treatment, he opted to remain in the six-bed public ward under the care of that consultant and sings the praises of the public health service.  Consequently, I believe that if one gains access to the public health service and has a positive experience &mdash; there is no reason one should not &mdash; one will be well looked after.  I would go so far as to state there is no difference between the quality of the public service one receives as opposed to that of its private equivalent.  One probably is better looked after.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other area I considered was the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  In 2002 waiting lists for operations ranged from two to five years.  However, that time has been cut to between two and five months.  In the eight years since 2002, 165,000 patients have been treated.  When I went a little further and looked at the NTPF&rsquo;s website, it was interesting to find a list of people who had been treated.  The names are not fictitious, as the website provides the names and addresses of those who have been treated.  I took one example from County Sligo and one from my native county of Offaly.  A lady in Sligo had knee surgery.  Having been told she would be on a waiting list for 14 months, she rang the lo-call number for the National Treatment Purchase Fund which looked after everything.  Within two months she was treated in St. Joseph&rsquo;s, Garden Hill, County Sligo.  There was wear and tear on her knee and driving was a problem.  However, she has now been restored to full health.  She stated, &ldquo;I was treated like royalty,&rdquo; and would recommend it to anyone.  The lady from Clara, County Offaly, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s home town, needed a spinal decompression operation in Beaumont Hospital, which sounds specialised.  She also faced a two-year wait but again was dealt with within two months.  She also sings the NTPF&rsquo;s praises.</P>
        <P>I do not care what way it happens, provided it happens.  In what may not have been a throwaway remark, the Minister suggested one should talk about services, not about organisations.  This is extremely important and Members should think about it when jumping up and down about matters.  I do not exclude myself from those who jump up and down on hearing a headline on the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; or the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; programme.  I have been critical of the HSE and entered the Chamber this morning with a very different brief.  I had intended to seek complete reform of the HSE, but having listened to the Minister, I have changed my mind.</P>
        <P>The last subject I wish to discuss is something that has hit my own family, in that my mother-in-law has been diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  It has been a very difficult time for the family.  I am only her in-law, yet it has affected me and my children to a great extent.  Well done to the Minister for introducing the fair deal scheme.  I am delighted that the application my in-laws made for my mother-in-law has been dealt with speedily and effectively.  She is no different to anyone else.  Her application had nothing to do with me.  My sisters-in-law were responsible for everything and I was not involved in any way.  They are very pleased with how things have moved on for their mother.  She is in a private nursing home.  I am delighted to say <Col N="313"/>that although she has only her old age pension she is being looked after in the same way as a person with much more money than her and who in the past could have afforded much better care but now everyone is on an equal footing.</P>
        <P>I have a minor query about the fair deal scheme which came to me in the form of an e-mail.  If a person such as my mother-in-law goes into a nursing home, thus leaving her house vacant, and the family is keen to let out the house rather than leave it empty with the risk of it being vandalised or burgled, it would appear that 100% of the rental income will go to the State for the care of the person in the nursing home and nothing is left for the family to put towards the upkeep of the house.  The Minister will be aware that houses that are let out can run down.  In this case the family would like to let the house but there will be additional costs for its upkeep.  If they do not let it then they feel they are not being fair to the State either in so far as if nothing is done the State is deprived of the money.  Perhaps the Minister would reply to that point.  It might be the case that a bit of tweaking is necessary or I might not have been correct in my assumption.</P>
        <P>By and large, the glass is always half full rather than half empty.  At times, if there is not a positive spin on a story the national broadcaster will not want to run with it and it will choose the negative option.  I am not being picky because I have complimented such programmes as &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; in the House.  Perhaps the Minister will examine care for people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and see how we can try to keep people at home for longer, especially those who are affected with early onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  I wish we had more time to debate this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Doherty.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Feeney.  It is a joy to listen to the Minister who has no notes but is able to provide us with statistics during her contribution.  The other reason it is a joy is because she brought us good news.  I was not aware of the increase in life expectancy and of the improvements in patient safety, and in outcomes for breast cancer and prostate cancer.  From those perspectives it is a delight to hear what the Minister had to say.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to hear about the efforts in regard to care in the home.  I have been a big advocate of moving to care alternatives, including day care, primary care and community care.  Hospital care should really be supplemented by alternatives.  I am not sure we have done that to any great extent in the past.  I read on Monday about this sort of initiative being introduced in several hospitals in Canada.  They are calling it &ldquo;culture change&rdquo; and they hope it will result in so-called alternative level of care patients; that is, patients occupying a bed who no longer require the intensity of resources and services a hospital provides.  Such patients are being moved more efficiently from the hospital to appropriate care settings in the community.  This approach has not been properly examined in this country.  We need to convince the public that the obvious savings made in hospitals will be to the benefit of the community and to long-stay care.</P>
        <P>The Minister informed us that much progress has been made in the HSE in setting cancer care standards but, unfortunately, that fact does not make the headlines.  There is still a lack of uniformity in the HSE organisation in many areas.  For example, the child care assessment and protection guideline standards still differ across the country.  I understand uniform guidelines in the assessment of suspected miscarriage in early pregnancy are only being drawn up at the moment for maternity units.  Perhaps the Minister will bring us up to date in that respect.  Senator Fitzgerald has referred to the matter also.</P><Col N="314"/>
        <P>One can ask how all the problems can be addressed.  The incoming head of the HSE, Cathal Magee, faces a difficult challenge.  The small bit of advice I will give to him is to listen to what the customer says.  I always refer to patients as customers.  I told the Minister previously that when I was chairman of a hospital I made an effort to change &ldquo;patient&rdquo; to &ldquo;customer&rdquo; but the doctors did not care for it and I did not get my way.  I have always maintained that a good leader should be an excellent listener.  Mr. Magee can acquire much information on how to do the right thing by listening.  Perhaps every customer could fill in an on-line form after visiting a hospital and the HSE could act on that source of information which is so easy to obtain and is right under its eyes.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not refer to organ donation today.  Currently, more than 600 people are waiting for life-saving transplant operations.  A total of 243 organ transplants took place in this country in 2009.  A Bill was introduced in the House but debate on it was adjourned as the Minister wished to consider the area more closely to see what could be achieved.  The Bill related to presumed consent.  I understand that on its own presumed consent will not solve the problem but a great deal can be achieved with transplant co-ordinators in hospitals.  I accept the Minister is inquiring into the matter to see what can be done.  I am hopeful that something would happen soon because it is almost two years since the Bill was introduced.  I was pleased to see that more than 96% of the European Parliament voted for a directive aimed at increasing the number of organs available for transplantation among member states throughout the European Union.  It will also facilitate the exchange of organs and expand the pool of organs available.  Much can be done.</P>
        <P>The reason I introduced the Bill was because I knew a number of people who required organ donation.  Three people were affected in one shop.  One young man died although his mother went to great pains to try to organise an organ transplant for him, but two others are still alive because they managed to get transplants.  People are dying because we have not found a solution to the problem.  Presumed consent is the right way to go.  I accept the Minister has some reservations and she is carrying out an investigation in order to get support for whatever steps she takes in the area.  Matters are dragging on and each month we delay, people are dying.  I urge the Minister to take steps, whether by way of presumed consent or a different form of consent, because people are being put into the grave with organs they would be quite happy to have used.  If families are not happy they can opt out.  We would save lives on that basis.  I urge the Minister to do something about organ transplants as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Seanad&oacute;ir Quinn faoin am a roinnt liom inniu ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  It is clear that the HSE has failed miserably.  It is no wonder that it has because it is a monster that was created by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government as a means of insulating itself from accountability and responsibility for the delivery of health services to the people.  It was also set up to underpin a grossly inequitable two-tier health system.  The failure of the HSE and the shirking of responsibility by Government are illustrated most clearly by the two recent scandals.  The country has rightly been shocked by the revelations of the deaths of children in State care.  Responsibility for that lies with successive Governments who have presided over totally inadequate child protection services.  However, the Minister has remained virtually silent on this issue.  Similarly, she has hidden in the background regarding the diagnosis of miscarriage.  Just yesterday evening my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, received a reply from the Minister in which she admits the Melissa Redmond case was brought to her attention in August last year.  When Ms Redmond spoke about her experience in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, she was followed by other women from across the State who had similar experiences.</P><Col N="315"/>
        <P>The Minister sits silent on this issue, which is of great concern.  She has now admitted she knew of the Redmond case since August 2009, the month following the mistaken diagnosis of miscarriage.  The Minister has described how her Department and the HSE handled the Redmond case but she has given no indication of whether the wider implications were considered by them or whether they even considered the possibility that women might have had similar experiences in other hospitals.</P>
        <P>I support the call for the Minister to explain her silence and inaction and why it was only after this issue received widespread publicity that the HSE ordered a review of its cases of the past five years.  This will be a very traumatic experience for perhaps hundreds, if not thousands, of women who may find their viable pregnancies were terminated after being wrongly diagnosed as miscarriages.</P>
        <P>Let me refer to the effect the non-replacement of front-line services is having on the health service.  Today there have been up to 1,900 non-replacements of front-line service providers, nurses and midwives in the main.  This resulted from the recruitment embargo imposed by the Government.  If the recruitment ban is to be maintained in the health service, in excess of 6,000 further posts will remain unfilled over the next three years, with a corresponding withdrawal in the order of 3,500 acute hospital beds in the public health sector.  Is it any wonder that the INMO overwhelmingly rejected the Croke Park deal?</P>
        <P>There is great fear in Donegal South-West that the Rock Hospital in Ballyshannon, the Sheil Hospital and particularly Lifford Community Hospital face closure because they are starved of HSE funding.  I ask the Minister to oversee an injection of capital to those nursing homes and community hospitals so they can continue to provide a service.  Lifford hospital has provided a service since the 1790s.</P>
        <P>There are many thousands of excellent people working in the health service under the HSE.  They are doing their best to provide first-class health services but their hands are being tied by savage Government cutbacks and a disastrous health policy that maintains a two-tier health system.</P>
        <P>The health system must be replaced with a new system of care based on need, and need alone.  The HSE must be replaced with a network of community health partnerships, as proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The first step is to remove the totally discredited Government once and for all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister to the Chamber.  Like other Senators, I am always in admiration of her ability to speak so comprehensively on the health service without a note in hand.  I welcome the progress she has outlined.  I am very conscious that the HSE is a relatively new body for the provision of services.  It is very clear from the Minister&rsquo;s contribution this morning that there are many areas of health delivery and health provision in which the HSE has excelled.  There are areas where much work remains to be done.</P>
        <P>We will always be talking about the work that needs to be done.  It would never be acceptable for us to wake up some day and say everything is perfect.  We should always try to be a bit better and strive for even greater developments.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke a lot about good practice.  An essential component of this for any organisation is constant review and reflection.  Given the relative newness of the HSE, and bearing in mind that we are nearing the end of the term of its first CEO, Professor Brendan Drumm, are there plans to take stock of and reflect on the executive&rsquo;s experience to date and consider how this might inform future practice?</P><Col N="316"/>
        <P>I welcome the progress the Minister outlined, particularly the emphasis on education, upskilling, training and public awareness.  These are essential to the HSE&rsquo;s effectiveness and patient safety.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke very eloquently and effectively on the emphasis we are now placing on early intervention and prevention.  Sometimes the work we do on prevention can be very hard to measure and quantify.  I have no doubt that any investment in prevention will be one for the future of our health service and for our citizens, the people we represent.  Although we may never be able to quantify the impact of the investment, I am very honoured to be involved with Dr. Ken McDonald and the work he does with the Heartbeat Trust.  I can see very clearly the progress being made on early intervention, assessments associated with prevention and education.  These are having an impact on cardiac care.  Cardiac disease is one of the main killers in Ireland.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are a few issues I would like to refer to in the presence of the Minister, the first of which concerns vaccinations.  I welcome the roll-out of the cervical cancer vaccine but I am concerned about the uptake under the childhood vaccination programme.  I ask the Minister to consider launching a public-awareness campaign.  Over recent years, there was much confusion caused in the public domain over the safety implications of vaccines, particularly in respect of the MMR vaccine and its alleged links to autism.  It is really important that we send out a message today that there is no credible scientific evidence to link the MMR vaccine to autism and that there is very clear scientific evidence linking diseases such as measles, rubella and mumps to early and unnecessary death and the needless acquisition of disabilities.  In the future, Ireland will have people with acquired intellectual disabilities that could have been prevented had they not contracted one of the diseases.</P>
        <P>One of the issues we face as a consequence of there not being sufficient uptake of the vaccine is that we no longer have herd immunity in Ireland.  This has implications for every infant under 18 months.  It is not possible to administer the vaccine to those under 18 months.  If we maintain herd immunity, it will mean children under 18 months will not come into contact with those diseases.  If we do not have immunity among children over 18 months, they could unintentionally carry disease back home to an infant under 18 months.</P>
        <P>From my professional background and having kept up to date with developments, particularly studies carried out in England, I am aware all the research linking MMR to the onset of autism has now been withdrawn and is no longer credible.  However, I am not too sure the public is aware of this.  I ask the Minister to consider an awareness campaign in this regard.</P>
        <P>Concerns were raised recently in the news over developmental checks for younger children.  This is a really important part of our work in the fields of early intervention and prevention.  Developmental checks are often the first occasions on which it is noticed that things are not quite going according to plan for younger children.  The checks comprise an essential component of prevention and intervention.</P>
      
        <P>I very much welcome the fair deal.  It has given peace of mind and reassurance to people and gives equitable access to older people who seek nursing home care.  However, an issue has arisen for people who suffer the onset of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease or an age-related disorder.  The person&rsquo;s needs increase and they require a higher level of care.  Often, they must be moved to a higher support corridor or wing, but they are no longer covered by the fair deal from the moment of the transition.  That occurs in nursing homes where high support has been put in place for age-related disorders and part of the nursing home has become registered under the mental health institutions.  In one week the person is covered by the fair deal but when they are moved the following week to a different part of the nursing home they are under the mental <Col N="317"/>health section and are no longer covered.  Families will then often face bills of between &euro;1,300 and &euro;1,800 per week.</P>
        <P>I did not have a chance to speak about the protection of children, which is really important with regard to the HSE.  I would welcome another opportunity to discuss that, if possible.  I have previously sought the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee on the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  The Minister said it is really important to have inspections carried out without fear or favour, and that this is taking place at present in the mental health and elderly sectors.  It is imperative those inspections take place in residential services for children with disabilities and children who are unaccompanied minors.  We should also consider inspections in residential services for adults with intellectual disability, who are also quite vulnerable and whose residential settings might not be up to the standard we would desire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I had hoped the Minister would give her views on the way the HSE conducts its business.  My experience of the HSE matches that of many other public representatives, including Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and at least one of the party&rsquo;s former Ministers.  The executive has been described by many public representatives as a monster and a bureaucratic glutton, gobbling up much-needed funds that could be used for frontline services.  This is a cause of immense frustration to the public and the medical profession.  It also leads to inadequate care for patients.</P>
        <P>I accept that not everything that goes wrong with the HSE can be laid at the Minister&rsquo;s door, but that does not mean she can avoid accountability entirely.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach again deployed his limited liability defence regarding his responsibility for the economic crisis.  Considering the HSE&rsquo;s failings, which we hear about on an almost daily basis and which have been well outlined by Senator Fitzgerald, I hope to hear the Minster, who established it, today accept responsibility for its actions.  It appears the HSE does whatever it wants and health Ministers assume the role of its public apologists.  However, when the public wants answers from Ministers about the failings of our health service, the response is invariably: &ldquo;It was not me, it was the HSE&rdquo;.  The HSE&rsquo;s public accountability can only ever be limited.  It is not a person who stands for election and it cannot be scrutinised in Parliament or voted out of office.  Nor can its character be assessed by the electorate.</P>
        <P>A Canadian documentary made in 2003, called &ldquo;The Corporation&rdquo;, is potentially instructive.  The film examined the conduct of corporations by applying the psychiatric diagnostics used for human beings.  The diagnosis was that the firms in question behaved in the same way as a psychopath.  If the same test were applied to the HSE, I believe the diagnosis would be that the patient is a pathological liar.  Time and again the executive makes statements, either publicly or to stakeholders, that are demonstrably untrue.  It happens so frequently that it cannot be an accident or incompetence.  It is done with the deliberate intention to mislead.  This reflects poorly on the Minister&rsquo;s political integrity.</P>
        <P>Last year, the Minister told me and my fellow Oireachtas members in Tipperary South that we would be informed in advance of changes to our health service.  However, just a month later, the HSE announced it was closing St. Michael&rsquo;s acute mental health unit in Clonmel, without the advance warning the Minister promised.  The Minister did not break her word but the HSE did it for her.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on that?  What is her view on the fact the decision was made without the consultation process outlined in Vision For Change and without an option appraisal being carried out?  I assume the Minister expects best practice to be observed in the administration of the health service.  Does she stand over reconfiguration decisions in which consultation and option appraisal are not carried out?</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the decision to close St. Michael&rsquo;s was taken without reference to the line Minister.  Does she stand over this as well?  If so, how many patients does it take to screw in a <Col N="318"/>light bulb in the Minister&rsquo;s head?  The welfare of over 50 patients is at stake at St. Michael&rsquo;s, yet the Minister saw no need to be involved in the decision over their future.  Therefore, the answer is obviously not 50.  Perhaps she might let us know if it is 100 or 150 before she decides to become involved.</P>
        <P>I would also be grateful if the Minister would comment on the increase in bureaucracy since the HSE was established.  Between 1999 and 2009, there was a 67% increase in the numbers working in administration and management in the health service.  By comparison, the increase in nursing staff over the same period was 39%.  Ten years ago there were nearly three nurses for every administrator in the health service.  That ratio is now close to 2:1.  The trend looks set to worsen.  We already have an admission that there are not enough junior doctors in the system.  Would the Minister accept that there are insufficient nurses as well?</P>
        <P>The recruitment moratorium has led to the extraordinary situation in which the Minister is demanding that nurses carry out the cervical vaccination programme without any extra cost.  That means public health nurses are being taken away from their normal duties forever.  This is not like the H1N1 programme which has a prescribed lifespan.  The consequence of this decision is that thousands of babies every year will not get their developmental checks at the optimum time of nine months.  There was already an insufficient number of public health nurses to carry out this task to optimum level before the moratorium and the two vaccination programmes.</P>
        <P>I pointed out the dangers of this to Professor Drumm at the time, at a health committee meeting, and he shared my concern.  He will be returning to paediatrics in the near future and will no doubt be doubly concerned that there are now 120 public health nurse vacancies.  These have not been filled and it is having a severe impact on the delivery of primary care.  Can the Minister explain how a cervical vaccine programme, requiring the annual administration of 90,000 injections, can be run without affecting the health of babies?</P>
        <P>Many people will find it perplexing that the HSE continues to use agency nurses, who cost 50% more than temporary and permanent staff.  People could be forgiven for thinking that agency staff are hired to replace nurses on maternity, sick, compassionate or <i>force majeure </i>leave.  They would be wrong.  These nurses are rarely replaced, meaning there are fewer nurses in our system than the figures suggest.  I accept the Minister might not have the figures to hand, but I would be grateful if she could provide me with an average number for nursing staff absent from duty this year when we meet at the health committee next month.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney stated the Opposition opposes for the sake of opposing.  That could not be further from the truth.  I have experience as a nurse and midwife for over 20 years in the health service in this country and for more years in another country.  Our sources are of the highest integrity.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has frontline staff who feed information to the executive council and tell the absolute facts relating to the statistics.  The spin from the HSE totally removes them from this.  I have put questions to the Minister today and I seek answers.  In particular, I ask the Minister to update the House on exactly what will happen to the patients in St. Michael&rsquo;s unit.  When will we have an update on the reconfiguration process?  What is happening with that?</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Harney.  Health is one of the most crucial issues for everybody.  Members discuss finance, education and many other issues <Col N="319"/>a great deal but health is the bedrock of our society.  A healthy society is crucial for the well-being of our people.  I hope we will see more of the Minister and the Ministers of State in the House.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on her progress with regard to primary health care.  We can get extremely upset about the HSE.  We can shout and roar about all that is wrong with it, but the reality is to put matters right we must start somewhere.  The Minister is embarking on the adoption of what is very much a community-based approach which is the right one to adopt to health care in this country.  We see it in A Vision for Change in providing mental health services in the community and the setting up of primary care teams around the country.  Regardless of what party one is in, we should be working with the Minister to ensure the speedy roll-out of primary health care services.  Unfortunately, this means that some of the health services people know and love must move or we must make changes in certain hospitals.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for providing for a level of innovation in speech therapy services recently in Galway where she has initiated a pilot project to install a speech therapist in a school.  I hope the project will work well.  At a time when we have constant difficulties with budgets the only way we will have better health care services is by being innovative and trying innovative approaches to health care provision.  Pilot projects are important in that regard.</P>
        <P>There are so many matters I want to bring up with the Minister that I will not have time to raise them all.  To mark World AIDS Day, I want to mention a few facts.  According to the figures for 2009, there has been a 2.2% decrease in the number of new HIV cases diagnosed.  In 2009 some 395 new cases were reported, down from 404.  The total number of people infected in Ireland at the end of 2009 was 5,647.  However, 33% of all newly diagnosed cases are between the ages of 15 and 29 years.  Therefore, as well as continuing to inform people, a preventive approach to AIDS is needed.</P>
        <P>We need to place much more emphasis on health promotion.  When mayor of Galway, I had the pleasure to visit Finland where I met the Finnish health Minister.  Finland has the best health service in the world and I heard how it had managed to move from a difficult situation such as that encountered in Ireland to having the best health service in the world.  Believe it or not, it has a three-pronged approach to health care and is very much moving towards the community approach that we are trying to adopt in this country.  It is important that we look at and try to adopt best practice models.</P>
        <P>I want to mention midwife-led care services in maternity hospitals.  There is nothing more poignant than the birth of our children.  Some 70,000 children are born in Ireland every year and the number has been increasing in recent years.  The birth of children is crucial to our society and as such it is important that we get the provision of services right.  Most women who give birth do not suffer from ill health and it is important that women have as many choices as possible.  Where they opt for midwife-led care services or Domino care &mdash; where care is provided before and after the baby is born within the home or a clinic setting &mdash; or home births, this works well in many countries.  There are also potential cost savings.  I urge the Minister to adopt what is considered to be best practice throughout Europe in the area of maternity services.</P>
        <P>There has been much criticism of the HSE, rightly so in some cases.  There has also been much criticism of the health service in general.  The Taoiseach described it as Angola.  Therefore, the Minister has an impossible job.  Looking at the various things she has done, the mind boggles.  What the health service is working on is extraordinary.  I want to work with the Minister in completing the roll-out of primary health care teams to the greatest possible extent between now and the end of the Government&rsquo;s term of office.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to address the Minister directly.  As I have only two minutes in which to do so, I need to cut to the chase.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to what is probably the most intractable network, the north east, my own area, and my analysis of how the problem might be addressed by the Minister.  I have looked carefully at Parts 7 and 10 of the Health Act 2004 which describe in broad terms the relationship between the Minister and the CEO of the HSE.  It is the most important relationship in any organisation.  Although I would like to see the ministerial functions strengthened in any review of the Health Act, under Part 7, it is the function of the HSE to provide advice for the Minister on its functions at the Minister&rsquo;s request.  In that regard, I request the Minister to seek advice from the HSE on whether it considers Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital to be fit for purpose as the <i>de facto</i> regional centre which it was never intended to be.  Obviously, a decision was made about the hospital in Navan some years ago.  In fact, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is developing into a regional centre, but I do not believe it has the trust of the majority of people in the north east.  I acknowledge that the accident and emergency department is opening next week.  The facilities contained within are fantastic.  It will change people&rsquo;s experience of the accident and emergency service.  However, according to Dr. Colm Quigley who is leading the transformation programme, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is now, by an accident of history and design, the centre of services.  However, I do not think that is sufficient reason for it to be so.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to seek the advice of the HSE on whether the hospital is fit for purpose because most people do not believe it is.  I also ask her to issue a direction on foot of that advice to the effect that the transformation programme should be suspended should the hospital be found not to be fit for purpose as a regional centre.</P>
        <P>There is an opportunity, with health services on both sides of the Border strapped for funding, to provide for the cross-Border delivery of regional health services.  In the western part of Ulster the Strategic Investment Board of Northern Ireland has developed certain infrastructural projects that have cross-Border application.  We could be much more ambitious in how we deliver health services on an cross-Border basis all along the Border but, most specifically, in the north east and south Ulster region.  I would like to see the Strategic Investment Board of Northern Ireland and the HSE engaging in serious negotiations on delivery of hospital services on a cross-Border basis.</P><P Just="Left">Debate adjourned.</P>

	<P>I wish to share one minute of my time with Senator Mullen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for being here and I, too, will cut to the chase.  I am sorry for being parochial, but I must be.  Like Senator Feeney, I consider that the glass is always half-full, but the situation in the Athlone and Mullingar area services of the HSE is desperate.  Only yesterday I received a reply from a consultant whom I had asked to expedite a hip replacement operation for a 75 year old lady, as she had been waiting for two years.  He wrote to say he would if he had a bed, which he did not.</P>
        <P>I also have very serious concerns.  When our delegation met the Minister last week to discuss the moratorium on the filling of nursing posts, she stated five administration staff had to leave the service before she could employ another nurse.  Most nurses are female and will at some <Col N="321"/>point go on maternity or parental leave or retire.  As such I am concerned about how we will keep beds open in Mullingar hospital if we do not have the required number of nursing staff.  I ask the Minister to address the issue because HIQA is highlighting the serious issues with regard to agency staff.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>While the overcrowding in Mullingar hospital last year had nothing to do with junior doctors, it is a major concern for them, a point that adds weight to Senator Dearey&rsquo;s comments regarding services in Louth.  Some 4% of doctor posts in Mullingar hospital have not been filled this year.  When the junior doctors rotate on 1 July, the figure will double and we will reap the rewards of the serious understaffing.  Last Christmas, our accident and emergency department was closed because of overcrowding owing to 40 beds being removed from the system.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the constant niggling away at services in Mullingar hospital, which has won many awards.  The Minister referred to hygiene awards, but we have won them all.  She stated that hospitals would be rewarded for doing a good job.  Mullingar hospital has done an excellent job, but we are constantly being downgraded.  Our post mortem facilities were removed in recent months because we could not upgrade them to the tune of &euro;250,000.  Last week, someone told me how a relative&rsquo;s remains needed to go to Cavan for a post mortem because the services in Tullamore were full.  This is not acceptable.  We needed to fight to get a sexual assault unit for Mullingar hospital, but the possibility of moving it to Tullamore has been mooted.  Tullamore does not even have gynaecological services.  The unit is badly positioned in Mullingar hospital, there are no bathroom facilities and there is a staffing problem.  Will the Minister address this issue?</P>
        <P>We have spent much time thrashing out the serious issue of Loughloe House.  I thank the Minister for listening to us and taking the time to meet our delegation last week.  I accept her statement that fair care of the elderly was the way forward.  It is a good system, but the closure of the nursing home in Athlone has led us to realise we have no respite service.  This matter has not been addressed since our meeting one and a half weeks ago.  All of the area&rsquo;s public representatives who attended a meeting with the mid-Leinster health forum yesterday supported keeping those care homes open.  There is one in Mountmellick, Athlone, Longford and Mullingar.</P>
        <P>I examined the configuration &mdash; a word the HSE uses often &mdash; of the membership of management at Naas General Hospital yesterday.  I have never seen such a top-heavy room of managers.  They each had a role, yet nothing was being done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some 15 people will be turfed out to sterile, cold places to which they do not want to go and will be separated from their friends.  The money spent on re-accommodating them would keep them in Loughloe House until they died.  There is no compassion for them.  One old man has two dogs.  Two ladies who are best friends, talk to each other and go to mass and prayer meetings together will be separated.  It is morally wrong.  I cannot stay quiet about it, although I am sorry for labouring the point.  Of most importance is dignity and respect for the individual.  We can never lose track of this point, regardless of economies of scale.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to make this a miraculous minute.  I welcome the Minister.  It was a pleasure to listen to her, as she has a fantastic mastery of her brief.  It would be nice were more Ministers to speak in the House in such an informed and competent way without the aid of notes.  I compliment her in this regard.</P>
        <P>I will make four brief points.  First, the Minister mentioned the cardiovascular implementation plan, which is to be welcomed, but funding is the issue.  She rightly pointed out that there were 12 stroke units, but some, including the Irish Heart Foundation, would say not all of these measure up to international standards.  Some 20% of people could benefit from thrombolysis, yet only 2% get it.  The good news is that money up front in stroke prevention can prevent the outlay on nursing home care or hospital stays down the line.  The emergence of a business plan that would allow the investment needed to improve the service should be possible.</P>
        <P>Second, everyone appreciates the good work done by the hospice movement.  The Irish Hospice Foundation insists on there being greater strategising in respect of end-of-life hospital care.  When I recently attended a conference on this matter, everything from a hospital&rsquo;s layout to the question of whether there was room for the soon-to-be-bereaved to meet the soon-to-be-deceased to discuss sensitive issues was raised.  There is great potential for investment.  A die with dignity programme has been proposed by the Irish Hospice Foundation and I hope it will be given a listening ear, as it could do so much to help people in difficult and trying situations.</P>

	<P>Words fail me in trying to describe the Minister&rsquo;s eloquence.  It was a magnificent presentation and listening to her was a joy, pleasure and education.  As she knows, I have been supportive of the fair deal scheme, which has led to a dramatic change in the lives of older people who need to enter long-term care and their families.  They no longer need to worry about where they will get the money, so I compliment the Minister.</P><Col N="323"/>
        <P>To make the most of this opportunity, I wish to raise a couple of points.  I am supportive of the fantastic centres of excellence idea and free breast cancer screening, although I previously asked the Minister about when the latter would be introduced for older people.  Women over 65 years of age are seven times more likely to get breast cancer than a woman under 65 years of age.  As I mentioned yesterday, Dr. Somers recently stated that the Department of Finance says &ldquo;No&rdquo; to everything.  The majority of people in that Department are men and do not comprehend that women over 65 years of age need health care as much as women of 25 or 40 years of age.  I plead with the Minister on this important issue of the human rights of older women.</P>
        <P>Loughloe House has roused the emotions of people in the midlands.  If people in the area are strongly of the belief that it can be saved in its present form, they have a democratic right to be heeded.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, gave them a good report and a different decision was made.  It would be well worth the Minister&rsquo;s while examining that issue again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other one dear to my heart is the thalidomide issue.  I am putting my reputation on the line by saying I intend to stick with this issue until we get a fair and just solution.  The suggestion in the Minister&rsquo;s proposal about assessment of the needs of the people is very welcome but in terms of the monetary compensation, each one of the 32 survivors of thalidomide has different physical needs and we just cannot give a sum.  Each person must be assessed in terms of what he or she needs to help him or her live a normal life.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware of Maggie Smith, who is 3 foot 8 inches tall.  She has a job and works every day.  She has two children.  In terms of thalidomide, I remember it all happening and the thalidomide survivors are an inspiration to me.  It is extraordinary what they have been able to do with their lives.  I intend to stick with this issue and I will put my reputation on the line.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could examine this again.  It is critical that we do something because the State failed on that issue.  Dr. John O&rsquo;Connell stated in his autobiography that four years later he could still buy a thalidomide tablet in a hospital in Donegal.  It is frightening.  There is an obligation to do something.</P>
        <P>I have been hearing on radio programmes about child carers but it was not until yesterday that I understood that term.  As I stated at the health and children committee, 95% of people in Ireland have never heard of child carers.  There are thousands of children in this country who are looking after dysfunctional parents, grandparents and siblings.  Apparently, five year olds are looking after parents who are dysfunctional either from mental illness, alcohol abuse or whatever.  They are worrying about issues such as food and the safety of their parents or grandparents.  Apparently, there are thousands of child carers in the country between the ages of 15 and 18 years and their emotional, physical and educational needs must be met.  I asked Enda Egan, the chief executive of the Carer&rsquo;s Association, what is being done currently for child carers and to prioritise what we must do for them.  He said nothing is being done.  We must address that.  I plead with the Minister on that issue.  It is horrific to hear about child carers minding their parents.  God help them.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister.  I love listening to her speak.  She is an example to all of us.  I am aware that in terms of the Health Service Executive there is a lot to be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending.  This is my first time to be in the House when the Minister is present.  At 26 I am the youngest Member of the Seanad and I am aware the Minister was a Member in her 20s also.  I understand she was the youngest ever Member and if I have half the success in my political life that the Minister has had I will be delighted.</P>
        <P>I have six key points that I would like the Minister to address.  The first concerns the impact of the 1 July deadline on health services nationally.  The second is on the status of the transformation programmes in light of the cuts in last December&rsquo;s budget and being conscious of next December&rsquo;s budget.  Third is the reasons for her rejection of the universal health service model.  I am aware that when the Progressive Democrats Party was formed that was an area its members examined but then turned away from.  The fourth point concerns the Minister&rsquo;s update on the co-location plans.  The fifth point is on healthy eating lifestyles, which I believe must be advocated in a far more direct way, and whether the Minister has any plans in that regard.  The sixth is about delivering political accountability.  It is my belief that there is a need for the Minister for Health and Children to have more power to get and give answers to public representatives to deliver full accountability.</P>
        <P>On the first point about the status of health services post-1 July, the Minster&rsquo;s brief is possibly the most unpopular and unwanted but it is also one of the most influential and powerful.  While there is constant good and bad news on occasion, I would like to raise the issue, which has also been raised by my colleague, Senator Dearey, of Louth County Hospital in Dundalk, which according to the HSE is due to close as an acute hospital from 1 July as a result of the shortage of junior doctors.  I ask the Minister to expand on that when replying.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been talk of three particular areas being hit &mdash; anaesthetics, emergency medicine and general medicine.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on that because as we all know, people&rsquo;s greatest fears are about their health and the health service, whether it is to do with their children, parents or grandparents, and having a safe structure in place in the various regions throughout the country is of vital importance.  I hope the Minister can allay some of those fears today.</P>
        <P>My second point concerns the new emergency department opening in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  That was an ongoing issue when I was elected to the county council last June.  It was a matter of great importance.  People who have been inside the new accident and emergency department have said it is magnificent, and it is an important step for us locally.  My mother, who was a nurse in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital &mdash; she trained there in 1966 &mdash; is horrified when she hears the bad stories that come out about the hospital but it is a fine hospital.  It has a fantastic reputation both nationally and internationally and while it has taken somewhat of a battering locally, the new &euro;11.5 million emergency department will provide a great service.  The new medical assessment unit, MAU, that will also open in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital will also help alleviate pressure.  I hope that will deliver major change for the whole area.</P>
        <P>The emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital was part of the transformation, which is my second point in terms of the way the transformation programmes will be affected by the cuts in recent budgets, and especially in light of the upcoming budget.  Professor Drumm has said that a plan for a reduction in staff will not be met this year because of a slowdown in the number of retirements.</P>
        <P>On my third point, I heard the Minister say in the past in the D&aacute;il that when the Progressive Democrats were formed they were in favour of a universal health service but that she turned away from that view.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s model for a new health and health insurance system is based <Col N="325"/>on the Dutch model.  Has the Minister examined this model and those of other countries?  Were there reasons she decided not to follow them?</P>
        <P>In the last general election, different stances were taken on hospital co-location.  Some argued it was correct as a private patient should not be taking up a public bed.  Others claimed it was giving more effect to a two-tier system.  Currently, there is the perception the co-location plans are on ice.  Will the Minister elaborate on the policy&rsquo;s future?</P>
        <P>As the youngest Member of the House, I tend to be more aware of the calls for healthy lifestyles.  When I was in University College Dublin not too many years ago, healthy eating was not one of my priorities, to which many of my friends can testify.  I recall reading Alan Carr&rsquo;s book on how to stop smoking and how he got into making his own juice smoothies every morning.  Having to do something for my health, I decided to try this for a while.  Five years later, I am still making a smoothie every morning and it has transformed my health.  I no longer get the colds and flu that I used to when at school and college.</P>
        <P>The HSE says obesity costs the taxpayer &euro;1.8 billion each year.  If a certain cancer or other ailment was costing as much, there would be a clamour to take direct action and introduce a screening programme.  Instead of just putting up warning posters, we should be involved in direct preventive action against obesity such as getting schools to get their transition year students make smoothies for school consumption.  This would be much better than having school children full of Coke and Pepsi running hyper around the place.</P>
        <P>The creation of the HSE made sense, particularly with delivering best practice in one health board to all areas.  However, not everything was done right in the transition.  Up to 90% was done right but the other 10%, such as delivering more accountability to Members of the Oireachtas, was not.</P>

    <Title>Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009: Report and Final Stages</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we commence I remind Senators that they may speak only once on Report Stage, except for the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  On Report Stage each amendment must be seconded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, line 34, to delete &ldquo;3 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;12 months&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We have tabled several amendments on Report Stage.  At least two months have passed since Committee Stage and I would have expected some amendments from the Minister by now.  We are informed that amendments will be accepted in the other House.  That amounts to treating this House with contempt.  The Minister is prepared to accept and introduce amendments in the other House but not to put them before us for scrutiny.  Amendments must come back to us if they are passed in the other House, but it amounts to treating us like a rubber stamp.  It is appalling and shows contempt for the House by the Minister at a time when he is suggesting reform of this House.  Regardless, he treats the House in such a manner.  This view was expressed by several colleagues from the Minister&rsquo;s side of the House on the Order of Business this morning and it is a matter on which we take a strong view.</P>
        <P>I refer to amendment No. 1, which deals with the lead-in time for the regulations under discussion.  On Committee Stage, we made the point that we appreciate the fact that a lead-in time is being provided for.  However, three months is an insufficient lead-in time to put through <Col N="326"/>the regulations because people may have to alter buildings or get planning permission to carry out work to comply with the regulations.</P>
        <P>As the Minister is aware, planning permission can take a good deal more than three months.  We are not being unreasonable in any way to call for this to be extended to a period of 12 months.  Many family farms breed dogs and perhaps the buildings and outhouses are not what they should be.  Such buildings would have to be brought up to standard and it is possible planning permission would have to be secured for any necessary alterations.  I appeal to the Minister to show some respect for the House and to accept some of the amendments tabled.  We have only tabled four amendments, all of which are reasonable and none of which are too controversial.  However, I believe they will improve the Bill.  I call on the Minister to give due consideration to this and I trust he will not tell me that he will consider the amendment when it goes before the other House.  Let us deal with the amendments before us in this House.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I apologise for being somewhat late.  I arrived at the tail end of Senator Cummins&rsquo;s contribution and I was taken by his comments about the need to respect this House.  The Minister has been present in the House for most of the debate, for which I give him credit.  We have had a comprehensive, wide-ranging, engaging and constructive debate.  Obviously, there will always be a difficulty in accepting amendments from the Opposition, but progress has been made and the Bill is getting a good airing.  However, it is disappointing that the finished product in Seanad &Eacute;ireann will inevitably be subject to change in the other House.  It is also disappointing that decisions have been made to table amendments in the other House.  We would be obliged if the Minister clarified his intentions in that regard.  It would have been preferable if substantive, or even minor, changes which the Minister, his departmental officials and Cabinet colleagues have agreed had been introduced in this House.</P>
        <P>This is a modest proposal.  As Senator Cummins outlined, it is one the Minister should be in a position to accept, as a sign of the willingness of all Members of the Oireachtas to put through legislation over which they can stand.  This is one of the more minor amendments tabled on Committee and Report Stages and I hope the Minister will give it some consideration.</P>

	<P Just="Left">By way of introduction, I inform the House that my Department has engaged with the stakeholders with a view to addressing any fears various interest groups might have about the proposed legislation.  Many of these fears were highlighted by Senators on Committee Stage, including concerns about inspections, the financial implications, breeding limitations, micro-chipping and the overall effect of implementation of the legislation.  Senior officials from the Department have met the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club on a number of occasions, with Dogs Trust and the Irish Kennel Club.  This active engagement has resulted in amendments which I will signal today, as requested by Senator Bradford, as well as by Senator Glynn, to whom I spoke before coming into the House.  The amendments will successfully allay many of the legitimate concerns of the Irish Greyhound Board, in particular.  This process has taken considerable time to complete and is not without controversy.  We have been working on the amendments and trying to do our very best to safeguard the interests of the stakeholder groups and ensure we do not veer too much that we somehow undermine the welfare considerations.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator who talked about a lack of respect.  I have the highest respect for this House.  His party leader called for its abolition, but I have never gone that far.  If the Senator wants to talk about a lack of respect for this House, he should use other examples, not me.</P>

	<P>I will not interrupt the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am confident that the Bill, as amended, will safeguard the welfare of dogs in breeding establishments and ensure a thriving greyhound industry leading to the creation of employment by enhancing standards and the reputation of dog breeding in Ireland.  The amendments will be subject to further advice from the Parliamentary Counsel and represent significant concessions to respond to the needs of stakeholders.  To allow further time to iron out the technicalities behind some of them, they will be tabled on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and will have to be brought to the Seanad.  </P>
        <P>Concerns about inspection were raised by many Senators.  The Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club have raised concerns regarding the scope for abusing the inspection process.  To allay these concerns, I propose to provide a facility, whereby representatives of the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club will accompany local authority veterinary inspectors on visits.  I also propose to restrict the personnel authorised to issue an improvement order to local authority veterinary inspectors.  The proposed amendment will allow a qualified veterinary practitioner-stipendiary steward from the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club to accompany a local authority veterinary inspector on an inspection of a greyhound breeding establishment, stipulate that a local authority veterinary inspector is also an authorised person under section 16 and insert a provision under which only a local authority veterinary inspector will be able to issue an improvement order.</P>
        <P>Concerns have been raised about the potential for animal welfare bodies to issue improvement orders.  There are up to 45 veterinary inspectors employed by the local authorities; there is at least one in every local authority.  My Department has full confidence in the existing local authority dog warden and veterinary structures.  Nonetheless, I propose to specify the local authority veterinary inspector as a category of authorised person and restrict the issuance of improvement orders to veterinary inspectors to ameliorate the concerns raised.</P>
        <P>I refer to financial concerns.  The Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club have raised concerns regarding the financial burden which registration fees place on greyhound breeders and trainers.  I note that the fees are modest in the context of an industry which the Irish Greyhound Board estimates is worth approximately &euro;500 million annually.  I also note that the bulk of fees currently payable by greyhound breeders and trainers are to the Irish Greyhound Board and that they relate mainly to recording pedigree rather than welfare issues.  Notwithstanding this, I propose to make provisions for IGB breeders to be exempt from the fees associated with the dog licensing process to offset any financial burden they might experience as a consequence of the introduction of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Under the 1986 Control of Dogs Act, as amended, a person with numerous dogs can choose to purchase a general dog licence from the local authority.  It is proposed to provide that a registered dog breeding establishment be exempt from the fees associated with the general dog licence but not from the licensing process.  Given that the general licence fee is scheduled to increase to &euro;400 and that the registration fee for a dog breeding establishment of six to 12 bitches is &euro;400, I consider that this provision will go a long way towards offsetting any financial burden which breeders might experience.  The proposed amendment will roughly state a regis<Col N="328"/>tered dog breeding establishment will be exempt from the fees associated with the general dog licence but not from the licensing process.</P>
        <P>I propose to make provision for IGB trainers to be exempt from the fees associated with registration.  This exemption will apply to IGB registered trainers with more than six bitches on the premises.  To claim the exemption, the trainer and the Irish Greyhound Board will have to certify that the trainer does not actually breed the dogs.  This is a significant concession in that it will save an eligible greyhound trainer a minimum of &euro;400 a year in registration fees.  It will save him or her considerably more if his or her establishment has more than 12 bitches.  The amendment will provide for the exemption of IGB registered trainers from the fees associated with the registration process.  This mirrors the hunt club exemption.</P>
        <P>I refer to concerns about breeding.  The Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club have raised concerns that the legislation, as it stands, is excessively restrictive in regard to dog breeding cycles.  To address this concern, I am changing the provision in respect of breeding frequency from one litter every 12 months to three litters in any three year period.  This will address concerns about situations where a bitch might not fall pregnant in a 12 month period.  It will provide for three litters in a three year period, subject to veterinary advice providing that the provision in respect of a maximum of six litters during the lifetime of a bitch is retained.</P>
        <P>I also propose making a minor modification to the definition of &ldquo;dog breeding establishment&rdquo;.  The amendment of the duration to six months will allow further time for the owners of a newborn litter of pups to decide if they want to sell or retain them.  Heretofore, when the pups reached the age of four months and were capable of breeding, each bitch pup was reckonable for registration purposes.  The amendment extends this period to six months as follows: &ldquo;Alter the definition of breeding establishment to extend the four-month age threshold to six months&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I refer to microchipping, an issue that has been raised in my engagement with many Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and the Senators opposite.  Stakeholders have raised concerns about the microchipping process.  To accommodate these concerns, I will extend the deadline for microchipping pups from the current provision of eight weeks to 12 weeks as follows: &ldquo;Change the previously signalled requirement of microchipping of all dogs on the premises from eight weeks to 12 weeks old&rdquo;.  It is essential from an animal welfare perspective that we have full traceability.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the above provisions, the Irish Greyhoud Board and the Irish Coursing Club continue to raise concerns about the potential harm the Bill might cause to their industry.  To further allay their concerns in this regard, I propose to introduce a review clause in the legislation to examine its impact on the greyhound industry 12 months after the legislation has commenced.  The amendment will be along the following lines: &ldquo;Insert a provision that the legislation be reviewed after 12 months with a view to assessing its impact on the effective functioning of the greyhound industry&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I propose to incorporate these amendments in the Bill for consideration by the D&aacute;il, as some of them will require detailed drafting and further consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel.  That has been a difficulty, as has the engagement with stakeholders which took place as late as this morning.  The legislation is not without controversy and complexity.  I consider this suite of amendments to represent a significant concession to industry stakeholders and that they address most of the concerns raised on Committee Stage by Senators.  I hope they fully illustrate that I am happy to work with stakeholders to ensure the Bill will safeguard the industry and the welfare of dogs in breeding establishments.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to introducing amendments in the D&aacute;il.</P><Col N="329"/>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 1, a similar amendment was debated on Committee Stage which proposed a 12-month lead-in period.  I thought this was excessive, given the length of the deliberative process to date.  However, in a spirit of compromise and to give sufficient time for dog breeders and local authorities to familiarise themselves with the legislation, I will table an amendment to provide for a six-month period for breeders to be registered.  I am seeking to ensure a smooth transition to full registration, while also keeping the period allowed for registration meaningful.  Therefore, it should be remembered that the period will commence on the date of enactment of the legislation.  Those affected know we have been debating this legislation for some time.  The lead-in period will be significant.  Judging by the volume of representations received by my Department, few dog breeders are not aware of the Bill and its proposed requirements.  People know this legislation is being introduced and nobody can plead ignorance.  In a spirit of compromise, I will table this amendment and hope Senators understand it is a significant concession which should go a long way towards meeting their concerns.</P>

	<P>I find the procedure the Minister is going through extraordinary.  In response to our amendment he said he was prepared to provide for a six-month lead-in period, but why is the Government amendment not before us?  The procedure is that the Minister should table an amendment outlining that he accepts a six-month provision.  I appreciate he has gone some of the way, but the procedure he has adopted is extraordinary.  He has made a speech which has not been circulated to Members on what he will introduce in the D&aacute;il and given us the wording of the amendments.</P>

	<P>Why make reference to the amendments on Report Stage when they are not ready?  Why tell us what the Minister will do in the D&aacute;il?  He should use the House properly and debate the amendments using the appropriate procedure.  I accept he will provide for a six-month lead-in period rather than three months, but the procedure should be to table an amendment to that effect which we cannot accept because it is going to be introduced in the other House.  It should be tabled in this House.  The Cathaoirleach cannot accept the amendment, unless it is before us.  It is extraordinary that the Minister can talk about an amendment to extend the lead-in time to six months, on which I compliment him, without putting it before us.  The procedure he is following is unprecedented.  He is referring to the tabling of amendments in the other House and we are expected to digest what he said without reference to a script.  He cannot do this.  He can say he will accept the extension to six months, but that cannot be accepted by the Cathaoirleach.  The procedure the Minister has adopted shows contempt for the House, whether he believes this, because he is telling us what he will do in the other House without tabling proper amendments here.</P>

While the Minister has indicated he is unable to agree to this, he is prepared to extend the duration to six months when the Bill is taken in the other House.  The Bill will have to come back to this House.  The Minister is not prepared to accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, but he is prepared to compromise in the other House.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This is a technical amendment that we also tabled on Committee Stage seeking provision for the payment of charges under the Bill to be made by electronic means.  Many local authorities accept payments by electronic payments for their services.  There is much discussion about the smart economy and so on.  This should be the case in all local authorities.

	<P>I certainly accept the sentiments behind the amendment and agree that we require greater efficiency at local authority level.  That is why I have set up a local authority efficiency review group chaired by Mr. Pat McLoughlin, and it is to report shortly.  However, at this time to be proscriptive and tell each local authority how to do its business in this regard is not something I envisage in this legislation.  I have indicated this previously when we discussed this matter.</P>
        <P>In the context of the efficiency group review we will, I believe, be looking at each local authority to see how they can collect money in a more efficient manner.  In the context of this legislation, however, I do not believe this amendment is appropriate.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) the operator of the establishment is registered through the Irish Coursing Club,&rdquo;.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0">This is an area we spent a long time debating on Committee Stage in particular, namely, that the operator of the establishment is registered through the Irish Coursing Club.  The Minister has said he has been in contact with the Irish Greyhound Board, the Irish Coursing Club and so on and he is proposing some amendments.  However, I have correspondence from the Irish Greyhound Board, and I would like to read some of it into the record of the House.  The board says there are severe implications for the Irish greyhound industry if the Bill is passed in its present form, and I suggest this is true, even with the Minister&rsquo;s proposed amendments, from my understanding of what he said.  The board wanted to make it clear that the regulation and management of the greyhound industry was already fully legislated for under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.  That is something my colleague, Senator Coffey, stated categorically on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.  He was told it does not regulate the industry and the board did not have the powers.  He produced the 1958 Act and read out what it covered, to the amazement of the Minister.  The Irish Greyhound Board said:</P>
        <P LI="1">We have secured legal advice that shows that under the 1958 Greyhound Industry Act we can visit and inspect any establishment where greyhounds are kept.  This conflicts with the <Col N="331"/>uninformed correspondence which stated inaccurate and misleading information with regard to our right to inspect.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P FLI="0">It was suggested the board did not have a right to inspect.  The letter continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">The legal position was bolstered in May 2010 by a High Court ruling which upheld without reservation the right of officers authorised by the Irish Greyhound Board to visit and inspect any premises at which greyhounds are kept.  Furthermore, our legal advice indicates that the 1958 Act can be easily amended by way of a suitable regulation, so as to confer legal power on the Irish Greyhound Board to support the welfare and proper treatment of greyhounds by enforcing legal sanction on our findings.  Accordingly, this removes one of the main concerns which officials suggested, at lessening the validity of the 1958 legislation in the context of the proposed Bill.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a clear and efficient path to a workable solution to the present concerns of the Irish Greyhound Board as regards the current dog breeding Bill.  The proposed amendments by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government simply do not address the genuine fears of the greyhound industry.  The measures that are being introduced for other breeds have been in place for greyhounds since 1958, and their record is excellent.</P>
        <P>The board is now being asked to submit dual registration and accept double inspection systems.  This suggests the industry will be saddled with unworkable definitions pertaining to the greyhound breeding cycle, because it does not want to see the proposed legislation amended for greyhounds.  The Minister should have amended the legislation pertaining to greyhounds under the 1958 Act or introduced regulations under that legislation rather than bringing the question of the control of greyhounds into the dog breeding Bill.  We made that suggestion to him on Committee Stage, but obviously even with some of the sensible amendments he proposes to table in the other House, these will not be sufficient to assist the Irish Greyhound Board.  The proposals the board suggests would be a proper compromise, that is, to amend the 1958 Act and give the board the powers that are necessary.</P>
        <P>Like all of us, the Irish Greyhound Board recognises the benefits of legislation to outlaw puppy farming.  However, it cannot allow the illogical and misguided extension of legislation effectively to destroy the Irish greyhound industry.  It argues that it is a well run industry, driven by continuous improvements in welfare standards and populated by people who care deeply about the animals in their care.  I was the first Member of this House, about six years ago, to talk about regulating puppy firms.  I said this on Second Stage, and it was confirmed at the time.  I firmly believe we should root out those rogue operators.  If I had known this type of legislation was being introduced to regulate the greyhound industry and that it would go way beyond the legislation that was anticipated as necessary and which would have been very positively received on this side of the House, I would have seen it as a retrograde step with severe repercussions for the Irish greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>We shall certainly be pressing this amendment.  The future of the Irish greyhound industry is at stake.  This is an industry that gives great employment, enormous enjoyment and has some wonderful people involved in it, both in breeding and every other aspect.  What the Minister is proposing will have severe repercussions on that, and I ask him to consider matters further.  We have partly grasped what he intends to achieve with the amendments he proposes to table in the other House, and I hope they will be sufficient to satisfy the needs of the Irish greyhound industry, which has been one of the major success stories in the whole area of sport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally second the amendment. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the principle of what my colleague, Senator Maurice Cummins, said.  He has pointed out that this is a very valuable industry.  He has also pointed <Col N="332"/>out that the Irish Greyhound Board is somewhat concerned about the Bill.  I want to place on record also my concern over the most unusual situation, where we are being asked by the Minister, in effect, to take a leap of faith that amendments may be introduced in the other House and brought back here for us to rubber-stamp in two or three weeks or whenever the Bill returns.  Some weeks ago, I wrote to my whip stating I could not accept the Bill in its current form.  While Members are being asked today to accept the Bill in its current form, subject to possible amendments in the D&aacute;il, this position is untenable to me.  Obviously, I support the Minister and I spoke on Second Stage to the effect that the entire purpose and tenet of the Bill was to outlaw puppy farms and so on.  However, the net has been spread far and wide and is affecting many people.  Lest anyone think that I am a greyhound owner or breeder, I have only been at Cork greyhound track thrice in my life.  I am a rural life enthusiast and although I know some people in gun clubs and so on, I am not one of those who takes an extreme right position.  I have been highly objective in respect of this Bill but am deeply concerned that the manner in which the Bill is being dealt with in this House is most unorthodox.  It is disingenuous for Members, especially those on the Government side of the House, to be expected to vote down amendments today that may be dealt with favourably in the other House, only to return here in two, three or four weeks&rsquo; time or whenever, to rubber-stamp and endorse them.  Although I have the utmost respect for the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s position, I find this difficult to tolerate or stomach.  Basically, I consider it to be demeaning to this House and it should be unacceptable.  While many aspects of this House may have caused unnecessary public opprobrium abroad as to how matters are conducted here, with all due respect the Minister has merely brought to the House the foundation of some of the wording of possible amendments.  Such amendments should have been tabled before Members today, after which a more robust debate at this late stage could have taken place.</P>
        <P>With all due respect, the Bill has been parked for two months or a little more.  I acknowledge the Minister has been working in good faith with the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, and others to ascertain whether a favourable conclusion can be reached.  However, this puts me in a most invidious position on a point of principle, as does my belief that, to use fishing parlance, the net and trawl being thrown out by the Minister is far too wide.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator Cummins&rsquo;s contention that the 1958 Act could easily have been revisited.  There is over-regulation within the fishing industry that has driven many people from that industry.  Members are now witnessing over-regulation in the greyhound industry at the coursing level or otherwise.  I must confess that I have never attended a coursing meeting in my life.  The amendment tabled by Fine Gael seeks to address such over-regulation.  I also acknowledge the significant work carried out on this issue by Senator Coffey.  Having listened to him throughout the debates in this Chamber, it is obvious that he knows his stuff.  This over-regulation will damage the greyhound industry and will drive out the small operators.</P>
        <P>These concerns are deeply held and while it is not usual for me to support points being made, I have grave concerns and am greatly troubled about a number of issues in this regard.  Although it is not an easy matter to me to take a stand that might put me in a difficult position, I certainly have highlighted and flagged my grave concerns regarding the Bill&rsquo;s direction.  It is inappropriate for Members to be parked up a sideline and to be told that the Upper House is not capable of handling such amendments.  If it is a time issue, it can wait for a week or ten days.  The amendments should be tabled before this House, rather than obliging Members to come back to rubber-stamp the Bill at a time when it is most likely the D&aacute;il will be in recess.  Members will run into a cul-de-sac and with all due respect, the Minister could run foul of technical issues in this Bill and I am concerned that this is the wrong way to go about it.</P>

	<P>I have received a single telephone call on this matter and for an industry that supposedly is being brought to its knees, that is an extraordinarily low level of lobbying and if that is the case, it shows an extraordinary degree of complacency.  It leads me to conclude that Senator Cummins&rsquo;s comments are grossly exaggerated.</P>

	<P>Please, no interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The principle of being self-financed stands other sectors in good stead.  In the sector in which I work, I must contribute to my own regulation.  That is the way it is across the board and the costs are not excessive.  This measure will improve the overall standing of the industry in the eyes of the public and of the market abroad, where the Irish puppy breeding industry does not enjoy a good reputation.  On the contrary, I have seen some highly distressing articles that do Ireland&rsquo;s good name and the quality of our exports generally no good whatsoever.  Consequently, I believe the regulation is proportionate.  I acknowledge it will impose a certain level of costs and incidentally, the person who lobbied me did so on a competitiveness, rather than on a welfare issue.  However, gains that will outweigh such relatively low costs will come through and the sector will enjoy a better guaranteed Irish branding.  This will improve the ability of the greyhound sector and the puppy industry in general to find new markets.  Those who purchase from this sector will be able to do so with the confidence that animal welfare and regulation in general are being upheld to the highest standards in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I urge Members to desist from hyperbole and bogus arguments and to stick to the facts.  The greyhound sector must be part of an overall Dog Breeding Establishments Bill as to leave it out would be ludicrous and would lead to a gradual erosion of its integrity over time.  I entirely support the proposals and commend the Minister on the amendments he has accepted.  He has taken on board the views of this House and Members ought to recognise that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have explained in detail the genesis of the amendments, how I have engaged with the specific stakeholders and the amendments&rsquo; complexity.  I will state to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan that I also wrote to the Taoiseach and that he must accept my bona fides on this matter.  I do not write to the Taoiseach lightly on such issues but I did so because this spells out in detail exactly what I had in mind.  I was very clear with him and likewise am very clear with Members of this House.  I wish to state absolutely that there is no threat whatsoever to the Irish greyhound industry.  As my colleague, Senator Dearey, has just noted, the use of phrases such as &ldquo;The greyhound industry is being destroyed&rdquo; is an exaggeration.  Not only will it not be destroyed, it will not be undermined in any way.</P>
        <P>Although I am convinced of this, to make absolutely sure I intend to insert an amendment into this legislation that will result in a review after 12 months and should there be any undermining of this important industry, that issue will be addressed.  My Department has <Col N="334"/>included measure after measure.  Moreover, in consultation with the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club, I outlined that I would be willing to provide exemptions from the registration fee to trainers of greyhounds on the basis of assurances by the board and the club that training greyhounds was a specialised practice and that trainers do not actually breed greyhounds.  We had a long discussion on that matter.  In addition, I am anxious to minimise any financial burden on the greyhound industry and will, as previously mentioned, provide exemptions to registered dog breeding establishments from the general dog licence fee, thereby making a saving of approximately &euro;400 per establishment.  All of this has been done.</P>
        <P>As for the question regarding the Act of 1958, which has been raised, my legal advice is that the welfare regulations relating to the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 are considered to be <i>ultra vires</i> and as such are not supported by the primary legislation of the 1958 Act.  The Irish Greyhound Board has acknowledged this fact.  These are the facts as I know them and as the Minister responsible in this area, I therefore have concluded that all breeds of dog must be addressed through the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 and not through any other legislation.  I am not in a position to make exemptions for certain breeds of dog, be they hunting dogs or greyhounds.  Senator Cummins is aware that representations have been made on both categories of dog.  I emphasise that no damage will be done to the greyhound industry.  A campaign is taking place throughout the country.  I understand the political imperatives when people believe they are being subjected to significant pressure.  It is completely unprecedented.  I cannot believe it when I see such campaigns being mounted, as there is nothing surer than that they are based on misinformation.  There is an idea that somehow we are undermining a rural way of life and that first greyhounds will be outlawed, followed by shooting and angling.  I have heard all the arguments, but none of them stacks up.  None of the arguments about the potential damage that it is claimed will be inflicted on the greyhound industry stands up.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan might not have been present when I outlined the amendments.  They are the same amendments I outlined to the Taoiseach and will be introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is not disrespectful in any way to Members of this House.  Quite simply, it is due to time constraints and the complexity of the issue which requires the input of the Parliamentary Counsel.  This militated against us in introducing the amendments in this House, but as the Senator knows only too well, they must be endorsed by this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been accused of using hyperbole, but I was quoting from a letter from the chief executive officer of the Irish Greyhound Board.  He said the illogical and misguided extension of the legislation would effectively destroy the greyhound industry.  They are not my words and I am not using hyperbole.  They are the words of the chief executive of the Irish Greyhound Board and I suggest he knows more about the industry than the Minister, even with the vast amount of knowledge he may possess about dogs.</P>
        <P>I compliment my friend and colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, on outlining the difficulties he faces.  They are as I outlined in addressing the first amendment.  We are being used as a rubber stamp and the House is being treated with contempt.  We have told about the amendments being introduced in the other House.  There is no question that they should have been introduced in this House, as this is the place to introduce amendments and to allow a proper debate on them.</P><Col N="335"/>
        <P>I do not accept what the Minister has alleged about misinformation.  Much information emerged on Second and Committee Stages that I suggest informed the Minister and his officials of the actual position in the greyhound industry and about hunting and all other breeds of dog.  It has been an education for me and other Members of the House also.  It has certainly been an education for the Minister because he showed a complete lack of information on the 1958 Act when it was originally raised.  We will be pressing the amendment which is not based on misinformation.  It is based on the best information we have available from the chief executive of the Irish Greyhound Board.  We are relaying the genuine fears of that body which are held not alone by the board but also by those involved in the greyhound industry throughout the length and breadth of the country.  They are right to have fears.</P>
        <P>Senator Dearey said he had received one representation on the matter.  I am surprised he even received one because his party was introducing the Bill.</P>

	<P>This is absolutely crazy.  It shows a disregard for and a complete lack of knowledge about the breeding of dogs.  As we said on Committee Stage, to suggest that a person would breed a dog at four months and that they be included under this Bill, really sums up what the Green Party knows about any animal and certainly about the breeding cycle of greyhounds, in particular.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe the Bill makes it mandatory for dogs to breed at four months.  The Senator is being disingenuous.  Changing it to two years is quite ridiculous.  Obviously, a dog can breed within that period of time.  I accept the Senator&rsquo;s point regarding four months but with regard to a dog being forced to breed within four months, that is not stated in the Bill so please do not misrepresent it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is not four months, why did the Minister not change it?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally second the amendment.  Whoever drafted this Bill obviously did not do first year in veterinary medicine in college or failed it or first year in agricultural science, nor were they ever involved with farming or dog breeding.  In fact, as I said privately to my colleague, Senator Wilson, earlier, they are barking mad.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I would suggest the same, but in reverse.</P>
        <P>Whoever proposed this is barking mad.  It is ludicrous and shows a lack of knowledge of the industry and of reality.  While I accept the point that the Bill might not necessarily be enforcing breeding at four months, the fact it is suggested that bitches would be breeding and encouraged to breed at four months is bizarre.  I presume good sense will prevail and that the Minister will announce his acceptance of the amendment.  Anything else does not bear contemplation.</P>

	<P>Not only did the people on the working group do first year in veterinary medicine, they were veterinary experts.  That is the reason they were in the working group in the first place.  The amendment would have the effect of not including any bitch less than two years old.  That is the key issue.  It is fairly incredible that the Senators could envisage a Bill to regulate puppy farms which would exclude breeding bitches under two years of age.  The proposed amendment would, in fact, legalise the abuse of dogs.  It would incentivise breeders to breed bitches as early and as often as possible before the dog reaches two years of age.  That is a fact.</P>
        <P>I signalled on Committee Stage that I would be willing to change the definition to six months.  That will allow further time for owners of a newborn litter of pups to decide whether to sell or retain the pups.  Heretofore, once the pups reached four months in age and were capable of breeding, each bitch pup would have been reckonable for registration purposes.  My amendment will effectively extend the period to six months.  I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister is prepared to extend it to six months.  I do not believe six months is sufficient.  Again, no breeder I know would breed a bitch at six months.  It would be cruel to start breeding bitches at six months of age.  The two years I have suggested might be excessive.  We had intended to make it one year.  If the Minister were prepared to set the period at one year, it would be acceptable.  He has suggested that the four months is not right and that he will amend it in the Lower House.  That bears testimony to the fact that he got it wrong in the first place.  Four months is ludicrous and this is the Bill on which we are voting.  While the Minister has taken a small step by intending to increase it, there is no evidence of it before this House.  There is no amendment to that effect, which is what we would have expected.</P>
        <P>We cannot agree with what the Minister has said.  He intends to go a small bit further but it is not sufficient.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann has no confidence in the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Moving a motion of no confidence in a member of the Government in the Seanad is not a decision I, or Fine Gael, take lightly.  Such confidence motions are rare in this House.  However, even more rare is the publication of independent reports into a banking crisis which point the finger of blame squarely and largely at the door of the current Taoiseach during his time as Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, is it appropriate this debate should take place at this awkward time for the Fine Gael Party?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.  This was agreed on the Order of Business this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The two banking reports published in recent weeks shatter the myths, illusions and spin which the Government has tried to force on the people.  The words &ldquo;I am sorry&rdquo; were slow to come from the Taoiseach with him instead preferring to hide behind another two words, &ldquo;Lehman Brothers&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Now the jury has returned, however, and the independent verdicts are in with a clear result.  The reports stated this economic crisis was home-grown, nurtured by policies and a culture presided over by the Taoiseach Brian Cowen and his predecessor, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  The reports also pointed to the blind-eye turned to warnings and sound economic advice.  Anybody who dared to disagree or express concern was dismissed as a naysayer and even told by the former Taoiseach to go and commit suicide.</P>
        <P>The message that rings out clearly from the two reports published by Patrick Honohan and Klaus Regling and Max Watson is that the people have been spectacularly failed by an economic and financial system with the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, at its apex.</P>
        <P>No one can have confidence in his stewardship of the economy.  His failures were directly based on decisions he made and through the regulatory and banking systems he oversaw.  These failures have caused misery for thousands and replaced hope with despair for an entire generation.  Whoever thought we would return to the days of 60,000 people leaving our shores last year as they saw the country no longer able to protect their well-being or foster their ambitions?  Up to 40,000 more people are due to join them this year.</P>
        <P>For those who remain, lengthy dole queues ensue with 439,100 men and women unemployed but still no details of a jobs plan from the very Government that did not know how to manage the economy and now is overwhelmed trying to cope with the recession.</P>
        <P>Deputy Brian Cowen, when Minister for Finance, talked about a soft landing for the economy.  When the economy collapsed, he adopted the mantra of it not being his fault.  He was wrong not to accept responsibility.</P>
        <P>There had been warnings that a crisis was looming.  A long list of individuals and organisations warned that all was not well, that Government policy was unsustainable and that Fianna <Col N="340"/>F&aacute;il was overheating the economy.  Patrick Honohan, now Governor of the Central Bank, economist John FitzGerald, various economic commentaries, the ESRI, the IMF, the OECD and the Fine Gael Party all warned of these developments in the economy.</P>
        <P>The ESRI repeatedly warned of problems.  In 2001 it warned about the need to use fiscal policy to prevent property market bubbles.  In 2003, its medium term review expressed concern about unduly expansionary fiscal policy, specifically the failure to control the housing market, surmising the economy was flying too close to the sun.  In 2005 the authors went on to simulate the economic effects of a 30% fall in house prices.  These warnings were, in turn, ignored, dismissed and even sneered at.  Patrick Honohan warned of unmistakable signs of overheating in 2002.  In 2005, he warned that the housing and property sectors could have destabilising effects because of the way they were operating at that time.  The criticisms, advice and red-light warnings were there for all to see but the Department of Finance and the Government appeared blinkered.  I call on the Minister to comment on the points which Michael Somers made at the weekend in respect to the lack of good advice.  Yesterday morning, Senator Boyle commented on this matter as well.  I refer to comments from recent days in respect of the Department of Finance and its response at the time.  Yesterday in <i>The Irish Times</i>, reference was made to poor advice from Department of Finance, which is extraordinary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We offered many warnings.  It is wrong to say Fine Gael did not point out what was happening.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Consistently, we warned that Government economic policy was overheating the economy and undermining the Celtic tiger.  Like all others, our warnings were ignored.  I wish to put some of these warnings on the record of the House.  In 2002 we stated: &ldquo;It suits members of the Government to say it is the global economy rather than their own appalling and inept mismanagement that is the cause of this&rdquo;.  On 3 December 2003, Fine Gael stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The sad reality is we are experiencing the legacy of the &lsquo;get out and party&rsquo; years.  Never did a Government spend so much to achieve so little.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In 2005, we warned, &ldquo;Not only did Government spend money recklessly, particularly in the run-up to the previous general election, it also allowed proper controls and performance systems to rust over&rdquo;.  When one reads the two reports published this week, this is precisely what is spelt out about the absolute failure of the economic, fiscal and financial policies of the Government.  After the 2008 budget, Fine Gael stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Minister talks smugly of a timely housing correction.  The Government presides over a dysfunctional housing market.  Change in the way taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent is already long overdue.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These words and many more are on the record of the D&aacute;il and this House for all to see.  As the reports of last week stated, the Government cannot blame Lehman Brothers, a lack of economic warning or the Opposition.  The blame rests with those in charge, those who made decisions and those in control of economic banking and regulatory policies.  The reports outline an examination of each of these areas and in each case there are significant and serious failings which have had an extraordinary impact on the lives of this generation of Irish women, men and children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The two reports vindicate the charges made.  The reports clearly show the Government played a central role in causing the crisis.  This is denied again and again but it is clear that its role was central.  The misjudgments by the current Taoiseach were at the heart of the problem. <Col N="341"/> These reports demolish all his excuses and the guilt is plain to see.  It is a very serious and comprehensive rebuttal of the policies of his Government and his time as Minister for Finance.  On page ten of his report, Mr. Honohan notes, &ldquo;More generally, a rather defensive approach was adopted to external critics or contrarians&rdquo;.  On page 16 he notes that:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">... the weaknesses of Irish banks were not caused by the interruption in the flow of cheap money from abroad.  Even before the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, Irish residential property prices had been falling for more than 18 months and few observers expected their fall to end soon.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He found that the failure of Lehman&rsquo;s was not decisive and he outlines that:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">... a soft landing was not based on any quantitative calculations or analysis.  This appears to have been a triumph of hope over reality.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He goes on to outline how Government policy played a central role in contributing to the crisis and outlines the negative impact of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s budgetary policies as Minister for Finance.  They have had the most extraordinary impact on the lives of ordinary people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As everyone in the House is aware, people are hurting due to these inaccuracies, errors and failures.  Everyone has paid a price for these failures of the Taoiseach.  That is to say, everyone except the Taoiseach.  Hospital beds have been closed.  People&rsquo;s sons and daughters have been forced to emigrate.  Special needs education has been cut left, right and centre and social welfare recipients have been penalised.  However, the Taoiseach continues in office.  He has not faced up to the serious impact that his decisions have had on the lives of Irish men, women and children.  He has led us into this crisis.  It is clear that far more will come out about our banking crisis.  For example, it is clear the reports have not examined the NAMA decision.  They have not examined the capitalisation of the banks.  There is a cut-off date which does not include the guarantee scheme.  At this point, we do not know the full story of the range of decisions for which this Taoiseach was responsible and which have led us into our current position.  We lack confidence in him and I move the motion which Fine Gael has tabled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.  Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in remarked that this motion is somehow irrelevant.  In one month&rsquo;s time the concerns of what is happening within our political party will be old news.  However, the effects of what has happened to our economy are being felt severely and will continue to be felt quite dramatically.  Whatever about members of the Green Party, members of Fianna F&aacute;il understand this is having a very significant effect on their support among the public.  The former Minister for Finance and current Taoiseach has been very slow to admit to his mistakes and to what went wrong with our economy.  To an extent, as Minister for Finance he was like someone who set the house on fire.  When he became Taoiseach, he waited for the fire to take hold before he started to put it out.  Now he wants a medal for doing so.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, Government policy had a significant role in causing the problems we face today.  The economy has been stressed beyond belief.  The bailouts to the banks are the equivalent of what it costs to run two Departments, namely, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Anglo Irish Bank presented at committee today and thanked us for the &euro;15 billion it received but proposed that it might need a further &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion.  Figures such as &euro;24 billion are tripping off bankers&rsquo; tongues as if they were chicken feed, but they are not.  They are unbelievable sums of money.  The Government will only bring in &euro;32 billion in taxes this year.  However, one bank is already <Col N="342"/>looking for &euro;24 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money in a bailout.  This is on top of the 450,000 unemployed.  Many people&rsquo;s lives have been ruined.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Let us consider how our economy was deconstructed by Government policy.  The first phase of deconstruction involved the construction sector.  The party which was established and initially sold itself as a party set up to represent men of no property has somehow turned into a party representing men of substantial property.  I am unsure whether it was hubris or being in awe of property developers and speculators.  Ministers altered policy to suit these people.  For a time, 14% of the GDP of this country was made up of construction.  It was way out of kilter with the rest of Europe.  We have heard so much about why this has happened but most people understand that it is not true.</P>
        <P>What is really interesting is that during the election, these developers and speculators informed their workers that only Fianna F&aacute;il could protect their jobs.  What is also interesting is that around this time, Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers knew the property bubble had burst and that it would have a huge effect on the jobs of people in the construction sector but for some reason they felt it was easier to lie and not accept what was going on for the sake of power.  That may be a very hard statement but it is the reality.</P>
        <P>Ministers knew the property bubble had burst.  Even the Taoiseach was still suffering from the delusion that there would be a soft landing.  I have not heard too much about soft landings in construction bubbles.  By their very nature, construction bubbles build and deflate quite quickly and the market resets itself.  The Taoiseach continued in this belief that there would be a soft landing, as did many Ministers.</P>
        <P>What has transpired from all of this is the level of debt ordinary families have.  What is really annoying those families is that they feel they were hung out to dry by this Government while it pours billions of euro into NAMA for questionable reasons.  There is much concern about NAMA despite Ministers rolling out people to say it is the right thing.  We are not being very honest with ourselves if we do not acknowledge there are problems with NAMA.  There are problems with how the NAMA legislation is functioning, about which I am sure the Minister for Education and Skills is beginning to hear at the Cabinet table.</P>
        <P>Another issue which is really annoying the public is the extravagant lifestyles of certain individuals.  I came of age in the 1980s when there was a song by Christy Moore called Ordinary Man.  When the people hear about people jetting off to places and living extravagant lifestyles, they sense they are still paying for it.  I refer not only to people who have lost their jobs but to people in the Civil Service and the public service who are paying three extra taxes &mdash; a health levy, a pension levy and an income levy.  Others have also seen a dramatic cut in their incomes.  That is having a second impact on our economy in the form of consumer spending.</P>
        <P>Another problem only slightly grasped by the Government, but which is the biggest problem, is the turmoil in the public finances.  There is a huge gap between what we are spending and our income.  I refer to the delay in dealing with this crisis.  I accept much of what the Government is doing to deal with the crisis is right but it cannot take credit for dealing with a crisis it caused.  It cannot laud itself on that.  There is still a sense among the public that the Government is not dealing with this crisis quickly enough.</P>
        <P>The Government must accept the people are bitter and angry that they were misled at the latter end of the Celtic tiger years, that this Government bought the last election with their money and that it has left them paying for it for a number of decades.  That is why the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, should be honest and go before the people and why we have tabled a no confidence motion in him.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:  </P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann has confidence in the Taoiseach and this Government&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am proud to affirm confidence in the Government which is willing to take the hard decisions necessary to get the economy on the road to recovery.  I remember two recessions and was a Member of this House for one of them.  The Government of the day in the 1980s did not take the hard decisions.  The Taoiseach of the day was very honourable and honest when he said many years later on his retirement that he would have made different decisions if he had to make them again.</P>
        <P>This Government has provided confidence and credibility for the Irish economy and the markets at a time of great turbulence.  As the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance pointed out yesterday, many countries in Europe now face serious problems in their public finances.  Ireland has gained an advantage by moving quickly to tackle the public finances.</P>
        <P>This Government has attracted much criticism from political opponents.  I have been involved in politics long enough and lived through enough recessions to know that in an economic crisis, governments need to do what is prudent.  Taking the populist approach will not get Ireland out of this crisis.  There is no doubt that the Government could have tried to defer the hard decisions but as the example of Greece shows us, the hard choices cannot be avoided for long.  Other nations are now following Ireland&rsquo;s example.</P>
        <P>At all stages, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government has put the national interest first and has put economic substance before political spin.  Everyone in this House and in the country knows that Ireland is going through a very difficult recession.  We are lucky we have men and women of courage under the stewardship of Deputy Cowen, as Taoiseach, and their talents at this crucial time.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is a man of substance and of real integrity.  In tough economic times, we need people with broad shoulders.  We need Ministers who will not be deflected by criticism, who have the bottle to do what is necessary and who will not be rattled or thrown off course by the fleeting opinion poll.</P>
        <P>Many people have spent the past two years deriding decisions made by the Taoiseach and his Government yet it is now becoming increasingly clear that the major policy decisions taken by the Government over that period are having the intended impact on the public finances and are restoring much need confidence in our country.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach and welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House for this very serious and important motion and wish her well in her new portfolio.  Our colleagues, the Minister for Finance, the other Ministers and Ministers of State and the Green Party Ministers and Ministers of State have shown great political maturity, leadership, acumen and skill.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach made clear in the D&aacute;il yesterday, the recent reports confirm the need for an extensive guarantee, that Anglo Irish Bank was a systemic bank at the time of the guarantee, that the bank&rsquo;s failure would have been disastrous for the economy, that the timing of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank did not result in higher costs and that steps have been taken to correct the main issues relating to regulation.</P>
        <P>In his report, Governor Honohan is unequivocally strong on the need for a guarantee.  He made the point that if the Government had not acted on the night of 29 September 2008, the <Col N="344"/>cost to our economy would have been detrimental.  In this respect, the report must make difficult reading for our colleagues in the Labour Party who said there was no need for a guarantee.</P>
        <P>The report states: &ldquo;Closure of all, or a large part, of the banking system would have entailed a catastrophic immediate and sustained economy-wide disruption involving very significant, albeit extremely difficult to quantify, social costs, affecting in particular the fundamental function of the payments system in a modern economy.&rdquo;  It further states: &ldquo;Considering the experience of other countries in such circumstances, the social and economic costs, if they could be quantified, would surely have run into tens of billions of euro.&rdquo;  These immediate costs were avoided by the guarantee.  The record shows the Labour Party voted against the guarantee.  The reality of that choice, had its position prevailed, is the entire banking system would have collapsed and our economy would have gone down the tube.  Without a guarantee, there would have been a run on the banks and Governor Honohan says that, in all likelihood, the main banks would have run out of cash within days.</P>
        <P>The Government is pursuing a clear and well defined strategy to generate sustainable jobs.  Those who say we can save jobs while allowing financial institutions to fall are closing their eyes to the most basic necessity of economic reality.  That reality is our economy is open.  We depend on exports, foreign investment and international trade and those who advocate defaulting or allowing banks of systemic importance to fall clearly do not understand the reality because following such a dangerous course would suck confidence and investment out of the country and do untold damage to Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a recent speech in Athlone the Taoiseach identified ten areas where the Government&rsquo;s economic renewal plan is working to generate the jobs we so badly need.  They are confidence, credit, costs, infrastructure, innovation, foreign direct investment, small business, green enterprises, agrifood and tourism.  I encourage Members to read his speech because it is constructive politics at its best.  It sets out a national course for tackling unemployment and for the priority of getting people back to work as soon as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to our public finances, Ireland made a fiscal correction of 5% of GDP in 2009 and the correction will be 2.5% in 2010.  Big decisions will also have to be made in the next budget and the Government and the Taoiseach must weigh up where expenditure savings can be made to restore fiscal stability in order that we can continue to attract investment and continue on the path to economic growth and job creation.  The Government has learned hard lessons and taken difficult decisions.  Our economy is emerging from recession and Ireland is strongly fighting back.  The Government has credible plans to take us forward on the path of sustainable economic growth.  The plan is to fix the banks, restore order to our public finances, restore competitiveness, support enterprise and generate employment.</P>

	<P>It is unusual to have a debate of this sort with a motion tabled in such blatant terms in this House.  This always puts Independents in a difficult situation as they have to come off the fence on a motion as crude as this but it is my view and that of a large number of people in the country that, for various reasons, Fianna F&aacute;il has been too long in office.  The numbers will be more familiar to other Members but the party has been out of office for two and a half years over the past 23 years but <i>ipso facto</i> it is bad for the party, the individuals, democracy and the country for any government or party to be in power for so long.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The evidence for that is obvious not so much in the conduct of people in these Houses or the legislation they put forward but in the way semi-State companies are governed.  One will find the infiltration of these companies by Fianna F&aacute;il over that period has been quite devastating.  Anybody who looks at the boards of the quangos in this country will realise it will take many years to dismantle Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s influence on them.  The T&aacute;naiste will be familiar with the issues in F&Aacute;S and other semi-State companies, given her former portfolio, while the Minister for Transport will be familiar with the issue of CIE which, for some reason, has not been debated in the House, despite several requests I have made.  There are other glaring examples of such companies being used purely and simply as a home for patronage by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  That is not good for the nation and it is bad for these companies.  When this happens on a massive scale, as has been the case, vital organs and utilities become controlled politically.  They are run for the benefit of a particular party, which is wrong, and not necessarily for the good of the consumer or the people.</P>
        <P>Government Members should not be too prickly about this.  I did not say this practice is exclusive to Fianna F&aacute;il.  It has happened when other parties have been in government as well but the reality is if one party gets into government for too long, it takes a generation to dismantle the control and influence it has on these organs.  Blatantly obvious party political nominees are on the board of the DAA, An Post, Enterprise Ireland and so on.  It is difficult to link that to the damage they may or may not do.  Perhaps they are just sleepers who do absolutely nothing and do no damage, in which case they should not be there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not necessarily feel this applies to the Green Party but the motion is phrased in such a way that it is difficult for those of us on the Opposition benches to support a blanket dismissal of the Government because my criticism is confined largely to Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Green Party in government, like the Progressive Democrats Party before it, has been a good and benign influence.  Its Ministers have got some welcome reforms through and they have stopped some of the greater excesses of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Its members have influenced appointments and bank investigations, which is to their credit.  Senator Boyle has been a great influence on that and I commend him for that but that does not in any way detract from my primary issue.  A party should not be in power for so long if it is going to abuse power in the way it has done.</P>

	<P>Does Senator O&rsquo;Malley not understand that?  When she joins Fianna F&aacute;il, she will probably get some other form of patronage, as she has done already.  She is one of the beneficiaries of this system.</P>
        <P>I worry about the Judiciary and the system of appointing judges.  If one party is in power too long, there is a danger that judges of a particular political complexion will also be appointed.  There is no doubt whatsoever that judges are politically appointed and there is no point in Members looking outraged.  If one talks to people in the Law Library, they will say, &ldquo;That one is yours or that is theirs&rdquo;.  They identify judges in private conservation and when they talk about Supreme Court judgments, they can say which way they will go according to the political <Col N="346"/>colour of the judges.  There is no point in Members denying it and looking outraged because that is the way the world works here.  It may not be convenient for this to be pointed out but that is what happens.  It is important, therefore, that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, regardless of its legislative record, should not remain in office for any longer than is necessary.  It will stay in power for a certain time.</P>
        <P>With regard to the economy, we debated the two banking reports well under different guises.  There is succour for the Government in them.  There is no denying  it.  If they are decoded properly, they state that up to the time of the crisis the economy was being badly run and they blame the Government, in coded terms, for being asleep on the job as regards the banks.  They state that afterwards crisis management was good, that Ireland is regarded in Europe as an example of recovery and that we are to be commended in that regard.  That tells us that, pre-crisis, the economy was extraordinarily badly run but has been very well run since.  That is the message they are sending and they may be right or wrong.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance certainly should have the confidence of Members of this House and the nation.  He has mine and that of many independent people, but he was not Minister for Finance during that awful period when the property boom happened.  It was a two-tiered decision.  It is obvious that the main flaw was the dependence of the Government during the years of the boom on property taxes and revenue.  It was sticking out a mile that too big a proportion came from property.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us not take the motion completely in the raw.  It is difficult because there are good things to say about the Government.  On the whole, however, the main problem is that it has abused more than 20 years in office and has had a disproportionate amount of time.  The warts are now showing as a result of its tenure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion of confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government.  Needless to say, it is disappointing that we have to dedicate Seanad time to have an unnecessary confidence debate on a day when we should, in fact, be debating the Regling-Watson and Honohan reports, the findings of the Saville inquiry or getting on with the work of placing Ireland on a path towards sustainable economic growth.  That said, the motion provides the Government with an opportunity not only to set the record straight, but also to reaffirm its commitment to aid recovery.  What we have in mind is not recovery in the opinion polls in the short term but real and lasting economic recovery, on which the people will pass judgment in the only poll that counts in two years&rsquo; time. </P>
        <P>The truth is that we are operating in a period that presents a grave challenge for the country, the currency, the European Union and the global economic system.  This is a time in which the capacity to sustain confidence abroad is just as important as the ability to deliver the correct policies at home.  The people know that Ireland is now on the right path, but they also know that we still have some distance to travel.  To make the journey safely, the country needs steady, determined and calm leadership.  The Government, under the leadership of the Taoiseach, will continue to provide the necessary leadership.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Rather than addressing issues, regrettably, the debate has been personalised to the point where it now a motion of confidence in the man who in the past two years has led Ireland through one of the most difficult and challenging periods in its history post-independence.  The capacity of a Taoiseach to lead a team of Ministers, particularly a team formed from a coalition of political parties, and through that team a country, is best tested in periods of significant challenge when difficult choices have to be made.  The capacity to provide leadership demonstrated by the Taoiseach in this regard in the past two years is without precedent.  It is evident <Col N="347"/>in his ability to understand the silent majority and appreciate the importance of leadership to &ldquo;bring the people with you&rdquo; in order to achieve enduring change and progress.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has mapped out a course for the country that will not just see it recover but also ensure it will achieve long-term and sustainable growth.  The actions taken to stabilise the public finances, restore competitiveness, rebuild the tax base and repair the banks run in parallel with a strategic vision for the development of a smart economy.  Investment in critical infrastructure, job creation, education and the productive sectors has been prioritised.  In the past week crucial progress has been achieved in the reform of public services.</P>
        <P>I make this point, not to ignore issues that have prompted the motion, but to highlight the reality of where we stand today.  The Government, under the leadership of the Taoiseach for more than two years, has demonstrated a capacity to implement difficult but necessary policies at home and sustain international confidence abroad, as affirmed by fair-minded observers both inside and outside Ireland.  While there are significant lessons to be learned in the path taken by the domestic banking sector in the previous decade, they are lessons for all of us.  Support for the economic orthodoxy of the day was either explicit or implicit across most parties in the Oireachtas.  The proof is available for all to see in election manifestos.  It is there in the many statements made in both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for more homes to be constructed, further relief from stamp duty for home buyers or more to be spent in every area of Government expenditure.</P>
        <P>The banking reports make it clear that the Government was ill-served by much of the advice it had received in the period up to the crisis.  Even the surveillance provided by external institutions such as the IMF, in terms of economic policy and financial stability, failed to sound alarm bells about the impact of policy decisions made.  The analysis actually provided reassurance that the general policy direction taken was the correct one.  With the benefit of hindsight, I have no doubt we all would have altered our positions and approached some issues differently.  Today, knowing what we now know, it is right that all should be held to account for what has been done, as well as what was left undone.  Our determination in that regard is evident in our decision to appoint distinguished and independent experts to conduct a robust assessment of the reasons for the banking crisis.  We are determined to continue that examination, analysis and reflection in order that full and fair assessments can be made, lessons learned and the basis established for a full political assessment of performance to be made in due course.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has made it clear that he accepts responsibility for all of the decisions he took when Minister for Finance and has taken as Taoiseach.  The record, informed by the expert analyses published in recent days, demonstrates that he acted to correct imbalances in the tax relief system and rebalance the focus of economic policy from an excessive dependence on property and construction revenue towards having a more balanced and sustainable economy.  In that regard, we do not disagree with what Members of this House have said.  That this ultimately proved insufficient to prevent our vulnerability from producing the critical situation in which we have found ourselves reflected severe failings in the banking and regulatory systems.  As I have highlighted, these were compounded by the failings of external authorities which falsely gave comfort about the performance of both systems.  This crystallised following the collapse of international financial markets to a degree nobody had anticipated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Undoubtedly, this has been the most volatile and demanding period in Irish political life for over a quarter of a century.  The acknowledgement by the Taoiseach of his role and responsibility for past policies and decisions is in stark contrast with the rewriting of history and denials of the Opposition as regards its record.  The Government has worked long and hard in an effort to get Ireland through the crisis and its track record has been acknowledged by international commentators as the correct response to our circumstances.  This has been confirmed by the <Col N="348"/>Regling-Watson and Honohan banking reports.  They confirmed the need for an extensive guarantee, that Anglo Irish Bank was a bank of systemic importance at the time of the guarantee, that bank failure would have been disastrous for the economy, that the timing of nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank did not result in higher costs and that steps had been taken to correct the main issues relating to regulation.</P>
        <P>Our efforts are paying off, as international commentators, including the OECD, acknowledge the economy has reached a turning point.  Other countries are facing up to their difficulties.  That we are on the correct path is emphasised by the actions being taken in recent weeks in other EU member states such as the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany which are behind us in taking steps to rebalance their budgetary figures.  Ireland has first-mover advantage in this regard and we must maintain a steady path to ensure we position ourselves in the best position for the future.  The determination of the Government, under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s leadership, to move early and decisively to address problems confronting the public finances has generated approval and confidence abroad, from which we continue to benefit.</P>
        <P>Members are aware that the Government&rsquo;s plan for recovery involves four key pillars, namely, repairing the banking system, restoring stability to the public finances, regaining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and supporting enterprise and job creation.  Arguably, getting the banks working again presents one of the most significant financial challenges ever faced by the State.  The reality is simple however &mdash; the Government must repair the balance sheets and get credit flowing again to support economic recovery and create jobs.</P>
        <P>The Regling-Watson and Honohan reports highlight the reasons we find ourselves in the position where we are obliged to provide so much support for the banking system.  The reports conclude that the major responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s banking crisis lies with the directors and senior managements of the banks.  They highlight that fundamental errors within the management of individual banks led to excessive risk taking, that banks became too dependent on wholesale funding, that inadequate financial regulatory controls were implemented in Ireland and other international economies based on a mistaken view of governance within banks and that property tax incentives in place in the period from the mid-1990s should have been abolished many years before the December 2005 decision to so do.  They also highlight that individuals were left in dominant positions within individual financial institutions for too long a period, with too little management turnover, and that there were significant failures in corporate governance.  In addition, there was a failure to impose international stability risk assessments and protection systems that took account of the interaction of global financial systems and a failure to ensure more intensive compliance regulation of those financial institutions which were too big to fail.  They further highlight that the higher capital requirements for speculative property loans in Irish banks introduced at the start of 2007 should have been imposed many years earlier before the rapid escalation in property lending took place.</P>
        <P>The reports highlight the failures that resulted in the domestic banking system being so exposed on the eve of the international financial crisis.  They are welcome confirmation of the contributing factors, the majority of which we had grown to understand since the onset of the banking crisis.  It is the role of the Government to implement policies and introduce reforms to ensure such banking crises can never happen again in this country.  Under the leadership of the Taoiseach, it already has done so.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s response to the banking crisis has been robust and involved a series of actions, including the guarantee of Irish banking liabilities, the establishment of NAMA, the appointment of a new Governor of the Central  Bank and a new Financial Regulator and the integration of a new central banking commission and the Financial Regulator.  The Government&rsquo;s actions also include the introduction of a radically changed regulatory system, the setting <Col N="349"/>of higher capital requirements for Irish banks by the regulator, restrictions on bankers&rsquo; pay and supporting the independent investigation and prosecution of criminal actions in the banking sector.  Ensuring the existence of a stable and strong banking system for the future is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s future prosperity.  The availability of credit for sound business proposals is the lifeblood of any enterprise economy and the key to job creation.</P>
        <P>The second element of the Government&rsquo;s plan is to restore order to the public finances.  While the good news is that stability has been restored, the more difficult news is that we have further to go and that more difficult budgetary decisions lie ahead.  Despite the fiscal correction of 5% of GDP achieved to date, it is important not to allow an air of unreality to develop to the effect that Ireland is out of the woods.  While we certainly are on the correct path, we have much further to go.  I accept fully that some of the decisions, particularly those pertaining to expenditure that the Government has been obliged to take in making this adjustment, have created anxiety and difficulty for many.  However, I again assure Members that in taking these decisions the Government was guided at all times by the national interest and the need to ensure public services can be sustained into the future.  For the year ahead, a further &euro;3 billion of adjustments will be required in the budget for 2011.  There will be less money available for public services and we must achieve more with less.  Without the measures the Government has taken to date, the budget deficit would have ballooned to 20%.  There simply is no room for complacency and we must persevere with the agreed deficit reduction programme in the coming years.  As confidence in Ireland abroad rises as a result of the course the Government has charted, it would be a mistake to do otherwise.</P>
        <P>The restoration of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position as a global economy is another key element of the Government&rsquo;s path to recovery under the leadership of the Taoiseach.  It is an element on which I undertook considerable work in the past two years as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The drive to restore Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position is, in certain ways, the most difficult of hurdles to overcome and on which to achieve quick results.  It requires myriad actions across both the public and private sectors.  Members should be in no doubt, however, that addressing Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness is of fundamental and key importance to achieving long-term sustainable growth in the economy.  Considerable positive movement has been achieved in this regard in the past year.  For example, between 2009 and 2011, it is expected that Ireland&rsquo;s unit labour cost will have fallen by 12%.  Consumer prices have already fallen by 2.5% this year, well ahead of the eurozone average.  Moreover, energy costs, property prices and commercial rates have also fallen.  Such competitiveness improvements bring Ireland back into contention for foreign direct investment that it previously had been too expensive to win.  They also are improving the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s exports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland remains a small open economy and a nation reliant on exports which have held up well during the most severe global downturn.  The future of the economy clearly depends on its ability to export and ensuring Ireland is made more cost competitive in that regard must be and is a key element of the work the Government is undertaking.  It is only though creating the right conditions for job creation and growth in the private sector that lasting economic growth will be achieved in the medium to long term.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past two years, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I also introduced stimulus measures to protect jobs in the short term.  The employment subsidy scheme, supporting 80,000 jobs, and the enterprise stabilisation fund which directly supported 7,500 jobs last year alone were important measures in retaining employment in vulnerable enterprises through the crises.  The Government is also investing &euro;1 billion this year <Col N="350"/>to help those who have lost their jobs, thereby bringing the number of training, education and work experience places for unemployed workers to 160,000.</P>
        <P>In the last budget the Government also introduced a short-term jobs stimulus, including a national energy efficiency retrofit programme and tax incentives for energy efficiency measures, thereby creating 5,000 jobs.  In addition, it introduced a car scrappage scheme and tax incentives for electric and hybrid vehicles that will support up to 2,000 jobs, reductions in excise duties on alcohol and lower VAT payments to assist the hotels, catering and retail sector, a marketing drive and investment in visitor attractions in the tourism sector and a new employer PRSI exemption for new employees which is being introduced to reduce the cost of creating new jobs.  In addition, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I put in place a new strategy for the IDA which targeted the creation of a further 62,000 new jobs in the next five years which could lead to an additional 43,400 jobs elsewhere in the economy.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland continues to support indigenous companies, with the objective of creating a further 40,000 new jobs in the next five years, leading to another 28,000 jobs elsewhere in the economy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wish to take a moment to refute the comments made by Senator Ross in respect of many of those who serve on boards of organisations such as Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and F&Aacute;S, regardless of what personal political affiliation or none they may have, in the best interests of the semi-State organisations they wish to progress.  I certainly take grave exception to some of the comments made by the Senator about those who give a considerable amount of their time and expertise to the country&rsquo;s development.  While issues arose in F&Aacute;S, those who have been appointed to its new board are engaged in a difficult process, through which they are driving the reform of corporate governance and all of the pertinent issues of strategic importance to the country.  Although I am unsure of the political affiliation of most of them, the single reason for their appointment was their ability to do the job.  Moreover, more people must be encouraged to participate in this process.  It is encouraging to note that so many are interested in bringing forward their views and expertise for the benefit of the country.  I certainly would not stand for that type of comment about people, particularly those on the boards of Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and F&Aacute;S, the boards with which I was heavily involved.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s ability to continue to attract so much foreign direct investment in spite of the global recession and to support and grow its indigenous enterprises demonstrates that one of the accusations often made about what happened in the past decade &mdash; that we blew the benefits of boom &mdash; is disingenuous, as we face into the challenges of today from a position of great strength.  The strong position arises because we invested smartly during the good years.  We invested with purpose in this country&rsquo;s economic and social infrastructure and in its long-term future, while also paying down the Government debt.  We should not forget that.</P>
        <P>It is this side of the House that has transformed the transport, water and communications infrastructure on this island.  It is this and the preceding Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments that prioritised such significant investment for the development of sectors such as the indigenous agriculture and food industry.  It was Governments led by my party that prioritised so much time, energy and capital into attracting foreign investment and jobs to this island and to the regions, while also growing the indigenous enterprise base.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the area of my new portfolio of education and skills, Fianna F&aacute;il in government has invested billions of euro in schools&rsquo; infrastructure and in supports for children and teachers, while funding the research and innovation revolution in third level institutions.  Special needs assistants are a good example in that regard.  We are now funding more than 10,000 such <Col N="351"/>positions in schools.  When the Labour Party left the Department of Education and Science there were fewer than 300 special needs assistants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our record is unsurpassed in capital investment in schools.  Even this summer in excess of 1,490 schools across the country are benefiting from a record &euro;122 million capital investment through the summer works scheme.  It is part of a total planned capital spend of in excess of &euro;500 million through the school building and modernisation programme this year.  At a time of significant fiscal constraint that demonstrates again the Government&rsquo;s commitment and the importance we attach to education on this island.</P>
        <P>In the past two years I have been honoured to work closely with the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, in leading this country.  He is a man of integrity and one who cares deeply about this country and the people.  As Taoiseach, he has my every confidence and support.  The path ahead for this country will not be an easy one and I am certain that the political temperature will remain high.  I am confident however that when the people begin to see the results of the work we have undertaken during the past two years under the Taoiseach, they will begin to appreciate the enormity of the task and the diligence with which it has been executed.  I am confident that come the next election, this Government and Fianna F&aacute;il will have a very strong story to tell.  I commend the motion of confidence to the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Professor Honohan stated in his report that Government policy clearly played a central role in contributing to the crisis.  He said that macro-economic and budgetary policies contributed significantly to the economic overheating, relying to a clearly unsustainable extent on the construction sector and other transient sources for Government revenue and encouraging the property boom via various incentives geared at the construction sector.  When Professor Honohan stated: &ldquo;This helped create a climate of public opinion which was led to believe that the party could last forever&rdquo;, I would describe that as another way of stating something I strongly believe, which is that the then Minister and the Taoiseach did blow the boom.  There is no question that they blew the boom.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the sort of activity that the Members opposite appear to want to engage in.  We either have a debate or we do not.  I never heard such nonsense as the T&aacute;naiste saying we are personalising the debate around the Taoiseach.  If one is to talk about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s performance, one must talk about the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s name is Brian Cowen.  To that extent the debate is being personalised.  He holds an important constitutional office and we are entitled to criticise him forcefully if we wish.</P>
        <P>We are dealing with &ldquo;planet Bertie&rdquo; without Bertie because Senator Cassidy said he felt the Honohan report would make difficult reading for the Labour Party.  It does make difficult reading for the Labour Party.  The report makes difficult reading for anyone who picks it up because it demonstrates the most gross incompetence at least, if not shocking betrayal of the trust of the people over the past ten to 15 years of this Government in office.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste made some crack about the Labour Party and teachers.  The last time my party was in Government Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn was Minister for Finance.  This is a matter of factual record.  The new Government in 1997 inherited the first planned surplus in more than 30 years.  We were the most competitive economy in Europe at the time.  We were creating 1,000 jobs a week and unemployment was rapidly falling.  What did we find yesterday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter of fact.  The people opposite do not like facts.</P>

	<P>No interruption please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the facts.  The other fact is that yesterday we were told that unemployment in this country is now 3% above the European Union average.  That is the state of affairs we have reached in this country.  Anyone who has any sense of reality cannot possibly invoke the banking reports in support of the Government&rsquo;s position.  The absolute contrary is the case.  One only has to read the reports.  I wonder how many of my colleagues have read them.  There is criticism of the guarantee.  The notion that Professor Honohan gave plain sailing to the guarantee is totally wrong.  That is not the case.  In fact, he made the point that the guarantee was too extensive.</P>
        <P>Listening to the T&aacute;naiste and some members of the Government one would think the Opposition was responsible for much of what they themselves have done.  The ludicrous argument was made about all the demands from the Opposition for extra spending.  Since when did Fianna F&aacute;il heed demands from the Opposition about anything?</P>

	<P>I respect that but I only have eight minutes and I will not allow any of it to be taken by interruptions.  If I am interrupted I will respond in kind.  We only have to look at the television programmes to show the historical fact that one of the intellectual influences on the Government in the past 15 years was from Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s former party, if it still exists or if she is still in it.  I do not know whether the party is still going or what exactly is the state of it.  Is my colleague an Independent Member, a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party or is she still a member of the Progressive Democrats?  Nobody knows.</P>

	<P>The fact is that the Progressive Democrats were at the heart of Government and the decisions that were made by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and by Deputy Cowen when he was Minister for Finance.  They have us where we are.  That is the reason for the present situation.  There is no confidence.</P>
        <P>Everyone knows the vote will go through in the same way as it did in the D&aacute;il.  I accept and respect that, constitutionally, the Government has a mandate from the people based on the previous election.  However, it does not have a mandate for anything it is doing currently.  The mandate the Government got in 2007 was an entirely different mandate in its character to what it is now implementing.  The only way it can be demonstrated clearly whether there is confidence in any member of the Government is to put it to the test.  The Government will not even hold by-elections.  It will not face the people in any shape or form.</P>
        <P>I heard what Senator Ross had to say about the Green Party.  I like and respect a lot of people in the Green Party but the party will never be able to get away from the fact that it is propping up an absolutely disastrous Government which does not have the confidence of the people.  The Government does not have credibility.  The Taoiseach does not have credibility for what he is doing and he does not have the confidence of the people of this country as demonstrated not just in one opinion poll but over and over again in recent months and years.</P>
        <P>Senator Cassidy referred to the Government being derided.  The banking reports deride the policy of the Government.  They are an unanswerable indictment of Government policy in recent years.  I wish to focus on the guarantee.  The notion exists that no other decision could have been made and that the guarantee was inevitable.  Senator Cassidy suggested the Labour Party said there was no need for a guarantee.  That is not in fact what we said.    We opposed the guarantee ultimately because the very reasonable amendments tabled had not been accepted by the Government.  We said there was a very respectable argument, supported by many economists across the board, for taking the banks into temporary public ownership.  It was not just respectable at the time, it is also touched upon by Professor Honohan in the last page of his report.  He refers to the emergency lending assistance approach that could have been taken.  I <Col N="354"/>remember the Minister for Finance saying in the House that our international reputation would be destroyed if we adopted that approach.  Professor Honohan states:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is unlikely that even extensive use of the facility [emergency lending assistance] to buy time to facilitate nationalisation the following weekend would have been viewed negatively [or as damaging] by partner central banks under the circumstances.</P>

	<P>This august Chamber has developed traditions, a proud history and a sense of character in determining how the nation should be defined at different times and in different circumstances in its history.  Debates have taken on a particular significance.  Confidence debates are meant to fall into this category.  They offer an opportunity for a Government to justify its actions and continue in office if it wins the argument.  They also offer an opportunity for Opposition parties to state why they should comprise an alternative Government.</P>
        <P>This confidence motion may be the most surreal ever debated in the House.  Instigated by a party leader in the other House, it does not seem to have the significant support of that party.  It may not even have majority support in the party.  The Senators next to contribute to this debate, in particular, do not support their party leaders.

	<P>I will repeat the policies in question because my party and I were most correct about how they were being pursued.  The policies being pursued in 2002 to 2007 resulted in an overheated economy.  They were the collective responsibility of the Government in office and the Minister for Finance had a role to play in that regard.  I attribute more blame for the overheating to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor as Minister for Finance than the Taoiseach himself.</P>

	<P>In 2007 my party entered government with the consent of its members.  It did so on the basis of a programme for Government we considered we could implement.  Economic circumstances, informed by the events of  2002 to 2007, were such that some options were not available.  We had choices as a political party and still do.  We could walk away or decide to make the right decisions.  Ours will be a period of economic history that will not be judged on whether the most popular jobs were done.  It is easy to do and say popular things.  We see political parties which are benefiting from saying the others are wrong and that they would do better, without justifying any of their statements.  The reality is that we will be judged on whether the right decisions were made.  The real test of a Government is when the economic slowdown hits to such an extent that unpalatable decisions must be made.  It is in such periods that there is a real test of character and political parties justify their existence.  The Government has not got things right; there is no doubt about this.</P>

	<P>I remind Senators that this is a serious debate.  By its nature, political points will be made, but Senators should respect each other.  The public is not impressed by this type of barracking in the Chamber.  It happens in the D&aacute;il but tends not to happen here.  I ask Members on both sides of the House to respect the right of others to make their points.  I ask for their co-operation.  I will not allow Members to interject from either side of the House.  I will adjourn the debate, if necessary.</P>
        <P>I call Senator Phelan.  He has eight minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try not to be as provocative as the previous speaker.  I am glad of the opportunity to have this discussion.  A few things have been said which I wish to counter.  I was particularly disappointed by the start of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s speech and her comment that we should be discussing the banking reports tonight.  Surely to God whoever wrote her speech knew we had a debate on the banking reports in the Chamber yesterday.  Surely they knew that if we were discussing confidence in the Government and the Taoiseach that the banking reports would be a huge part of that discussion.</P>
        <P>I will not be lectured by Senator Boyle or others about the purpose of a confidence motion and how if the Government wins the debate, it wins.  It has nothing to do with winning debates.  This Government lost the debate a year ago.  It is about winning the vote tonight.  We know the Government has the numbers in this House and in the Lower House to win the vote.  It has nothing to do with the debate and the standard of the debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will certainly not be lectured to by Senator Boyle and other Government speakers about what the Opposition&rsquo;s role has been in our current economic circumstances.  I was the finance spokesperson for five years in the Seanad when Deputy Cowen and former Deputy McCreevy were Ministers for Finance.  I remember making points, following the Budget Statements being delivered in the D&aacute;il, about the overheating of the economy and our over-reliance on construction.  l recall Deputy Brian Cowen sitting in the chair currently occupied by the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, and Members on the Government benches laughing at me.  How stupid could I be?  The attitude of Deputy Bertie Ahern at the time was that people who thought the economy was being overheated should go away and do something with themselves.  That was the attitude of Fianna F&aacute;il and their friends in Government at the time.</P>
        <P>I will not be lectured to and told that we did not give the warnings.  I certainly will not listen to anybody inside or outside this House say that nobody predicted what was going to happen.  Several people predicted it.  This was presented to the Government at budget and other times but it chose deliberately to ignore the advice it was given.  That is its prerogative.</P>
        <P>There is also the contention by Deputy Cowen and others since the publication of the banking reports that they accept responsibility for what happened.  However, there are consequences for accepting responsibility.  If somebody commits an offence, is brought before the court and accepts responsibility, there are consequences for their actions.  The consequences for this Government must be that it leaves or is drummed out of office.  Thankfully, we do not live in a society that is riven with some of the social unrest we have witnessed in other countries in Europe.  However, I sometimes think Irish people do not get angry enough about what has <Col N="359"/>happened in this country and the revisionism of Senator Boyle, Senator Cassidy and others about what occurred.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I can tell them about my friends &mdash; I am 31 years of age &mdash; who have mortgages they cannot pay.  People ring my office every day because they cannot meet their mortgage payments due to losing their jobs or their jobs being made part-time.  They have to do that work because that is all they can get, but they cannot meet the repayments on their mortgages of &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000.  What about the people who have left the country?  The biggest disgrace, for which Deputy Brian Cowen and Fianna F&aacute;il are responsible, is that another generation of Irish people will have to leave this country.  A total of 60,000 left in the last 12 months and 60,000 more will leave this year as a result of that party&rsquo;s actions in Government.</P>
        <P>When we had our Celtic tiger economy Members on all sides of the House hoped we would not have to lose another generation of Irish people to the emigration ships again.  A couple of months ago, I met a father who had just brought his son to the bus in Ballyhale.  His son was going to New Zealand.  He has just got a job there and does not know if he will ever come back.  He might never return.  The man was crying to me.  How can one ignore the real tragedy for those families and individuals, who have suffered because of what the Government has done?</P>
        <P>The Government has been named in the banking reports; Professor Honohan does not put a tooth in it, nor do Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson.  They put a large chunk of the responsibility at the Government&rsquo;s door.  It is not all the Government&rsquo;s responsibility, as I have pointed out each time I have spoken on this issue.  However, it is clearly spelt out in the reports that the fiscal and macro-economic policies pursued by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and whoever else propped up Fianna F&aacute;il in Government were responsible to a large extent for the difficulties in which we currently find ourselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with most of Senator Ross&rsquo;s comments about appointments to State boards.  I have never held the view that people with a political affiliation should not be on a State board.  If they are good enough for the job, they should get it, regardless of their politics.  However, they should be interviewed by the Oireachtas committee that is responsible for the State board.  There should be some examination of whether they are good enough, rather than whether they go to enough cumann meetings.  With regard to the notion put forward by Senator Ross that the Green Party does not do that, it has stuffed people on boards left, right and centre.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is one example but there are others.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Chairman.</P>
        <P>That is all in stark contrast to the current situation of the economy and role he played in that.  I regard him as a decent man but his crucial problem is that he believes that when he talks to Fianna F&aacute;il he is talking to Ireland.  He believes that if he talks to people at a cumann or district meeting, they reflect the people.  They do not.  He is out of touch with the people.  Many members of the Government are out of touch with the people.  They must talk to members of the general public who are suffering as a result of the policies they have implemented over the last number of years.</P>
        <P>The level of political self-interest displayed by the Government in my eight years as a Member of this House is astounding.  Everything in its economic policy has been geared towards re-election.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley and others who pointed out that the Government won elections.  Of course it did, and we must respect the result of those elections.  However, all the fruits of the Celtic tiger economy were geared towards ensuring it won those elections in a cycle of destruction which has brought us to the current juncture.  For that reason, anybody who consults the general public would know that one can have absolutely no confidence in this Government and in the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Feeney.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by stating the obvious.  Ireland, like most other countries in the world, has experienced a severe economic downturn.  What has taken place has not just been national, but international.  In the past few days we have received reports that have analysed some of the reasons, and there will be further examination in future months and years.  However, this is a vote of confidence in the current Government.</P>
        <P>The people I represent want the discussion to be about the future, not the past.  They want economic stability, banks lending again and the businesses that are cash starved, but with projects on their books, enabled to carry on their business.  With such actions people get employment or their employment becomes more secure.  To achieve this we need a Government not scared to do the right thing, even if it is the hard thing.  We need a Government not scared of the backlash of public opinion for doing the right thing.  We need a Government that will not fold on the first negative poll.</P>
        <P>That brings me to look at what the alternative to what we have is and while I do not like to be personal, this motion is personal and so we must look to the main Opposition party.  Even this week we have seen how Fine Gael reacts to one bad poll.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Confidence within the party falls apart and there is a public spat that has captivated the attention of all forms of media and much of the public.  However, is this positive attention?  Would it be the same reaction if they were in Government?  What a distraction it is even when they are merely in Opposition.  What would it be like if they were in Government in charge of difficult decisions, and yet where are the media today?  Indeed, where is the Opposition that was clamouring for a vote of no confidence today?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>As I say, the place is absolutely full.</P><Col N="361"/>
        <P>We look to potential partners for Government and we take one example of leadership, the Croke Park deal.  It is only in recent days that Deputy Gilmore has come out on the issue at all.  He was afraid to influence people.  Surely that is not the sign of a national or international leader, but the choice the Irish people has is what we have at present or the alternative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Returning to the current Government, I do not state what I think; I quote international observers.  It links to Senator Alex White&rsquo;s concept of the mandate of what is going on.  The European Commissioner Oli Rehn, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15 June 2010, stated: &ldquo;The Irish authorities have implemented a significant consolidation package for 2010 of 2.5 per cent of GDP&rdquo;, and he went on to give a positive analysis.  <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> of 1 June 2010, reported:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">So what makes Ireland special?  Its political leaders are doing it &mdash; and have been since October 2008 ... and politicians around Europe could do worse than to look at Ireland&rsquo;s cuts as a model.</P>
        <P FLI="0">According to Bloomberg, on 1 June last, &ldquo;The economy may be expanding again after shrinking&rdquo;.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Professor Patrick Honohan, on 28 May last, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We&rsquo;re close to the bottom ... Here at the central bank, we are projecting an upturn in the second half of 2010.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The OECD, on banking policy, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The injection of public funds into the banking system is an important step in restoring the financial sector to health and getting credit flowing again.</P>
        <P LI="1">On the positive side, however, the notable improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s price and cost competitiveness could allow growth to pick up more quickly than expected in the context of the ongoing global economic recovery.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The French Finance Minister, Mme Christine Lagarde, on RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; on 19 February last, stated: &ldquo;Ireland has set the high standard and the rest of us must follow&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>There are other quotations, for example, the <i>Financial Times</i> of 23 May 2010, reported that:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is not often that the Irish get a chance to tell the British how to do it.  But in the past few days, senior UK Treasury officials have been on the phone to Dublin picking the brains of their Irish finance ministry counterparts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is important in the context of the current climate that we take time to look at what professionals at an international level are saying.  We should look to recent words of, for example, Mr. Philip O&rsquo;Doherty of E&amp;I Engineering, currently expanding its employment base in Inishowen with a company with international recognition, who states that there is a future for Irish business and is proving it by his actions in my region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Take time to study the discrepancies within Fine Gael and Labour policies.  Where are the policies?  I will not even begin to quote the two stances on the abolition of this House.  Can anyone truly look at these two sides and not vote confidence in the current being the better option, the more confident, if tougher, deliverer of recovery?  The lack of interest in this debate is a key signal of just how wrong the timing of this debate has been.</P>

        <P>I am delighted to speak to the amendment expressing confidence in the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen.  I hail from the same neck of the woods.  Unlike Senator Phelan, I know the Taoiseach well.  For my part, I find he is an honest man, a man of great integrity, not a man to mince his words.  He stands behind no man or woman.  He does not need to be prompted.  He is certainly a man who loves his country and does everything in the interest of his country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I feel sorry for Fine Gael and where it is this evening.  I heard Senator Phelan state that Deputy Kenny is twice the man somebody over here was and I hope the party will remember that for Deputy Kenny tomorrow night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and we will wish Deputy Kenny well in his vote of no confidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is something of an own goal on behalf of the Opposition when it tables a motion like this.  It is a damp squib tabling a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach when its own party is in such disarray.  An election in the morning &mdash; they all are shouting for it &mdash; would be the last thing Fine Gael Members would need because they do not even have a leader and they do not know where they are going.</P>
        <P>To get down to the real matter, Fine Gael is supported by Labour, from whom there is a no show here tonight with the exception of Senator Alex White, who does not even think it worth his while to stay and listen to Fine Gael&rsquo;s contribution.  One wonders what kind of a coalition Government they would make if they were in power.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As has been outlined here today, we had manifestos, scripts and speeches of Fine Gael and Labour together on the record of both Houses from 2007.  If they had had their way, we could not have spent enough, built enough &mdash; it was spend, spend, spend.  When we tightened the reins and pulled back on section 48, section 23 and section 21 in the budget of 2006, under the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, we had a surplus of &euro;5 billion.  He put away &euro;3 billion to bring down the national debt and he was called a miser by the party on the opposite side.  They cannot have it every way.  Their memories are short, but go back to their manifestos of 2007 and see what they were looking for.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are the Government.  We have the leader.  One can see by the numbers on this side of the House tonight.  They are not single figures like they are on the other side.  We have the man who will lead the country and put it above an opinion poll, and when an opinion poll comes out and is bad for his party, he will come into the parliamentary party and say to us that he will make no apology for putting country before party.  I applaud him, as I have done in the parliamentary party, for doing that.  Fine Gael gets one bad opinion poll and it falls to pieces and is looking to get rid of its leader.  I wish it well tomorrow.</P>

	<P>It is an appalling debate and I have learned nothing from it.  It is disgraceful.  This kind of thing gets us nowhere &mdash; constant heckling, no points being made, just landing blows and nothing to be learned from it.  If anybody wants to read this debate next week and learn something from it, show it to me.  I listened to it all and it gets me nowhere.  I refer to both sides of the House.</P><Col N="363"/>
        <P>I could take issues, but I will give one example as I do not have time to deal with much of it.  Professor Honohan&rsquo;s report, for instance, takes four pages to deal with one item, that is, the directors&rsquo; compliance statement.  As far as I recall, the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, was here when the Bill that dealt with directors&rsquo; compliance statements, which became section 45 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003, came to the House.  I have a vested interest in this because I chaired the audit review group which required, requested and demanded that a directors&rsquo; compliance statement be put in place.  I will tell the House what happened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I reported to the Progressive Democrats Minister, Deputy Harney, whose policies I disagree with fundamentally.  I made the case to her as to the importance of this directors&rsquo; compliance statement and why it needed to be done.  She accepted it fully and she put it fully into the legislation.  That legislation was published and every party that has spoken here tonight so far, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael &mdash; I take Labour out of it as that party did raise issues in the other House on it &mdash; operated against it and put pressure on Deputy Harney to change it.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael supported all the main accountancy bodies which opposed this, and then the Minister changed it.  I tried to get it changed back here in the House where the Bill was introduced and I could not get the support needed for it.  Eighteen months ago when a companies Bill was being brought through by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coughlan, I tabled an amendment, in line with the Company Law Reform Group report and in line with what was reported by the OECD, in order to get that implemented then.  Even the weak section finally inserted in the Bill has never been implemented by the Government, which must take responsibility because not implementing the section was wrong.  This is a major issue.</P>
        <P>Professor Honohan was clear in his report.  According to him, there were problems with regulation, banking practices and Government policy.  There is no question in this regard, as that was the reality.  I am being asked to vote my confidence or lack thereof in the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, but this debate is occurring in a vacuum and is disconnected from what we are doing.  We could change the Government in the morning, but the difficult decisions taken to date have been necessary.  It is my understanding of Fine Gael policy that, even though it opposes NAMA, it would implement NAMA were it in government tomorrow morning.  Someone riddle me that and explain how it would bring us forward because I do not understand.</P>
        <P>Regarding the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, a matter the House spent long nights discussing, Professor Honohan stated in his report that, while the issue could be argued this way or that way, doing it six months earlier or later would not have made a whit of a difference.</P>
        <P>Certainly Government policy was at fault to a significant extent.  I fought, argued and negotiated with the current Taoiseach on issues of, for example, taxation policy because I fundamentally disagreed with the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government in that regard.  He argued from a principled point of view.  The idea that he betrayed the country is nonsense.  He did what he believed was right for the country while I believed he was wrong.  One must consider these issues in all sorts of ways.</P>
        <P>I know none of the people who forecast the recession.  I have never met them.  Behind me on my office wall, I have every forecast from every economist made in the past X years, including and up to 2008 when they were still making contrary statements.  The new economist in the Department of Finance who was supposedly the only person who identified the recession did so in April 2008, four months beforehand.  He concluded his statement by saying that, even though a recession was on the way, it was going to be worse because interest rates were going to climb.  There was no question.</P>
        <P>Where does this leave the two parties?  Everyone could see the books before the last election because the parties were invited to examine them.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael made their pro<Col N="364"/>posals for Government.  Both sets of policies were dependent on 4% growth in the economy.  If people in the Opposition claim they saw the recession coming, yet they still made a series of proposals to the public based on 4% growth, I do not buy it.</P>

That was criminal.  The Government also introduced and lived with soft touch regulation.</P>
        <P>Something else is coming down the road.  I have tried to introduce legislation on credit unions three times.  They are in trouble.  Every time I introduced the legislation, both sides of the House had difficulty in supporting my position.  We will rue that day.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the time being spared by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  This is a bit of a farcical debate.  While I will support the motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach, the real motion of no confidence everyone is discussing relates to the leader of Fine Gael.  I have no confidence in either because Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct.  The policies articulated by Fine Gael in the run up to the last election and those being implemented by Fianna F&aacute;il are exactly the same.  The two parties are the Tweedledee and Tweedledum of politics.  For the first time in opinion polls, we see the majority of people rejecting both.  A need for real change is necessary and other parties, including mine, must step up to the plate and show that we have the policies and vision to take the country forward in a fairer, more equal and inclusive society.</P>
        <P>Individuals on the street are seething at the way in which the Taoiseach and his Cabinet have treated the ordinary, decent people.  They see that not a single banker, developer or speculator has served one night behind bars.  A few have been removed from their positions, but most had a soft landing.  We need only look at the names.  Patrick Neary, John Hurley, Eugene Sheehy and Brian Goggin were paid in the millions of euro and have annual pension cushions of &euro;450,000 or, in the case of Mr. Goggin, &euro;650,000.  It is ridiculous.  Compare this situation with that of an unemployed person over 25 years of age in receipt of &euro;196 per week or a younger person who is in receipt of &euro;150.</P>
        <P>The country did not need to be here.  Before elections and in the D&aacute;il, we in Sinn F&eacute;in argued for stronger policies and regulation, caps on the remuneration of bankers, an end to property inflation, a fair tax system based on stable, direct taxation, the improvement of corporate law, a tax on speculative trading and counter-cyclical budget policies.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  Like all Members and every member of Fianna F&aacute;il, including the Taoiseach, I am profoundly distressed when I hear of the extremely disturbing circumstances in which the people find themselves.  As the Taoiseach, he feels the responsibility even more.  This sense of responsibility drives his determination to lead the economy and our country to recovery, and recover it will.  Our focus must be on economic recovery, jobs for our people, services for those in need and support for people to remain in their homes.  Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s focus has been on all of these aspects since becoming Taoiseach.  I have every confidence that he will lead us to economic recovery, and confidence is the subject of this debate.</P>
        <P>I will give the House one evidence-based reason for my belief and conviction.  I will not repeat other Senators&rsquo; comments.  When the Taoiseach became Minister for Health and Children and Fianna F&aacute;il entered into Government in 1997, disability and mental health services were in disarray.</P>

	<P>Services immediately felt the impact of his commitment.  There was extensive development, A Vision for Change was drawn and, for the first time ever, multi-annual funding was introduced.  As the Minister for Health and Children and Finance and now as Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen has honoured this commitment to people who have been frequently forgotten.  Therefore, I have every confidence he will honour the commitment he gave to our people and country to lead us to economic recovery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Corrigan for giving me two minutes of her time and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  I am pleased to support the motion of confidence in the Taoiseach and his Government.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, is a person of the highest integrity who has given strong leadership to our country at this time.  When he was Minister for Finance I worked closely with him and through his support Ireland West Airport Knock got &euro;27.5 million for infrastructure that was essential for its development.  That was a huge boost for development in the west.</P>
        <P>Agriculture gained significantly when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance and Deputy Mary Coughlan was Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Since he became Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen has given the current Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, every support in ensuring Irish farming will go forward.</P>
        <P>The Government has invested &euro;1.1 billion from the Exchequer through farm waste management schemes which ensured we did not suffer fines or cutbacks to European Union funding for rural development and the single payment schemes, which are worth &euro;1.6 billion to the farming community in Ireland.  Every week we hear it said that it is through the different organs of farming that we will bring our country to the fore again with exports, food processing and so on.  That money is vital in that regard.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, has given the farming community in Ireland, through his Ministers, the highest support that possibly can be given.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Corrigan for sharing time.  She clearly had much more to say and it is very generous of her.</P>
        <P>This is an ill-timed motion and the debate has been disjointed.  People are talking about historical issues but what we are debating is confidence in the Taoiseach and whether he is the right man to do the job now.</P>
        <P>I have friends like those about whom Senator Phelan spoke and people coming into my constituency office who are hurting.  People are hurting, and it is easy to be cynical.  I visited a school last week where I spoke to 14 year olds and, to be honest, I nearly cried leaving it because of the cynicism and the lack of hope in those students&rsquo; eyes.  That is partly because of a media fuelled, Opposition fuelled constant berating of a good man who is doing the most difficult job that has had to be done in this country heretofore.  He has been doing it while ignoring a lot of what his party is saying.  He has to do that because he is putting his party second to the country.  That is a very hard sell, and it is not a job any public relations agent, no matter how good they think they are, can sell properly because people will not easily take cuts.  It is a very difficult thing to have to live with, and they are living with the consequences of the position in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>What we are talking about is going forward and coming out of this recession.  I told the children in that school that we will come out of this recession and that they have to have hope because it is they who will bring us out of this recession, and the best person to do the job is a man who is able to say &ldquo;No, I am taking this course of action because this is what the country needs&rdquo;.  We have engaged in economic restraint.  We have taken the decisions that need to be taken and we will come out of this recession.</P>
        <P>On what Senator Shane Ross said about the Judiciary, the GAA etc., I accept there are issues in regard to our corporate governance and soft touch regulation.  Political appointment of the Judiciary is probably the best way forward and as a practitioner I have never felt that I have gotten any good favour from the Judiciary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>What we need is a vision and a solution and I do not see either.  I see just one prong of a solution, that is, the banking solution.  If we look at what has been advised, we will see that we need solutions on the banking front, the fiscal and budget deficit front, the economic front in terms of jobs and competitiveness, on a reputational front and with regard to the social crisis.  On the jobs front, the main people the Taoiseach and the Cabinet are letting down are the 435,000 out of work in terms of the social impact.</P><Col N="369"/>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I mentioned on the Order of Business that I had met three young graduates in one house alone last week who were looking for passport application forms.  Where does their future lie?  The Government is giving everything to the banks, but the Taoiseach now has an opportunity to show what he can do.  He can never be any higher in his leadership role, yet he is not addressing this problem.  Everything has gone one way in this country, that is, towards the banks.  When we asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to intervene on behalf of the home owner, he said his only role was to regulate.  That is some indictment of the Taoiseach because we now know from the Honohan report and the other banking report that the Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, did not regulate.  He has shown no capacity in this area.  There have been no deals or write-downs for home owners in negative equity.  NAMA will provide for a 43% write-down on properties, while the taxpayer picks up the tab for uncollected developers&rsquo; debts, for which the Taoiseach has not unequivocally apologised.  Neither has he faced the people in a state of the nation address to seek their support.  He must apologise unequivocally for the role he played in this problem when Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is to be condemned on several grounds for decisions made when he was Minister for Finance.  He relied completely on unstable tax returns from stamp duty and capital gains tax during the property boom, a fact well documented in both banking reports.  He let us down on the issue of wage competitiveness.  During the boom years employees negotiated supplementary wage increases which meant a deterioration in wage competitiveness.  The Taoiseach also negotiated benchmarking increases without securing increases in productivity in return.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There were also failures in banking regulation.  What the Government has done with Anglo Irish Bank has proved this was a unique home-grown crisis.  Under his watch when Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach let the Financial Regulator, Mr. Neary, allow Anglo Irish Bank to become the model for all other banks.</P>

The findings reiterate Mr. Honohan&rsquo;s conclusion that Govern<Col N="370"/>ment&rsquo;s policy, under the direction of the Taoiseach, left the &ldquo;public finances highly vulnerable to a downturn&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reports do not reveal new information.  However, they refute any argument hitherto brought forward by the Taoiseach.  The Lehman Brothers defence has been thoroughly discredited by this latest report.  Claims by the Taoiseach and the Government that the current crisis emerged overnight are nonsense.  It was building before 2007 and since.  Any pleadings by the Taoiseach that the crisis in this country is as a result of global forces have been exposed as incorrect.</P>
        <P>The Regling and Watson report has found that the greater part of the crisis in Ireland has been homemade.  The conduct of the banks was a response to economic circumstances which were profoundly influenced by political decisions.  The report also highlights not just the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have been fiscally reckless in shrinking the tax base, while simultaneously extending public spending, but also idiotic in their extraordinary decisions to increase tax incentive schemes.  The report stresses, in vindication of Mr. Honohan&rsquo;s findings, the serious and dangerous faults &ldquo;in macro-economic and budgetary policies which contributed significantly to the economic relying to a clearly unsustainable extent  for Government revenue&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s position as Taoiseach and Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s mandate to lead the country have been compromised even further by the findings of these reports which highlight that domestic mismanagement is at the heart of our economic problems.  Considering the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance at the time of this mismanagement, it leaves one with no alternative but to support the motion.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leat, a Chathaoirligh, as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an r&uacute;n muin&iacute;ne sa Taoiseach agus sa Rialtas.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas an domhain orm seans a bheith agam r&aacute;iteas a dh&eacute;anamh ag an am seo.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To table a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach is truly extraordinary.  The Opposition has now done so in less than three years in the case of two taoisigh which has been unheard of in our democracy.  The world&rsquo;s media watch when any such motion is moved.  My humble advice to Opposition Members is to tread carefully because their time will come when they will be members of a Government.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole highlighted half an hour ago, tabling such motions is unheralded and unnecessary.</P>
        <P>I accept mistakes were made by the Government.  Yesterday the Taoiseach acknowledged property incentives should have been removed long before he abolished them in December 2005.  The international aspect to this crisis, to which Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred, is not acknowledged enough by the Opposition or the media.  There is also the discrepancy in the Opposition&rsquo;s stance on economic issues before and after 2007.  It is extraordinary to recall what was stated in its manifestos from 2002 to 2007 and see its stance on this motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to express my confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government.  The current problems facing them are the hardest any Government has had to face.  The Taoiseach has shown great leadership, calm judgment and the ability to say, &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  These are the qualities we need now.  In the long term he will be remembered for doing the <Col N="371"/>right thing.  Mistakes were made but the Taoiseach is concerned about how we can solve them for the next generation.  He is taking difficult decisions which hurt people and mean the Government is taking a hit in its popularity ratings in the polls.  The Government&rsquo;s term is for five years, for which period it is entitled to govern and then ask for the people&rsquo;s judgment on its work.  At least, the Government will have stood for something and not governed with hindsight which is what the Labour party would do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that there is a certain element of farce, theatre and pantomime about this motion at this time.  Confidence is what the political discourse must be about.  The Houses of the Oireachtas must convey it to all who are out of work and their families.  I am one of them because my eldest daughter and many of her contemporaries, having received a third level education, are hoping to get work.  I understand the pain and distress suffered by people across the country.  The Taoiseach and the Government fully understand them, too.  They are conveying confidence, which has been reciprocated by every international economic commentator from the <i>Financial Times</i> to <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and every finance Minister across Europe.  The path chosen by the Government, led by the Taoiseach, is the right one to follow.  If only one thing comes out of this debate, I hope it is the confidence needed to convey to the people that they can have hope in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Carroll for sharing time.  For 15 of the past 18 years the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, has been in ministerial office.  During that period we have seen unprecedented economic growth in our country.  We have achieved heights that people never dreamt could be achieved.  As the report has shown, mistakes were made in banking, in our regulatory authorities and in our macro-economic policies.  This has been acknowledged by the Taoiseach and others.  It is no consolation that the same mistakes were made on an even larger scale in other economies such as the USA, Britain, Germany, Japan and elsewhere in more developed economies than ours.</P>
        <P>There have been many leaks from time to time from our parliamentary party.  However, one leak that was not made was in October 2008 when the extent of this crisis emerged.  At one of our meetings, when politicians within our party were concerned about the political fallout, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, said to us clearly that this was a time to put the country first, not a time to consider the interests of the party or to deprive the country of any benefit.  Such is the leadership that the country needs and it is exemplified by the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Carroll for sharing time.  Lemass was a great example to all of us.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, often refers to him.  He stated that Lemass instinctively grasped that in difficult economic times, confidence was the gold standard.  In today&rsquo;s circumstances it is worth noting that he sought confidence as a necessary precondition for growth and for pioneering a flourishing economy.  There is irony in this motion because the Opposition is in flux in respect of confidence in its own leader which is obvious and there for all to see.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, as well as the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, saw the ingenuity and capacity of the people as the way to shape a better future for all of us.  There is almost nothing on Earth the Irish people cannot do as well as, if not better than, any other people once they put their minds to it.  Confidence in our Government to bring us through these difficult times is visible from the numbers who have spoken here tonight, in the D&aacute;il and throughout the country.  Such is the confidence in our Government and our Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Carroll for sharing time.  Some 33 years ago on this day I entered the Lower House.  I served with the former Deputy, Ber Cowen, father of the Taoiseach.  I shared an office with him.  He was a Minister of State and a fine colleague.  His son is the Taoiseach.  I am delighted to have the opportunity &mdash; I thank the Opposition for it <Col N="372"/>&mdash; to vote confidence in the Taoiseach.  He is an outstanding Taoiseach.  He has courtesy, courage and conviction.  He alone is working with the Government in providing leadership for the country.  The pension fund which he supported as Minister for Finance was to be rifled by Fine Gael, especially Deputy Enda Kenny, at that time and that would have deprived us of an opportunity to solve the problems of the country at this stage.  I have full confidence in the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is whether we have confidence in the Taoiseach to carry us through this recession.  There are many answers.  My answer is &ldquo;Yes, I do&rdquo;.  He is a humble man.  One could say he has much to be humble about.  He has questions to answer and he has made mistakes.  However, based on the homoeopathic principle that those who make mistakes are probably the best to clear them up, he has shown diligence and attention to duty.  He has shown courage.  He has taken the hardest decision of all; he took on the public sector.  Courage is what we need.  Words are not what we need.  He could have waffled.  He could have come in and given us public relations bromides or he could have done what the spin doctors wanted.  However, he simply did his duty.  It has damaged Fianna F&aacute;il.  It has probably put Fianna F&aacute;il on the ropes, but he did it.  That amounts to acting with good authority and that is what a good Taoiseach does.  He will go down in history as a brave man.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the chance to endorse my confidence in the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen.  The timing for this motion is appalling.  I want the Taoiseach to give us hope.  He is trying his best and putting the country before the party.  He has given us courage.  It is awful when such unrest is going on at this time.  I wish the Taoiseach well.  He has been subjected to such criticism by the media for the past two years.  Everyone should stand back and give him a chance to do the job.  He is doing the best that anyone could do; let there be no doubt about that.  I am here to endorse my confidence in him.</P>

	<P>I thank all Senators who have contributed.  It comes at a most appropriate time, with the publication of two reports that strip away any possible defence the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, could proffer for the actions he took as Minister for Finance.  They strip away the defences and expose the damage that has been done to this economy by his actions, the consequences of which every family in the county is feeling today.  Everyone is feeling the effects and experiencing the distress, including those who face losing their homes, the 440,000 unemployed and the 6,600 who became unemployed last month.  Each of these people are bearing the ill-effects of the decisions he has taken and the reports expose this completely.  The damage done by his decisions are being felt in every hospital ward, every classroom, on every road, in every home and even among those abroad who rely on Irish development aid.  This is the legacy that the Government Senators are defending.  It is indefensible.</P>
        <P>The NESC report referred to the damage done.  It is a report worth reading.  It refers to the damage done by the decisions of Fianna F&aacute;il and the taoisigh referred to tonight, including the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  The report refers to the damage done to a wide range of aspects of Irish life.  It refers to the damage to banking, fiscal damage, economic damage, reputational damage and the damage to the social fabric of this country by the decisions taken by these men in the name of the people.  That is some legacy that the Government Senators are attempting to defend.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle came here and attempted to defend the indefensible.  There is no doubt his lines were directly out of the Fianna F&aacute;il handbook of spin.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue I want to raise relates to lobster fishing, which essentially is a licensed fishing activity.  In County Donegal, I understand there are between 250 and 300 licensed boats associated with lobster fishing.  It is a commercial activity undertaken as such by fishermen.  It adds to their livelihood and essentially is an activity that has been undertaken through the generations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reason I am raising it relates to the fact that many of fishermen in the commercial sector who are licensed &mdash; obviously there is a cost associated with licensing and the upkeep of vessels &mdash; have expressed concerns to me that many holiday homeowners in County Donegal partake in recreational lobster fishing.  The term, &ldquo;recreational lobster fishing&rdquo;, does not require a licence, so this is unlicensed activity, according to the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency.  I was liaising for a number of months with the previous Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, and also with the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency about this issue.  While the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency implements the current legislation, it is unable to enforce any restrictions on the number of pots that may be fished by recreational fishermen.  Such restrictions, I understand, are in place in other EU member states.</P>
        <P>I am not calling for an outright ban on recreational fishing in respect of lobsters, but I am calling on the Department to, perhaps, introduce some form of restriction which would not allow the ongoing situation where the commercial sector is being penalised as a result of the <Col N="377"/>unlicensed sector being able to fish under the clause of recreational fishing, and making quite large landings as well.  There are issues to be addressed.  It is a cause of concern to the commercial sector.  As I have indicated, the commercial sector has invested large amounts of money in the upgrading of vessels and applications for licences on an annual basis.  The Department should seek to alleviate its concerns by addressing the issue.  I hope the Minister of State might take those concerns on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  As a species lobsters are covered under the general legislation on commercial fishing.  At present there is no specific legislation dealing with recreational lobster fishing apart from a prohibition on the capturing of shell fish, including lobsters, by skin diving introduced in the 1960s.  Recreational lobster fishing is not deemed to be commercial fishing.  Essentially recreational lobster fishermen do not sell the lobsters they catch, but rather they keep them for their own personal consumption.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware commercial fishing for lobster is regulated and comes under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and more specifically from an enforcement perspective, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  There is however, no regulation of recreational lobster fishing.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated, recreational lobster fishing may be legitimately carried out provided the catches made by such fishermen are not sold for commercial gain.  While traditionally recreational fishermen were only allowed to fish four pots, I understand that currently there are no restrictions on the amount of lobster pots that may be fished by them, as long as they do not sell their catch.</P>
        <P>It must be stressed that recreational lobster fishing differs from unlicensed commercial lobster fishing whereby lobster catches are offered for sale.  The detection of the latter is an enforcement matter for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  I understand the authority targets inshore fisheries in order to control unlicensed commercial lobster fishing activity.</P>
        <P>The issues raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill are clearly important for commercial lobster fishermen who depend on such fishing for all or part of their livelihood.  Careful consideration must be given to potential conflicts with commercial activity when recreational lobster fishing activity takes place on a large scale.  Indeed, this would have ramifications for the sustainability of stocks as I understand lobster is a slow growing species.</P>
        <P>It is the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention to bring the Senator&rsquo;s concerns regarding the policing and detection of what seems to be essentially unlicensed commercial lobster fishing to the attention of his counterpart, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The Minister of State does not believe the creation of yet another regulatory framework in this instance to deal with recreational lobster fishing is the most appropriate way to deal with the issues raised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>In County Galway today, almost 1,300 children have a hearing impairment and are awaiting their very first assessments by a senior audiological scientist.  These vulnerable children are very much in need of early intervention, if they are to achieve their full potential in adult life.  The fact they are left waiting is completely immoral and unjustified.  If we claim to be protecting the most vulnerable in our society during these very difficult times, we really need to mean that, because it is a phrase that has become somewhat demeaned in recent months.</P><Col N="378"/>
        <P>International best practice and research suggests early intervention for children with hearing impairment is very important.  We have gone out of our way to look at international best practice in relation to other health issues.  For example, we recruited Professor Tom Keane from Canada because it was deemed that cancer detection and treatment services in that country were among the most effective in the world.  It is interesting to note that in Canada, also, all babies are screened at birth for hearing loss and when identified very early on, and given access to hearing technology, the majority of such children born with hearing loss there will learn to talk and function as normal adults when they grow up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been told by the HSE western region that the reason there is no senior audiological scientist operating in County Galway is because it is not allowed to recruit one due to the current embargo on recruitment within the public service.  I simply ask that those 1,300 children in County Galway be given the service and opportunity they deserve to develop to their full potential.  In the past year, despite the embargo, the Department of Finance has deemed it acceptable to allow 885 posts in the public service to be filled where it has been deemed absolutely necessary to have such staff in place.  I implore the Minister of State to make another exception and appoint a senior audiological scientist for County Galway in order that the children mentioned can be given the service they so badly need and deserve.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I am happy to have the opportunity to address the issue raised by the Senator.</P>
        <P>As Members will be aware, under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver or arrange to have delivered on its behalf health and personal social services.  This includes the delivery of audiology services and the prioritising and resourcing of the development of national community audiology services.  I wish to set out the position on national policy on the operation of the general public sector moratorium as it affects health services, including the delivery of audiology services.</P>
        <P>The Government has made it clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues.  To help to achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and reduce public service numbers in the coming years.  This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until the numbers have fallen to the level set out in the employment control framework for the health sector.  The framework for 2010 to 2012 gives effect to the Government decision on employment policy in the public sector and provides that there will be a net reduction in employment of 6,000 between March 2009 and the end of 2012, with consequential pay roll savings.  Based on the reductions in numbers already achieved in 2009, the net target reduction to the end of 2012 is 4,560 whole-time equivalents.  Therefore, the net target reduction in numbers in 2010 and the following two years is 1,520 whole-time equivalents.</P>
        <P>The Government decision has been modulated to ensure key services are maintained in so far as possible in the health service, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.  The framework provides for a number of grades and posts that are exempt from the moratorium on recruitment and promotion.  The HSE also has the capacity under the framework to fill some posts, provided it achieves the overall target reductions.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a relatively low ratio of audiological scientists to the population and, even within the country, there are regional imbalances.  There are significant demands placed on community audiology services nationwide.  Given the aging population, the service will be expected to meet a greatly increased demand.  These and other issues are being addressed in the national review <Col N="379"/>of audiology services commissioned by the HSE.  The overarching objective of the review is to assess the needs of the population for audiology services, audit current provision to assess the extent to which it is both adequate and consistent and make recommendations to address inadequacies and inconsistencies with an implementation road map.  The Department of Health and Children will consider recommendations brought forward by the review which will inform future delivery of this important service.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter and the Minister of State for her attendance in the Chamber.  </P>
        <P>I speak about the regulation of the health and social care worker professions, as provided for in the Health and Social Care Professionals Act.  While I welcome this important legislation, I acknowledge its implementation with regard to the 12 designated professions has taken a little longer than expected.  The legislation is essential to ensure the highest standards of professionalism and competence, thereby ensuring consumer protection.  The professions originally identified for regulation are ones to which highly vulnerable and needy people often turn for assistance.  Consequently, the legislation is essential to provide for their safety.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to provide an update on the current position.  In that context and on foot of previous queries, I am aware that there are other areas in need of similar regulation.  I am delighted that the Irish Institute of Clinical Hypnotherapy and Psychotherapy has made an application seeking inclusion, although I note that its application cannot be considered until the 12 designated professions have been dealt with.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be in a position to indicate a timeframe for the consideration of the institute&rsquo;s application because, in common with other professions, it has not gone as far down the road towards ensuring competence and consumer protection as some of the designated professions.  However, its keenness to seek this for its profession, its wish to put in place whatever is required to ensure regulation and its decision to go down the road of self-regulation in the interim are to be welcomed.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Senator for raising it and giving me the opportunity to update the House on the ongoing regulatory programme undertaken by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Act was passed by the Oireachtas in 2005.  The Act provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for 12 health and social care professions.  The 12 professions to be regulated under the Act are clinical biochemists, dieticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  The structure of the system of statutory registration will comprise a registration board for each of the professions to be registered, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee to deal with disciplinary matters.</P>
        <P>As a first step in implementation of the system of statutory registration, the Minister for Health and Children launched the Health and Social Care Professionals Council in March 2007.  The chief executive officer of the council was appointed in 2008 and additional senior administrative staff took up duty with the council in late 2009.  These appointments, as well as further progress in the establishment of a suitable organisational structure, will greatly assist the council in its ongoing work in preparing for the establishment of the individual registration boards.  The council must establish a registration board for each of the 12 professions currently covered by the Act.  Arrangements for the establishment of the first of these registration boards <Col N="380"/>are being finalised.  The council will enable health and social care professionals to practice in a regulated, controlled and safe environment and in a manner which will ensure the provision of high quality interventions, thereby meeting the challenges of increasingly complex and evolving care for service users.  Health and social care professionals will be facilitated in ensuring responsible and accountable practices, while providing the highest level of patient care and service.</P>
        <P>The focus of the council to date has been on the setting up of organisational structures, the progression of corporate and general processes and the identification of robust financial, human resources and governance systems.  The council has undertaken an enormous amount of preparatory work in readiness for the establishment of the first 13-person registration board, the Social Workers Registration Board, in the coming weeks.  It has carried out considerable work in developing governance arrangements, financial management systems, fitness to practice procedures, meeting ICT requirements and developing other such arrangements  that will be needed to support the establishment and functioning of all registration boards.  It is essential that the first registration board be established with great care as it will serve as the model for all registration boards to follow.</P>
        <P>While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance, to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health and Children to include, on the basis of specific criteria, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, as appropriate.  Section 4 of the 2005 Act sets out the criteria governing the subsequent addition of further professions into the regulatory system at a later date, including the extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge; the extent to which the profession has established itself, including whether there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession&rsquo;s practitioners; the existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and independently assessed entry qualifications; the profession&rsquo;s commitment to continuous professional development; the degree of risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public from incompetent, unethical or impaired practice of the profession, and any other factors that the Minister considers relevant.</P>
        <P>The priority for the Health and Social Care Professionals Council is to establish statutory registration procedures for the 12 designated health and social care professions in the first instance.  The issue of inclusion of other grades such as psychotherapists and hypnotherapists within the scope of the statutory registration system will be considered after the initial designated 12 professional grades have been fully dealt with.</P>
