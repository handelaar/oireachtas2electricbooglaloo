	<P>As Leader of the House and on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I welcome and congratulate Senator Paschal Mooney who, as we all know, was born, bred and reared in his native Drumshanbo, County Leitrim.  This is a proud and memorable day for him, his wife, Sheila, and their children as he takes his seat in Seanad &Eacute;ireann having been elected once more on the Agricultural Panel.  As we all know, he was first elected to the Seanad in 1987 on the Cultural and Educational Panel and went on to contest successfully five elections.  During that time he was Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s spokesman in the Seanad on foreign affairs and a member of many joint and House committees which he represented ably and well.  He is also a past member and chairman of Leitrim County Council and County Leitrim VEC.  Most recently he served as chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland North West.</P>
        <P>Drawing on his vast wealth of knowledge and experience gained over many years in public life, Senator Mooney made a major contribution in respect of a wide range of topics discussed <Col N="3"/>in this House.  I have no doubt he will be equally vocal in his contributions to the 23rd Seanad.  On behalf of everyone present and all those who have known Senator Mooney through the years, I warmly congratulate him.  I look forward to working with him in the remaining two and a half years of this Seanad.</P>

	<P>As the House reconvenes, the country faces many challenges.  I wish to focus on yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Finance in which he outlined the Government&rsquo;s approach to the banking crisis.  When one examines past events, it is clear that the capacity of the powerful in this country to act in private and secret was a major factor in the collapse of the banking system and the damage to the economy.  The idea that the investigation into the cause of that collapse should underpin this culture of privacy and secrecy is a damning indictment of the Government which is comprised of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  When the Leader announced the Order of Business, the very least I would have expected from him was an announcement to the effect that the Seanad would have an opportunity to discuss the inquiry to which I refer.  The views of Members should have been sought on this topic today, particularly in view of fact that it is of concern to everyone and has been the subject of continual media coverage in recent days.  If we are to restore credibility to the D&aacute;il and Seanad and if we are serious about reform &mdash; the House is due to debate a motion on Seanad reform later this evening &mdash; we should have an opportunity to discuss this matter today.  Even if Members on this side of the House disagree with the way the Government is proceed<Col N="4"/>ing, they should at least be given the opportunity to outline their views.  In such circumstances, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that the House should discuss the banking inquiry today in order that Members might have an opportunity to indicate their views.  Those on the Government benches ought to hear what those of us on this side have to say on the establishment of such an inquiry.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad are being undermined by the approach being taken by the Government.  It is a very serious issue for all of us.  At a time when people are so cynical about politics and there is so little faith in politics, it further adds to disillusionment and cynicism which we cannot afford.</P>
        <P>I remind the Leader that he has promised a debate on A Vision for Change and mental health services.  While the House was in recess the Inspector of Mental Health Services published another report.  It is quite clear that A Vision for Change is not being implemented and I ask the Leader to do what he said he would do and have a debate in this House.  This week is the fourth anniversary of A Vision for Change and it deserves a proper debate in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also wish to be associated with what the Leader and Senator Fitzgerald said in congratulating Senator Mooney on his re-election, welcoming him to the House and wishing him well in his restarted career.  I wish him the best of luck.  I hope he can bring some reform to his party&rsquo;s policies in certain areas, to which I look forward.</P>
        <P>I completely agree with the points made by Senator Fitzgerald about the need for a discussion on the banking inquiry.  It is not that I completely agree with the Opposition position on this, nor do I completely agree with the Government position.  However, if something is being discussed everywhere else except in Seanad &Eacute;ireann then there is something wrong about our arrangements.  That is the crucial issue and it should be discussed here.  We should also look at our own consciences.  The airwaves are almost polluted now with politicians piously pontificating about everything around them.  We can all look around and find fault with businesspeople, builders, bankers and others without looking at our own record, which leaves much to be desired.</P>
        <P>In the past couple of weeks I looked back at some of the debates on the crucial issues.  The most crucial issue in recent times was the establishment of the Financial Regulator in 2004.  It is very interesting to look back on the debates held in this and the other House.  Suffice it to say that all parties welcomed the legislation.  The only voice raised against the Financial Regulator at that time came from these benches, where Senator Ross pointed out that it was utterly inadequate to deal with the issues that existed.  However, at the end of the day it did not go to a vote &mdash; we all agreed to it, particularly the two main parties.  On Committee Stage, Senator Cummins made a very strong argument that penalties against the banks in particular were far too low &mdash; how right he was.  However, at the end of the day we voted for it.</P>
        <P>The year before that in the establishment of the IASA legislation dealing with company regulation and the question of directors&rsquo; compliance statements every single group in this House opposed my proposal on compliance statements so much so that the Minister of the day and then T&aacute;naiste had to pull back having come under fierce pressure from Members of all parties and none and soften that provision.  I firmly believe that if that directors&rsquo; compliance statement had been implemented as it was originally drafted it would have led to a very easy conclusion as to what we do with bank directors who act improperly.  I do not want to go into detail or mention anybody, but if we had done as we had requested at that stage, there would have been no doubt about it.  However, at the end of the day we all voted for that legislation and people on all sides of the House talked about it being burdensome legislation.</P>
        <P>I do not want to hear people talking about everyone else making mistakes.  As many mistakes were made in these Houses and regulators were given insufficient power at all levels.  Those <Col N="5"/>two pieces of legislation were presented by then Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, whose final comment was that it was business-friendly legislation.  That is what governed all that legislation.  We also need to take some responsibility for what happened.  Let us not walk away from our responsibilities here.  We need to be very honest and straightforward about it.  This is complex.  It is not just about businesspeople and bankers.  It is also about ourselves, the political classes.  We did not give enough authority to regulators and others.  Apart from the Members in my own group, the only people who gave me substantial support on the compliance statement were those in the Labour Party.  Then Senator McDowell supported it strongly.  The idea of a statement from directors of companies that they believed they acted correctly and honestly was considered a bridge too far.  That is where we are and we should be absolutely clear that we have a great deal to answer for also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the other voices in welcoming and congratulating Senator Mooney back to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I wish him every success &mdash; I hope he will not take this personally &mdash; in the short time he will be here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not going to Europe yet. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate him and his family on his achievement. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope everybody&rsquo;s stay here will be just as short as Senator Mooney&rsquo;s.  That was not a personal remark directed at him. </P>
        <P>As regards the banks, Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole are absolutely right.  It is extraordinary that we are not discussing the issue today.  I ask the Leader to address it directly.  I suspect he will say there is an issue about the availability of Ministers.  We respect that and understand the position.  However, it is not necessary for the Minister for Finance or a Minister of State at the Department of Finance to be here for us to have a debate in the House.  The proof is that each time we have discussed the banks, there has been a queue of Ministers in and out of the Seanad during the course of the debate.  I believe I counted seven on one occasion.  Therefore, it is not, in fact, necessary for a particular Minister to be here for us to have such a debate.  I ask for it to take place today and respectfully second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s motion to the Order of Business.  We should debate the issue today because everybody else is talking about it.</P>
        <P>The type of inquiry a committee of the Oireachtas may undertake is a live issue in the country.  The Supreme Court decision in the Abbeylara case is in place, on which I have two brief points to make.  First, there is the question of the restrictions on the Oireachtas in making findings of fact which could touch on the personal culpability of individuals.  I understand clearly that there is such a caveat contained within that decision.  Second, there is the issue as to whether the Oireachtas ever had lawful authority to carry out such inquiries.  These issues are very much on the table.</P>
        <P>My party brought forward legislation in the other House to deal with the second of these two issues, but it was rejected by the Government.  On the first issue, I do not accept that it is not possible for a committee of the Oireachtas to hold a meaningful inquiry into what went wrong in the banking system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;without touching on the personal culpability of individuals because there are other places in which that matter should be dealt with.  I am a strong supporter of those who say the criminal justice system is where criminal charges ought to be dealt with. <Col N="6"/> However, this does not prevent serious politicians who claim to have credibility from having an inquiry into the lending practices of the banks to determine what strategies were in place, why AIB and Bank of Ireland now proclaim they had a difficulty because Anglo Irish Bank was doing certain things and they had to follow suit.  We need to know what strategies were employed and, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly said, the history of regulation, including that by politicians.  These issues do not turn on the personal culpability of individuals in terms of the level of criminality, rather they are legitimate questions which ought to be pursued in a public inquiry.  I believe they could be dealt with, without any worries on a constitutional level, by a committee of the Oireachtas.  We could deal with that matter in the debate, as I am sure the Cathaoirleach will tell me if I go on about it for too long. </P>
        <P>The second issue I want to raise can be addressed by the Government, that is, the extraordinary statement or indication to the effect that the commission of inquiry will hold its investigations other than in public.  What is the reason for this secrecy?  What is the exact position?  Last week the hapless Senator Boyle was telling the country that the Green Party was going to a deliver a public inquiry.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, has learned a great deal since he went into Government because he is telling us that black is white and that the inquiry will be held in public.  It is a question of saying, in effect, &ldquo;Well, we are a small party in government; we tried and pushed, but could not deliver.&rdquo;  However, the Minister does not say this, rather he says it will be held in public.  What exactly is going on?</P>
        <P>Apparently, the Taoiseach said this morning that the commission of inquiry could decide to hold hearings in public.  That is a different line.  If he is prepared to contemplate the commission of inquiry deciding to hold hearings in public, what is stopping the Government from including it in the terms of reference that the inquiry will be held in public?  There is an overwhelming public interest in this inquiry being held in public.  The impact of what has happened to the banks and those to whom they loaned money is in the public domain.  The 300,000 empty houses are there to be seen plainly by everybody and the impact on people&rsquo;s lives is also there to be seen.  There should be an inquiry and it should be held in public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join others in welcoming Senator Mooney back to the House.  I know the House will be a much better place for his participation.  In my first term here, I learned much from him and I hope to continue to learn from him as he participates in debates up to 2012.  I am sure we are all confident that this Administration will serve its full term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Contrary to other speakers, I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement that we are going to have an inquiry into the banking crisis.  Last week, there were many empty seats at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service when we discussed the issue.  I welcome the fact, however, that many more people want to discuss it now.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s approach whereby we will have two preliminary reports, one by the Central Bank and another by a so-called wise international expert.  That will help us to frame the appropriate terms of reference for a statutory commission to investigate this matter.  Like anybody else, including all my colleagues, I share the anger over why we are in these difficulties.  Much pain is being felt by many householders all over the country as a result of a reckless regulatory financial regime, internationally and nationally.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I would love it if we could line people up, metaphorically speaking.  However, it would seem the media and others would like, in reality, to see the guillotine set up in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to begin the beheadings.  Thankfully, however, we have due process.  I am confident it will provide us with the pound of flesh which all of us rightfully seek.  I believe the public deserve it.  I am not prepared, however, to tell the Munster team &mdash; to use a metaphor &mdash; next Friday night that by their team selection today they will lose the game.  Unlike Fine Gael which would like to abolish this House, I still have some respect for our democratic institutions.  I believe in this Administration&rsquo;s capacity to establish the necessary terms of reference to give people peace of mind and give them their rightful pound of flesh, which they deserve. </P>
        <P>I wish to call for a much more important debate on the draft legislative package on reforming the EU&rsquo;s financial supervisory and regulatory framework.  After all, that is what will ensure that this mess will not recur.  I am seeking that debate as a matter of the utmost urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Having listened to Senator Boyle earlier in the week, I understood it was most likely that we would have a public inquiry.  Instead, however, we will have this whitewashed, secret approach behind closed doors.  Senator MacSharry is in cloud-cuckoo land if he thinks it will deliver, especially as it will not be transparent, which is the bottom line.  We all want a meaningful public inquiry.  My sympathy goes to Mr. Honohan, the Governor of the Central Bank, concerning how he will investigate his own staff.  There are questions about the legality of that and whether he will be able to deliver upon it.  I am very disappointed about this matter. </P>
        <P>I wish the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, well in facing his difficult illness.  He has all my sympathy as well as that of my constituents in County Westmeath.  I want to let him know that, on a personal level, we are very supportive of him and the way in which he has dealt with this sad news.  I am sure he will do very well in every way, however.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments on A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy.  The Leader has given commitments that we would have such a debate.  Senator Corrigan has always advocated a debate on that report.  Two wards in our local hospital, St. Loman&rsquo;s, were cited as being unfit for human habitation.  That is shameful in this day and age.  It is urgent that we have a debate on A Vision for Change.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator McFadden&rsquo;s views on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, whom I wish a very speedy recovery.  He is a courageous man and has given great leadership.  He has proved to be a tremendous Minister for Finance.  He has shown great courage in his difficulties and has greatly encouraged those with similar difficulties.  We wish him every success.  We very badly need him to continue to work for us.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I join Senators in commending Senator Paschal Mooney on his return to the House.  He is an extremely able politician.  He put up a great performance in the elections to the European Parliament on 5 June.  He received an enormous number of votes in the North West constituency.  It was a great achievement in the circumstances.  The Senator guaranteed a seat for Fianna F&aacute;il in the European Parliament.  I know what it is like being out of the House for a number of years and I was out four times longer than Senator Mooney.  It is great that he is back and I am delighted he is here.  This Chamber is back to where it was in the past.  I wish the Senator well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole tabled a motion on so-called head shops, which matter was raised on the Joe Duffy show, &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;.  There is an Adjournment Matter tabled on this subject also but I do not know whether it has been accepted.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State at the Department of <Col N="8"/>Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Curran, to the House to discuss head shops?  Senator Wilson raised the issue in November 2008 when he fought a very serious campaign on the growth of so-called head shops.  In an article in the <i>Irish Mail on Sunday</i> on 17 January it was stated the new cocaine in the head shops is 100% legal.  Head shops are using a loophole in the law to flood our cities with drugs that have tipped youngsters into a life of psychiatric treatment.  The article reveals the shocking truth behind what occurs.  The article was by Dr. Chris Luke of University College Hospital, Cork, who said young people will die as a result of the availability of these drugs.</P>
        <P>It has come to our attention that there is a proposal to open a head shop in Roscommon town.  This is causing tremendous concern.  There was a protest on Castle Street, Roscommon, on this issue.  It is not a question of any one shop because they are technically legal.  They are paying their rates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

	<P>We are not promoting the Joe Duffy programme in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is a very serious issue.  There are serious drugs being peddled in these shops and they are causing life-long difficulties for young people.  We have a duty in this House to address the problem.  I recommend to Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole that they introduce a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on this matter and try to bring it through this House as quickly as possible.  It is a matter of grave urgency.  Something must be done about it immediately.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, or the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, to address it in the House.  The national drug control centre should also be involved.  It is a total anomaly that head shops are allowed to operate.  People are very concerned.  Approximately 70 people were protesting this morning in Roscommon.  This reflects concerns about such shops throughout the country.  The shops represent the greatest growth industry and the drugs are extremely dangerous.  They are a replacement for the illegal drugs that are available on the streets.</P>

	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that we take No. 1 with discussion at the conclusion of the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I congratulate my good friend, Senator Paschal Mooney, who is one of the finest orators I have ever heard in this House.  He lent his eloquence to the defence of human rights consistently during his previous term in the House.  I take pleasure in welcoming him back.</P>
        <P>There are some sad things happening, particularly the election of Mr. Scott Brown in Massachusetts.  This is appalling when one considers that he has been elected in the heart of liberal Irish-America to replace Senator Edward Kennedy.  The American people, in spite of everything they know about Iraq, have elected somebody who openly espouses waterboarding and says it is appropriate to torture people.  He is not fit to be elected.  The American people in that constituency have shown themselves not to be fit to carry the torch of western values.  They certainly do not speak for me.</P><Col N="9"/>
        <P Just="Left">There was welcome news in the legislative programme that I received from the Department of the Taoiseach today.  It lists the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill.  Will the Leader inform the House when this Bill will be finalised?  It is an important fund.  I have worked with Ms Trina Vargo, one of those involved in it, and it does much credit to the country.  The Mitchell scholarships are so highly regarded that last year a potential student turned down an interview for a Rhodes scholarship to come to Ireland on one.  It is the best public relations Irish universities could possibly have.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Taoiseach have said the scholarships would be supported.  I am glad that after a long delay the financial measures to match funding will be put in place.  I would be grateful if the Leader could give some information on the exact status of the Bill.</P>

	<P>Since the House last sat, several issues have emerged which have been good, distressing, sad and horrific.  One of the good news stories was the re-election of Senator Paschal Mooney to the House.  One of the distressing items was the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s illness and how it was brought into the public domain.  The sad matter was thedeath of Cardinal Daly.  I was privileged to be at his funeral, a very joyous occasion in a sad                                                  way.</P>
        <P>In October I commended people working together for new beginnings for Northern Ireland.  One of the new beginnings was the Gaelic football tournament between the PSNI, the Garda, the New York Police Department and the London Metropolitan Police Service, held in south Belfast and which the Democratic Unionist Party Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Mr Nelson McCausland, attended.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That week the PSNI team was captained by Peadar Heffron.  He now remains in a critical but stable condition in the Royal Hospital, Belfast.  Having visited the hospital, I commend Peadar, his wife, Fiona, and their families for their dedication, quiet dignity and great determination to see him through his horrific attack.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader set aside an hour this week to allow us to say those people who dare to say they carry out these attacks in the name of republicanism are not representing the people of any part on this island?  We must say these attacks are not acceptable, that we have moved on and that the Good Friday Agreement was accepted by the majority of the people of this island.  If these attacks are an effort to stop Gaelic-speaking, Gaelic football players joining the PSNI, we must be of one voice to say it is not acceptable and it does not represent us or any others on this island.</P>
        <P>If we left such a debate go beyond this week, we would do a disservice to our future.  We have a new future, signalled by many events but none more so than that particular football tournament in October.  I would like to think the House, all parties united, will send a clear and loud message of condemnation from the Twenty-six Counties to our friends in the Six Counties.  We must say these attacks are not what we want and do not represent our views.  Instead, we want to see those who blew up this gentleman caught and prosecuted.  Anyone with any information should come forward.  We must be clear in our unity on this subject.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There were many events during the Christmas and festive season which warrant comment today, one of which I would like to mention, namely, the death of Mr. Jens Bang, a Danish citizen and former European Commission official and my father-in-law.  I have a specific reason for mentioning this event.  In Denmark, when a person dies, the death is recorded in a central register, thus ensuring all public authorities, including the tax authorities and those who deal with pensions and social welfare issues and the electoral register, as well as banks, doctors and dentists, are immediately informed of the death.  That is how the Danish <Col N="10"/>system works.  This means that in Denmark it is not possible for a person to claim for 23 years the pension of a dead person, as occurred here and reported in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on 15 January.  The amount involved was &euro;140,000.</P>
        <P>We have had repeated public statements from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on the need to tackle social welfare fraud and reports on this matter from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There are also problems with the electoral register.  Late last year there was reference to dentists arranging appointments for dead people.  Such instances of fraud and criminality are resulting in bleeding of funds from the public purse.  We need to consider the introduction of an integrated civil registration system as in place in Denmark to ensure our public authorities have the basic information required to deal with fraud, the cheating of the system and ensure they are in a position to provide an effective service.  We have a PPS number system, but it does not work.  There have been recent reports of PPS numbers being traded.  In investigating issues for a few individuals I learned that people often have two PPS numbers accorded to them, which is creating problems in the system.  We need to put in place an essential administrative infrastructure in this regard.  A starting point should be the introduction of an integrated civil registration system of the type mentioned.  I ask the Leader to allow time for a debate on this matter with a view to dealing with the issue of wholesale fraud on the public purse at a time when the public finances are so stretched.</P>

While the region is not represented in the D&aacute;il, it has two representatives in the Seanad to fight its cause.  I also take the opportunity to congratulate Senator Mooney&rsquo;s family.  They were involved in politics a long time before I became involved in County Leitrim.  I have no doubt that it is heart warming for his wife and family to see him returned to the Seanad.

        <P>Today air traffic controllers went on strike for four hours.  While we all accept people have a right to strike, in so doing the air traffic controllers disrupted air travel and caused the cancellation of up to 160 flights.  I do not believe all of the available methods to solve the dispute, by way of the various resources available to employers and unions, were utilised.  This serious issue must be addressed.  It might be useful if we were to have a debate in the House on how unions and employers deal with such strikes.  I would call this a wildcat strike.  It cannot be called anything else, but the damage it does to this country and to the outside view of it is something that must be looked at.  I am asking this in the hope that the Leader will arrange for a debate on how the labour laws are used to deal with and try to prevent strikes.  Today&rsquo;s action does nothing only cause serious disruption to people who want to travel and, on top of that, it damages the good name of Ireland in the international scene.</P>

	<P>I join others in welcoming Senator Mooney to the House.  I have not had the pleasure of working with him previously, given that I am a relatively new Senator, but I look forward to doing so in the future.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on overseas aid.  It is a topic that is uppermost in many of our minds as we see the horrific effects of the dreadful earthquake in Haiti.  It certainly put our problems with water shortages, the big snow and the freeze, etc. into perspective for all of us in the past week.  I congratulate the Government on sending aid so promptly to Haiti.  However, it shows the need for us to ensure we maintain our levels of overseas aid spending which I was distressed to see cut in the budget.  A debate on this would be appropriate at this time.</P>
        <P>I also want to raise a different issue for debate with the Leader, that is, the effect of the public sector pay cut on a particular group of individuals, namely, research contract staff in universities and third level institutions.  This was raised with me by the Trinity Research Staff Association, but clearly it has implications across third level institutions.  It seems that these contract staff, many of whom are paid by the private sector by trusts and research funds and who have no security of employment because they are only on contract, will be made subject to the public sector pay cut as if they were civil servants or tenured public servants.  If we cannot have a debate, I wish to table a matter on the Adjournment.  I will have support from my colleagues among the university Senators.  It is an issue we need to look at.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the call made by Senators Fitzgerald, Alex White and O&rsquo;Toole for a debate on the banking inquiry.  Listening to an interview with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, it really seems as if the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il are speaking about two different inquiries to be conducted in parallel, one in private and one in public, one with a short timeframe and one which could go on until after the next election.  In terms of the timeframe and the way the inquiry is to be conducted, it seems that the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il are speaking in two voices.</P>

	<P>We need to know the exact nature of the inquiry.  When the Minister, Deputy Gormley, states he is satisfied with the shape of it, all we can conclude is that this inquiry is likely to be pear-shaped because it does not seem it is being put together with any sort of coherence.  It reminds me of a quote in the US used famously in the 1960s &mdash; the rich get richer and the poor get prison.  In the US they have reformed their criminal justice structures on white collar crime to ensure people are made accountable where the banking system collapsed and inquiries were conducted in a timely fashion.  We have much to learn from that.  Unfortunately, in Ireland, it seems the rich still get richer and the poor still get prison.</P>

Let us not play politics with the issue.  We will have an opportunity to have a political dimension when there is an election.  Time and again one hears it suggested the people do not want it.

        <P>We all have our own views on how the banking inquiry should proceed, what its terms of reference should be and so on.  However, the fact is that the public has a right to know the truth.  As legislators, we have a right to ensure it knows the truth.  Some &euro;54 billion in bonds will be issued to the banks in the coming months when the transfers begin to roll through to NAMA which is a done deal at this stage.  We hope for the sake of the country that it will be successful.  However, my major concern is that we get the economy working properly again.  To this end, we need a robust banking system.  However, the banks are not positioning themselves properly to restore confidence and win back trust.</P>
        <P>Despite the few honourable exceptions who fell on their sword, let us consider the many who still serve on boards and in senior management positions.  These are the ones who made gross mistakes, steered us onto the rocks, signed off on irregular and risky lending practices.  None of this should have taken place.  They were misadventures.  Surely their removal could take place without prejudicing an inquiry.  The public interest directors appointed by the Government should insist on this, if necessary at the direction of the Government, as we must get the economy working.  Sadly, this will not happen without a robust banking system.  For that reason I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Fitzgerald.</P>

	<P>I welcome Senator Mooney back to the House.  He gave great service to his county of Leitrim for many years and I know he will continue to do so.  Leitrim is now very well served with two great Senators.  I am delighted to see the Senator back, for himself and his family, and I believe he will be able to make a major contribution to this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport to the House to discuss emergency funding for roads, particularly the minor roads in south Carlow.  Carlow was badly affected and was one of the coldest places during the 30-day period.  The temperatures there were -10&deg; <Col N="14"/>Celsius and -15&deg; Celsius.  Consequently, the smaller roads in the south Carlow and Mount Leinster areas have suffered greatly.  Kilometres of road have disintegrated and families are now cut off from going into the town of Borris to do their normal day-to-day shopping.  Farmers are cut off in that area when they try to get to their lands and farms to feed their sheep and cattle.  There should be an emergency fund, not necessarily for County Carlow, but for roads that were very badly damaged during that particular bad period.  From what I can see in the south Carlow area, what happened was that the extreme frost and the flooding disintegrated at least four to five kilometres of road, which is phenomenal.  I would like to see the Minister in the House for a full debate on that.  I am sure there are other parts of the country that suffered equally badly.  I would like to see the Minister holding an inquiry into the areas that were badly affected in order that money can get directly to them first.  There are areas that suffered somewhat but this is extreme and something should be done about it.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Malley in supporting the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and what she has done.  She has done a great deal for the young people of this country by getting good value for money.  There is a lesson to be learned in every Department, namely, that when one is spending money of that magnitude one must look for the best price for the product one is buying.  For far too long in this country we allowed ourselves to pay more than our European partners pay.  I congratulate the Minister in that regard.  However, I ask her to look at the situation in accident and emergency departments, one of the areas in health that is letting us down badly.  If it could be solved a great number of problems in the health services would be dealt with and brought up to the standards we deserve.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s call for a debate on the first item.  The best part of the proceedings of this House very often takes place on the Order of Business.  To restrict that is something we should decide not behind closed doors but in this House and, therefore, I formally second the motion made by Senator Norris.</P>
        <P>I have a concern about the unbridled use and right to strike.  The air traffic controllers&rsquo; strike today is a disgrace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have a real problem with the economy.  We must get our costs down, become competitive and use modern technology.  For people to close down, not only our airports and the aeroplanes that fly from and into them but also all passing traffic across the Atlantic which must now veer away from us, is not acceptable.  The air traffic controllers in the US went on strike the very week former US President Reagan was inaugurated in 1981.  He told them that if they did not go back to work, they would be dismissed and would never work again as air traffic controllers.  He stuck to his word and there has been no strike by air traffic controllers in the United States since.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am a great admirer of this House, the Constitution and how we do things in this country.  However, when one looks abroad one can see other ways of doing things.  I can offer three examples.  A commission of inquiry into the Iraq war is taking place in the British Houses of Parliament.  The inquiry has brought former Prime Ministers and others before it.  It is open to <Col N="15"/>the public and its work is visible.  It is clear that it is investigating this issue.  I am not sure why we cannot do that.  Perhaps the Abbeylara inquiry has something to do with it or perhaps the Constitution does not permit it.  If so, we must re-examine how we do these things.</P>
        <P>The second relates to something mentioned by Senator Ivana Bacik, namely, how the Americans deal with white collar crime.  Bernie Madoff was in handcuffs and in jail within weeks of being caught.  Perhaps the reason is that he admitted his guilt, but it is an awfully long time since we have found anybody guilty of white collar crime in this country.  There might be something we could do differently in that regard.</P>
        <P>Third, I drive a German car.  When I got the car it already contained a first aid kit and a triangle for use in case of an emergency.  I understand this is the law in Germany and France.  The first aid kit costs &euro;10 to &euro;15, while the triangle costs &euro;5 to &euro;10.  It would not be a huge cost to introduce legislation in this regard, particularly when one considers the last few weeks and the accident rate we experienced.</P>
        <P>On that basis, there are some things we can learn from other countries.  Many of the standards we have set in this country have been followed in other countries.  Let us ensure we do not close our eyes to the fact that sometimes we can learn from what happens elsewhere too.</P>

        <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the Government&rsquo;s proposal to investigate the banks, which I fully support?  The question at issue is not very difficult.  It is about lending, the amount of lending and the purpose of the lending.  To suggest there is something untoward to be found other than the answer to that question is not realistic.  The majority of the people who work in the banks have done their job correctly and well.  However, there were a few who did not, and there was a rule from the top which dictated the policy on lending.  The biggest difficulty was the type of lending.  It appears to have been off balance sheet or off the public accounts.  People were getting massive bonuses, in line with those in New York, not on the quality of the lending but on its volume.  The upshot has been that the banks and the people who owned the banks have had their share values virtually wiped out.  The practices of the bank officials who were responsible for that must be checked in the future.  Given that the new Basel requirements will mean less bank lending because the reserve ratios will be higher, we must ensure that whatever lending takes place in the economy is well and properly directed.</P>
        <P>Third, I wish to raise the proposed debate on Haiti and the necessary work taking place there.  I praise the Americans in particular in that regard.  They receive terrible criticism at times, yet we see them doing wonderful work in ensuring their neighbourhood is well looked after by getting in there quickly with as much aid as possible.  That should be commented on and commended.  If they are looking for expertise for rebuilding Haiti, the Israelis could give them good advice on how to rebuild a nation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have two questions for the Leader.  Will he ask the Taoiseach to confirm that he will do the same for all public servants as he did for the senior <Col N="16"/>civil servants?  In a sneaky Cabinet move on 23 December, their pay cuts of 12% and 15%, respectively, were reversed to 3% and 5%, respectively.  What was that about?  How could it be fair?  Why is he giving preferential treatment to senior civil servants who are on salaries of more than &euro;165,000 per annum?  This is where public trust and confidence has been lost.  Is it the case that the Taoiseach is afraid of them?  Are they covering up for the Government?  I would respect a response to this question from the Taoiseach, through the Leader of the House.  I will persist with this question until I get an answer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is another cover-up with the banking inquiry.  If there is nothing to cover up, why is it not being held in public?  We need three dimensions to the banking inquiry.  Senator MacSharry said there was regulatory recklessness, but there might also have been political recklessness.  Did the concept of the Financial Regulator not originate from the office of the Minister for Finance?  At the time the Minister for Finance was the current Taoiseach.  There must be openness if there is to be a banking inquiry.  In fact, we should not have a banking inquiry at all unless it is open and transparent.  Let us not waste any more public money and our very scant resources.  The way the inquiry is currently framed is a sham.  Does the Taoiseach have respect for the taxpayers, whose futures have been mortgaged, whose homes are at risk and who have lost their jobs?  He is seeking to waste their money on an inquiry that is less than transparent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I look forward to receiving replies to those two questions from the Taoiseach through the Leader of the House.</P>

As I was first elected to the House on the Cultural and Educational Panel with Senator Mooney, I know him very well.  We have always worked well together.  He is certainly a very fine parliamentarian and has a great grasp of the issues.</P>
        <P>The people we represent have been watching for something in recent months.  They were watching, first, to see if there would be an inquiry into the banking sector and, second, to see if the inquiry would have any meaning or depth.  In a manner of speaking, we have given them an inquiry, but we have failed the people in that it is not open and transparent.  It is bad for democracy, this Parliament and the political process.  It is wrong that hard-pressed taxpayers whose wages have been affected by these events must be told on television that there will be a secret inquiry and no open or transparent process.</P><Col N="17"/>
        <P>In matters of public policy and public administration, there is no need for a commission-style inquiry.  The inquiry should have been held in an open forum.  It should have been an Oireachtas inquiry.  Notwithstanding the Abbeylara case, it would have been possible to examine policies, decision making processes, administration and public policy.  We have done the people and ourselves a wrong because we have added to the public&rsquo;s cynicism and disillusionment and people&rsquo;s disconnect from the Houses, which is a great pity.  We should have had an accountable process in this Parliament.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn made an interesting point when he cited the UK&rsquo;s inquiry into the Iraq war as a comparison.  Prime Ministers, the great and the good are being brought forward to be questioned in public.  It might not be too late for us yet.  Even at this late stage, I appeal to the Government to consider changing the inquiry.  Otherwise, it will be a disgrace.  The IMF reckons that our banking crisis will cost taxpayers approximately &euro;24 billion.  It is not right that they will not see a public inquiry.  The Americans who started their revolution of independence stated, &ldquo;No taxation without representation,&rdquo; which was the battle cry at the Boston tea party.</P>

        <P>Those of us involved in party politics know that loyalty is easy when one is winning, but not so easy when one is not winning.  Despite the fact that Senator Mooney accrued more than 40,000 votes and might not have been treated in the most tender fashion by his party, he stayed loyal.  I am delighted he has reaped the reward for this and for his abilities.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader raise a matter with the Minister for Transport and, if necessary, ask him to appear in the House for a debate on safety procedures at Dublin Airport?  In recent days, a number of incoming flights needed to be diverted to Belfast and elsewhere.  A small number of landings needed to be aborted virtually at the last minute.  I am informed this is due to the airport&rsquo;s low-visibility fog system not working effectively.  During slack periods late at night and early in the morning, groundworks were carried out on some of the runways.  When freezing fog is the norm, safety should always be first and development works on runways should be second.  I believe my information is correct and I experienced one of the flights in question.  Will the Leader raise this issue with the Minister as a matter of urgency?</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s remarks concerning the Minister for Health and Children.  There was a resounding silence to the recent good news, but the Minister has been pilloried for the past ten years.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I compliment Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole and the other Independent Members on putting motion No. 22 on the agenda.  I hope it will be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Head shops are causing havoc and severe health problems for many.  There is no control, licensing or regulation of the products being sold.  Will the Minister for Health and Children attend the House immediately to address this problem?  Last year, Senators Wilson and McFadden raised the matter of BZP, which thankfully was banned a number of days later.  All of the products being sold in the shops in question must be controlled and licensed, since they are doing untold harm to many of the people using them.  I ask that the motion be dealt with as a matter of urgency and that the Minister attend the House to respond to people&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I join Senator Keaveney in expressing disgust at the car bombing of a gentleman in the PSNI.  He is fluent in Irish and played Gaelic games.

I pay tribute to him for his dedication and commitment to the House and various organisations for two decades.  I warmly congratulate him, Sheila and his family.  We have missed him for the past two and a half years.  He mentioned that he might require a pairing soon, but I hasten to say that he should consider himself to have been paired for the past two and a half years and that no pairings will be forthcoming in the near future.</P>
        <P>Like many Senators, I welcome the Government&rsquo;s inquiry into the banks.  While this might not satisfy some inside and outside the House, I am confident the Government is doing as much as it can not to hinder the investigations carried out by the Financial Regulator and the Garda.  I look forward to the outcome of all the investigations.</P>
        <P>As Senator Coghlan and others have pointed out, the public have a right to know what went wrong in our banking system.  However, it is important that we not take our eye off the ball in terms of banks.  Small and large businesses have closed and are about to close the length and breadth of the country simply because they cannot get credit.  This is the public&rsquo;s most immediate concern.  No credit is available, but the banks are, if the House will excuse my unparliamentary language, screwing the ordinary person daily.  We should not let them off the hook in this respect.</P>

My mother has just finished treatment for cancer and, thankfully, has fully recovered.

To date, the Minister has dealt with his illness with courage and dignity.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange time for an urgent debate on the state of the public water supply system?  That system is creaking at the seams and on the first occasion on which it faced a challenge it was unable to cope.  In 2007 Forf&aacute;s compiled an extremely informative report on our national water supply system and concluded that we spend over &euro;500 million per annum to produce drinking water.  Some 48% of that water is lost or simply disappears during the journey from treatment plants to people&rsquo;s taps.  When it reaches people&rsquo;s homes, only 15% of it is used for drinking.  The remainder is flushed down toilets or used to wash cars, water gardens etc.</P>
        <P>There is a need for an urgent and radical reappraisal of how we produce and use drinking water.  As part of its NewEra document, Fine Gael proposed the establishment of a semi-State national water supply company.  I wholeheartedly support this concept.  It is farcical that there is no interconnection among the 34 local authorities when it comes to water supplies.  One could imagine what would happen if the ESB had 34 electricity generating stations located in the various counties and if the supplies provided by these terminated at county borders.  It would be as ridiculous as that which obtains in respect of water supplies.</P>
        <P>On Monday morning last, the River Avoca in County Wicklow burst its banks but there were people in south Dublin who had no water.  In south Galway, thousands of acres of land remain flooded while some 50% of the towns in the county, including that in which I live, have not had water since Christmas day.  It is farcical that we are doing nothing to collect a resource which falls from the sky, free of charge.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland, which administers the greener homes scheme, has sensibly put in place a grant-aid system in respect of solar panels, pellet-fuelled stoves etc.  This represents a wise employment of Government funds to encourage a more sustainable use of a natural resource.  It is time we considered water harvesting as a mechanism to ensure we have a constant and reliable water supply.  Provision in this regard should be made within the grant-aid system to which I refer.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I also offer my condolences to Senator Regan on the death of his father-in-law.  The Senator raised a very interesting issue in the context of the Danish system of control relating to statutory authorities.  I believe some work in that regard has been done in this country.  There are issues in respect of data protection, the sharing of information and the creation of big brother scenarios.  I listened with interest to Senator Regan&rsquo;s comments and perhaps it might be possible to make progress along the lines to which he refers.</P><Col N="20"/>
        <P>I am of the view that the vast majority of people have a low threshold for strike action and industrial unrest.  Members of the public recognise that more productive outcomes can be achieved by way of negotiating.  It is regrettable that due to the fact that new equipment which is designed to improve air passenger safety was being introduced, air traffic controllers felt compelled to take action.  The latter was followed by a reaction from the Irish Aviation Authority, which gave rise to the situation in which we now find ourselves.  Those involved should seek a resolution without delay.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I listened with interest to the comments of previous speakers in respect of a banking inquiry.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have stated that the public is entitled to a full examination in respect of what went wrong.  The Government is intent on providing what everyone wants, namely, an inquiry into what went wrong.  I received a document from a former Fine Gael Minister &mdash; it made for interesting reading &mdash; who has been through a tribunal of inquiry.  Anyone who has not already read the document to which I refer should do so.  The document would lead one to say that we should learn from our past mistakes with regard to the appointment of tribunals of inquiry, some of which did not fulfil the purpose for which they were established.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have endeavoured to establish an inquiry, restore public and international confidence in the Irish banking system and do that which was outlined by Senator Wilson.  We need a functioning banking system because there are individuals and small and large businesses which are suffering, not as a result of bad practices employed or decisions taken by people within the banks but because of a lack of liquidity in the system.  A cash injection is required in order that we might kick-start the economy.  If a debate is to take place in the House in respect of the inquiry, provision should be made to discuss fully the liquidity that will be injected into the system in each of the four financial quarters of this year.</P>

	<P>I also welcome the re-election of Senator Mooney.  I do not know the Senator but I am sure we will engage with each other during the coming months and years.</P>
        <P>I support the calls for a public inquiry into banking.  I do so not because other politicians are requesting such an inquiry but because ordinary people, who understand what is happening, are seeking it.  We are doing a great disservice to the public interest by not having a fully transparent inquiry into banking.  It is time for honesty and truth.  While the Government has promised to establish an inquiry, we must ask why there is a need to keep it secret.  Why will the inquiry be held behind closed doors?  Why is the period to which it will relate being limited to events which took place prior to the end of September 2008?  These are pertinent questions and they must be answered.</P>
        <P>If we are to restore confidence in the banking sector and in the economy, this would be a good starting point.  By establishing an open inquiry, the Government could take the lead in this regard.  Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach and the Government to cast off the cloak of secrecy with regard to the inquiry, restore full confidence and transparency and give the people something genuine, open and honest with which to engage?</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">I support the comments of previous speakers regarding the condition of the road network following the recent adverse weather conditions.  Not only am I referring to local and secondary roads in this regard but also to the national and primary routes that have been seriously damaged.  There are many roads which are littered with potholes and craters and which have been affected by serious subsidence.  As late as last week, the Minister for Transport, who is responsible for the funding of our roads, stated publicly that he would not provide emergency funding to local authorities.  I am very surprised at that statement because I am sure he is hearing from representatives, like the Leader and others from the other side of the House with <Col N="21"/>Fianna F&aacute;il and other Government party councillors throughout the country &mdash; not that there are too many Green Party councillors &mdash; about the damage to our road network which is essential for the everyday life of business and society.  It is essential for the Minister to listen to those representatives and provide emergency funding because if he is not listening, he is obviously in cloud-cuckoo land and is not in touch.  It is essential that funding be provided for local authorities to reinstate these roads.</P>

	<P>Like many of my colleagues, I warmly welcome Senator Mooney back to the House.  I was very pleased to support him as a candidate in the European Parliament elections.  He secured a fantastic vote and while he did not make it, many people knew he was around.  I was pleased in a practical sense because he does not just talk the talk but also walks the walk.  He was very easy to sell because as a Member of the Oireachtas and as a member of Leitrim County Council, Senator Mooney has been one of our finest public representatives.  I welcome him home again.  I am sure that as in the past he will show himself worthy of again being a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>A few years ago a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children published a report on the adverse effect of pharmaceuticals on society.  It would be worth debating this document.  Colleagues mentioned certain outlets selling certain preparations.  Another practice should be outlawed, which is ordering drugs on-line.  It is very hard to eliminate it, a point strongly made in the report.</P>
        <P>The number of people who have lost their lives through knife crime in recent times is very worrying.  It again calls into question how legislation is failing to deal with these crimes.  There is a legislative void in dealing with knife crime.  We should ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House and debate the matter.  Anybody who goes out into the community with a knife in his or her pocket is not doing it to tend to his or her fingernails or pare a pencil.  They are bringing it to use it maliciously and a mandatory sentence should be given to a person carrying a knife that is capable of inflicting serious bodily harm or death as has been seen in recent times.  I ask the Leader to consider that request favourably.</P>

	<P>Gu&iacute;m gach rath ar mo chomhghleacaithe don t&eacute;arma amach romhainn.  As others have done I welcome Senator Mooney to the House.  I both envy and sympathise with him because it is not normal that one gets to hear so many tributes to oneself in one&rsquo;s lifetime outside one&rsquo;s retirement.  I also sympathise with him because the number of tributes paid to him is greatly in excess of the number of vocational panels to the Seanad and I foresee difficulties.  None of that in any way takes from the tributes that are undoubtedly deserved.  He comes with a great reputation already and I look forward to hearing his contributions to debates and to engaging with him as others will do.</P>
        <P>I was also very pleased to hear Senators McFadden and Keaveney, who are both always very fair, raise the media treatment of the Minister for Finance over the Christmas period.  I ask the Leader for a debate at the earliest opportunity on the media and how they operate.  I am not talking about a session in which everybody comes in and vents their own personal spleen, vendettas or gripes against journalism.  There is already too much of politicians giving out about the media.  We do not need a culture in which people constantly give out about the media.  We need a culture in which people hold the media to account.  We will do so by identifying that the libel laws alone are not sufficient to protect people, whether in private life or in public life from the depredations of the media.  We need a more thorough analysis of how the media operate.  While we need to consider that under the heading of privacy, we also need to consider issues like taste and decency, and fairness and balance.  We can all outline occasions and instances where the media have been unfair.  However, we live at a time when all institutions are coming under scrutiny and there is very little support for self-regulation.  While I commend <Col N="22"/>the work being done by the press council, that does not cover broadcast matters.  There is no sense that the broadcasting regulatory authorities have any teeth at all.  We clearly need to reconsider how we can hold the media to account in a way that does not impact unnecessarily or inappropriately on media freedom.</P>
        <P>I say this with great sympathy to individual journalists who are caught up in a web of bad practice because of the pressure they face from their editors and media bosses.  This is not targeted against any individual journalist or media practitioner.  However, we definitely need a debate on how we can get the media to observe better standards.  It was simply not acceptable to hear a series of journalists in recent weeks defend, as they had to do, bad practice.  The most that some would say was that they would not have done it that way themselves, as if there were no objective standards which all should uphold.  Clearly the timing of telling that story was a matter that should have been negotiated with the Minister&rsquo;s family.  The idea that anybody was done a favour by being given merely two days over Christmas is an insult to our intelligence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking seriously for a debate on the media in which we will not be hearing just rants about the media, but also constructive thoughts about how we can get the right balance between media freedom on the one hand and the right of all members of the public, including people in public life, to good standards on the other.</P>
        <P>On a number of occasions in the past year I have raised not only the good work being done by hospitals but also the good work being done by the Irish Hospice Foundation.  It has a particular programme for hospice-friendly hospitals.  It has raised the important matter of how we get our hospitals up to the standards they should attain particularly regarding end of life care.  I am talking about facilities for people who are terminally ill to be able to settle sensitive matters with their families or facilities to allow people to stay over in hospital with people for whom they are caring.  There can be insensitive treatment of people in our hospitals simply because the facilities are not there and good practice has not been established as a norm.  Our hospitals should be run like hotels in terms of the quality of service given to people at every level including food and beverages, medical care and the space and quality of facilities afforded to loved ones.</P>
        <P>I would like a debate on the quality of our hospitals.  I know it is not an easy time to talk about major capital investment in our hospital care, but if we are serious about promoting good health in our society and helping people to get well we must provide them with an environment conducive to good health care.  I would like a debate about the hospice-friendly hospitals of the Irish Hospice Foundation and the agenda of quality health care generally.</P>
        <P>I also concur with what has been said about the air traffic controllers strike.  Senator Quinn rightly mentioned the response of President Reagan in 1981, which was seen as a drastic response at the time.  However, we should be asking where is the patriotism of people who at a time of crisis take such a step with the impact it has on our reputation abroad and the major inconvenience caused to our citizens.  I accept great and sensitive work is done by our air traffic controllers, but they are certainly not at the rough end when it comes to remuneration.  It is a shame that this has happened and it calls into question people&rsquo;s awareness of the serious crisis this country faces.  It is beyond me that they could contemplate such an action.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mention overseas aid as mentioned by Senator Bacik.  The crisis in Haiti has concentrated our minds on the importance of solidarity with people in less fortunate parts of the world, particularly parts of the world that are prone to natural disasters.  I had the honour of hosting <Col N="23"/>the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, Dr. Stafford Carson, this afternoon.  He had met the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power.  I heard about the great work and fundraising being done within the Presbyterian community supporting Irish efforts abroad.  To use a word beloved of the Taoiseach, it is vital that the State continues to provide aid commensurate with the people&rsquo;s commitment to the developing world and in particular to people in crisis.  I certainly hope that this is the year in which we will get back on track towards reaching our commitment of 0.7% of GDP in terms of overseas development aid because we have lost ground in this regard.  I hope that situation will be reversed.</P>

	<P>I welcome Paschal Mooney&rsquo;s re-entry to the Oireachtas as a Senator.  I was told by an usher today that I am now the third newest Member of the 23rd Seanad, after only six weeks in the House, and this is something of a shock and surprise.  I reiterate the call made by numerous Members as regards a debate on the commission of inquiry into banking.  It is sheer political opportunism by the Opposition to continually dismiss the commission and discredit its findings as a whitewash.  This is cheap political points scoring which takes away from the credibility of this House and the Lower House.  As the Taoiseach said this morning, we have already debated<i> ad infinitum</i> many issues in this respect.  It is not good enough to have an Oireachtas committee which merely facilitates the appearance of the Taoiseach before it so that the Opposition can start to batter him from all angles and try to discredit him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A member of the Opposition has already proclaimed he would love to take down the Government, regardless of how this might be done.  Such a proposal would therefore seem to indicate a desire on the part of the Opposition just to get its pound of flesh, as opposed to focusing on the issue at the centre of the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a separate issue I encourage the Leader to facilitate the examination by the House of the consequences of the bad weather we have had over the Christmas recess.  I believe a national strategy is needed, as I was inundated with telephone calls over the Christmas.  In other counties, for example, Donegal, Wexford, Cavan and Monaghan, there was a degree of flexibility as regards how local people could treat their roads.  As the representative of a very large rural area in south Louth, I heard from a great many people who were willing to do this work if the facilities were provided.  The problem is that disparate county and city councils are working under different rules and regulations and a centralised, co-ordinated response by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, should be the way forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I conclude on those points while urging the Leader to arrange for debates on these two motions as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by also congratulation Senator Paschal Mooney on his re-election to this House.  I served with him in the previous Seanad and he was a very hard-working and sincere Senator.  I wish him and his wife well.  Our thoughts are not far away from the late Senator Peter Callanan whose untimely death gave rise to this vacancy.  We think of him today and in the future as we wish Senator Mooney the best.</P>
        <P>I have two points to make.  I believe the banking inquiry should be held in public and that the template to be used by the Government should be that of the DIRT inquiry where for a relatively short period an effective parliamentary committee was in place which yielded a dividend to the Exchequer in terms of money and also held people to account.  It is not good enough to give the banks &euro;54 billion and let them ride into the sunset, so to speak, while they evict young people from their houses and literally render generations homeless.  This is after <Col N="24"/>the recapitalisation and the bailout of the banks, which still hold thousands of young couples to ransom by locking them into fixed-term mortgage interest agreements.  I know of one particular case where a young couple are paying an interest rate of 6.9% and the penalty to get out of that agreement is not affordable.  All the while interest rates have been teetering around the zero rate.  Such situations are pathetic.</P>
        <P>As regards road funding, I believe the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, was short-sighted in announcing he was not going to allocate extra funding to local authorities in terms of restoring the roads to their normal levels before the frost, ice and flooding.  The Government might consider one element which would enable local authorities to raise the much-needed finance themselves.  While the licensing authority for cars and other vehicles such as tractors, buses, etc. in Cork is based in Cork County Hall, all moneys collected in Cork city and county go to the Exchequer.  Cork County Council pays staff to collect the money locally, but it all goes to the Exchequer.  I do not believe this is a good use of money, particularly when it is considered that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, when Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, wasted &euro;50 million on electronic voting machines.  I believe local authorities need autonomy in terms of fund-raising and should be allowed to retain moneys collected at local level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Green Party, like everyone else, I welcome the return of Senator Paschal Mooney to the House.  As a fellow Connacht man, I am delighted we are beginning to redress the imbalance.</P>
        <P>Like other Senators, I call for a debate on Haiti because it is very important.  Our troubles with snow and floods pale into significance relative to what is going on there.  I ask the Government passionately to give any assistance it can.  It has been put to me by various people that our Defence Forces could look at helping out in that jurisdiction, if requested, in so far as this is possible.</P>
        <P>I also support the call for a debate on media very strongly, given the way things are going in this country in relation to politics, since I believe the media are unhelpful at the moment in that regard.  It would be quite something to have a live debate on RTE television and radio from the Seanad, so that we might get our points across unedited.  Quite often, the difficulty with media is that we are talking about spin and the segmenting of the things we actually say.  It would be important to get matters before the public, live and directly, rather than having debates edited all the time.</P>
        <P>I would welcome a debate on head shops as being of importance, although I am not going to talk on this.  I would very much welcome a debate on drinking water as well.  I have two brief points to make in this regard.  Under the present Government there has been unparalleled investment in the treatment of drinking water in Ireland, despite what people believe, and I very much welcome that.  Drinking water is the basis of life and it is crucial that it is available for the people.  I would stress, however, that water in flooded areas and in rivers cannot be confused with clean safe drinking water.  It is not the same thing, despite that people continually ask why we cannot have enough water in our reservoirs, given that there is so much lying in puddles throughout the country.  Water does not just jump into the reservoirs and enormous investment and work is needed to ensure it can be safely distributed.  When people make such comparisons, they can be somewhat disingenuous.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the banking inquiry is taking place, and that is crucial.  The Green Party has been solidly behind that from day one and we are delighted that this banking inquiry will now go ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am getting to that matter, Senator.  There are three portions to this banking inquiry.  The first, which is very important, is the scoping of this inquiry, and it is crucial.  We do not want to see the banking inquiry going down the same route as the Flood, Mahon and other tribunals which have taken years, including the conclusions to the beef tribunal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is not the format we want.  Many Members of the Opposition are talking about this particular inquiry as if the scoping has actually happened and as if the terms of reference are in place.  They are not.  That is going to take place and it is important that people do not prejudice the scoping.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second portion is the commission of inquiry and if people refer to the legislation governing the commission, they will find that there are particular regulations in place in that regard.  It is important we look at those and the Green Party is very committed that as much information as possible should come into the public domain.  In fact, all the information from the inquiry has to come into the public domain.  Members of the Opposition are incorrect who say there will be no public element to this at all.  There will, of course, be a public element.</P>

	<P>I join my colleagues in welcoming Senator Paschal Mooney to the House and wish him all the best for the future.  I hope he enjoys his time here and I am sure he will make a very positive contribution to the House, as he has done in the past.</P>
        <P>I also express my condolences to the people of Haiti for the awful catastrophe that occurred there over Christmas.  At times such as this one sees people give of their best and I pay tribute to members of the international community who have given of their time in going there and helping out in the relief effort, including people from Ireland.  I was speaking to a family earlier, one of whose members is working in Haiti, trying to save lives and help people there to recover from the disaster.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All our local authorities did as much as they could in the recent cold spell, but they suffer from a lack of funding.  In County Meath, for example, the county council is under serious pressure to try to make current budgets last.  When extraordinary events like the recent cold spell occur &mdash; it only happens once every 30 years or so &mdash; local authorities will not be prepared to cope if they do not have money in the bank.  In east Meath, we saw tens of thousands of people without access to the road network because gritting could not take place.  There were insufficient funds and salt supplies and we need to learn from this.  Adequate funding is required from central government because local government cannot raise such funds through rates.  The Leader should arrange a debate in order that Senators from all over the country can share their experiences.  Perhaps we could then learn about what went well and where mistakes were made.  When the next emergency arises we will then be better prepared to help people go about their business.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In my mad rush to get back into this House, I ignored the protocol of first meeting with the Cathaoirleach, for which I apologise.  I could not help but reflect that my dearly departed parents were looking down on all that has happened in the last while.  My father would have been very proud and my mother would have believed every word of it.  Mothers are proud of their sons and believe they do everything right.  God rest my mother who died almost a year ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank all sides of the House for the overwhelming welcome I have received.  Politics is a rough trade.  I have been a victim of it, as have many of my colleagues.  As they have gone through the electoral process successfully or unsuccessfully, they will know what I am talking about.  The last two and a half years have been somewhat grim in that regard.  When one reflects some mornings on not really having a reason to get up, one can empathise to a great degree with those who have no jobs.  As there is a growing number of such people in the economy, I hope everything that is done both here and in the other House will make some contribution towards improving the lot of those who have suffered from the economic downturn.  That is what we are about.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I record my appreciation of Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, as I have not had an opportunity to do so publicly up to now.  We both campaigned in the European elections last year and I want to thank him for his personal courtesy and friendship towards me at all times.  He is a perfect gentleman.  People who say that politics is lacking in humanity could listen to what has been said here today across the House.  It is a reflection of the warmth I have received from all sides of the House.  Politicians are criticised by a harsh media, yet there is a great basic humanity and decency about them irrespective of the ideological differences we may have.  We must have such differences in order for democracy to function effectively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also thank the Taoiseach who proposed my name to the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party before Christmas.  Political parties can be somewhat harsh in making pragmatic decisions about whom they should support with an eye to the next election.  However, as the Taoiseach said in his own remarks as reported to me, there are exceptions.  I am pleased and thank God that I was the exception in this case.  The contribution that I made, modest and all as it was, both as a Member of this House and also in the European elections, was recognised as the Taoiseach said.  It showed a side of the Taoiseach that perhaps the media and public do not often see &mdash; a basic decency and humanity, for which I am grateful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank my colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party who came out and voted in such strong numbers, as well as our colleagues in the Green Party who showed solidarity in that they all supported me.  I also received support across the political divide.  They know who they are and I am grateful to them.  It shows that in some cases personal relationships transcend political ideology.</P>

I am informing Members in order that they can be well prepared.  Unless banks start lending money to SMEs, however, thousands of people will continue to be unemployed in the early part of this year, as Senator Wilson said.  In the interests of assisting the people, we should bring pressure to bear on banks and governments.  Money must be in circulation because, if not, thousands more people will be unemployed.

	<P Just="Left">From this day on, I want to see the energy and experience of all Members of the House being reflected in their contributions.  They have made their point about the banking inquiry, but solving the matter is far more important.  When solved, we can have open inquiries.  There are two inquiries taking place, including one very serious one under the auspices of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There must be due process.  I have no doubt that everything that could be done is being done.  The Minister for Finance assured the people in this regard yesterday.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister for Finance well.  He is making a massive contribution to the country and showing real leadership.  Thousands of people hope he will be able to turn the economy around.  As I stated, unless the United States comes good, Ireland will not.  To be honest and fair, there are very few countries that are able to come good without the assistance of the United States.  The bottom line is that we have a brilliant Minister for Finance.  Please God, he will get over his illness.  We all wish him well.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald and McFadden called for a debate on A Vision for Change.  This is the fourth anniversary and I congratulate everyone concerned.  The commitment I made stands.  I hope the debate on mental health and A Vision for Change will take place within the next two weeks.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senators Leyden, Norris, Cummins and Wilson referred to the serious issue of head shops.  Motion No. 22, tabled by Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole, reads, &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann urges the Government to introduce legislation aimed at regulating the sale of dangerous, non quality controlled and indeterminately compounded substances through so called &lsquo;Head Shops&rsquo; &rdquo;.  I will have no difficulty in agreeing to an all-party motion on the issue.  I will give it top priority and discuss it with the leaders and Whips to determine how we can debate it in the House as soon as possible.  I congratulate all my colleagues on bringing the matter to the attention of the House.  I congratulate Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole on placing the motion on the Order Paper.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and Quinn welcomed the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill.  I will inform the House when it is proposed to take it.  It is listed to be taken this session, as we know from the legislative programme of the Chief Whip.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney offered her condolences on the death of Cardinal Daly.  I join her in acknowledging all the good and great work that the cardinal did in Ireland in his long life.  I knew him reasonably well.  He was in a neighbouring diocese, Ardagh and Clonmacnoise.  He was in Longford for some considerable time and in charge of the papal visit to Clonmacnoise.  It was unfortunate to see what happened to St. Mel&rsquo;s Cathedral over Christmas.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney also referred to Mr. Peadar Heffron.  We send him and his family a message of support and sympathy.  Senator Cummins referred to the abhorrent and terrible beatings carried out in the name of republicans.  I wish Mr. Heffron well.  Please God, he will make a full recovery.  He is certainly under serious pressure.  I join Senator Keaveney in sending a message of goodwill to him and his family.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan has referred to the procedures that apply when one dies in Denmark.  I express sympathy to the Senator and his family on their recent bereavement.  He stated deaths in Denmark were recorded in a central register.  Thus, everyone knows who has passed on to his or her eternal reward and one cannot claim the pension of a deceased person for 23 years.  In this regard, we must support the Minister for Social and Family Affairs in combating fraud.  I support the Senator&rsquo;s expressions.</P><Col N="29"/>
        <P>Senators Ellis, Quinn and Callely expressed disappointment at the air traffic controllers&rsquo; strike.  In these difficult times we would prefer, in the national interest, if it did not take place.  Everyone should negotiate and express their difficulties at the conference table.  Ireland plc should not be closed down by any organisation or group of people, however serious the cause, without thinking seriously about the implications.  I hope common sense will prevail and that such a strike will not happen again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Bacik, Hanafin, Daly, Cummins, Mullen, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in and Hannigan commended those who were assisting the poor, unfortunate people of Haiti.  What we see repeatedly on news bulletins is unbelievable.  I note the work Charlie Bird is doing in Haiti.  We wish former US President Bill Clinton and the current US President, Barack Obama, well in their efforts.  I note that Mr. Denis O&rsquo;Brien was on the streets in Haiti and that he gave financial support amounting to &euro;5 million to the people of the country.  I commend all the Irish groups involved.  They are a shining example of what can be done by communities.  There is a great push by the Irish to raise funds.  The entertainment industry is no exception.  Colleagues of mine are organising concerts and everything is being done to raise funds to help the poor people of Haiti.  The House sends its condolences to the family of Mr. Andrew Grene who lost his life in the earthquake.  Next Wednesday, in the presence of the Minister, we will have statements on overseas development aid and what we can do to help the Haitians.  In my lifetime I have never seen anything like what has occurred.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Malley, Butler and O&rsquo;Sullivan welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Health and Children on cervical cancer vaccinations.  Great value for money has been achieved.  The initiative will protect all young girls, the next generation.  I wish the Minister well.  The savings made have been considerable.</P>
        <P>Senators Butler and Carroll called for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address in the House the difficulties experienced on foot of the inclement weather, particularly in rural areas.  Last night we saw television footage of the damage done in the Mount Leinster area of Carlow.  I understand the Minister has written to every local authority asking for an up-to-date estimate of the amount of emergency funding that will be necessary.  Senator Carroll referred to the need for a co-ordinated national emergency plan.  The Minister might update the House on the current position in this regard.  I will make my request to him after the Order of Business.  We will definitely have him in the House to discuss this issue in the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to the various backup services needed for motor transportation.  I fully agree with him.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly asked for the up-to-date position on Kenmare hospital and asked that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, state in the House when tender documents would be issued.  I will pass on the views of the Senator Daly to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>

        <P>Senators Cannon and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in raised the need to review policy on public water supplies.  Senator Cannon said only 15% of all treated water was used for drinking, while the rest was used for other activities.  This is an alarming statistic and an area in which we must plan for the future.  We must examine ways of harnessing rainwater for these other activities without requiring costly treatment.  This is a serious challenge for local authorities.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn referred to the on-line availability of pharmaceutical drugs and called for a debate on the issue, with which I have no difficulty.  He also called for a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the misuse of knives.  It has developed a whole new dimension, with young people losing their lives in the past few weeks.  It is just horrific.  I will have no difficulty in requesting the Minister to attend the House to discuss the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen called for a debate on holding the media to account and ensuring taste, decency, privacy and the observing of better standards.  I support the Senator&rsquo;s call and will endeavour to arrange such a debate.  The Senator also raised the issue of the quality of care in hospitals and hospices, a debate we can also have.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in called for live broadcasting of the Seanad.  I am pleased to inform the House that we are well advanced in this matter at this stage.

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to bring this important Bill before the Seanad for its consideration.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to transfer the function of regulating premium rate services from Regtel to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  During its passage through the other House, I introduced an important amendment to the Bill that changed it from one dealing solely with premium rate service regulation to one that also provides for the installation of electronic communications infrastructure in public roads.  I will provide more detail on this amendment later.</P>
        <P>The Bill itself is the result of a departmental review of the regulation of premium rate services in Ireland that involved consultation with Regtel, ComReg, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, key market players and other stakeholders in the sector.  I initiated this review following a significant increase in complaints from the public concerning premium rate services, particularly subscription services.  Following the review, I decided that the regulatory function should be transferred from Regtel, a non-statutory limited private company, to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, by way of an extension of ComReg&rsquo;s functions under the Communications Regulation Acts.  This will ensure that an effective regulatory regime <Col N="33"/>backed up with strong enforcement powers is established and is also in accordance with Government policy on agency rationalisation.</P>
        <P>The Bill was broadly welcomed in the other House and I was happy to take on board some amendments proposed by Deputies on the opposite side which strengthened the provisions in the Bill on refunds to users by service providers who are in breach of the conditions of their licences.</P>
        <P>The premium rate services sector, in tandem with developments in communications technology and platform delivery generally, is a growing and evolving sector.  The regulator of the sector must always be up to speed with current developments to ensure that all types of premium rate services and new services, which may be offered in the future and which may give rise to consumer harm, are effectively regulated.  In this regard the premium rate service providers themselves must continuously strive to maintain the highest standards and best practice in the content and promotion of their services and to rid the sector of those service providers whose sharp practices have brought the sector into disrepute.  The service providers were fully consulted during the preparation of the Bill and, I am pleased to say, have broadly welcomed its provisions.</P>
        <P>The consumer interest is paramount and unless that interest is protected, confidence in the sector will not be restored.  The Bill provides the necessary statutory powers to establish a robust regulatory regime that will, when implemented, remove the rogue elements from the sector and restore consumer confidence in it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before going into the main provisions of the Bill, I offer Senators some background on the premium rate sector in Ireland and the rationale for the Bill.  Premium rate services are content services provided primarily over fixed line and mobile telecommunications networks charged to a consumer&rsquo;s telephone account by the network operator.  The prices charged are at a premium rate compared with the cost of a normal telephone call.  These services, accessed by means of a specific telephone number prefix, include information and entertainment services such as weather forecasts, traffic news, sports results and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Premium rate services are distinctly different from standard telephone services in many respects.  The main features that set them apart and warrant more regulatory intervention to protect consumers include issues relating to content, price and transparency.  Many premium rate services such as weather forecasts, traffic reports or sports results, although typically more expensive than ordinary telephone communications, only require light regulation.  Other forms of content offered over telephone networks, such as adult chat lines, require tighter regulation because of the risk of minors accessing them.  The content of a service must also not be such that it facilitates or encourages anything unlawful.  Prices for certain types of premium rate services can result in substantial charges on a telephone bill or pre-pay card if the consumer is not vigilant or if the telephone is used by a child or other user unaware of the potential to generate telephone bills.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A further reason for regulation and an area that gives rise to the vast majority of complaints in Ireland and elsewhere is the lack of transparency in respect of subscription services offered by a small but significant group of providers.  In many cases, consumers who believed they had engaged in a one-off transaction found that they had inadvertently agreed to subscribe to a premium rate service, whereby they would subsequently receive content over their telephone line or mobile and were charged for this service.  This problem has been most prevalent where consumers enter competitions of some sort and may not realise that they have signed up to an ongoing subscription service thus incurring substantial costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to Regtel&rsquo;s annual report for the financial year ended 31 March 2009, there are approximately 129 service providers offering premium rate services over the networks of 13 <Col N="34"/>operators.  Between 2001 and 2008 annual revenue grew from &euro;31 million to &euro;95 million, an increase of more than 200%.  This declined to &euro;80 million in the last financial year, reflecting the overall decline in economic activity.  Clearly, this is a dynamic market that provides significant returns for service providers and network operators.  The premium rate services market is currently regulated by Regtel by means of a code of practice to which all service providers are required to adhere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regtel is funded by a levy on the premium rate service providers and the network operators that provide users with access to those premium rate services under a contract with the service providers.  This is essentially a self-regulation model.  While the vast majority of service providers operate within Regtel&rsquo;s code of practice, a small number of non-compliant providers bring the sector into disrepute.</P>
        <P>The new regulatory framework aims to address any issues that may arise in the provision of premium rate services.  It replaces the current self-regulatory system, based on contractual arrangements between Regtel and service providers, with a licensing regime backed up by effective enforcement powers.  The involvement of the service providers in enforcing proper standards is an important element of effective regulation.  I acknowledge that the majority of companies operating in the sector are reputable and, through various initiatives, have played an important part in maintaining high standards.  To maintain this level of engagement with the service providers in the regulation of the sector, the Bill provides that a code of practice drawn up by ComReg, in consultation with the service providers and other interested parties, will remain an integral part of the new regulatory regime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following enactment of the Bill, consumer confidence in the sector will be enhanced and the sector will enjoy further development and growth.  The transfer of the regulatory functions to ComReg will not impose any charge on public funds as provision is made in the Bill for the costs of regulation to be funded by a levy on the service providers.  I have also made provision in the Bill for the transfer of the staff of Regtel to ComReg, thus ensuring that the valuable expertise built up by Regtel over the years is retained and that no existing staff member suffers any loss as a result of the transfer of function.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from the regulation of premium rate services, the Bill makes provision for ComReg to issue an appropriate emergency direction to an undertaking that provides wholesale access to its network for another operator.  This will facilitate the provision of an alternative service for those affected customers and provide continuity of access for the emergency services.</P>
        <P>I also introduced an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to Part 5 of the principal Act.  In its existing format, Part 5 of the principal Act provides for local authorities to grant consent to telecommunications operators to open public roads for the establishment of underground communications infrastructure.  Under the principal Act, local authorities are the sole consent giving authority in this regard for local, regional, national roads and motorways.  The amendment designates the National Roads Authority, NRA, as the authority for national roads, including motorways.  This will enable the authority to make available to network operators access to ducting on such roads and to facilitate the roll-out of high speed broadband networks in the regions.  There is significant ducting on national roads and motorways that has the potential to be used by network operators.  By using existing assets, operators could make significant savings in the roll-out of fibre connections to the regions.  Since the National Roads Authority has responsibility for the planning and supervision of such motorways, it makes sense that it should grant consent to road openings for network operators.  It is also beneficial for operators to have a single point of contact in dealing with multiple local authorities.</P><Col N="35"/>
        <P>This amendment was the subject of discussions with the Department of Transport and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the changes aim to strike a balance between the need to encourage and facilitate greater investment in broadband roll-out while ensuring our road network is managed well.  I believe these changes will greatly streamline the process for getting access to ducting running along national roads and motorways.  Furthermore, the changes are also in line with the policy goals already established in respect of a one-stop-shop aimed at pulling together the disparate pieces of State-owned ducting infrastructure into a more cohesive, seamless and cost-effective network.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the text of the Bill, which is divided into three parts.  Part 1 provides for the Short Title and the collective citation.  Part 2 provides for the regulation of premium rate services and Part 3 provides for infrastructure sharing on public roads and for the issuing of emergency directions to wholesale network operators.  Section 3 provides the necessary definitions for the purposes of the Bill.  The key definitions are those of &ldquo;premium rate service&rdquo; and &ldquo;premium rate service provider&rdquo;.  The definition of a premium rate service in the Bill is necessarily broad to capture not only existing types of services but also services that may be developed in the future as a result of developments in technology.  It defines a premium rate service as a service having certain characteristics.  As I outlined, premium rate services include services such as information and entertainment services that are provided primarily over fixed and mobile telecommunications networks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Broadcasting services are specifically excluded from the definition because such services are regulated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland under broadcasting legislation and do not constitute a premium rate service as ordinarily perceived.  For example, broadcast services such as pay per view could, if not specifically excluded, come within the scope of the definition.  However, where a premium rate service such as a competition or chat line service is advertised or promoted by means of a broadcasting service, that premium rate service will be regulated under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 5 amends section 10 of the principal Act to provide for the commission to have the additional function of regulating premium rate services, the primary purpose of the Bill.  Sections 6 and 7 provide for the licensing of premium rate services, the terms and conditions that may be attached to a licence, including the basis and circumstances upon which refunds may be made to end users, and the information that premium rate service providers shall provide for ComReg upon request.  The requirement under section 6 that each service provider must apply for and hold a licence covering the services it provides is significant.  It enables ComReg to refuse to grant a licence in specific circumstances, including where the applicant has been convicted of an offence under sections 12 or 13 of the Bill in the previous five years for operating an unlicensed service or for overcharging for a service, or under regulation 13 of the Data Protection and Privacy Regulations 2003, which relates to sending an unsolicited communication for direct marketing purposes, namely, spam.  This new licensing regime is designed such that ComReg may prescribe the type of service and service provider that will require a licence and will enable ComReg to vary the conditions that will apply to particular types of premium rate services.  Certain types of premium rate services will be subject to tighter regulation than others.  Accordingly, ComReg will be able to specify different conditions for different types of service in an objective and proportionate manner.</P>
        <P>Sections 8 to 10 provide the enforcement powers that ComReg may apply against non-compliant service providers.  Under section 8, ComReg may apply to the High Court for the immediate suspension of a licence where it considers such suspension is necessary to protect users or potential users of premium rate services.  This is an important provision as swift action by ComReg may be necessary to prevent the continuation of an offending service until further investigative and enforcement action is taken.</P><Col N="36"/>
        <P>Section 9 provides that, if ComReg finds following an investigation that a service provider has not complied with or has breached a condition of a licence, it shall notify the provider of its finding and require the provider to remedy any non-compliance or breach within a specified period and refund any charges imposed on users in respect of any service connected with the non-compliance or breach.  Where a premium rate service provider has failed to comply with or remedy the breach within the time period specified, ComReg may, having notified the licence holder of its intention and considered any representation made by the licence holder, revoke, amend or suspend for a period the licence.  If the failure to comply with a condition is considered by ComReg to be a serious breach, the revocation, amendment or suspension will take effect upon notification.  Section 11 provides that a service provider which is aggrieved by a decision of the commission to refuse, suspend or revoke a licence has the right of appeal to the Circuit Court against the decision within seven days of its notification.</P>
        <P>Sections 12 and 13, respectively, provide for offences relating to the provision of unlicensed premium rate services and for overcharging for services or charging for services not supplied.  Section 13 also provides for the court, on the application to it by the commission following a conviction, to make orders revoking the licence and prohibiting the licensee from reapplying for a new licence, either permanently or for a fixed time, and to repay to end users any charges wrongfully imposed on them.</P>
        <P>The enforcement provisions in the Bill are designed to give ComReg maximum effectiveness in deterring non-compliant service providers from operating in the market.  They provide a mechanism, whereby a licence may be amended, suspended or revoked, depending on the nature of non-compliance with the conditions of the licence.  It is important for the sector as a whole that the minority of service providers which are responsible for the large number of complaints from consumers should be subject to dissuasive sanctions.  The vast majority of service providers which are compliant need have no fear of these provisions.  On the contrary, they have welcomed them as an effective response to those service providers which are bringing the whole sector into disrepute and undermining public confidence in it.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the involvement of the sector in maintaining high standards through a code of practice is an important element of effective regulation.  Section 15 of the Bill provides for the preparation and publication of a code of practice by ComReg following consultation with interested parties and other relevant statutory bodies.  Apart from consultation with service providers, this would include consultation with bodies such as the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland which has statutory responsibility for broadcast content, a medium through which many premium rate services are advertised, and the National Consumer Agency which has overall responsibility for protecting consumer interests.  In this way, a consistent approach by the relevant statutory bodies in both consumer protection and content-related regulation will be ensured.  Compliance with the code of practice will be a condition of a licence and, consequently, non-compliance with its provisions will result in a sanction being imposed.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides under section 18<i> </i>for the transfer of staff currently employed by Regtel to ComReg on the same pay and conditions to which they were entitled while in the service of Regtel, subject to my consent and that of the Minister for Finance.  This will provide ComReg with the expertise and resources that will enable it to carry out its new functions effectively from day one.</P>
        <P>In addition to the regulation of premium rate services, the Bill also contains provisions in relation to electronic communications infrastructure.  Section 21 amends the principal Act to provide for roadworks relating to the installation of electronic communications infrastructure on public roads.  As I mentioned, the main objective of this amendment is to facilitate the <Col N="37"/>National Roads Authority in making available to network operators access to ducting on national roads and motorways.  The amendment contains a number of provisions.  First, the provision in the principal Act under which local authorities may grant consent to telecommunications operators for the opening of public roads and set conditions for such consent is to be extended to the NRA for all national roads.  Local authorities will remain the consent-giving authority for local and regional roads.</P>
        <P>Second, the amendment provides for the NRA to make a scheme, whereby it can impose charges for the use by network operators of ducts provided by a local authority or the NRA on national roads.  This will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Transport following consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>Third, under the principal Act, consent is not required for emergency roadworks but a network operator is required to notify the local authority as soon as practicable in advance of the commencement of the emergency roadworks.  Under the amendment, consent for emergency roadworks is deemed to be granted.  This is to facilitate a rapid response by network operators to fix faults.  The amendment retains the current requirement for advance notification to the authority by the network operator but also allows for conditions to be imposed by an authority during the progress and after completion of the emergency roadworks.  This will ensure such roadworks are carried out having regard to the safety of all road users and that the road in question is not left in a state of disrepair after the works are completed.</P>
        <P>Fourth, section 55 of the principal Act provides that, where a road authority undertakes roadworks, it will pay to a network operator all reasonable costs incurred by the operator in relocating its infrastructure.  The amendment includes a provision that the NRA will not incur any costs relating to the relocation of network operators&rsquo; telecoms equipment in ducts on national roads that have been provided and made available by a local authority or the NRA.</P>
        <P>Fifth, the amendment provides that a consent granted by a local authority or the NRA may contain specified conditions, without prejudice to any other conditions it may also set.  These relate to any losses and liabilities that the NRA or local authority may incur from a third party which are caused by any act undertaken by the network operator; loss or damage to electronic communications infrastructure carried in ducts and the supervision of works to ensure compliance with any conditions contained in the consent.  Although there are other consequential minor amendments included to update the legislation, the changes I have outlined are the most significant.</P>
        <P>Section 22 of the Bill provides that, in order to minimise customer disruption and ensure continuity of access to emergency services, ComReg may issue an emergency direction to an operator providing wholesale access to another operator in the event of the exit from the market of that other operator.  Senators may recall that a situation arose in 2006 where an operator informed its customers that it was no longer in a position to provide them with a service.  Although ComReg played a significant role in mediating a solution that allowed those customers to switch to an alternative service provider, it had no statutory power which it could use to achieve this.  This provision gives ComReg the necessary powers if such a situation were to arise in the future.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an important measure in contributing to the effective regulation of premium rate services in Ireland.  The proposals it contains are measured and proportionate responses to the challenges that will face ComReg in establishing effective regulation of premium rate services and protecting the users of these services.  I am confident that the Bill, when enacted, will result in greater consumer protection and promote confidence and growth in the premium rate services sector.</P><Col N="38"/>
        <P>Apart from some minor amendments of a technical and drafting nature that have been agreed in conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, I do not intend to introduce any substantive amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. I look forward to hearing the views of Members on the Bill and their assistance in facilitating its early passage into law.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>My party has been seeking this type of legislation for some time.  In principle, we welcome the Bill and its objectives.  There has been an enormous problem in this area for a number of years.  Premium rates apply to traffic news, sports results, psychic, chat and horoscope services, as well as participating in various competitions on programmes such as &ldquo;PlayTV&rdquo;.  They involve the use of 1550 numbers in offering information services, etc.  This obviously forms part of modern communications services and, as such, is not inherently wrong.  We want to encourage the industry in Ireland and do not wish to regulate it to a level where it would not succeed.  However, there have been abuses and wrongs.  People have been duped; by merely accepting a text, they then received an entire sequence.  They can be the recipients of unwanted material and enormous bills.  Often the carrot may be concert tickets or alleged telephone credit.  In many cases this is erroneous, but the prizes are attractive to vulnerable individuals.  Young people are being codded, particularly young teenagers who run up exorbitant telephone bills.  </P>
        <P>Going through some of the aspects of the Bill, I take the Minister&rsquo;s point that in the case of sports results and news services, there is light regulation.  There does not appear to be a huge difficulty in this regard, other than that one would want to see realistic pricing and the licensing of the providers of such services.  The difficulty arises when it comes to participation in competitions.  A number of such competitions are false.  People are held on the telephone too long, they receive repeated messages and their bill runs up as they wait to give their answers to the competition.  These lines are advertised in the national newspapers.  There have been many questions concerning the programme &ldquo;PlayTV&rdquo; on TV3 in this regard.</P>

    <Title>Seanad Reform: Motion. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That, in the light of public criticism and of the numerous reports on the subject, Seanad &Eacute;ireann requests the Government to embark urgently on the process of comprehensive Seanad reform.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I place before the Seanad tonight an urgent motion on Seanad reform.  I do so because the reform and survival of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is undoubtedly the most critical issue facing this House.  The leader of the Opposition, Deputy Enda Kenny, in a surprising and perhaps ill-conceived move some months ago, committed his party to the abolition of this Chamber, if it is successful after the next election.  He was quite unequivocal about this, even though the context in which such a decision was taken was, to say the least, obscure and open to different interpretations.  Nevertheless, political stunt or not, his action has had the immediate effect of making reform of this institution of paramount importance if it is to survive.  In the view of many, myself included, the conclusion is clear: reform or die.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nothing could more dramatically illustrate the need for Seanad reform than the recent by-elections.  Out of courtesy, I held my fire during the recent elections of Senator James Carroll, who is an intelligent and decent young man for whom I wish a distinguished career in politics, my old friend and valued colleague, Senator Paschal Mooney, who I am happy to congratulate on his welcome return to this House, as well as Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in.  The worthiness of the candidates aside, it is undoubtedly deeply distasteful to the public that for election to a seat in the Upper House of our Parliament the entire electorate consisted of a mere 227 votes.  Talk of rotten boroughs.  This is something that would have disgraced the most corrupt politics of 18th century Ireland.  In addition, the squalid wheeling and dealing that has surrounded these types of campaign, whereby political parties controlled blocks of votes with rigid authority and, on the basis of political pragmatism, elected people who were often entirely unconnected with the alleged interests of the nominating panel, has brought the system into contempt in the eyes of the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been innumerable reports and recommendations for reform of the Seanad.  On the first sitting of this Seanad after the general election I tabled an amendment to the Order of Business by putting forward a motion urging the Government to implement immediately the recommendations of the O&rsquo;Rourke committee, an all-party committee sponsored by the Government.  The degree of cynicism involved in this charade of Seanad reform was revealed as Members of both parties on the Government side trooped obediently into the lobbies to vote against their own proposals.  Since then a committee was established, which has just completed its work, under the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, whom I welcome to the House.  I attended that committee as a representative of the Independent university Senators.  At the first meeting, as I predicted, it became clear that the initial target was, as usual, the university seats.  I indicated forcefully to the Minister, as he will remember, that as far as I was concerned it was all or nothing &mdash; a comprehensive reform of the Seanad whereby nothing was agreed until everything was agreed.  The university seats should not be uniquely targeted in a cosmetic exercise.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile the public controversy was fuelled by inept performances from some leading Members on a regrettable &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, during which a small proportion of the show was devoted to a demolition job on the Upper House.  The programme appeared to be conceived as a populist ambush of one of the institutions of the State, in which the negative side was privileged by being given an extended soap box at the opening, during which a prepared attack was read from an autocue.  No parallel opportunity was offered to the defenders who were <Col N="40"/>divided among themselves, subject to scatter-gun questions from the host and then thrown on the mercy of an audience whose hostility towards politicians in general had already been ignited.</P>
        <P>I first stood for election to Seanad Eireann in 1977.  I was virtually unknown to the public but I got coverage for one remark during that campaign, which was: &ldquo;That the Seanad had come to resemble a convalescent home for the casualties of the D&aacute;il election.&rdquo;  This remains a significant problem, although I have come to believe the presence in the Chamber of a limited number of people with Cabinet experience can be valuable.  My views on this and other matters are unlikely to be widely held by my colleagues.  The reason is that I am one of a small minority in this House who have specifically chosen to make their political career in the Seanad and have no ambitions to use the Upper House as a launching pad into the Lower House.  Many of our colleagues, as we know, would sooner not be here.  They are merely in transit from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in one direction or the other.</P>
        <P>First, whatever the difficulties concerned, the Seanad can be reformed and made a more effective element of our democracy.  If I did not think so or if I thought there was a cast iron case for the abolition of the Seanad and that it served no function, I would feel honour bound to resign straightaway and not to defraud the taxpayer, especially in these difficult times.  Every element of the Seanad needs overhaul, including the university seats.  I am on record for many years as supporting the extension of the franchise to other third level institutions.  However, I have no doubt that it is the remaining 54 seats that most need to be examined.  Of these, 11 are filled by direct nomination by the Taoiseach of the day to establish an automatic Government majority.  This is done without even the pretence of an election or a publicly accountable selection process.  There are no guidelines and no parameters to the selection of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11. They are in the princely gift of the Taoiseach of the day.</P>
        <P>The remaining 43 Senators are elected by a system of panels which have nominating bodies covering a wide area of Irish life.  However, these groups carry no political clout and are in effect meaningless.  This is because they possess between them not one single vote.  In recent years one nominating body, the Royal Irish Academy, nominated its president, but he did not receive a single vote.  The right to vote is confined to Members of the Oireachtas and members of county councils, thus placing the fate of every seat, apart from the university seats, firmly in the grip of the political parties.  I recall seeing party officials herding Members into offices within this building so they could stand over them to ensure they put the tick in the right box.  How democratic is that?  Does it still happen?  Should the electorate be so confined?</P>
        <P Just="Left">If I may, I shall give a clear practical demonstration of some of the dangers of confining voting to county councillors.  In a previous Seanad I managed to persuade the then Leader to establish a formal committee of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to inquire into rendition flights passing through Shannon Airport.  The committee was established and about to begin its deliberation when a delegation of local authority members from the Shannon region made a pilgrimage to Dublin, leaned on the Government and was able to have the committee of inquiry dissolved.  To prevent people having access to the truth about what was occurring because of parochial and political self-interest was a day of shame in the political life of the country.</P>
        <P>I have always been able to maintain that the university seats were democratic because these two constituencies were unique, in that they enfranchised the ordinary members of the nominating bodies.  In both NUI and Trinity, it is the graduates who, as a corporate entity, form the nominating body and it is the graduates who vote, in the case of Trinity over 50,000 and in the case of NUI over 100,000.  Those are real constituencies.  Why not do something similar with the other constituencies?  First, we would need to examine the nominating bodies to ensure <Col N="41"/>that all walks of life were represented, therefore giving a degree of universality, and then allow the ordinary members of each group to play a role by voting.</P>
        <P>Consider the richness of talent that would be brought into public life &mdash; doctors, lawyers, farm workers, trade unionists, fishermen, nurses, dentists, building workers, architects, business people, people from the world of culture, the arts and entertainment.  If we let their representative bodies become nominating instruments and allow the ordinary membership to vote, we would have people talking from the depth of their experience with knowledge and technical capacity on matters with which they were particularly qualified to deal.  We would mobilise the resources of wisdom and experience.  Moreover, were such a scheme to be properly devised, the entire island would be covered in a way that did not slavishly duplicate the D&aacute;il.  There is little point in having geographical constituencies that mimic arrangements in the Lower House.  Why should the taxpayer pay twice for the same act?  We could then do what I have often suggested and make the dates of the D&aacute;il and Seanad elections coincide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I spoke on the subject of Seanad reform and on whether the Seanad should be retained at all at a meeting of the Dublin South-East Labour Party branch on Monday night.  Among the usual questions &mdash; interestingly, the general feeling of the meeting was overwhelmingly that the Seanad should be retained and reformed &mdash; two struck right to the heart of the matter, namely, why should we have a Seanad at all, and what is its justification and how many successful Bills had originated spontaneously, so to speak, on the Seanad floor from Opposition parties or Independents.  The second, at heart, related to the question of whether the Seanad is merely a rubber stamp for Government policy and an ineffectual talking shop.  The two questions link.  There is nothing wrong with being a talking shop.  That is just another name for a think tank, a commission or any of those other bodies that have become so fashionable and are seen as being valuable in providing a catalyst for new ideas and new approaches to public life.  That is certainly a part of the function of the Seanad that is not shameful and should be vigorously defended.</P>
        <P>We are traditionally and constitutionally a revising and amending body.  The Seanad operates effectively in this area.  I can list a number of amendments that I have secured and I was also happy to second important amendments of Senator O&rsquo;Toole to the NAMA Bill, a significant achievement by the House.  There are even more frequent occasions on which the Minister will accept the principle of the argument and introduce a Government amendment subsequently.  In these circumstances and even though the amendment cannot be directly claimed by a Member, such an amendment would not have been made without intervention in thisHouse and the Seanad can legitimately claim the kudos of the impact it has had upon such legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amending function of the Seanad is not assisted when, as occurred several times recently in terms of important legislation, amendments that were tabled in good faith by Members were neither reached nor discussed in either House of Parliament, allegedly because of time constraints.  This despite any disclaimer by the Leader represents the effective operation of a guillotine.</P>
        <P>The second question concerning legislation is interesting.  Let it be said that every single Member of the Independent university group has placed at least one item of legislation before the House for consideration within the last session.  The fact that none of these has passed into law is regrettable, but it does not mean they have not had an impact.  Often, the House acts as a catalyst and the Government eventually takes over and implements ideas that originated here.  The matter of civil partnership, for example, which is a current issue in the Lower House, was first placed before the Seanad in 2004 and it was several years before first the Labour Party and then the Government took up the issue with serious political intent.  There can be <Col N="42"/>no doubt, however, that this House played a significant role in that area, as it has also done with items such as AIDS, climate change, broadband, embryonic stem cell research etc. by the depth and knowledge of the debate that took place here.</P>
        <P>It would be futile to deny that a large part of the impact of individual Members is extrasenatorial.  For example, Senator O&rsquo;Toole has made a considerable contribution to the life of this country by his involvement in the trade union movement and the social partnership talks.  Senator Ross has made a real impact on the awareness of the public on financial matters, principally through his editorship of the financial section of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and his recent book.  Both men have undoubtedly found the status of being a Senator valuable, but their major impact on life so far has been found outside these walls.  This is perhaps sadly inevitable in the present circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is virtually no media coverage of the doings of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I look forward to the day when the proceedings here will be streamed live to those who are interested rather in the manner of American television&rsquo;s C-Span channel.  In the meantime, we are dependent on the broadcast and print media.  Apart from <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Upper House is virtually completely ignored by all newspapers.  Even the coverage in <i>The Irish Times</i> is often pitiful.  This is not due to lack of effort on the part of the correspondent Jimmy Walsh, who is universally respected.  Even in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the doings of the Seanad are eclipsed by every other activity within Leinster House such that sometimes all that survives is a couple of shorn paragraphs.  &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; on RTE makes an attempt and I certainly cannot complain of not being covered, but it is indicative that the coverage of the proceedings of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is invariably placed at the tail end of the report after everything else, including reports of committee meetings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Kieran Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has one minute remaining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This clearly indicates that the Seanad is less significant than not just the D&aacute;il, but also any committee that happens to be sitting.  If the D&aacute;il does not sit, there is no &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; at all, although the Oireachtas consists of two Chambers.  This attitude is reinforced by regular media reports and publications dealing allegedly with the &ldquo;general election&rdquo; that, on closer perusal, turn out to be coverage of D&aacute;il elections only.  No other radio or television station gives routine coverage of any kind to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This does not inhibit many of my colleagues from alternately attacking and then toadying to the media.  One recent instance was the sentimental reception given in this House to the 25th anniversary of &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  It was described as such a brilliant production, such a wonderful programme, etc.  I had to restrain myself because it would not have been appropriate to be the pooper at that particular party.  I listened to the programme and it did not deserve the praise it received. I am reaching the end of this paragraph, but the Acting Chairman knows there was a lot of injury time.  The show&rsquo;s production values were terrible, the link to London was inaudible, historic clips were drowned out by inappropriate rock music and, inevitably, we were treated to the usual whinnying and giggling at facetious jokes by the presenters.  The only bright spot was the momentary re-emergence of David Hanly.</P>
        <P>This is all of a piece with the general dumbing down throughout the media.  Instead of hard news, what we are given is infotainment and factoids in the American manner.  We hear much about investigative journalism.  However, as a fully paid up member of the NUJ, I can tell the House that there is damn little of that around.  Most of what passes for investigative journalism in this country is little other than muck raking.</P><Col N="43"/>
        <P>We do not help with our performance in this House.  I will continue with this point after I have listened to my colleagues.  I also have more to say regarding the way in which the House is organised or, rather, disorganised.  We had a classic example of it today when we met at 5.30 p.m. instead of 5 p.m. and no Minister was present.  When asked, people did not know what was going on.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris needs to rest after all of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator Norris, for his impassioned contribution to the House.  I also thank him for asking me to second his motion which I will do in a restrained fashion.  I support his general points.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  While he has taken this issue in hand, it is important to recognise that he is being outmanoeuvred by the main Government party.  I have stated this each time the Minister and I have discussed the matter.  It would be unfair of me not to put it on the record of the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il is playing ducks and drakes with the Minister&rsquo;s good ideas and is throwing them back in his face.  We had understood that all the decisions the Minister was to take in respect of this matter were to have been taken last April.  It was then announced that they would be taken last summer and finally we were informed that they would be taken prior to Christmas.  As yet, no such decisions have been made.  I do not agree with everything the Minister is doing.  In the interests of making progress, however, I am of the view that we should do as he suggests in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>We should approach this issue in a proper fashion and we should not attempt to destroy people&rsquo;s political careers.  In light of the fact that we live in a modern democracy, however, it must be stated that the method of election relating to this House is nothing other than anachronistic, unrepresentative and undemocratic.  In saying this, I do not intend to cast any reflection on those who are Members of the House.  I accept that the best of people may become Senators by means of various routes on offer with which I disagree.  I, therefore, intend no reflection on current Members or their contributions.</P>
        <P>Events taking place today provide a good example in the context of circumstances in which the Seanad lacks relevance.  During the past two days the Minister has been hammered in the media in respect of the investigation into the activities of the banks.  This is the only matter in respect of which those in the media wish to ask questions and it is the only issue under discussion in the Lower House.  One would imagine that the Upper House might be of the view that such a matter might be important, topical and relevant and that it is worthy of discussion.  However, we are not discussing it today.  I do not intend to discuss the whys and wherefores in this regard but this is an example of the circumstances in which topicality and relevance are lost.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are a number of issues which we should consider.  I have informed the Minister previously that one of the difficulties which continually arise relates to those who have a vote in respect of the university panels and who are also in a position to vote in respect of the various panels.  I admire the contributions made by colleagues who are elected through the vocational panels system but, like Senator Norris, I disagree with that system as it is currently constituted.  I am not, however, opposed to a system whereby those in the first elected tier in a democracy elected the members of the next tier.  That is a well tried process in many democracies and I do not have a difficulty with it in principle.  My difficulty arises in respect of the fact that in this country, said system is used to elect 43 out of 60 Senators.</P><Col N="44"/>
        <P Just="Left">How should we deal with this matter?  I am of the view that for each of the vocational panels there should at election time be an inner and outer panel.  In the case of the Agricultural Panel, for example, the former would comprise those nominated for election by any four Members of the D&aacute;il or Seanad and the latter would comprise those nominated by the agricultural bodies.  Those on the inner panel should continue to be elected by members of local authorities and those on the outer panel should be elected, in one form or another, by people attached to the nominating bodies.  That would make sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very good idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We could formulate the new system in such a way that far fewer Senators would be elected by local authority members.</P>
        <P>As stated previously &mdash; some consider my remarks in this regard sacrilegious and do not agree with them &mdash; in fairness to colleagues on the Government benches who have built up constituencies on the various vocational panels, I would be satisfied if the Minister decided to proceed with a system such as that which I have outlined in the election after next.  I accept that many would not agree with this but it would give people a period in which to come to terms with the new system.  I am of the view, however, that fair is fair.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are three groups of Senators.  First, there are those who are in the Seanad because they want to make a contribution to its work.  Second, there are those who are here because they failed to gain election to the D&aacute;il.  Third, there are those who are here who are trying to build up a profile to gain election to the D&aacute;il.  Unlike Senator Norris, I do not have a difficulty with this.  I like the idea of people who aspire to membership of the D&aacute;il and those who were Deputies &mdash; even some who held ministerial office &mdash; becoming Members of this House.  If the structure of the electoral system is right, then I have no problem with that which I have outlined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position is similar with regard to the university panels and I agree with the point made by Senator Norris in this regard.  In 1979 we took a constitutional decision that the franchise should be extended to the other colleges and this should be done immediately.  We are of the view, however, that nothing should be agreed until everything is agreed.  It would be just too easy to change the position only as it relates to the university panel.  I would be prepared to change the position regarding the university panels now and not changing that which obtains in respect of the others as long as legislation relating to those panels came into operation at some later date.</P>
        <P>Every citizen should, in some form or other, have one vote &mdash; only one &mdash; in the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea of people having seven votes is nonsense.</P>
        <P>There are other issues with which we must deal.  Those who state that the Seanad should have more power do not understand its function, as established under the Constitution.  It would be completely wrong for the Upper House to pervert permanently the will of the people as expressed in the Lower House.  Our job is, by force of argument, to introduce new information, put forward new perspectives and try to delay, inform, moderate, modify and add to legislation.  The argument that the Seanad can never overturn the D&aacute;il is about as good as that which states that there should not be an Opposition because it cannot overturn the Government.  This argument is nonsense and does not stand up.</P><Col N="45"/>
        <P>We must ensure we make the changes to which I refer.  The Minister has taken this matter on as a crusade of sorts.  I applaud him in that regard and have informed him that he has my full support.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on a final matter.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for people to commit to public life.  The way the media operate, it is becoming a less attractive option and fewer people will choose to be public representatives in the future.  One of the things of which I am extremely proud and in respect of which I get a great deal of hassle is the fact that I negotiated a safety net for teachers who chose to seek election as public representatives.  I ensured these individuals would be supported and that they would have jobs to which they could return if they lost their seats or left public life.  People might object to the terms of the deal I negotiated but the principle behind it is correct.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want someone to ask those in the private and public sectors what they are doing to support people who are good enough to put themselves forward to represent their fellow citizens in the Houses of Parliament.  There is a huge problem in this regard.  In the same way that a person on maternity leave or whatever cannot be sacked, it is equally important that a person who is elected to Parliament should be able to take up office without putting his or her family at risk.  We should ensure there is a fair system of protection for those who give up everything for the sake of serving the citizenry in Parliament and who might subsequently lose their seats.  This is not directly relevant to the matter under discussion.  However, the Minister should challenge people in respect of it.</P>
        <P>Everyone appears intent on having a go with regard to the calibre of Members and that which happens in Leinster House.  Regardless of whether we agree with the system of election or that for which people stand, those who are currently Members were elected by the will of the people, in some form or other.  I am of the view that more people must be encouraged to put themselves forward for election.</P>
        <P>I fully support the proposals brought forward by Senator Norris.  I regret that the Minister has not moved forward in respect of this matter with greater enthusiasm but I accept that a great deal has happened elsewhere in the past six or seven months.  I assure him we will stand with him as long as he goes the whole hog.</P>

         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">As someone serving his third term in the House, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on Seanad reform.  The renewed programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an electoral commission which will be tasked with proposing reforms to the electoral system in a number of areas, including outlining new electoral systems for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The final meeting of the all-party group on Seanad reform was held in November.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is to report to the Government on its conclusions.  The commitment to seek to advance Seanad reform forms a part of the Government&rsquo;s overall approach to Oireachtas reform. It is clear the Minister is committed to Seanad reform.</P>
     
        <P>The issue of Seanad reform was put under the spotlight &mdash; not in the way that I or any Member of this House would like &mdash; by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Kenny.  The Government&rsquo;s reaction at the time was that we must bear our democratic institutions with great <Col N="46"/>care.  Given that even the poorest democracies in the world have a two-chamber system, why should Ireland have only one?  At the end of my contribution I shall outline some of the attributes that have been justly earned by this House in terms of scrutinising legislation.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that Seanad reform must be pursued.  We have done the talking; now let us do the walking.  It would be wrong to simply abolish the Seanad to save money.  We could save money by halving the number of Deputies or by abolishing many of the cabals throughout the country, many of them very worthy organisations.  If we take that simplistic approach we will not be doing any good.  The abolition of the Seanad as put forward by Fine Gael cannot sit as a proposal on its own.  It must be accompanied by significant institutional and constitutional reform.  There are several references to the Seanad in the Constitution.</P>
        <P>The Seanad was established in the interest of a proper functioning democracy.  Abolishing the Seanad would improve vertical accountability of the D&aacute;il as it would be the sole Legislature, but it would remove horizontal accountability, as another body would not check the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s business.  I shall give examples of what would have happened had this Chamber not been in existence.  It would reduce parliamentary oversight of the Executive.  Getting rid of the Seanad may speed up the passing of legislation, although the passing of the bank guarantee scheme in September 2008 is an example that showed that legislation could be done quickly in a bicameral system.</P>
        <P>All parties need to play a constructive role in moving forward with Seanad reform, which is why we do not oppose this motion.  In terms of reform, it is clearly important for any organisation to look continually at the way it does its business.  We should not be afraid to push the boat out and examine how we operate.  However, simply to close it down as Fine Gael has proposed is not the answer.</P>
        <P>The sub-committee on Seanad reform published a report on Seanad reform in April 2004.  I did not agree with a number of those recommendations, but as a democrat I had to take account of what the majority in the Government parties felt at the time.  The report set out a package of comprehensive recommendations for further consideration and action concerning the composition, functions and future role of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Many of these recommendations were radical and far reaching.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to this House being used as a stepping stone.  I shall refrain from using the term &ldquo;to bigger and better things.&rdquo;  I am proud to state that I am a career Senator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators get no help.  This is one of the reasons we have been criticised.  I would have a difficulty in drawing a salary and expenses without giving a service back to the people who pay my wages, the taxpayers.  However, what help do I get to do that?  In a word, none.  There has been a parliamentary response to an ill-conceived report in a national newspaper last Sunday which was grossly inaccurate even in my case.  It was only wrong by &euro;10,500, but that is all right.  If the truth gets in the way of the story, the story is a one-way winner every time.  Senators need to fund it if they want to give a service.  If they want to open an office they need to fund it.  One can imagine the job that is in these times.  To say it is impossible would be the nicest thing one could say.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole spoke about the nominating bodies.  I take a somewhat different view.  I have the honour of being the only Member of the House to be nominated to stand and elected by local authority members and Oireachtas Members given that I was nominated by the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, the oldest local authority organisation in the country.  Even though I represent it as its nominee, it is short-changed in this House.  While <Col N="47"/>at all times I seek to put forward its views, it does not have a vote.  Some of the biggest urban authorities, including those of towns with a bigger population than some counties do not have a vote.</P>

	<P>Last year, 1,199 amendments were made in the Seanad at all Stages.  When the raft of equality legislation went through the D&aacute;il in 1993, one Bill focused on the issue of unlawful dismissal.  It established for the first time in law sexual orientation as a ground for discrimination in employment matters.  The Bill went through the preliminary consultation process, eventually passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il and arrived at the Seanad.  Eight grounds of discrimination were set out in the Bill, but Senator Quinn noticed that one important ground had been totally left out &mdash; discrimination on grounds of age.  In the Electoral (Amendment) Bill there was all-party agreement to a ban on opinion polls in the period before elections.  On discovery that a poll could be published on the morning of the election the provision was deleted in the Seanad and its deletion subsequently agreed in the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>I crave your indulgence, Acting Chairman, as these are important.  In the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Bill, Senator Quinn highlighted that the scholarships were for people from the Republic only and the Bill was subsequently amended.  From 1998 to 2008, an average of 30% of all Bills initiated in the Houses of the Oireachtas were initiated in this House.</P>
        <P>Throughout its history, the Seanad has provided greater representation for women.  A higher percentage of women have been Members of the Seanad both at present and since 1922 than of the D&aacute;il.  While only 13% of Deputies are women, the Seanad has a better representation at 22%.</P>

	<P>It was certainly read at a fast pace as well.  The Senator probably broke all records for that one.  I wish to respond to some of the points he made.  While they might be considered to be incidental points, I agree with the thrust of what he said.  There is just a small correction.  He mentioned how he had initiated a Civil Partnership Bill in this House and mentioned how it had been taken up by the Labour Party.  It was also taken up by the Green Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very happy to acknowledge it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with his analysis of what is occurring in the media.  It is a very serious issue that was taken up by his colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  The way this is going I have no doubt fewer people will want to enter public life.  This is a serious issue.  I believe colleagues will agree with me when I say being a public representative is a very honourable profession.  We should encourage more people from the various professions outlined to enter public life.  In that way we would have greater variety.  I am looking at Senator Quinn, for example, who has brought his business experience to bear and made a very significant contribution.  As highlighted by Senator Glynn, the Seanad has, no question, made a major contribution in altering legislation.  I have always said this at committee meetings and value very much its contribution. </P>
        <P>The motion requests that the Government embark urgently on a process of comprehensive Seanad reform.  I am pleased to say the Government does not oppose the motion.  I was very clear on this and believe we should wholeheartedly support the motion.  Reform of this House merits attention.</P>
        <P>I should like to comment on the words &ldquo;public criticism&rdquo; used in the Senators&rsquo; motion.  The public has every right to expect our institutions of State will work as effectively as possible on behalf of the people.  The operations of the Oireachtas must continually earn legitimacy from a society which justifiably demands quality decision-making and legislative action.  That is the reality of the social contract.  Therefore, I welcome fair criticism and scrutiny of the Oireachtas which can spur necessary reform and which reminds us, as public representatives, that those we represent are ever watchful.  However, I do not welcome criticism which misunderstands or willfully ignores the role of and contribution made by the Seanad.  While some of the criticisms of the Seanad in the last 12 months have validity, some comments have not contributed to reasonable and informed discourse and have done this House and its Members a disservice.</P>
        <P>Despite a wealth of reports on reform of the Seanad and the expenditure of considerable energy and thought over the decades, we have not succeeded in achieving all-party agreement on substantive reform.  The motion refers to the numerous reports on Seanad reform.  Eight reports have been made since 1943, the most recent in 2004.  Therefore, extensive reportage has not translated into successive programmes of radical reform.  It is fair to observe that the political system has not embraced wholesale change of the House in the last half century.  However, I have sympathy that there is a natural caution in that regard.  One must remember that the pursuit of constitutional change requires a considerable mandate which has not always been readily apparent.  It is also undeniably the case that the issues involved are complex and <Col N="49"/>multi-faceted.  Contemplation of reform necessitates consideration of the constitutional, political, legal, administrative and resource implications and repercussions.  Notwithstanding my appreciation of a certain guardedness in relation to constitutional change, the time comes when change must be contemplated.  No institution is immune to the need to maintain its relevance, mandate and effectiveness.</P>
        <P>An Agreed Programme for Government from 2007 states the Government will determine the extent of cross-party agreement on the recommendations of the report on Seanad reform and advance proposals for implementation.  The commitment to seek Seanad reform is part of the Government&rsquo;s overall approach to Oireachtas reform.  The 2004 report which the all-party group considered argued that there was &ldquo;an urgent need to accept the political reality that Seanad &Eacute;ireann really must be reformed if it is to make a viable and distinctive contribution to the economic, social and political affairs of our country&rdquo;.  In terms of its composition, the report recommended a Seanad with 65 seats: 32 directly elected, 20 indirectly elected and 12 Taoiseach nominees.  The report made a number of recommendations regarding the functions of the Seanad, including in relation to the scrutiny of legislation, EU affairs, the review of public policy and the scrutiny of public appointments.  As acknowledged in the report, many of its recommendations are radical and far-reaching and a number would require constitutional amendment.</P>
        <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, requested that I chair an all-party group on Seanad reform in line with the commitment made in the programme for Government.  The aim of the group was to establish, in a small number of meetings, the extent of cross-party agreement on the 2004 report&rsquo;s recommendations.  The group met on four occasions during the period 2008-09 and included Members from both Houses representing all parties in the Oireachtas, as well as the Independent Senators.  It provided a forum for the comprehensive consideration of reform of the Upper House.  I publicly thank the members of the group, Deputies and Senators, several of whom are present, for their contributions.  All political parties engaged in a positive manner with the group&rsquo;s business.</P>
        <P>Despite the view of all participants that reform was necessary, the reality is that there was little all-party consensus on what route it should take.  The all-party group&rsquo;s deliberations indicated that party positions varied from complete abolition to reform within the existing electoral system, save in relation to the higher education constituency.  The group&rsquo;s work ranged over the nature of the Seanad electoral panels, its electorate, functions and possible enhanced role in areas such as North-South and EU affairs and a potential role in relation to public appointments.</P>
        <P>The group noted the most significant changes to the composition of the Seanad would require constitutional amendment.  There was a collective appreciation of the difficulty of pursuing constitutional reform in the short term.  After some discussion, therefore, the group narrowed its consideration to four main areas.  The first had to do with an enabling amendment to the Constitution to permit subsequent reform by legislation which was discussed in detail.  It was suggested the detailed prescriptive provisions currently in the Constitution which set out how the indirect panel system operates could be replaced with a simpler enabling provision that would allow greater flexibility to reform the electoral process by legislation.  However, it was generally considered the details of any new system would have to be known before a proposal was put to the people.</P>
        <P>The expansion of the higher education constituency was another issue considered in detail.  The current system of electing the representatives of graduates of the National University of Ireland and Trinity College has been acknowledged by all parties as anomalous.  However, the <Col N="50"/>university Senators were opposed to this issue being treated in isolation, as highlighted by Senator Norris in his contribution today.</P>
        <P>The group also considered two other reforms: the scrutiny of certain senior public appointments by the Seanad to improve transparency and the provision for the membership of the Clerk of the Seanad of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The party responses indicated that while there was some consensus on making a number of changes to the operation of the Seanad, there was little all-party support on the major issues of reform.</P>
        <P>I have stated previously that I favour widening the third level electoral franchise.  However, it should be noted that there are now over 500,000 graduates in the State and widening this franchise could have significant resource implications.  Again, this was a valid point made by Senator Norris at the committee hearing.  The issue also needs to be considered in the context of examining wider reform.  Today&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Education and Science that the NUI is to be abolished will also have to be taken into consideration in deciding how we move forward.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the work of the all-party group has been somewhat overtaken by the renewed programme for Government which commits to the establishment of an independent electoral commission which will incorporate a number of electoral functions and be tasked with proposing reforms to the electoral system in several areas, including outlining a new electoral system for the Seanad.  The programme also states options for the timing of elections to local authorities, the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and the European Parliament will be considered, to include the possibility of mid-term elections and running some elections on a staggered or rolling basis in order that they would not fall on the same day for every candidate or Chamber.</P>
        <P>We seem to be some way off cross-party consensus on reform of the Seanad and I will be reporting this conclusion to the Government.  I intend to submit a report for discussion with my colleagues in government shortly.  We will have regard to the views expressed by all parties and the commitments given in the programme for Government.  We will then consider the next steps to be taken in the process.  While consensus remains elusive, I have previously informed the House that the absence of consensus cannot be allowed to lead to paralysis.  It is my ambition that the Government will press ahead with reforms from which successive Governments have shied away.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Enda Kenny&rsquo;s proposal is to put in a referendum to the people the question of whether we need to have two Chambers in the Oireachtas.  Ultimately, it is the people who will decide what type of system we will have for the future.  In the here and now those who are most important in considering the issue of reform within the Oireachtas are the parties in government.  There have been eight reports on reform of the Seanad.  It is clear, therefore, that very little has been done.  Constitutional changes are required in respect of all the reforms proposed for this Chamber, but nothing has ever been done.</P>
        <P>First and foremost, the Government needs to pull up its socks and get a move on in changing the way the Seanad is run and how it operates if we are to win the confidence of the people that this Chamber is relevant.  I have no doubt that there are great debates, including legislative scrutiny, in this Chamber.  For five years I was a Member of the Lower House where I was my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on health.  There is the same quality of debate and commitment to politics in this House.  If I am asked to do so by my party, I will stand for election to the Lower House again.  However, as regards being a politician, I find the role of Senator somewhat limited.  While I have access to officials in the civil and public service through my role as a Member of the Oireachtas, there are serious problems in this House.  It is up to the Leader and the Government parties to make the required changes.</P><Col N="51"/>
        <P>I have worked in the private sector in which I ran a general medical practice.  There was a day-to-day business element, as well as an emergency service element, which cannot be planned in advance.  In some respects, this House reflects that position.  There are things that can change at short notice and matters that can be planned for well in advance.  At times, however, the business of the House is chaotic.  This would be unacceptable in the private sector.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to Senator Quinn.  If he ran his business the way this House is managed, he would not be in business.  He would be unknown because he would have been broke years ago.  As that reflects what happens in the House, we need to make changes.  If we want to be relevant, we can make ourselves so.  For instance, we put questions to the Leader on the Order of Business and ask him to obtain replies from Ministers, yet I have not once received a letter stating what a Minister thinks of my request.  I am sure that goes for Members on both sides of the House.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is present, Ministers do not pay much attention to what happens in this House.  Many avoid turning up here.  For instance, there is no commitment on the part of Ministers to attend on Committee and Report Stages of legislation to see what amendments are tabled and if adjustments need to be made.  Ministers of State attend the House and say they will refer back to the Minister, or else they just stonewall and do nothing.  It makes the House look irrelevant, which is the public perception of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>We can stand up for ourselves and discuss the matter as Opposition Members, but it is up to Government representatives to put pressure both on their party leaders and Ministers to show a strong commitment on how the House works.  We do not need to dive straight into constitutional issues.  Reform can start by reorganising the business of the House and getting Ministers to make it relevant.  It is a two-way process in that we can also take direction from the Leader and the Cathaoirleach or Acting Chairman if speeches are considered to be irrelevant in debates or if Members are making Second Stage speeches on Committee or Report Stage.  However, it is up to the Leader to start giving the required leadership.  The Government often dictates what happens here, which can be to the detriment of how we are perceived.  If the Leader is instructed by the Government not to facilitate matters, we are the ones who look foolish because we will not be seen to be debating topical issues or to deal properly with legislation.  We have a role in making the House more relevant.  If we make ourselves more relevant, we will be more relevant to the people.</P>
        <P>I will cite one example, of which Ministers are well aware.  All of the Oireachtas Members for County Wexford were asked to meet to discuss the issue of policing committees.  As I was in the House, Senator Walsh went to the meeting to represent Senators.  The five Wexford Deputies voted to take the five positions on the policing body themselves.  They deemed the Senators to be irrelevant.  However, I do not believe the Minister can do anything about this.  I do not even know if he has any views on whether there should be at least one Senator on various State or local authority bodies, including policing committees.  At present there is nothing to stop the five Deputies from taking such positions, thus excluding Members of the Seanad.  The Minister could take this on board and sort out the matter quickly on our behalf.</P>
        <P>We should bear in mind a health and safety issue for staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as departmental staff who assist Ministers.  The carry on in sitting late into the night, with no idea of whether we will sit on Mondays, Tuesdays or Fridays, is absolutely stupid.  It is disrespectful to those working in the Oireachtas and Departments.  They must make provision to get home, sometimes after midnight.  In addition, when they come to work, they do not know if they will be working late.  That might be fine for many of us; perhaps we like to be machismo in working all night and doing things backwards, but what about the staff?  We are asking people who work for us to go home late at night.  They may not be able to afford taxis and buses may no longer be running.  They are going onto the streets late at night, which is unnecess<Col N="52"/>ary.  The health and safety aspect applies to everyone who works late, including the ushers who are here all day and work long nights.  I have no doubt that from a medical viewpoint such a working environment places unnecessary stress on staff.  This should stop.</P>
        <P>When we discuss reform, the big questions relate to constitutional issues and how we can change the electoral system.  If we really wanted to do so, in this session we change the small things I have outlined.  That would result in a serious alteration to the way in which the House is run, as well as to how it is perceived.  We should have respect for those who serve us as Members of this House and in Departments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am delighted to welcome my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who is absolutely committed to Seanad reform.  I have spoken to him about the matter on many occasions, most recently when I saw this motion on the Order Paper.  I contacted him by text message and suggested we support the motion.  He was quick to reply and agree.  I will certainly support the motion which is a good one.</P>
        <P>There are many issues to be debated on Seanad reform.  Senator Twomey has broadened the debate, but what does Seanad reform mean?  Does it only refer to the way in which elections are held?  I think not.  Senator Twomey spoke about the way in which the business of the Seanad was conducted, but that can be reformed without recourse to legislation or a constitutional amendment.  We could do this tomorrow if we so wished.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that members of the public want the Seanad to perform a useful service on their behalf.  In advance of this debate I was asked by a member of the public what my constituency was.  I thought that was an interesting question.  I was elected to the House in a by-election just before Christmas.  The voters were Deputies and Senators.  Members of the university panels are elected in very big constituencies by university graduates.  Most Senators, however, are elected by councillors, Deputies and Senators, in other words, by all of the elected representatives.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a valid point when he said every person on the electoral register should have one vote in Seanad elections.  That is a good principle, which I would support.  I have a background in many areas, one being information technology.</P>
        <P>I can see that the various Seanad panels were established at a particular point in history, but they are now outdated.  It is time for reform.  Last year Deputy Enda Kenny stated he would like to abolish the Seanad within one year of assuming power.  I stand to be corrected, but he certainly said he would like to abolish the Seanad if he was elected Taoiseach.</P>

	<P>I do not see any Members falling asleep behind me.  It was always a bit of fun to watch on television live coverage from the House of Lords to see how many people were falling asleep.  It was quite extraordinary.  That is not the system we have here.</P>
        <P>It is a great privilege to be a Senator and to be able to stand here and debate as a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is extraordinary and a great privilege to be debating in the Chamber with people whom I regarded during the years as having household names.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn stated 1,199 amendments were tabled in the Seanad last year.  This is an extraordinary number.  It is not the case, therefore, that the Seanad is irrelevant.  However, there is a great difficulty associated with how this House is perceived.  Most members of the public, to many of whom I have spoken, have no idea what the Seanad does or does not do.  An educational process could form a part of Seanad reform immediately.  I have watched visitors trooping into the Visitors Gallery, for a number of minutes in most cases, to watch debates in the Seanad.  Bringing children into the Seanad is very worthwhile.  Many others visit the Seanad to see what is going on.  It is very much the case that those who visit are interested in doing so.  It is quite important that we embark on an outreach programme.  I am sure it has been tried before.  It is important to make the Seanad relevant.  I do not want to see it abolished.</P>
        <P>I have ambitions.  I have stood for election to the Lower House twice and would welcome the opportunity to do so again.  I have been selected to do so again and would love to be elected.  However, I take the business of the Seanad very seriously.  It is an enormous privilege to be here and I intend to put my heart and soul into being a Senator and into making as great a difference as I can while I am here, albeit making no assumptions as to what will happen in the future.  None of us can do that and none of us knows how long the Government or this <Col N="54"/>House will last.  While it does last, it is important that each of us makes as strong a contribution as possible and does his best to achieve what he can.</P>
        <P>This will be an ongoing debate.  The key point for me, as a new Senator, is that we make a difference in what we do.  I hope this is not a debate, involving only the ten or so Senators present, that disappears into the record books but that it spurs real reform.  A statement made to me, a truism, was that very few people elected by a particular system are prepared to reform that system.  The university Senators are saying it would be unfair to reform certain aspects of the Seanad without reforming everything.  Turkeys do not vote for Christmas; nevertheless, we have come to a point in our history where there is great disquiet over the political system.  There is a great need for reform and every Member should be prepared to see a decent level of reform.  I hope it happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  She will be reporting on this debate to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, who had to leave.</P>
        <P>I am glad to be associated with this motion and to have joined Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Norris in proposing it.  I am glad the Government is supporting it, which is very important.  The cause of Seanad reform is important and we need to debate it, particularly in this House.  In the brief period since I was elected, just over two years ago, this has been the third substantial debate on Seanad reform.  We certainly debated it in November 2007 and March 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Circumstances have changed somewhat since we last debated the issue.  In March 2009, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, was more upbeat about the prospect of real reform of the Seanad.  I was rather disappointed to hear a note of frustration in his speech this evening.  I do not know if I am correct in that regard but believe he was frustrated by the lack of progress on achieving consensus on Seanad reform.  I am disappointed about this because I attended some of the meetings of the all-party group on Seanad reform.  I certainly believed consensus was emerging.  A clear consensus had emerged in the weighty and considered report produced on Seanad reform in 2004.  I believe I am correct in stating it had all-party support.  It made recommendations on the future composition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  For the most part, they were sensible recommendations on the processes by which Senators are elected, with a view to making them more democratic, and on the business the Seanad should be conducting.  They would make the Seanad&rsquo;s structures more efficient and effective.</P>
        <P>Consensus was reached and the all-party group was seeking to identify practical ways to act on that consensus.  From what the Minister is saying, I understand events have overtaken the group.  His speech states &ldquo;there is little all-party support on the major issues of reform&rdquo; and &ldquo;we seem to be some way off reaching cross-party consensus on the Seanad and I will be reporting this conclusion to the Government&rdquo;.  There is a tone of defeatism and it is unlikely, from what the Minister is saying, that we will see substantive reform.  I would be grateful for clarification on whether my interpretation of the Minister&rsquo;s speech is correct.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It will be a pity if there is stagnation.  The university Senators are very keen to see reform, as is the Labour Party group.  I speak as the only university Senator in the Labour Party group.  The group is very keen to see significant reform of the method by which the Seanad is elected and in the business it conducts.  Unless such change occurs, the role and relevance of the Seanad will continue to be questioned by the public to such an extent that convincing arguments may be made for its abolition.  This is perhaps where Fine Gael is coming from.  We do not support outright abolition in that we contend there is a role for a second Chamber.  However, it must be reformed substantially in order to answer the arguments being made for its abolition.</P><Col N="55"/>
        <P>The problem concerns what kinds of reforms to be made.  We have the benefit of an all-party group that issued a report and made recommendations.  Let me address some of the recommendations and suggest ways in which the Seanad could become more relevant, thus allowing its retention to be supported much more widely by the public.  Since I have been elected, the strength of the Seanad has lain in its debates on legislation, particularly on Committee Stage, during which we tease out the technicalities.  The Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, has been present for some of those debates.  She will have noted that there is space in Seanad debates for more considered and thoughtful contributions on Bill amendments than in D&aacute;il debates.  In particular, the university Senators have demonstrated during the years a strong commitment to bringing forward amendments that might have no space to be debated in the Lower House.  The debates on them often lead to the improvement of a Bill, even if the amendments are not directly accepted by the Minister, although they often are.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Seanad has served a valuable function in providing a platform for views to be expressed which are often not expressed in the Lower House.  It gives an opportunity for people to be represented in a way that they may not be in the Lower House.  For example, while they may not have directly fed into legislation or have been adopted by the Government of the day, one of the Private Member&rsquo;s Bills from the 1970s of my predecessor from Trinity College Dublin, Mrs. Mary Robinson, fed into a change in public opinion and ultimately paved the way for reform of the law on contraception, with important socially progressive legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is also Senator Bacik&rsquo;s climate change Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, there is my Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, the Climate Protection Bill.  I thank Senator Norris.  I was going to go on to speak of the immense contribution he has made in this area.  His Civil Partnership Bill 2004, in which I played a small role&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik played a large role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;and which the Government did not adopt, will be accepted in years to come as paving the way for the Government&rsquo;s own civil partnership legislation.  It also helped to shift the public debate.  The Seanad&rsquo;s role in shifting public debate and changing public opinion is often not sufficiently acknowledged.  The Seanad plays a vital role in this regard, one that the D&aacute;il cannot play.  I always believed this, even before I was elected to the Seanad.  Legislation such as Mary Henry&rsquo;s on the need to regulate assisted human reproduction and <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation was pioneering in a way in which Senator Norris&rsquo;s civil partnership legislation and M<Insert>rs. M</Insert>ary Robinson&rsquo;s on contraception was.</P>
        <P>While I defend the role and existence of the Seanad, significant and substantial reform is needed.  The election processes need to be changed.  All Senators on the university panels agree on the need to extend the franchise to graduates of all third level institutions.  The Minister claimed this would present logistical difficulties and have significant resource implications because, as he pointed out, there are over 500,000 graduates in the State.  I am disappointed by this and again detect a note of defeatism and frustration.  The case has to be made to making this reform to the university panels.</P>
        <P>I also support the recommendation made in the 2004 report on Seanad reform which called for a broadening of the university constituency to a national higher education constituency and that other Seanad seats should be directly elected in a single national constituency using a proportional representation list system.  This latter process would make the Seanad different from the D&aacute;il because it would be not be based on geographical constituencies.  It would also mean those entitled to vote in the higher education constituency would have to chose in which constituency they wished to vote.  This would prevent people from being doubly enfranchised.  This was a sensible idea to make the Seanad more democratic in its election processes.</P><Col N="56"/>
        <P>As regards the Seanad&rsquo;s work, the Minister will be aware of the recommendation made in 2004 that it should be given a new role in scrutinising EU legislation.  That is an enormous task.  We are all conscious of the increased workload in that regard, particularly considering the Lisbon treaty&rsquo;s provisions in that respect.  As a member of the justice committee, I am conscious of seeing an increased amount of EU legislation coming before it.  There is a real argument to be made for the Seanad to have a greater role in this area.  I am often concerned that legislation that might be controversial or have serious implications for changing policy might slip through the net unless it is debated in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  It seems the Seanad would be an appropriate forum in that regard.</P>
        <P>The argument was also made that the Seanad should have a role in scrutinising senior public appointments, an eminently sensible suggestion.  We have seen far too little accountability in the appointment of senior public servants during the years, a matter under the spotlight, given the talk about a banking inquiry and failures in regulation at the top levels.</P>
        <P>There is clearly a role for an Upper House with clear functions it should undertake.  In the two years I have been a Member I have seen an enormous strength in the House&rsquo;s role as a legislative assembly.  Under the Constitution, that has to remain the primary function of the Seanad.  However, there are other functions that have been recommended which should also be taken on.  Clearly, much of what the House does is not effective.  I have spoken before about how statements can seem to be pointless time-fillers.  There is an argument for tightening the Seanad schedule to ensure it is much more effective in a shorter space of time.  I agree with Senator Twomey on the chaotic ordering of business and the machismo of the House sitting through the night to deal with legislation.  There should be better ways of ordering our business.  It would be worthwhile examining how we can whittle it down and, then, if necessary, Member&rsquo;s pay and allowances, to ensure the work the Seanad does, as a legislative body and a scrutiniser of EU legislation and public appointments, is valid and genuine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Seanad has a role to play but for this to continue significant reforms must be made.  Otherwise, the arguments for its abolition gain weight.  There is no doubt such arguments already carry some weight with the public.  We must answer them robustly by making a clear case for reform.  I believed the Minister had a genuine commitment to it.  Even a year ago when the House last debated the issue, he was positive about the prospect of Seanad reform during the Government&rsquo;s term.  I am not sure he is so positive now, which is a pity because we need reform before the next election.</P>

	<P>In the seven and a half years I have been a Member there have been three Seanad reform debates per year on Private Members&rsquo; business with an amendment to the motion.  Tonight no amendment to this Private Members&rsquo; motion has been tabled.</P>
        <P>If members of the public were remotely and accurately informed about the level of debate, scrutiny and work done in this House, they would have much more confidence in our political system.  Unfortunately, little more than lip-service is paid by many to the workings of the House.  Senator Norris and other Members have mentioned how the media do not cover the proceedings of the House.  He has never minded when I have often told him unless a Member is gay, a former president of the ICTU, a <i>Sunday Independent</i> business journalist or like some of the other fine Independent Senators, one can barely get a soundbite on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and certainly not be covered elsewhere in the media.  That is not to impugn the overwhelming contribution made by the mentioned Senators.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>No, Senator Norris has, rightly, been covered on a great many issues.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment the Seanad has been an admirable institution.  The lack of media coverage, then their comments in an authoritative fashion as to their opinion on the Seanad&rsquo;s usefulness and uselessness and the suggestion of its abolition have done a disservice to the great work it has done.  It has taken up quite a few debates, even on <i>The Late Late Show</i>, which I thought was the exclusive preserve of toys and soft entertainment.  I did not participate in that debate because I knew it would be an ambush, which it was.</P>
        <P>With past and current Members, I have been an enthusiastic supporter of Seanad reform.  Throughout the history of the State Members of all parties and none have sought to preserve the <i>status quo</i>, namely, to use the Seanad as a safety net for the &ldquo;also ran&rdquo; and a launching pad to protect their future prospects.  Notwithstanding this, as I pointed out, the Seanad is a useful forum in terms of considering legislation and the role its plays in society; meaningful reform could enhance its role further.  Until there is a will to do this at senior government level I do not believe we will have the reform for which all of us in the House have always and will continue to yearn.  Parnell was once described as &ldquo;dry rot&rdquo; in the House of Commons.  Senators are often described, metaphorically by Members of the other House, as dry rot in the Oireachtas and the legislative process, with which I fundamentally disagree.  We need to work to change this view &mdash; I am speaking candidly on the basis that we will not be voting on the motion &mdash; and to work collectively to convince people in the higher echelons of government &mdash; I include in that Governments made up of Fine Gael and other party members &mdash; to take a different view of the Seanad.  Until we do this, we will not see the required reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Norris, O&rsquo;Toole, Glynn and others made valid points.  The Minister stated it would be difficult to achieve cross-party consensus on this issue.  Reforming an institution of State is a difficult mission.  The reality is that if we cannot achieve consensus, we will require leadership to take us forward in addressing this issue as best we can.  I look forward to this happening in the short term.  It is ridiculous in the extreme that we have had eight reports on the matter and that we have had such preservation of the <i>status quo</i>.  However, it suited to have that safety net for the &ldquo;also ran&rdquo; and as a launching pad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have never contested a D&aacute;il election and have never been a member of a local authority, although I might have liked to have been a member of both.  I am not suggesting it would not be nice to serve as a Member of the other House.  However, I have taken my role in this House seriously and have tried as a member of the Industrial and Commercial Panel to reflect in legislation relevant to that sector my experience which is exclusively in industry as a business person, an employee and through my involvement in international marketing.  I do not use my position exclusively to raise issues relevant to Sligo-Leitrim or solely for the purpose of raising my profile in order to enhance it.  I fully expect to put my name forward in the next Seanad election, notwithstanding the intentions of Deputy Kenny, for whom I have great respect.  However, in terms of his aspiration to abolish the Seanad and his call during interviews for reform from the centre and the top, which confuses me, I do not believe pandering to populist media driven reactionary politics is what the nation needs at this time.  We should seek to improve our institutions and reform them in a meaningful way to ensure they are more effective, as in the case of the Constitution which has served us well since 1937.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of the reforms I would like to see, I agree with the Graduate Equality Ireland Group which, with many other organisations, has lobbied for implementation of the seventh amendment to the Constitution to widen the university structure to reflect the position in the <Col N="58"/>higher education sector in 2009 rather than in 1937.  We are all agreed on that point.  There are many areas other than that which should be reformed, including a reduction in the number of nominating bodies for those elected through the system, an area in which there is much duplication.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees should always include representatives from Northern Ireland, although, unlike others, I do not believe this will happen.  It is unlikely that the Queen will bestow peerages on us.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Lisbon treaty provides for a Sixth Stage in the processing of legislation which will see draft legislation kicked back to national parliaments.  Therein lies the biggest value in terms of what Seanad &Eacute;ireann can do for the future.  So often Members have expressed frustration that we only rubber-stamp European directives.  However, under the Lisbon treaty, we will have an opportunity to take a view on them.  For two days each week it should be the exclusive role of the Seanad to scrutinise EU legislation.  Only today I called for a debate on the draft legislative package on financial regulatory reform, an important issue.  These are the debates in which we should be getting involved and taking an informed view.  This would assist in bringing the public closer to this institution of State and assist us as a nation take a more informed view of proposed EU legislation in order that our Ministers, including the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, and others, when they attend the Council of Ministers can reflect an Irish opinion as debated in the Seanad having listened to various interest groups.</P>

	<P>With the Chair&rsquo;s indulgence, I would like to make a few more points.  I support the call for the scrutiny of public appointments as mentioned by other speakers.  A revised number of joint committees should be chaired and convened by Senators.  Clearly, as Deputies are expected to be more involved in constituency work than Senators, Senators could chair and convene committees.  I do not propose we receive any money or a reward for so doing other than that we do so on the days we attend the Oireachtas. </P>
        <P Just="Left">On the methods of election, some Members should be elected through the panel system but I am not against universal franchise on a constituency basis such as the European constituencies.  Another issue on which I would like to see some work done &mdash; I acknowledge some work was done in the past &mdash; is the petition system, whereby, for example, 50,000 members of the public or any three of a list of prescribed organisations could petition the Seanad to consider an issue and on which &mdash; this is interesting, although it may not be possible to achieve agreement on it &mdash; an open and free non-partisan vote would take place to determine a follow-up recommendation or achieve referral to the Cabinet which would, in turn, respond on the matter within three months.  However, such a recommendation would not be binding.  This would be greatly welcomed by the public.  I am not being populist but such an initiative would be worthwhile.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More than anything I hope that during the remainder of my time as a Member of this House some reforms will be made.  Senator Norris has often stated that on opening day of the Seanad the issue of Seanad reform is always one about which there is great enthusiasm but that the level of enthusiasm usually lags after the first two or three weeks.  I hope that with the help of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, the rest of the Government and Members of this House that will not happen this time.  I know every Member of the House is a strong and enthusiastic supporter of Seanad reform.  I have expressed <Col N="59"/>a few of my ideas, some of which may be a little radical.  Nevertheless, they are genuine in their ambition to see what is a relevant and important institution and arm of State become even more effective.  While the media have chosen not to provide coverage of our work, that is their hard luck.  We continue to do good work.</P>

I begin by clarifying for Senator MacSharry that Deputy Kenny was not pandering to populism in his remarks.  We have had eight reports on Seanad reform and the matter has been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i>.  It is time the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, in the absence of consensus, moved forward and introduced reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I am disappointed he did not refer to any future heads of a Bill or to an expectation of legislation for reform of the Seanad.  It is time the Government, if it is intent and serious about Seanad reform, presented to us legislation to move this process forward.  As Senator Norris so eloquently stated the process has taken us to the highways and byways of ideas and suggestions.  It is time we had reform.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The political process is broken.  We have lost our connection with the people.  It is exemplified in this House by the fact that tonight in an important debate the Minister has left us.  He is not alone in doing so.  While I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, and wish no disrespect to her, the Minister dealing with a specific Bill should be here for the duration of the debate and should engage in a process of questions and answers, consultation and dialogue with Members.  This happens on Committee Stage, but that is different in that it deals with amendments.  Where we have statements, the Minister should stay for the duration of the debate and should engage in questions and answers and open a two-way process of discussion in this House.</P>
        <P>We are in the midst of an economic recession.  People are under pressure.  They have priorities such as jobs, retaining their homes, education and child care worries.  The media have generated much of the debate about the Houses of the Oireachtas which are under greater scrutiny.  If we are honest and objective, we can state quite categorically that this House is not working effectively.</P>
        <P>Yesterday in a vote of the people in the State of Massachusetts defeated a Democratic candidate who was 30% ahead in the polls four weeks before Christmas.  They sent a message to politicians which can be translated here, and if we had elections in this country tomorrow the same message would resonate.  The people are asking politicians to listen and to lead, to work on their behalf and to promote job creation, greater accountability and transparency in our work in this House and in the other House, and in local authorities.  Our fundamental task in this House is to work on behalf of the people.  We can do that by better structuring our business.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry used the word &ldquo;ambush&rdquo;.  We ambush ourselves in this House by the way in which we structure and order our business.  I do not mean to apportion blame to anybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I like a bit of bluster too and I am good at it but we need to have genuine interaction.</P>
        <P>The Minister and Senators have spoken about how we can implement reform and change.  The Lisbon treaty, as we mentioned, has been passed which means European legislation and European scrutiny can come into this House.  Rather than having an EU scrutiny committee, which is doing good work, it could be done here.</P>
        <P>I will incur the wrath of the Independent Senators, but we have this great line about having to reform how the Independent Senators are elected and to include new universities.  The Minister for Education and Science today has abolished the NUI.  What implication does that have for the Seanad?  At the stroke of a pen, he abolished the NUI.</P>
        <P>Personally, I have no difficulty in advocating reform of the Seanad because in my two and a half years here I have tremendously enjoyed it.  I find the debate here to be invigorating and I get a great lift from it.  Unfortunately, much of the debate here goes unnoticed.  While I might not agree with what is said, there is a great sense of participation by the Members who have a good ability to communicate the message of whatever debate.  There have been some great suggestions from all sides of the House that have not gone anywhere, which we need to reflect upon and we need to change and amend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part of the difficulty, be it driven by the media or for whatever reason, is that people see this House as irrelevant, which it is not.  It is very relevant in the scrutiny of legislation.  In time, and when the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 which has gone through this House comes out into the public domain, there will be consternation.  Under the Government, more power has been devolved back to central government, taken away from the regions and the councils and given back to the Minister and the mandarins in the Department, which is wrong.  There needs to be greater scrutiny here; we need more time devoted to scrutiny of legislation without the use of the guillotine.  We need to schedule our business more effectively and efficiently and orientate it more towards the House having relevance beyond the gates of the compound of Leinster House.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s proposal to abolish the Seanad has set another debate going, but the motion is valuable.  The Minister spoke about the establishment of an independent electoral commission.  He should not wait for that.  He should go forward himself with zeal and gusto and reform the Seanad, for which he will get support.  I commend the Senators for the motion and thank them for putting it forward on the Order Paper.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No more than his good self who will come up against these matters from time to time, I appreciate it.</P>
        <P>Much work has been done by the leaders, the representatives who have sat down with the Minister and tried to get a consensus on how we can make the Seanad more meaningful.  As far as I am concerned, the suggestions that have been made here by various colleagues for the Seanad are all worthwhile and most of them are worthy of being included in Seanad reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The suggestion that we should sit at least one day a week on the Sixth Stage of legislation on European directives and assist the nation and Ministers when they go to the European Union is good and we fully support it.  That was one of the proposals we, in Fianna F&aacute;il, included for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am here as long as anyone with the exception of one Member.  The value of the Seanad is there is no use of the guillotine on legislation.  The value of the Seanad was seen on the NAMA legislation and the various legislation on banking that came before us recently where every section was debated and discussed in minute detail, section by section and line by line.  That is the difference between D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann does not and cannot say that every section and every line is debated and discussed because we know that is not a fact.  The guillotine is used because the considerable membership in the D&aacute;il does not allow time.  It would be sitting seven days a week if that was the case.  The strength of the Seanad is that there is no guillotine used.  Certainly under my leadership since 1997, no guillotine has ever been used.  We have sat until 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., and even 8.20 a.m. on the NAMA legislation.</P>
        <P>The taxpayer and democracy are well protected.  Every section of value for money legislation proposed by any Minister or Government is discussed in minute detail.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the workload of the Seanad.  Last year, we sat for 100 days.  Never in its history has Seanad &Eacute;ireann sat for 100 days.  Last year, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann sat for 101 days.  These were unprecedented sittings and we are very proud of that fact.  In 2008, the House accepted 1,201 amendments to legislation from Ministers who appeared before the House, a very significant contribution to legislation and to ensuring better, stronger and more relevant Bills.  In 2008, 31% of all legislation was initiated in the Seanad.  Certain colleagues in the House may remember the 1980s when it would have been a celebration if two Bills per year were initiated in the House.  The substantial amount of legislation now being initiated in the House speaks volumes and indicates the esteem in which the Cabinet holds the Seanad and the importance of the House in helping and assisting the Government to process more legislation.  This is very welcome.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il proposal on Seanad &Eacute;ireann suggests a right of audience for Northern Ireland Assembly Members.  It provides for a right of audience in the House for up to ten Members who may come down here on occasion, perhaps once or twice per year, and be present for debates to be agreed by the Chairs of both Houses.  In return, Members of Seanad <Col N="62"/>&Eacute;ireann would have a right of audience in the Northern Ireland Assembly to see how we could assist in the great work of the Good Friday Agreement, the North South bodies, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and all the important committees and functions carried out by the Council of Ministers in respect of Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also support the automatic return of the Cathaoirleach as one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 appointments.  The Cathaoirleach is in a very difficult position because he must stay completely independent and cannot attend any function.  This makes it almost impossible or very difficult at least for his re-election, which is unfair.  We suggested the same mechanism as that used in the D&aacute;il at present.  In the short term at least, the Cathaoirleach should be automatically returned as one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 appointments.</P>
        <P>I refer to the case of the Leader of the House as well &mdash; the position not the person &mdash; and the proposal in the 2004 report of my predecessor and the work of the associated committee.  They worked so hard and proposed in the 2004 report that the Leader of the House should have a right of audience at Cabinet to keep the Seanad centre stage, given its importance, and to have it properly briefed every week.  There are many good ideas to enhance the role of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>My background was in the world of marketing before I came to the Seanad.  The greatest problem is to let the good people of Ireland, our constituents, know what is taking place in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This is why we are working so hard and striving to have at least one hour of the Order of Business live on television, say on a Thursday morning.  It is my wish and hope that by Easter all the difficulties and problems will be out of the way such that this could take place.</P>
        <P>This House did not get its name as the Upper House from a one-liner in a newspaper, magazine or television show.  It earned the right because of the level of debate.  Colleagues on all sides of the House and our predecessors can take kudos from the fact that often people who visit the Houses remark to me that the level of debate in the Seanad is extraordinarily high and I thank them for their comments.  If the people could see the House live on television they could make up their minds without reference to anyone&rsquo;s point of view.  I have no wish to repeat what other colleagues have said but I welcome the proposal of the Senators who have tabled this matter for debate this evening and I look forward to the Minister reverting to the House with real, meaningful proposals.  We fully support the awarding of votes to all graduates on the university panels and I recognise our university colleagues are fully supportive of this as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Ross.  I have listened to every Member who has spoken in this debate and I have found it very interesting.  In two weeks&rsquo; time I will begin my 18th year in the Seanad.  I appreciate the opportunity to have become involved and many Members share that view.  I have been impressed with the level of debate in the Seanad during those 18 years and with what has been done.  I agree entirely with those who maintain we are not recognised.  However, if we are not recognised, it is our own fault and we can do something about it ourselves.  There have been regular debates on reform of the Seanad during that time and this is just another such debate.</P>
        <P>The Seanad does not need more power.  If we need more power, we should earn it ourselves, and there are examples of where we have earned it.  I am not in favour of a more confrontational Seanad.  I believe we have learned over the years how to benefit from debates, but we must work together to do so.  If we are to achieve more recognition, we must do something about the elections.  I am concerned that the only electoral changes likely to take place will involve the university seats.  I agree fully that university graduates not currently represented <Col N="63"/>should be represented.  However, I would be greatly disappointed if we went to the trouble of making changes in the House but that the only basic changes related to the university seats.  That would not be useful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The concept of vocational panels established in the 1937 Constitution was very worthy and worthwhile, and this is well recognised.  We sought to have those vocational interests recognised but then all 43 votes were transferred to county councillors and it ended up that the 43 votes became party political.  Once that happens, a confrontational issue arises.  University votes in general have seldom elected party political Members and that has meant better opportunities.  We should avoid politicians being elected from those 43 votes.  I do not disagree with having the Taoiseach nominate a certain number of people.  It almost allows the Government the guarantee of a majority, although not necessarily.  The five Independent Members between 1994 and 1997 had the pleasure of holding the balance of power and one could see the benefits.</P>
        <P>Earlier today, Senator O&rsquo;Toole made the point that one worthy objective in the past was to hold D&aacute;il and Seanad elections on the same day.  I do not disagree with young, upcoming politicians envisaging election to this House as the first step on their road to the other House.  I have no objection to that and I am perfectly pleased to see it.  However, I am not quite so pleased to see someone who has lost their seat in the other House return here and stay until he or she gets a chance to go back there, because the heart is not in the right place.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a proposal I had not heard before but I believe it is worthwhile and worthy of consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fact that the issue is being raised again through Private Members&rsquo; time shows how little we are moving forward on the issue of Seanad reform.  I have shared my views on the subject many times before and wish to explore a different angle this time.  There is a similar debate on reform of Canada&rsquo;s Senate.  It is not an elected body.  There has been of the order of more than 30 proposals for its reform since the 1970s and in Canada, as in Ireland, there is even talk of its abolition.  Thus, we are not the only ones.  There is a significant concern in Canada of the amount of trouble in which they could end up if they proceeded with abolition and that it could cause untold problems.  This is due to the way in which the Senate is formed based on the constitution.  I read a remark to the effect that opening up the Canadian constitution would &ldquo;tear the country apart&rdquo;.  We could face similar problems in this country and that is simply one aspect of the debate.</P>
        <P>The Seanad has a good deal of what political scientists term &ldquo;output legitimacy&rdquo;, which means it does relevant and effective work and has done so throughout the years.  However, it lacks input legitimacy because the way in which Senators are elected to the House is lacking in credibility.  I refer to the vocational panels designed to produce a variety of experience and expertise.  They have been rendered much less representative largely because of the politics I talked about which confines the electoral college to those who themselves were elected.  We must move forward with legislation and extend the power to elect those from the vocational panels in a different manner.  I believe we can do something about this.</P>
        <P>I have touched only on election to the Seanad.  A number of Senators, including the Leader, spoke about changes we can make to the work we do in the House.  That is the second big challenge.  Let us ensure we take it on and make this a more worthy, representative and recognised panel.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Quinn for sharing time and congratulate Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole on tabling the motion.  It appears the only place there is any real enthusiasm for change is on these benches.  I should remind Members that I was first elected to this House in 1981.  The first thing I did when elected was table a motion seeking Seanad reform.  People <Col N="64"/>shook their heads at me and said, &ldquo;You are pissing in the wind.  This is not going to happen.  Seanad reform does not happen.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely they did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is exactly what they said and they were right.  In the past two sessions I was very privileged to sit in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s Chair before he did, and on both occasions I made a plea for some kind of Seanad reform which fell on deaf ears.  A series of committees were set up since, the purpose of which is not to advance Seanad reform but to delay such reform.  The committees were put in place as a kind of cosmetic camouflage in order t hat that people might think something is going on.  They are well calculated to be referred to another committee, and when that committee reports it is time for another general election.  It is very cleverly done.  It does not deceive anybody but means the game is pretty well played out over a five-year period.</P>
        <P>The signs from the speeches today indicate there is not a huge amount of enthusiasm for Seanad reform.  My fear is that the good intentions of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, for Seanad reform will be drowned by the Machiavellian machinations of Fianna F&aacute;il by the time the proposals he spoke of reach the Cabinet.  He said he would present a paper to his Cabinet colleagues shortly.  Presumably this will be very low on the Cabinet agenda, will not rise very far on that agenda and will certainly take us to the next general election.</P>
        <P>There may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the Senator&rsquo;s ideas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There may be a compromise, namely, that all will agree the one thing that really must be changed will be the university seats and consequently we will become the target for all the political parties.  I do not apologise for believing &mdash; as I think everybody on these benches believes &mdash; that the university seats need to be reformed.  It is grossly unfair that some graduates of universities have votes while others do not.  That is absolutely indefensible and we agree that a change to that system should be made, and made quickly.  However, we do not feel it should be done on its own.  It should be done because it is right and should be done in any case but there are worse aspects of this House than the faults in our seats.  Senator Norris put it very well when he pointed out, as he has done time after time, that we are elected by more than 50,000 people and the NUI Senators are elected by more than 100,000 people.  That is a pretty large number of people and is a big mandate to win even if it is, as people accuse it of being, an elitist or specialised mandate.  Of course, it is.</P>
        <P>However, concerning those other people who are elected in this House, if we need to be reformed &mdash; which we do &mdash; they need to be reformed in a much more crucial way.  There are 43 Senators elected by the panel system which is a bit of a farce in the first place because it does not really elect people for vocational reasons.  It elects people who can look after county councillors very well and that is the end product.  The point about that aspect of the Seanad is that insiders elect insiders.  Those 43 people are elected&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope I may speak without interruption from the Leader.  Those people are elected by the outgoing D&aacute;il and Seanad and the county councils.  This guarantees that the favourite sons and daughters of the people in power in those parties are elected.  It is even more of an inside job than Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party electing their own <Col N="65"/>people.  It means the leadership gets its own people elected by nods, winks and pressure.  That needs reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us abolish the idea of the Royal Irish Academy somehow having a nominee to this House.  It simply does not happen, nor does it with the IFA or, God forbid, IBEC or ICTU.  Those bodies never get anyone elected, thank God, but nor does it happen that people with that sort of vocation succeed in getting anyone elected.  The people who are elected eventually are the representatives of political parties.  We need reform but they need reform just as badly; therefore, let us have the package altogether.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Mullen, if that is agreed.  I am very proud to be a Member of the Seanad.  The general public tell me all the time that the level of debate in the Seanad is much better than that in the other House.  There are many eminent Members in this Chamber.</P>
        <P>Regarding reform, Senators Norris and Ross stated that insiders elect insiders.  My first time to run for the Seanad was at the last election and it is not an easy job to get elected.  I would not like to have to go through it again.  It is a democratic system.</P>
        <P>In the last session the Seanad dealt with 1,200 amendments.  The work is there and Senators perform it well.  We sat on 100 days which is more than the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>There is one reform I would like to see.  Since I came to the House I have seen Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees deserting the ship and going over to another party.  There should be some regulation concerning that.  The sitting Taoiseach nominated a person who then moved to another party.</P>

	<P>It is disloyal.  Loyalty comes into the equation.  That is something I would like to see dealt with.</P>
        <P>As an example, the Senate in the French Parliament operates in the same way as this one.  I read about this only the other night.  It performs an important role as does the Seanad.  We scrutinise legislation and ensure this is done to such a degree that no mistakes are made.  From that point of view the Seanad is worthwhile.</P>
        <P>The only point I would make is that the Seanad does not receive sufficient coverage from the national broadcaster.  It is time we sought to promote ourselves and the House in a way that the people can discover what we are about.  For example, the Order of Business in the Seanad should be broadcast live.  I would like to see that happening.  The Leader has made efforts in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ross made a point about the university panels but I do not believe everybody is zoning in on that aspect.  We have respect for each other.  I see nothing wrong with that system although others might disagree with me.  To be honest, I would leave well enough alone.  We should not have reform merely for the sake of it, to ensure we look good in the public eye and <Col N="66"/>that we are doing something.  There is no point in fixing something if it is not broken.  I shall leave it at that.</P>

	<P>Correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason it has resonated with the people is that the people cannot have confidence in a Chamber whose Members they have no part in electing.  There is a credibility problem with the Seanad; it does not fit in with the spirit of the times owing to its electoral system.</P>
        <P>I accept what Senator Brady said.  It is true France has a system of <i>les grands &eacute;lecteurs</i> who are representatives of the <i>conseils r&eacute;gionalaux</i> and others who elect Senators.  However, that does not make it right.  I strongly support what has been said by other speakers and what is contained in the 2004 report, that there should be direct election.  I believe the report proposed that 32 Senators be directly elected by the people.</P>
        <P>Much of the other criticism that applies to the Seanad also applies to the D&aacute;il.  We have a weak parliamentary system.  There is huge need for reform in order that legislators actually get to be legislators.  Examples were given of occasions when legislators in this House managed to point out something which the Government took on board, but we could do a great deal better than this.  Yesterday there was a dramatic development in American politics with the loss of the Democrat seat in Massachusetts to the Republican Party candidate.  When Ted Kennedy died, everybody remarked that he was a great legislator.  The reason he was able to be a great legislator was that Congress in the American system had power; the President of the United States must horse trade with the elected representatives in the Senate and the House of Representatives.  That can lead to problems; it will certainly pose problems for the health reforms President Obama is trying to get through Congress.  However, at least it makes legislators what they should be, people who can take an active and sustained interest in legislation and policy.  They are motivated to do so because they know they can have an impact and legislate for the good of their country.  In Ireland we need to get to that position, sooner or later.  That is not just a matter for Senators, it is also a matter for Deputies.  Everybody knows there are some tremendously talented Deputies and Senators who give very little of their intellectual space to legislation and policy because they must first mind their constituencies.  We need reform and a more thorough debate about all these matters, not just superficial change or sniping at the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I very much regret that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, appears to be pulling back from a commitment he gave earlier.  On the last occasion this issue was debated at the behest of Senator O&rsquo;Toole, the Minister gave a commitment that a wider pool of graduates &mdash; I believe that is the phrase he used &mdash; would take part <Col N="67"/>in the election of the six university Senators.  Today he has said the university Senators do not want the university seats to be reformed in isolation.  I dissent from this.  We should not wait another day before carrying out what was mandated in the 1979 referendum.  On my first day in the Seanad I told Members I did not want to have the embarrassment at the next election of meeting graduates whose degrees were as good as mine but who could not take part in the election of Senators because of an out-of-date system.  That is the easiest part of reform to carry through.</P>
        <P>There should be a single six-seat constituency in order that all university or college graduates would be on an equal footing in terms of the measure of representation available to them in the Seanad.  It is no argument to contend that it would be an impossibly large constituency of voters.  I believe the Minister quoted the figure of 500,000 voters.  That is the same size as a European Parliament constituency.  It can and needs to be done.  Just because it is not the only reform needed does not mean we should not proceed with it.  That said, if we should move to a system of direct election of Senators by citizens, we could also move to a system under which the entire process could be carried out on election day and not by postal vote.  That would also deal with the problem to which the Minister referred.</P>
        <P>I commend the work done by graduates of other colleges during the years, particularly by the organisation Graduate Equality, to achieve some movement on this issue.  The announcement by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, of the proposed abolition of the NUI, a matter we will have to debate separately, could create complications for reforming the election of university Senators, but that reform must happen and not be delayed.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Gormley, finds support for it in the Cabinet and takes the initiative sooner rather than later.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank my colleagues for taking part in the debate.  There was a very high level of debate, with a number of stimulating opinions expressed.  Members of the House need more support.  An example is access to drafting skills.  We do not have such skills and it is difficult to draft legislation.  All Members have excellent secretaries.  My secretary is absolutely superb, but she is over-worked.  She works desperately hard.  We are cutting back on overtime, but she will still do the work, although she will not get paid for it.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly spoke about the difficulty of getting onto policing committees.  I am a member of the north inner city committee.  It is voluntary, unpaid work.  People are not rejected because they are Senators; therefore, I do not accept that argument.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in has said the panels are outdated.  I agree.  They must be reviewed.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn has mentioned the amendment about age that was cleverly put forward by Senator Quinn and accepted.  That was in the context of an earlier one, the sexual orientation clause that I pioneered in this House.  It is a double whammy for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>I was a Member of the House when the Cathaoirleach, Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Leader of the House were all rejected in the D&aacute;il elections.  How is that for democracy?  We do not help with our performance in the House.  First, we refuse to play to our strengths.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is universally acknowledged that the most regularly interesting element of our day&rsquo;s work is the Order of Business, yet we continue to confine and cramp it and play it down.  I have continuously attempted to expand it and to build on our strengths, with some small success.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, was surprised that I read out my contribution.  I seldom do so.  I did it once previously in an important debate on the demolition of the Combat Poverty Agency; I believe <Col N="68"/>the Minister took part in that debate.  I issued a script, but it did not appear anywhere.  Why was that?  The reason is that it was late and the media could not be bothered.  There is laziness on their part.</P>
        <P>The Cathaoirleach is placed in an invidious situation.  To keep order he must rely on irrelevant and irritating tintinnabulations with a biro on his cow bell.  The Order of Business is routinely chaotic.  We never know properly in advance when, on what day or at what time we will meet.  A classic example is today.  We were informed the Seanad would sit yesterday.  Suddenly, with no explanation, this changed.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and I had to abandon a press conference on the matter and hare across town to be on time for my debate.  This does not inspire confidence, nor does the fact that at certain times of crisis the D&aacute;il met while the Seanad continued in recess.  Moreover, the public, rightly or wrongly, has the perception that the Seanad interrupts its operation to facilitate Members who wish to take part in golf competitions or attend race meetings at Cheltenham.</P>
        <P>The classic Ding Dong Denny O&rsquo;Reilly Wednesday night tit-for-tat charade also does little to help.  Routinely during Private Members&rsquo; debates the Government states white, the Opposition states black, a ritual vote is called, the Government inevitably wins and political honour is satisfied.  However, is the public satisfied?  Thank God, we did not do that tonight.</P>
        <P>Rulings by the Chair are incontestable; at the same time they can be inconsistent and absurd.  In a previous Seanad under a different Cathaoirleach I argued that a national ESB strike qualified as a matter of national importance.  An hour later the Cathaoirleach of the day read out his judgment, that it was not a matter of national urgency.  This happened at precisely the moment the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, was telling the D&aacute;il that it was.  Are we not entitled to some explanation of how these decisions are made?  About six months ago there was a ruling by the Chair which appeared to be illogical and indefensible but which I had to accept on the day.  However, I sought to have the matter raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and understand it was.  I never received an answer to my letter or any explanation of the inconsistencies in the decision.  This does not foster respect for the proceedings of the House.</P>
        <P>Regardless of whether it is our fault, we have become the butt of the humour of commentators.  I regret that some of the Leader&rsquo;s comments have contributed to this such as the statement in the middle of the economic crisis that the spirit of the nation would be uplifted by <Col N="69"/>country music or that we could solve the mathematical deficiencies of our students by awarding them extra unjustified marks in their examinations.  Such infelicities are guaranteed to be pounced upon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is galling to listen every day to the ill-informed comments of media personalities about the proceedings of the House and the workload and remuneration of Members.  Over the Christmas period I found myself working 14 to 16 hour days, rarely leaving this building until after 10 p.m.  I am sure many other colleagues were in the same situation, yet all that is assessed by some broadcasters is the time spent in the Chamber, which is like assessing the work rate of a broadcaster simply on the amount of broadcast hours and refusing to include all the ancillary items such as research, preparation etc.  I shall scream if I ever again hear the tired old canard about how few people there were in the Chamber while a Minister was speaking.  I would have thought broadcasters would be aware of the existence of radio and television monitors in people&rsquo;s offices.  The taxpayer would be cheated were the Chamber full to the brim on a full working day with nothing else being done except easing our senatorial bums and catching flies with half open mouths, as one regularly used to see in the broadcasts of the House of Lords.  The nasty thing is these broadcasters know the facts perfectly well but it is popular and palatable to traduce politicians in a cheap but effective manner.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Communications Regulation" RHead="Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed)"> 
    <Title>Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources back to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the suspension of the House, I was referring to a particular difficulty regarding some premium rate calls.  Psychic lines have posed considerable problems, as they prey on vulnerable people, those who need reassurance and security and are experiencing personal difficulties, and put them at great risk.  Horoscope and chat-up lines and those relating to competitions also give rise to major issues.</P><Col N="70"/>
        <P>I had a conversation with another Member a few moments ago with regard to &ldquo;Play TV&rdquo;, a programme broadcast on one of the privately owned television channels.  That programme is not particularly popular in my area but I am aware of anecdotal evidence to the effect that people are held on telephone lines for long periods, that they make repeated telephone calls and that they waste considerable sums of money.  The difficulty with all of these lines is that individuals are charged rates of which they are unaware and that the calls go on for far too long.  As stated earlier, there is also a problem with regard to the various texts sent to young people in respect of prizes they have won etc.  These individuals are continually receiving unwanted and unsolicited texts and other messages.</P>
        <P>While a facility is provided by means of which people can cease to receive material such as that to which I refer, this facility does not always work.  In addition, unsubscribing from various services or whatever can prove to be a major difficulty.  Better mechanisms should be provided in order that people might discontinue their interest in these lines or services.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames made the point to me that if a person is obliged to hold on the line for three minutes or more, the onus should be placed on the relevant company to pay for the call or to call that person back.  In other words, after three minutes there should be no question of the call continuing or of the individual in question incurring further expense.</P>
        <P>As a result of the issues that arise in respect of this matter, I am in favour of increased regulation.  It is correct that we should incorporate the work done by Regtel in this area within the legislation.  To be fair, Regtel did a great deal in respect of some operators, such as those offering psychic lines, etc., in the role it played with regard to self-regulation.  Regtel did good work over the years and made efforts to thwart the worst excesses of the premium rate companies, such as Realm Communications.  Regtel is to be congratulated on that work but it is a progressive step, especially in the context of the rationalisation we believe to be necessary, to bring its functions under the auspices of ComReg and place regulation in this area outside the industry and on an independent statutory footing.  I am in favour of this in principle because it is the correct route to take.  Self-regulation cannot continue and there is a need to rationalise the position.  I welcome the extra powers that will be bestowed upon ComReg in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>The cost of premium rate calls is also an issue.  This must be tackled in tandem with those relating to difficulties experienced by those seeking to unsubscribe from lines or services, the sending of unsolicited material to teenagers, the elderly and the vulnerable.</P>
        <P>Last year, the provision of services on fixed lines was worth &euro;95 million.  That level of revenue is considerable and, as stated earlier, the industry has the potential to grow.  It is important that we should not regulate it out of existence but it must be controlled.  We do not want to export the business elsewhere but we also do not want the vulnerable to be exploited.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a code of practice by ComReg will be important.  That code of practice, which will be drawn up following a process of consultation, will have to be strict, must restore confidence among consumers and interest groups and will have to be precise to eliminate the difficulties to which I refer.  The need for a code of practice is underlined by the fact that Regtel received 6,000 complaints last year.  This compares with a figure of 1,700 for the previous year.  Anyone who suggests there is no need for regulation or a code of practice is obviously extremely naive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I referred to the increase in the number of texts and other premium rate products relating to the services of psychics, music products, etc.  These services are not always properly advertised.  Last year, 22,000 people contacted Regtel and informed it of the difficulties they experienced in the context of unsubscribing from services, etc.</P><Col N="71"/>
        <P Just="Left">Reference was made, both in the Lower House and at the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, to cyber bullying.  While I accept this matter is not germane to the debate on the Bill, everything possible must be done to eliminate bullying by text message or telephone.  Unfortunately and tragically, this is a modern phenomenon.  I had the privilege to serve on the board of management of a community school for five or six years.  As a result of overseeing disciplinary procedures at the school, one came across tragic instances of bullying by means of telephone or text message.  It is important this matter is dealt with.</P>
        <P>The system of fines that will be put in place will be important.  I agree it is appropriate that a fine of &euro;250,000 should apply at corporate level.</P>
        <P>I understand this industry could give rise to earnings within the country of approximately &euro;500 million per year.  That is an amount at which one would not scoff.  However, we must ensure we get our priorities right in respect of policing and control.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will consider the legislation prior to Committee Stage to see whether it might be possible to offer suggestions or amendments which might improve it.  However, we will not oppose it on Second Stage because we agree with it in principle and with its objectives.  Anything that stops teenagers being gulled into engaging in excessive expenditure is welcome.  I was informed by a colleague that they had topped up their child&rsquo;s phone with &euro;25 but that this had evaporated in no time as a result of premium rate charges.  Such behaviour is unacceptable and we must police and put a stop to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  The Minister explained the legislation both adequately and at great length.</P>
        <P>Section 22 relates to instances where operators cease business, which was a major difficulty in the past but which will now be catered for.  I worked in this area when premium calls were first introduced and I am aware that with regard to disputed accounts, 80% of the problems that arose related to such calls.  Disputes might arise where a babysitter might have called a premium line without the permission of the owner of the house where they were babysitting.  When we consulted the printout, it was nearly always the case that a large telephone bill related to a premium call.  It is possible for people to prevent the making of outgoing calls to premium lines on their telephones and this should be made clear to them.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to certain game shows on television and mentioned TV3 in particular.  I recall listening to an edition of Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme on which someone admitted to spending &euro;500 on calls to one of these shows in a couple of weeks.  I do not know why but at 2 a.m. one morning I decided to spend some time watching the programme on TV3 to which Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred.  I will try to provide Members with some idea of what happens on these shows.  They give out the name of a well known fishing village in Wexford and leave three letters blank in the middle.  Anyone could work it out by looking up a map or an index &mdash; it would be no problem.  I rang the number myself four times to see what would happen.  I got the message that I did not get through to the studio that time, encouraging me to try again and wishing me better luck the next time.  This kept going on and on.  People do not get through.  I watched it for a full hour and nobody got through during that hour.  That is extortion and should be tackled.  The advertising is slick and people do not realise it until they start and they can get addicted to it very easily because it seems so simple.  They believe they will win &pound;500 in a few minutes if they keep ringing.  It then keeps going up and nobody gets through.  That is nothing short of extortion.</P>
        <P>The other problem is with people leaving telephones unattended in their houses.  When I worked in Telecom &Eacute;ireann the reason for the majority of disputed accounts related to premium rate calls made by babysitters and so on.  People did not realise the exorbitant cost <Col N="72"/>involved when they made these calls.  The cost of &euro;1.50 per minute, or whatever, appears in very small print at the bottom of the screen.  People do not realise the true cost until they get the bill.  I hope we can rectify that matter.</P>
        <P>The other provisions of the Bill are to be welcomed and I have no problem with it.  I thank the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  The Bill is welcome.  I am confident that when enacted, it will provide an effective and robust regulatory regime that will ensure the protection of users of premium rate services and restore confidence in the regulation of the sector.  Coming from a business background I have a slight problem with the <i>caveat emptor</i> need.  We cannot protect everybody from everything and there is a danger that we tend to do that in various ways.  I know of some of the challenges facing the Minister and on that basis I support what he is doing.  It is not just young people; other susceptible people have been abused in this regard.  I know of one competition in which there were four or five very big prizes worth large sums of money.  As all the other small prizes, which included a week&rsquo;s holiday in Florida, were guaranteed, winners were guaranteed one of those prizes.  It also guaranteed that calls would be answered within ten minutes.  However, calls took varying lengths of time.  While everyone got a prize, what use is a week&rsquo;s holiday in Florida if it is just the use of a bed in a hotel in Florida and the person must pay to fly there?  Clearly people lost a considerable amount of money on it.  I know the young man who established that legitimately and made a large sum of money from it.  It was quite legitimate.  I do not know how the Minister will solve this issue and do not know the Bill in sufficient detail, but I am sure the regulator will have some ability to do so.</P>
        <P>I welcome any Bill which brings in more safeguards to protect the customer.  The issue of using mobile phones for marketing and advertising is perhaps more complex than we thought and certainly than I thought.  In the Middle East for example, unsolicited text messages are very common and do not prompt many complaints.  People in the Middle East are apparently quite used to them and do not have any problem with them.  However, Europeans are less enamoured with such intrusion and it is interesting to note that in some parts of Scandinavia it is usual to send someone a text message asking permission to call that person.  I had not realised that.</P>
        <P>Without repeating what others have said about the Bill, I would like to get the Minister&rsquo;s view on some of issues that are relevant and will become increasingly relevant for mobile phone advertising in the future owing to rapidly developing technology.  Mobile phones, some which have satellite-positioning technology, could be used in the future to alert people through text messages or visual advertisements to a certain shop or restaurant as they are walking or driving past.  People using the Internet to search for a generic term could be targeted on their mobile phones.  For example someone keying &ldquo;Indian food&rdquo; into Google, could then receive advertisements from nearby Indian restaurants.  Of course, it is an innovative way of advertising, but I am still unsure of such direct tactics.  I would be interested to get the Minister&rsquo;s view.  This comes back to the point about <i>caveat emptor</i> because that seems like a very clever form of advertising.  Clearly if it is intrusive, we must be able to ensure that people can disconnect.  I read in the Bill that there are ways to do so but I am not sure I understand them.  I am not sure the Bill provides for this progression of technology and perhaps we should try to anticipate some of the changes in this field given that the technology changes so much.</P>
        <P>Why do schools close in the snow?  On a related note, I think mobile phone technology has great relevance regarding the recent closing of schools across the country due to snowfall.  I am sure the Minister is too young to remember it, but approximately 30 years ago when there was <Col N="73"/>a very heavy fall of snow, a particular Minister, who is no longer with us, became known as the Minister for snow because he announced we would close all schools for a week.  However, that was because there was an enormous fall of snow in Dublin but there was no snow in Cork, Limerick or anywhere else.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It appears to many of us from the older generation that schools close much more often than they used to.  Advanced communications make it easier for schools to close; they can send a text message and inform students they will be closed.  Even more to the point they can inform students that they will be open, which is probably more important rather than having to close schools in a large area.  This, of course, could not happen in the past.  Closing a school back then would have caused considerable chaos and confusion with students and teachers turning up to the school, then having to find their way home again.  The point is that perhaps if schools had the technology we have now, they could have stayed open and have notified people that they were open.  I am not sure how we can do it effectively, but I think it is worth looking at how technology, including mobile phones, is used responsibly especially when it comes to school closures.</P>
        <P>The effort the Minister is making is well worthwhile.  I assume the regulator will be able to handle the details of these matters.  Technology is changing all the time and is moving very fast.  I hope the Bill takes into account the changes that will take place in technology in the years ahead.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill and urge him to ensure we enact it as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to participate in the debate on the timely Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Bill 2009.  Senator Quinn mentioned some of the changes in the field.  It is important for legislation to keep pace with the changes that are happening.  The premium rate industry is one of growing importance.  In the UK it is estimated to be worth in the region of &pound;1 billion per annum.  It incorporates a diverse and growing number of services.  I came across a simple definition of premium rate services as &ldquo;content data and value-added services where payment is subsequently charged to an individual&rsquo;s or household&rsquo;s telephone account&rdquo;.  The growing range of services includes ones of which we are aware: fixed-line telecoms services, live chat lines, information services such as weather forecasting, traffic news, stock exchange reports and sports results.  In addition television vote lines are becoming more popular.  There are mobile services such as ringtones, media content and payment through reverse-billed SMS.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill is timely because there is an increasing convergence between telecoms and broadcasting resulting in significant innovation in these premium rate services.  There are subscription media services on mobile phones, interactive gaming on television and even entire television channels based on premium rate calling.  There are also significant business applications for premium rate services.  In Ireland we are all familiar with unique prefixes relating to the premium rate services: 1530, 1540, 1550, 1559, 1560, 1570 and 1580.  The 1559 prefix is dedicated solely to adult services and can only be accessed with a PIN issued by a network operator.  Calls to premium rate services cost more than ordinary telephone calls and each prefix has a specific call cost.  The role of regulation is important.  Others have referred to this.  One of its important purposes is to prevent consumer harm, in particular to ensure clear and accurate pricing information is provided with honest advertising and service content.  This Bill will accomplish this by ensuring the new regulatory system includes those strong consumer provisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In earlier days it was much more common for premium numbers to be used fraudulently.  Computer criminals have used premium rate numbers to defraud unsuspecting Internet users. <Col N="74"/> As we know, many more children and young people are using the Internet, which makes them vulnerable to this type of fraud.  One particular scheme involved encouraging users to download a programme known as a &ldquo;dialler&rdquo; which surreptitiously dialled a premium rate number, accumulating charges on the user&rsquo;s telephone bill without his or her knowledge.  Another premium rate scam involved television programming that encouraged young children to dial a number, relying on the assumption that they would be unaware of the charges to be incurred.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, premium rate telephone services have been regulated by Regtel, an independent non-profit company formed in 1995.  It operates through a strict code of practice with which all service providers in Ireland must comply.  Regtel has been required to assure consumer protection when using national or international premium rate services and has put in place procedures to deal with consumer complaints that arise from the use of these services.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the transfer of the function of the regulation of premium rate services from Regtel to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  It also provides for certain other amendments to the overall communications framework.  The transfer of the regulatory function to ComReg will ensure an effective regime that addresses the present market environment is established and this is in accordance with Government policy on agency rationalisation.  The legislation enables ComReg to license the premium rate services by specifying the classes or types of premium rate services that require to be licensed, the terms and conditions that may be attached, and the information that premium rate service providers must provide to ComReg upon request.  Significantly, it also deals with the issue of offences and penalties.  The Bill provides the necessary investigative powers to ComReg to ensure the conditions of a licence are being complied with.  ComReg will be empowered to revoke, amend or suspend a PRS licence with immediate effect, if necessary, where it finds that the holder has failed to comply with a licence condition.  It also provides for summary and indictable offences relating to the provision of unlicensed premium rate services and summary offences for overcharging for services or charging for services not supplied.  A service provider aggrieved by a decision of ComReg to refuse to grant or revoke, amend or suspend a PRS licence will have the right of appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
        <P>Significantly, too, the Bill provides that ComReg will, in consultation with the industry and other interested parties, prepare and publish a code of practice to be followed by premium rate service providers.  Compliance with the code of practice will be a condition of the licence.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned that the legislation makes some other changes to the communications infrastructure.  Having been a member of a local authority, I particularly appreciate the fact that this Bill amends Part 5 of the principal Act of 2002 to facilitate the National Roads Authority in making ducting infrastructure on national roads and motorways available for fibre roll-out.  This will facilitate the roll-out of fibre throughout the country to provide broadband connectivity, one of the priorities the Minister has emphasised his Department will pursue.  This legislation will facilitate us in developing the communications infrastructure which will help achieve that objective.  Under the principal Act, local authorities were the sole consent-giving authority for local, regional and national roads as well as motorways.  This amendment in the legislation before the House designates the National Roads Authority as an authority for national roads, which includes motorways.  This will enable the National Roads Authority to make available to network operators access to the ducting on national roads and motorways to facilitate the roll-out of high-speed fibre networks in the regions.</P>
        <P>For all these reasons I commend the legislation and I commend the Minister on its introduction.  I happily support the Bill.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the support of Senators on Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
        <P>I shall deal with a couple of points.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said something that bears repeating about the good work the existing agency, Regtel, has been doing.  We acknowledge this, while recognising the lack of statutory powers which hindered Regtel from doing the work necessary, especially in an evolving area, thus requiring us to make the changes that have to be made.  However, it is important to recognise the work that has been done by the existing agency while acknowledging the limitations in its statutory remit which have required us to change the circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also thank Senator Brady for his reporting of his experiences in front of his television set at 2 a.m., giving us good examples of some of the scams that can take place.  Senator Quinn is right about <i>caveat emptor</i>, but there are occasions when, say, at 2 a.m., it is difficult to be absolutely awake and razor sharp and people can be taken in by inappropriate marketing practices.  It is appropriate that we are now legislating to change such practices.</P>
        <P>Given Senator Quinn&rsquo;s record of attention to customer service, I take on board with extra attention what he has said.  The question he asks about how mobile services are developing is interesting.  In the first example he mentioned the prospect of a person walking down a street and, through Bluetooth technology in all likelihood, getting access to information about the restaurants or shops in the street.  Somebody told me the other day that an application available from iTunes does precisely that.  It can tell one not just that there is a restaurant in the neighbourhood but that there is a table free and one might get a 10% discount if one says one has used the mobile advertising network to access information and using words to the effect that the steak is particularly good tonight or whatever.  That level of detail is now available on mobile phones.  They are becoming the access network to&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the customer looks for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Senator is right.  The question then is whether the customer is not looking for it, because unwarranted advertising is a very serious issue.  It is slightly different from the premium rates services issue.  In that sense it is a contract that is entered into, either wittingly or unwittingly, whereas the issue of unwarranted communications is primarily a matter for the Data Protection Commission.  We need to have co-ordination in that regard to ensure this is not unwarranted.  It may be the most useful service in terms of the application of a telephone, but if one is not looking for such a service, it could be a frightful nuisance.  The second example given by the Senator in terms of target advertising is a matter primarily for a data protection officer, while recognising the reality that mobile phones increasingly are becoming our computers and main access point to the Internet.  The volume of data we draw down in terms of video streaming, etc. will all happen on mobile phones.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For that very reason there have to be consumer protections in place to allow people the confidence to know their mobile phone dealings are legitimate and not scams.  Therefore, strong regulation is good for the mobile phone industry.  Hammering the bad operators is good for the development of this technology, which is something we should encourage.  I believe it is positive, very efficient and can be socially beneficial.  We have benefited from texting, for example.  I do not know about the Senators, but when I get a text, I tend to like it.  I like the form of communication and the type of social networking it provides.  Increasingly, I use the Internet on my mobile phone and it works.  I like accessing the weather forecast on my mobile phone and watching the rain patterns which one can now get by satellite right to it.  In our country that is beneficial; therefore, we need to progress and disperse this technology, while increasingly using it for mainstream commercial and social communication.  For those reasons <Col N="76"/>we want to ensure it is run to a high commercial standard.  I agree with Senator Quinn about the ongoing evolution, subject to the appropriate data protection restrictions of this technology, in order that we know that everyone in the school can be texted.  In that way, a parent or guardian will not be fumbling around in their child&rsquo;s schoolbag and giving out to them the next morning because they forgot a school note.  It is much easier to do it by text, as long as people are open to such communications.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator de B&uacute;rca for going over the key details of the Bill, including support for the telecommunications infrastructure being provided by the National Roads Authority.  When I visit local authorities and speak to county managers, the crucial thing they ask about is fibre.  They want infrastructure, including roads, transport and water, but increasingly they realise that a lack of fibre will restrict economic development.  We need to install further fibre in my area of south D&uacute;n Laoghaire and run it from there to County Wicklow where I am sure Senator de B&uacute;rca will be pleased to receive it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senators who contributed on Second Stage.  I look forward to taking the Bill through its remaining stages and enacting it for the betterment of citizens.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, for attending the House to take this matter.  I sought this debate to register the anger of Tipperary people at a plan that was announced last week to close the county&rsquo;s only acute mental health facility.  I am talking about the entire county, comprising both the North and South Ridings.  It is the only county in Ireland which is so divided.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are countless reasons this plan is neither feasible nor reasonable.  In the limited time available I will outline some of them to the House.  I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to the conduct of HSE South officials in this matter, who I believe are acting outside their powers in formulating this plan.  Last week, lead clinicians at St. Michael&rsquo;s were stunned when they were told at a regular meeting of HSE officials that the 49-bed unit would be shut by the end of the year.  A media release to this effect was later issued by HSE South confirming that acute services were to move to Kilkenny.  This decision is completely at odds with practice and procedure in reconfiguring health services.  It is not in keeping with the recommendations of the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s report on services in south Tipperary, which was published last April.  I think the Minister of State had some knowledge of it.  It is not compliant either with A Vision for Change, nor the many other HSE documents that were published concerning reconfiguring mental health services, both regionally and nationally.</P><Col N="77"/>
        <P>The aforementioned HSE South&rsquo;s media release contained a litany of bogus claims, none more so than the statement that a process of consultation had taken place with stakeholders.  That was a blatant lie, actually.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is an untruth in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Thank you.  I am glad the Senator has withdrawn it.  I will take it as having been withdrawn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Staff, management, patients and their families were unaware that a plan to close St. Michael&rsquo;s had been drawn up.  In fact, discussions on the future of acute mental health services in Tipperary could barely be described as being at a preliminary stage.  This plan is a direct contradiction of what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, told a meeting of Oireachtas Members for south Tipperary last December.  She said no decisions would be made about any aspect of our health services without notice and without consultation first taking place with Oireachtas Members, stakeholders and other interested parties both in south and north Tipperary.  That means that HSE South has broken the Minister&rsquo;s promise by formulating and announcing this plan.  It means that regional officials have decided to go over the Minister&rsquo;s head to try to press ahead with their plan without ministerial approval.</P>
        <P>The reorganisation of health services in County Tipperary looks like it is being run by a faction of HSE officials who believe they are not accountable to anyone, including Ministers.  I am demanding that these people within the HSE be made accountable for their actions.  Their motives should be unmasked.  It is obvious that those behind this plan are using it as a means to downgrade South Tipperary General Hospital also because those 49 acute beds are factored in with the general hospital&rsquo;s complement.  Taking 49 acute beds from that complement is a <i>de facto</i> downgrading.  That is because a lower number of beds would attract a different banding, which attracts different funding as the Minister of State knows.  It has implications for the reconfiguration process currently going on within HSE South concerning the four acute hospitals in the south east.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a growing suspicion that the reconfiguration of health services in south Tipperary is being driven by a group of people whose personal interests in centralising services in Kilkenny are being put ahead of patient welfare.  I am calling on the Minister of State to suspend the plan to axe St. Michael&rsquo;s.  He should call to account the promoters of this shocking disregard for the Minister, for proper procedure and, most importantly, for patient welfare.  If this does not happen it means we have in our democracy a group of self-appointed decision makers with powers that exceed those of the Minister and the Minister of State.  Did the Minister of State or the Minister know of this plan before it was announced?</P>
        <P>There was almost a complete lack of consultation with stakeholders before announcing the closure of an acute inpatient mental health service unit in County Tipperary that had operated for more than 150 years.  It was an undemocratic decision made by faceless people.  There was no chance for any of the people in the county involved at the coalface to make submissions.  There was a lack of logic in pre-empting overall configuration decisions for the south east which might include the removal of some services from Kilkenny.  I am assured St. Canice&rsquo;s is located in a very old building and so happens to be in the grounds of Lacken House, the HSE head office for the region.</P>

	<P>I ask the Senator to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="78"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concluding on this point.  The long, narrow Carlow-Kilkenny-south Tipperary mental health area is geographically unsuitable.  There is no allowance made for new motorway systems or thought put into patient convenience or preferences.  Areas in north Tipperary very close to Clonmel &ndash; for example, Thurles and Templemore &mdash; are excluded.   The road to Kilkenny is unsuitable.  The hospital in Kilkenny is also not suitable for servicing the needs of the people of south Tipperary.  The outlay to make St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital suitable to meet modern requirements would be trivial by comparison with the ultimate dangers for patients and the difficulties faced by relatives and staff.  There has been a huge outcry and people are seriously concerned.  I cannot underestimate that aspect of the matter.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister of State suspend any decision pending detailed consultation, costings and submissions from stakeholders in County Tipperary.  I spoke to the staff.  I declare an interest in that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making my final point.</P>
        <P>I have a relative who has been in front-line management in south Tipperary for many years.  Therefore, I am very well acquainted with the facts, figures and realities of working within the unit and aware of the report produced last year.  There was never any suggestion all acute services would be removed from Tipperary.  Was the Minister of State or the Minister aware of this?  Is the Minister of State willing to suspend the closure of any unit in south Tipperary until all parties have been consulted?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for what she said.  I wish I had more time to respond because she raised so many issues.  I do not intend to respond by way of the prepared script because many of the issues raised are not referred to therein.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been asked to meet a delegation including Deputy Mattie McGrath, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, Senator Prendergast and Deputy Tom Hayes and I intend to do so.  I do not want to be blunt or bad mannered in my response.  It is my intention to proceed as fast as possible to close down every mental hospital in the country.  I am committed to doing so in three years.  I have visited nearly every psychiatric hospital and have done so without media involvement.  The Senator might remember I did not notify the public representatives in the areas concerned.  I did so to build a belief we were serious about mental health service reform.</P>
        <P>One of the first hospitals I visited was St. Michael&rsquo;s in Clonmel.  I saw its condition, just as I saw the condition of so many other hospitals.  I certainly made a commitment to its staff, particularly those who attended the meeting.  I had some serious discussions with them and made a serious commitment to the effect that, if I secured funding for the capital programme, the mental health services in the hospital in Clonmel would be among the first to benefit from investment.</P>
        <P>I consider this matter in the context of A Vision for Change.  Everything proposed for south Tipperary is contained in that document; it is not new thinking.  I ask the Senator to bear with me, as I will take another opportunity, perhaps next week, to explain my points.</P>
        <P>The second issue is that there will be absolutely no attempt on behalf of the HSE or Department to close down St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital until the investment of &euro;20 million is made.  In this regard, I am going to Tipperary within a fortnight to turn the sod on the new development.  It is not sod-turning for the sake of appearing on camera but it is a sod-turning in line with all the serious commitments given by me in the past 18 months.  The recommendations were not <Col N="79"/>set down by me but by experts in the area of psychiatric care, including Senator Prendergast.  The Senator is aware of what is occurring on the ground.</P>
        <P>I hope what we are doing in Clonmel will happen throughout the country in the coming years.  We are starting off with a commitment to provide &euro;43 million for mental health services.  We have a multi-annual programme.  What is proposed for and what is happening in Tipperary was outlined four years ago in A Vision for Change.  I read the local media and do not agree with the contention that the HSE is acting independently, improperly or without the imprimatur of the Government.  It is carrying out exactly what was proposed for the reform of mental health services nationally.  This must include St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital.  Patients and their families are the people about whom we are always talking.  Before there is any attempt to close St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, the investment in the 40-bed nursing unit in Clonmel will be made.  There will be a full team of health providers, psychiatric care providers and nurses to deal with psychiatric care issues in Tipperary.</P>
        <P>I read one of the comments made at the meeting.  It is implied there was an attempt to punish the patients by sending them to Kilkenny.  This could not be further from the truth.  Every aspect and every geographical area has been dealt with in A Vision for Change.  The document was not put together by politicians but by service users, their families and experts in the field.  Every proposal made therein will be implemented.</P>
        <P>I read in the media that somebody emerged from a meeting and leaked something that was being hopped on by the HSE, but the reality is that the HSE was explaining what A Vision for Change was about.  That is exactly why I went to Tipperary some months ago.  I look forward to visiting again.</P>
        <P>Let me be more specific because I know the Senator is very concerned.  I heard her speak about this issue in the House in the past.  I do not say this to pl&aacute;m&aacute;s her.  While the HSE has announced the closure of St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, its services will, in due course, be transferred to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Kilkenny.  It must be stressed that this will not occur before a home-based treatment team is put in place and operating for 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  This is not the system that obtains.  I note from the brief that one third of referrals to St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital in Tipperary occur after hours, in other words, at a time in respect of which people have not proposed or requested a separate service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Did the Minister of State say the beds would be transferred to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Kilkenny, not St. Canice&rsquo;s?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>The general hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Senator should remember that in the general hospital in Kilkenny there are acute psychiatric services.  I have visited the unit and noted it is forward-thinking.  In Kilkenny, as in Sligo, there is a nurse operating in the area of psychiatric care.  There is a prescribing nurse in this area also, which I welcome.  All of these developments are positive.</P>
        <P>I will not do the Senator an injustice when addressing her concerns.  That is why, in spite of the fact that the matter is properly being raised today, I intend to invite her to a meeting to discuss it.  This is to assure her there is nothing surreptitious, hidden, smart or cute.  The only regret I have is that what is proposed should have been happening approximately ten years ago.  Having visited most of the hospitals, I am aware that there is a great need.  I am glad that, at long last, we have a ring-fenced budget.  We are moving as fast as we possibly can.</P><Col N="80"/>
        <P>When I was in Tipperary over 12 months ago, the commission was involved in addressing the issue concerning the facility in Clonmel.  It reported that the facility certainly could not provide the mental health service required.  I accept that the Senator is not saying for one minute that the building and structure are adequate.  She may ask why there could not be a separate facility on the campus.  I intend to take the services provided at St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital off campus.  Let us be clear that the issue involves selling land and property to ensure we can develop further services in the area.  I am aware that the service in north Tipperary is delivered from south Tipperary.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive &euro;20 million programme to develop community-based mental services has been announced.  The programme will be funded from the proceeds of the sale of lands and will be associated with the package of &euro;43 million announced in the budget.  I expect the project in respect of the 40-bed unit to be put out to tender in the coming weeks.  I made a commitment to the Clonmel and Letterkenny facilities as they were crying out for immediate investment.</P>
        <P>The programme will provide more appropriate mental health services with better access for users.  It is all based on the recovery model of mental health treatment and the transfer from old structures to modern facilities backed up by committed mental health teams.  A Vision for Change envisions a community-based mental health service with a reduced reliance on inpatient care.  The decision to provide a home-based treatment team will minimise the necessity for hospital admissions.  Over Christmas I refreshed my mind on this clear policy in A Vision for Change.  My only regret is that we should be further up the line in this reform programme than we currently are.  I intend to revisit those hospitals I visited last year to work with them on their capital programmes.</P>
        <P>Regarding the point raised about bogus claims and lead clinicians making different assessments, I accept there is some anger in Tipperary.  However, part of the reason for this anger is that people, in their minds, perceive this as a downgrading of their acute hospital services.  It has nothing to do with this.  I may not have done justice to all the issues raised by Senator Prendergast.  However, I promise I will brief her and her Oireachtas colleagues in the next two weeks to assure her that this move is in the patients&rsquo; best interest and is part of a reform programme that must be pushed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State claims this is not a downgrading.  Taking 49 beds out of the bed complement of a general hospital means it attracts a different branding grade and is in effect a downgrading.  There is a regional configuration to Kilkenny&rsquo;s advantage.  There were no discussions with the clinicians, nursing staff or stakeholders involved prior to it being announced at an ordinary meeting three days before the national announcement.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, he stated that any moneys realised by the sale of hospital lands should be red-circled for reinvestment in community mental health services.  While the moneys, however, have been realised, they have not been reinvested in community services.  A community service for south Tipperary means it is in the area.  Kilkenny is not our community.  Land is available on the campus of South Tipperary General Hospital.  Why can a new build for St. Michael&rsquo;s not be accommodated on that land?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Brendan Drumm, chief executive officer of the HSE, publicly met senior managers of south Tipperary mental health services in January 2009 and confirmed his commitment to the development of its programme as set out in its service plan for 2009 to 2010.  He also commented that the type of transformation under way in south Tipperary is being replicated across mental health services in Ireland.  To support this work, he stated the HSE had implemented a new national initiative where funding from the sale of mental health services&rsquo; lands and proper<Col N="81"/>ties would be set aside in a protected fund to support the development of community-based services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Home care treatment teams&rdquo; was a term pulled from A Vision for Change.  It cannot be selectively used for south Tipperary and applied in a positive fashion to Kilkenny.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has been indulged in this matter and has been invited to a meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I know Senator Prendergast has a background in these services and I am not trying to rubbish any of her remarks.  Retaining the level of competency of a hospital for the sake of the 49 beds in this case, however, is wrong.  I went through all of these factors during the cancer services debates in Laois.  In the case of Tipperary, an image has been created of people sitting in a room somewhere in the HSE privately deciding on the services in this hospital.  Three clinicians made the media aware of the removal of these services as if it were breaking news.  It was not; it is part of the whole reform programme for mental health services.</P>
        <P>If one takes the full logic of the argument that the moneys released from the sale of mental health hospital lands should be retained for the particular area in question, then the people of north Tipperary should not receive any of it because it has no facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>This hospital has been serving north Tipperary for 160 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Some counties have no existing mental facilities to sell off to fund their mental health programmes.  Tipperary is part of the 300,000 catchment area referred to in A Vision for Change.  The whole process has been to ensure we deliver multidisciplinary services to these areas.  We are not unravelling A Vision for Change to suit Tipperary as I am having to do the same in Portlaoise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I first took over this job 15 months ago, I made it clear I wanted a director for mental health services appointed to drive the reform programme.  My second commitment was to secure the capital funding for the reform programme from the Government.  My final commitment is to ensure a full assessment of how far A Vision for Change has been implemented on 1 March and how it will be funded for the remaining four years.  I believe whoever holds this ministerial post should do this assessment every March.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This assessment will give me an opportunity to work with people in the HSE, such as Brian Gilroy, who heads the procurement programme.  This year I intend to ensure the capital required will be available to deliver a modernised mental health service with priorities such as a new Central Mental Hospital site, child and adolescent services, acute psychiatric units and rehabilitation units.  Much work has to be done to convince Senator Prendergast that this is consistent with the non-involvement of politicians and the full involvement of service users, their families and service providers.  What the HSE is doing in this case has not been thought up in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion, but is a clear following of the mental health services reform programme.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State rushed from the D&aacute;il to take this Adjournment debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned about the National Archives which performs a vital role that is often forgotten.  Its purpose is twofold: to care for past public records, some of which are, for good reason, closed to the public and to superintend the storage of archives in public institutions and to arrange for their final transfer.  Public access is a by-product of these functions which, while secondary, is an important one for historians, genealogists, journalists and others.  I am particularly concerned that new legislation in this area, emanating from the Department of Finance, is based purely on saving money rather than on cultural issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are indications that the Department wants to introduce technical legislation aimed at amalgamating three institutions, including the National Library, the Manuscripts Commission and the National Archives.  The amalgamation of these institutions under one umbrella featured in the programme for Government 2008.  Draft legislation appears imminent.  There are issues with such legislation in terms of reorganisation and resources.  If a new structure is called into existence for the three bodies, new legislative provisions will be necessary to preserve the powers of the director of the National Archives, which are statutorily defined in the National Archives Act 1986.  The director&rsquo;s responsibilities will be totally undermined if he or she is to be answerable to a new hybrid management summoned out of thin air unless the statutory authority for the care of Government records is properly provided for.  While additional resources are not likely to be allocated now due to the downturn, future needs must be recognised and spelled out in order that the needs of these institutions are not trampled underfoot at a future date when funds become more available.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">What progress has been made on the legislation to amalgamate the National Library, the Manuscripts Commission and the National Archives?  Will this legislation preserve the full statutory powers of the director of the National Archives?  On the critical resource front, is the Minister seeking advice on the scale of the problem and the scale of needs?  What scale of staffing and accommodation is required?  Who superintends the archival records of the Departments in choosing what documents to keep?  It is normal for Departments to move their paper regularly.  How do the Departments decide what should be kept?  It should be professionally and independently decided, if possible.</P>
        <P>In an ideal world, I would like to see the National Archives have the extra professional staff it really needs, extra support staff and new accommodation to specific standards.  There would also have to be fire proof accommodation to preserve those important documents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the digitisation of archives, electronic mail and e-mail are two of the biggest archival issues on which I would like to get the Minister&rsquo;s views.  Digitisation has a real value for records, both protecting fragile paper documents with a large demand and by easy access reducing the <Col N="83"/>number of readers, notably genealogists.  However, it is expensive and can only be justified for a limited range of record categories.  <i>Phoenix</i> suggested recently that &euro;4.5 million had been already spent on the 1911 census.  Apart from the fact that the originals would have to be retained, it is not feasible on cost grounds for most record categories.</P>
        <P>A letter in <i>The Times</i> <i>Literary Supplement</i> recently noted that the Kew archives in London proposed to put a deal of money into digitisation of certain categories in high demand and to cut back on the curating of other categories.  On the future plans for digitising of archives, will budget cuts affect such digitising?  I am interested in the Minister outlining proposals on digitisation of archives for the future.</P>
        <P>E-mail poses enormous problems at several levels.  I asked a senior civil servant recently how she managed things and she replied that she put print-outs of important letters on her files, but that record keeping in general in her Department was slack.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The registries, which used to organise centrally the files of each Department, have collapsed in Belfast as well as Dublin.  It appears that in the past decade and a half, the old central registry system has broken down in the various Departments, and the public should be made aware of what, if anything, has replaced it.  In the Department of Health and Children, it was the demands posed by the Freedom of Information Act 1997 which, in the absence of any working arrangement, made necessary a system of civil servants seeking a file number electronically for papers on a new subject.  How that system or the system, if any, in other Departments works in terms of the good order of files, the preservation of the integrity of the archive as a whole and meeting the conditions of the National Archives Act 1986 is a subject on which enlightenment for the public would be welcome.</P>
        <P>The David Kelly case in London &mdash; the Hutton report &mdash; in the UK was interesting in archival terms in the sense that a coherent picture was based largely on e-mails &mdash; whether by hard copies on file or by fresh print-outs, it was not clear.  It seems that we are falling seriously behind considering the digitising of archives at Kew, the Public Records Office in Belfast or even the Irish Virtual Library and Archive Project, IRVLA, in UCD archives.  Other archives are investing a great deal in digitising archives.  We would surely save space and many man hours if records were digitised and available to the public in that way.  I want to know who is superintending the electronic archival records of the Departments in choosing what documents to keep.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If any doubt remains about the alarming situation, the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights Sub-Committee on the Barron Report which considered the Barron report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974 should remove it.  The subcommittee was &ldquo;Astonished that better care was not kept of these documents&rdquo;.  It called, in March 2004, for an investigation with statutory powers to explore the reasons for loss or destruction and to try to recover documentation.  The resulting report in March-April 2007, the so-called McEntee report, is a damning expos&eacute; of a near-total lack of archival control in several Government institutions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The National Archives is in a unique position, however as a sort of Cinderella.  This is in part because its primary function is the humdrum and silent one of looking after the welfare of the records of the State, and access by the public is secondary to that concern.  We have a very valuable asset.  It is difficult at this time to allocate the sums of money to do everything we want to do, but I emphasise that this is a real challenge.  I would like to get some answers to these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn raised many important subjects and they are far more extensive than I can possibly deal with in a reply of this kind.  Perhaps he should seek a much fuller debate.</P><Col N="84"/>
        <P>The National Archives holds the records of the modern Irish State, which document its historical evolution.  It also holds a substantial number of records pre-dating that.  With the National Library, it is the main twin repository of our documentary political, social, economic, and cultural heritage.  Our modern National Archives were established on 1 June 1988, and took over the functions previously performed by the State Paper Office and the Public Record Office of Ireland.  Under the 1986 legislation, the records of Departments, and their agencies, are transferred to the National Archives when they are 30 years old.  As someone who has been a reader in the archives, but who in the past has advised the Department of the Taoiseach on the transfer of records more than 30 years old relating to Northern Ireland, I have more than a passing interest in, and commitment to the National Archives.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has ministerial responsibility for the National Archives.  However, the Minister for Finance may, under the National Archives Act, make regulations concerning the proper management and preservation of departmental records held by Departments, and under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 make regulations providing for the management and maintenance of records by public bodies in general.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources also may, under the Harbours Act 1996, give advice or directions to harbour companies and authorities on their records and archives, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may give advice or directions to local authorities on local records and local archives, under the Local Government Act 2001.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I have responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of the National Archives headquarters.  The property is owned by the Commissioners for Public Works.</P>
        <P>This House will be aware that Government has indicated that the National Archives, the Irish Manuscripts Commission and the National Library of Ireland shall be merged into a new national library and archives of Ireland.  This merger will require the amendment of the National Archives Act 1986 and of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.  The Minister proposes to update the relevant archival legislation as part of this process.</P>
        <P>The new draft legislation is complex, deals with three separate existing bodies, abolishes these bodies, and establishes a new body.  The initial draft of this legislation has been completed and transmitted to the directors of the National Archives and National Library and to the chairman of the Irish Manuscripts Commission for their observations.  It is intended to bring this legislation before the Houses this year.  I assure the Senator that the legislative requirements of the National Archives are being attended to within the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism at present.</P>
        <P>It is acknowledged that the National Archives suffers from a long-standing storage challenge on a constrained site.  While efforts have been made to accommodate the State records within its Bishop Street premises, the accommodation currently available there is unsatisfactory.  Under present economic circumstances, the planned major capital investment to redevelop the entire Bishop Street facility for the National Archives, involving the subsequent closure of its Four Courts storage, is currently not affordable, and legislation, of itself, cannot resolve this.</P>
        <P>The difficulties in the National Archives are being approached in the main from two perspectives.  The OPW, at the instigation of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, has agreed to produce a short-to-medium term solution to the storage and accommodation needs of the archives within the existing Bishop Street building complex.  The OPW will prepare proposals, and has provided some off-site storage for certain series of records.  In addition, the OPW has indicated it will move certain Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food records, mainly relating to the Land Commission, which are still in use out of Bishop Street and thus free up <Col N="85"/>space for the National Archives proper.  The administrative staffing of the National Archives, which was admittedly relatively small, has also been strengthened by the Department in recent times.</P>
        <P>Conscious of the need to ensure it provides a good service for the public, the National Archives has increasingly engaged with new technology within its limited resources.  The digitisation of the 1911 and 1901 census returns is a good example.  The National Archives set up this project as a research partnership with its counterpart, Library and Archives Canada.  Other partners included the National Library of Ireland and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland.  The project involved digitising the census returns and background material and making them searchable by address or surname.  Library and Archives Canada, deservedly, has a worldwide reputation in the field of document digitisation.  As a fellow national archival institution, it shared the same values in the preservation of and access to documentary heritage as the National Archives.</P>
        <P>The project is being undertaken in two phases.  The 1911 returns for the 32 counties were digitised and are being followed by the 1901 returns.  The first phase was launched in December 2007 with the 1911 returns for Dublin city and county.  The user figures were very encouraging, with more than 15 million hits and 900,000 individual users on the new website.  The records for Dublin were followed in December 2008, when those for counties Antrim, Down and Kerry went live.  I launched some of these digitised records in Bishop Street on 22 December 2008.  The cumulative traffic figures for 2008 rose to in excess of 31 million hits and more than 2.2 million users.  In August 2009 the 1911 returns for the remaining counties went live.  To date, there have been almost 165 million hits and 5.5 million users on the website.  Of these, the bulk, some 57%, are Irish users, followed by UK users which account for 30%, USA users which account for 5.7%, European users which account for 2.9%, Australian users which account for 1.3%, Canadian users which account for 1% and so on.  When one considers that this usage in the United Kingdom and the United States has developed spontaneously, as there has as yet been no formal launch organised for either country, it bodes well for the future.</P>
        <P>The National Archives has invited Tourism Ireland to co-operate with it to encourage users to visit Ireland.  In addition to visits, it is expected the availability of the census information may well give rise to a demand for old maps and other information from people who wish to trace their roots here.  Other digitisation projects are either in train or planning in the National Archives.</P>
        <P>While we can move away somewhat from the paper-based presentation of our national records, there is still a need to archive and store the paper original.  This is receiving a high priority in the Department and the Office of Public Works.  Shouldering my two responsibilities, I am determined to see a cost-effective solution through to a completion.  Senior management teams in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the OPW are meeting early next week to advance the solution.  I thank the Senator for his interest in the National Archives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and appreciate the words he used.  I was very pleased to hear him state the matter was receiving a high priority and that something was happening.  When I was in Bishop Street some years ago, I was very impressed by the ability of the team and its interest.  However, I still hold certain concerns.  The information provided by the Minister of State on the numbers examining the census figures is startling.  It would amount to a disaster if we lost them.  There has been a vast effort made; I urge the Minister of State to give the matter not only a high priority but the highest priority.  I recognise, however, that we do not have the funds to do everything we wish to do.  In this case we would never get over the blame that would attach to us if we lost the archives.  We must do something <Col N="86"/>about the matter.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to give it the highest priority and ensure this happens in the way sought.</P>

	<P>When one discusses an issue, it is always easy to look for defects, deficiencies, shortcomings and flaws.  However, there is very spacious accommodation for readers in the National Archives.  They are served well and relatively quickly compared to other archives with which I am familiar in other parts of Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Another point which is totally under-estimated and to which digitisation may offer a solution in some aspects, though not all, is that in the modern age we generate vast quantities of paper.  I remember when I was in the Department of Foreign Affairs in the 1970s and working on part 19 of a file on a particular subject, if I wished to retrieve parts seven, eight, nine and ten, for example, it was a devil of a job to do so.  People may castigate us about documents being lost, but there was a tsunami of paper.  It is a major challenge for every organisation to manage this issue.  Some operations are relatively simple to computerise, while it is possible to keep certain records on disk and so on.  However, the nature of documents produced by the Government is such that we are betwixt and between paper and digital information.  There is onsiderable unease, given that we are living in the digital age, that even more records will go missing than was the case in the paper age.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not take up too much time.  The motion submitted on Tuesday of last week has been overtaken by the visit of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to Cork, west Cork in particular.  I thank him sincerely for his visit to the flooded areas of Skibbereen which was flooded three times in a seven week period and almost for a fourth time, Bandon which was severely flooded on 19 November, Clonakilty and Kinsale.  In this regard, I am very pleased to accept his commitment given at the meeting held in Skibbereen last Friday.  Had I been alerted to the matter this morning, I might have been able to withdraw the motion.  However, I urge him in so far as he can to honour the commitment given in Skibbereen.  The council and the local authority are making a new application for funding under the small projects relief scheme for this year.  It is urgent that something is done.  </P>
        <P>The Minister of State brought very good news regarding the situation in Bandon and announced the allocation of considerable funding for the town.  However, in respect of Skibbereen, I urge him, through the offices of the Office of Public Works, to propel the local authority to act on a major relief programme.  That will provide the answer to all of the flooding problems that might arise in a lifetime.  There were three or four initial projects outlined by the flood committee in Skibbereen and supported, by and large, by the engineers and management team.  Some of this work will alleviate the problems that occurred in Skibbereen, probably one of the towns worst hit in Cork in recent weeks.  Work on the major relief and flood management facility for Skibbereen should be advanced expeditiously.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the work the Minister of State has done to date.  As with the National Archives, there have been up to 20 reports during my lifetime, or at least during the past 35 years, on various ways to solve the problem in Skibbereen.  A flood plan was agreed some six or seven years ago.  It should be scrutinised and re-examined and if it is to form the basis of a long-term solution, it should be adopted.  We should seek to secure funding next year for a major flood relief operation in Skibbereen.</P><Col N="87"/>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State sincerely for his visit.  That he walked through Skibbereen and Bandon and met members of the public and those affected was significant.  Both private and commercial properties were affected and the Minister of State met the relevant engineers and management personnel.  He has given a psychological boost and provided assurance that those in west Cork are not being forgotten.  I realise people living in other parts of the country suffered also.  That said, I hope what the Minister of State has done will allow elderly people who suffered severe personal degradation to sleep somewhat more easily in their beds.  I know it will not resolve the issue but the visit by the Minister of State was timely and very important.  When I proposed this matter last Tuesday for the Adjournment debate, I was unaware of his impending visit.  By visiting, he has done a considerable service to his Department and to the people of west Cork whom I represent.  I am reassured by the contribution he has made and the assurances he has given the people.  I speak now more to thank him.  I ask him to honour his commitment to the people he met, as I know he will, particularly those in Bandon and Skibbereen.  I do not intend anything derogatory to the people of Clonakilty and Kinsale but they were affected to a much lesser degree by the severe flooding of the past two months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for giving me an opportunity to come to the House to discuss the position in respect of the recent flooding which occurred in Skibbereen in November 2009.</P>
        <P>When Senator O&rsquo;Donovan tabled the Adjournment matter that Tuesday, I was not aware I would be going to Skibbereen on the Friday.  It had been my intention to visit the towns in west Cork but when I saw on Wednesday that Skibbereen was likely to be affected for either the third or fourth time, I decided to bring my visit forward to the Friday before the Houses resumed session to spend a day there and scrap any other plans I had.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very much aware of the hardship and loss suffered as a result of flooding and I am pleased to have the opportunity to express my personal sympathy and concern and that of the Government for the victims of the flooding.  As I stated, on Friday of last week I visited a number of areas in Cork, including Skibbereen, that were badly affected by the unprecedented flooding of recent weeks to appreciate the extent of the problem at first hand and to hear the views of people locally as well as to talk to engineers from both the Office of Public Works and the local authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the tremendous work delivered locally by the emergency services and other State agencies.  I mention in particular the contribution of local authorities, the Army and Civil Defence personnel who deployed 4,000 sandbags to protect the town from a threatened flood event last week.  I also acknowledge the fantastic co-operation and help that was delivered within communities and from neighbours.  It is my experience that public representatives, both national and local, served a very important function by helping to communicate with the different services and authorities.</P>
        <P>The OPW is aware of the impact of flooding, and we are committed to doing all we can to alleviate it through the provision of defences to reduce existing flood risk and by taking steps to prevent the creation of future risk and as a precaution against the effects of climate change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Skibbereen is situated on the banks of the River Ilen and its tributary, the Caol stream.  Flood analyses to date have concluded that the primary cause of flooding in Skibbereen is the flood flow in the Ilen river.  This flow cannot be accommodated in the river without it breaking its banks, extending up the Caol valley and, in the process, flooding part of the town.  Until recently, the most severe flood event affecting Skibbereen occurred in August 1986, with other recorded events in 1969, 1974, 1975 and 1982 being less severe.  In November 2009, the Ilen broke its banks, causing severe flooding of residential and commercial properties at various locations in the town. Records indicate that the flood event of 19 November 2009 was greater <Col N="88"/>in magnitude than the previously maximum recorded flood event in the last 40 years which occurred in August 1986.</P>
        <P>Following the severe flooding in November 2009, Cork County Council commissioned a scoping report to identify the extent of this flood and to update previous flood relief proposals and associated costs in light of development in the area in recent years.  This report is being finalised and will be forwarded on completion to the OPW for consideration for funding of mitigation works.  Following consideration of this report, the OPW will meet Cork County Council with a view to deciding how best to address the flooding problem in Skibbereen.</P>
        <P>The OPW is fully committed to working in partnership with Cork County Council, including providing expertise and guidance on flood solutions for the town.  Our aim is always to ensure the preferred solution is one that will afford the required level of protection while also addressing any environmental issues and providing the best value for money.  Pending a decision on the need for a full flood relief scheme, it is open to Cork County Council to apply for funding for minor mitigation flood relief measures under the OPW&rsquo;s minor flood relief programme which can be used to address immediate flood problems in the Skibbereen area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am conscious that in addition to the trauma caused by the flooding, people also suffered financial loss arising from the damage to their property.  In recognition of the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country due to the recent flooding, the Government has allocated an initial sum of &euro;10 million to fund a humanitarian assistance scheme.  The scheme is being administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The aim of the scheme is to provide financial support for people who have suffered flood damage to their homes.  In doing so it will provide hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation.  The community welfare service has already provided emergency financial and other assistance for households affected by the flooding to cover items such as clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs.  Qualified households can claim for essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The OPW will continue to work in partnership with Cork County Council to try to alleviate the risk of future flooding in Skibbereen and the surrounding areas.  I again express my sympathy to the victims of the flooding in Skibbereen and surrounding areas and assure them of the Government&rsquo;s support for the work that is already under way to provide reassurance for them in relation to risk in the future.</P>
