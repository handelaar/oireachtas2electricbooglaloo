	<P Just="Left">With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I would like to send the condolences of the House to the people of Donegal, especially the families of the eight men who tragically lost their lives on Sunday night in Inishowen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is proposed to take tributes to former Senator Nuala Fennell at the conclusion of the Order of Business, to conclude within 30 minutes, with leaders and Senators having three <Col N="392"/>minutes to speak.  The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on carers in Ireland, to conclude within 90 minutes, on which spokespersons may speak for seven minutes and all other Senators for five minutes, on which Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from leaders or spokespersons; No. 2, Criminal Procedure Bill 2009 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1; and No. 3, Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010, Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 3.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Leader in expressing our sincere sympathy and condolences to the eight families of those who were killed tragically in Donegal.  Road safety is something on which we should all keep our minds and on which we should reflect to see whether we can do anything in this or the other House on road safety.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s ongoing failure to respond to HIQA&rsquo;s grave concerns in respect of the safety of children in foster care is a clear demonstration that child care needs to be removed from the ambit of the HSE.  It is clear the HSE is out of control, a sentiment that has been expressed by Members on the Government side of the House.  It is failing in its core duties and is impervious to complaints from agencies such as HIQA.  HIQA has expressed concerns in this area regarding unsafe placements of foster children, missing files and failure to assess carers.  More than 100 child protection concerns have not been responded to by the HSE.  Advocacy groups estimate that up to 800 children are in foster care without any assessment of carers taking place.  What is the point of the State taking children into care if we cannot have some guarantee that they are placed in safer hands?  That is the key to it all.  HIQA has stated that some children in foster care have not had any contact with social workers for up to a decade and there are serious deficiencies in the social worker area, with wholly inadequate hours and <Col N="393"/>wholly inadequate numbers.  The net effect of this is that children&rsquo;s lives are in danger.  It is time for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to face up to her responsibilities and ask if the HSE is fit for purpose at this stage.  She needs to come to the House and explain to Members at the earliest possible opportunity what she intends to do to address this most important area.</P>
        <P>Newspaper reports yesterday indicate that the final cost of the Anglo Irish Bank bailout could be as high as &euro;33.5 billion.  Given that the bank guarantee is due to be reviewed prior to renewal while the Oireachtas is in recess, can the Leader tell the House of the Government&rsquo;s plans to debate this issue in the Oireachtas prior to its renewal?  That is very important.</P>
        <P>My party has taken a different view from that of the Government on Anglo Irish Bank.  Could the Leader also comment on the fact that yesterday it emerged that Mr. FitzPatrick is one of the bondholders who the Government appears so keen to protect?  We need a working banking system.  We need a guarantee, certainly on deposits.  However, do we need to protect risk-taking professionals and investors who knew the risks they were taking at that time?  I do not think we do.  That matter must be addressed and I ask the Leader to comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In discussing the issue of where we are with the banks and the economy, we should consider the growing list of FitzPatrick, Mansfield, McNamara, etc. and put to bed one idea.  Whatever criticism there has been of the Government, it has not sought to bail out builders and developers.  Let us get that out of the way for the moment because that distracted from our focus.  It is right that we all should focus on NAMA and the banks, look honestly and come to honest conclusions, but at least the phrase of bailing out builders and developers has gone from the lexicon, and that is good.  The next matter is to see how we deal with the banks and how we ensure people are brought to book over the next few months, and it is important that the Government shows us its commitment to doing exactly that.</P>
        <P>I share the views articulated by Senator Cummins about the latest HIQA report.  I have rarely criticised the HSE in this House.  Many of the issues that have arisen repeatedly have been historic issues coming to light.  The importance of this week&rsquo;s report is that there was a report last autumn, measures were supposed to have been put in place and the HSE gave commitments to us, to HIQA, to the Department of Health and Children and to the world at large that all the issues raised were being dealt with.  Six months later, HIQA goes back to reassess, see where they are, and comes up with an astonishing report.  The report reflects all the points raised by Senator Cummins and caused such obvious dismay in the Department that the Minister wrote to express her views to the chair of the HSE.  The reality is that we have abandoned children.  They are lost in society somewhere, out of touch and out of contact, with no files on them, no contact with social workers and no consideration or assessment of the condition in which they are being kept, fostered and maintained.  This, surely, is proof positive that the HSE is not fit for purpose in this regard, whatever about in other matters, and we should state that clearly.  The HSE should be relieved of this responsibility.  These children do not get another shot at the last year in foster care.  They must put up with the pain.  For a State agency such as HIQA, which is balanced in its statements and consistently produces balanced, evidentially based reports, to come out with a statement to the effect that there is a potential dereliction of duty on the part of the HSE is a clarion call to politicians and public representatives.  We cannot ignore this and we must take action.  I wish to hear what action the Department of Health and Children and the Minister can and will take on this issue on foot of the report to ensure children are not in an unsafe fostering environment, that their cases are properly maintained, filed, managed, recorded and safeguarded.  I call for this to be done as a matter of urgency and for this call to be communicated by the Leader to the Minister as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join the Leader and Senator Cummins in expressing sympathy following the horrible tragedies that have befallen the people of Donegal.  To lose one or two lives is tragic enough, but to lose eight in such a close knit community is dreadful.  This is a reminder to all of us of the whole issue of road safety.  I join the other speakers in expressing sympathy on behalf of the Labour Party Members of the House to the families of those who have lost their lives and to the community in Donegal which will be marked for some time because of this appalling tragedy.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of Anglo Irish Bank.  In the past week it has been in the headlines for two different reasons.  First, because of the bankruptcy application of its former chairman and second, because of the fact that it may well take more money from the taxpayer.  I have stated consistently in this House what I wish to be done.  What happened in the case of its former chairman was inevitable.  Unfortunately when one examines the financial scandal and the role of Anglo Irish Bank, no one has taken responsibility for it.  Thousands of people are still affected by negative equity, house repossessions and unemployment.  They have really paid the price for the economic collapse of the country.  However, there is still no financial responsibility for it.  Now, we believe there may be more money pumped into Anglo Irish Bank.  When will the Government realise this is no longer an option and engage in an orderly wind down?  Some &euro;22 billion has already gone in and possibly more billions are to come.  Is it any wonder people are up in arms?  I realise we are at the end of term and it is unrealistic to expect any movement in the House on this issue.  However, as we go towards the summer recess it is an issue of which we must be cognisant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, admitted that no decisions had been taken with regard to the e-voting machines.  In a climate where we are penny-pinching and saving and the Government is engaging in cutting and generally targeting vulnerable groups in society, it is a disgrace that no decision has been taken in respect of the electronic voting machines.  The whole saga was marked by financial imprudence, bad decision making and political blindness.  However, these machines are still costing the taxpayers a fortune in storage costs.  There is still no decision on the contracts under which these machines are being stored.  It is ridiculous.  Can we get some indication of when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government intends to deal with this matter conclusively, once and for all?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join in the notes of concern expressed by Senators in respect of the tragic road accident in County Donegal at the weekend.  The fact that it occurred on the Inishowen Peninsula where 25 such deaths have occurred in the past number of years means particular attention must be given to the factors in that part of the country and why so many tragic accidents involving large numbers of people occur.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the debates which are taking place and will take place on the ongoing banking crisis in the country.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has put down one interesting marker in respect of who is being assisted here and for what reason.  The debates have not been helped in the past by suggesting there are bailouts for developers.  Likewise, the reference to figures left, right and centre that must be qualified about &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;could&rdquo; without actually being realised do not help the debate either.  It is clear that whatever course of action could have been followed in respect of the banking crisis, given that these financial institutions were licensed and badly regulated, the State has picked up a liability that will cost billions of euro.</P>
        <P>I refer to Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s call for a debate on e-voting machines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I called for a decision, not another debate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="395"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Whichever way the House handles the matter, a definite decision has been made on e-voting machines.  They will not be used in future elections.  The decision must be made on how they are to be disposed of, which is very much an ongoing process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday at my clinic in Mullingar I met an elderly lady with osteoporosis who told me she had to attend a hospital appointment.  However, because no transport is provided by the HSE for patients from Longford, Mullingar and Athlone who must attend hospital appointments in Tullamore, she had to cancel the appointment, for which she had waited a long time.  She subsequently rearranged it and will attend St. James&rsquo;s Hospital which is bursting at the seams.  It is incredible to think the HSE is deciding which hospitals patients will attend without providing transport.  Family members of this little old lady have cars, but they work.  She was outraged and disgusted because there is no transport to Tullamore from the area provided by CIE or the HSE.  People must travel more than 50 miles from Longford to Tullamore.  Patients must also attend Tullamore hospital for chemotherapy.  My colleague, Councillor Peggy Nolan, has raised this issue on several occasions.   Will the Leader arrange a debate on it at his earliest convenience to ensure transport is provided in all these areas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in extending our condolence and expressing sympathy to those affected by the tragic road accident in County Donegal and to all of the other families who have suffered as a result of road fatalities and injuries.  I acknowledge the good work of the Road Safety Authority in reducing the number of deaths and injuries on the roads.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Leader&rsquo;s acknowledgment of my request to place on the cl&aacute;r a debate on carers.  The Carers Association and the volunteer army of people involved in caring will greatly appreciate this opportunity.  While I acknowledge we will be making statements, will the Leader consider arranging a follow-up debate on the issue when we return in the autumn to assess the progress made on the issues raised in the debate?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I join previous speakers who expressed concern about other matters relating to the HSE.  I have been vocal in my concerns over a prolonged period regarding this unwieldy executive.  I am unsure that I agree it is not fit for purpose, as I believe genuine, committed individuals are involved, but we established one single authority as service provider, having had 14 separate regional health boards which may have been a few too many.  We should probably consider the provision of a service on a regional basis based on European Parliament constituencies.  I share the concerns expressed about the HSE and ask the Leader to put this and other health related issues on the agenda when we return.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The horrific deaths in County Donegal are a reminder to us that we cannot take our eye off the ball in regard to road safety.  The work done in recent years may have meant people relaxed a little because the number of road deaths had reduced.  Our sympathies go to all of the families who have lost the young men involved.</P>
        <P>One of the scandals linked to the health service is the cost of medicines and health care, which is dramatically more expensive here than elsewhere.  Those of us who have filled a prescription in Spain, France, the United States or Britain have been amazed at the difference in price.  I had not realised until this week that one of the reasons for this was a large number of prescriptions in these countries did not need to be written by a doctor.  One can go to the pharmacy and pick up the medicine there.  It is good news that the Minister will announce later <Col N="396"/>that steps are being taken here in that direction this year and I gather flu jabs will be available in pharmacies later this year without the need for a doctor&rsquo;s prescription.  However, they will have to be paid for, including by medical card holders.  I am sure there will be sufficient controls to ensure we are protected.  The flu jabs are just the first step in that direction.  It seems the vested interests the Minister must face in order to achieve any change in our health care system are difficult to deal with, but she has shown over the years in her various portfolios that she is able to face up to vested interests and let them know the right approach to take and tell them what we need to do.  I urge the Minister to ensure over the next few months that she looks again at and faces up to the challenges so as to protect us and our pockets so we have a health care service that has more comparable costs to those of other countries.  The Minister&rsquo;s heart is in the right place so let us encourage her to do this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I too extend my sympathy to the families of the eight men in the two car crash in Donegal.  My thoughts are with the relatives of the deceased.  This crash raises again the question of road safety.  We have all the rules and regulations in place, but still things go wrong.  The issue goes beyond rules and regulations into communities.  We all have a role to play and must discuss this issue in our communities, homes, businesses, licensed premises and at sports events.  It is tragic to think that such an accident has happened once again to people on their way home after enjoying watching a match.  We must all ask ourselves what is going wrong when something like this can happen so fast.  People are careless.  The National Roads Authority is doing its best and the regulations are there, but accidents are still happening.  We need an ongoing debate on this issue.  We must discuss it here time and again so we get the important message across of the need for care when driving.</P>
        <P>I condemn last Sunday night&rsquo;s bomb attacks in Kampala.  Victims were watching the World Cup final when the bombs exploded and now there are 74 people, including an Irish person, confirmed dead.  I am saddened at this dreadful and appalling loss of life and by this vicious attack on innocent people who were enjoying celebrations on the conclusion of the World Cup.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns of many of those who spoke about the HSE and its management of children at risk.  This is a serious issue and I ask the Leader to convey our views on it to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the remarks made by Senator Maurice Cummins with regard to the bank guarantee scheme and its renewal, which is due in September while the House is in recess.  I am particularly concerned with regard to Anglo Irish Bank and how the scheme may be refined or varied.  What are the Government&rsquo;s intentions and what message has come from the Commission and the European Central Bank on that?  This issue is vitally important.  Every taxpayer has serious concerns about the guarantee and our future.  If necessary, the House should be recalled so that debate can take place when appropriate.</P>
        <P>Publication of the Dublin mayoral Bill has been promised for a long time.  It is intended to include in that Bill in some way a provision for the righting of the Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is matter, which has been outstanding for years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the issue of child protection which a number of other Senators have raised.  I note that a debate on carers will be held after the Order of Business, which is to be welcomed.  However, I regard this as separate from the issue of child protection.  While I have no doubt child protection issues will be raised during the debate, we need a separate debate on child protection because I agree with Senators on the opposite side of the House that it is absolutely clear there is a deficit in that regard.  We are calling for a referendum on children to be held later this year or early next year and I ask the House to note that the outcome of the referendum will make it easier, rather than more difficult, for the State to take children into care.  What we need to do is ensure, after the referendum is held and once we have the legislation to back up the result, the children of this country will be properly protected by the institutions of the State.  Following the Ryan and various other reports, it is time we put child care and child protection at the top of our agenda, not the various financial issues that we discuss so strongly in the House.  More than anything else, child protection is at the core of our society.  It is very important, therefore, that we hold a debate on the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Thursday Senator Mullen stated I had voted in favour of the use of the guillotine.  I have checked the record of the House and there was no such vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not revisiting the business dealt with last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What he said was untrue and I want to correct him.  In fact, I spoke against it, as the record shows.</P>
        <P>I refer to the situation of an Irish company which, apparently, has been deprived of the opportunity of applying for a job.  Many of us will know about the magnificent pipe organ in the National Concert Hall which was built by an Irish company using Irish crafts people.  It has been very successful and is widely regarded as a work of architectural significance and art.  Now, apparently, it is to be revamped and redeveloped, but the firm which originally made it is, for some reason, to be precluded from even tendering.  It has not been asked about it and has not been allowed to tender.  Something should be done about this, as we should be encouraging Irish companies.  It seems absurd that the company which actually made the organ is to be prevented from tendering.</P>
        <P>It is very important that we have an opportunity to relate the stories of some of the people being injured in these terrible financial circumstances.  We all receive letters, day after day, some of which are heartbreaking.  I recently received a letter from a wonderful man who, with his wife, started a business in the midlands.  He was hit by the cutbacks to bank loans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past few days there have been very disturbing reports from Iran concerning a young girl who at the age of 14 years was subject to an arranged marriage with a much older man.  Within a couple of months she was accused of and found guilty of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning.  Because she was 14 years old, it was believed they would hold off from carrying out the sentence until she turned 18 years.  She has spent the past four years in prison, where she has been subjected to two mock stonings.  I ask the Leader to make contact with the Minister for Foreign Affairs as soon as possible after the Order of Business and urge him to advocate on behalf of this child, who will be sentenced to death by stoning.  I also request him to ask our EU colleagues to take up the case on behalf of the young girl.  We have signed the Hague Convention and we believe in the rights of the child.  This should not go ahead.  The fact we have this information makes us responsible for taking some form of action on her behalf.</P>

It is important that the Leader orders business tomorrow so the Minister for Health and Children comes into this House.</P>
        <P>Regarding what Senator Norris raised on the Order of Business, it is imperative we hear about people and jobs.  Yesterday we saw the great friends of Fianna F&aacute;il fall from grace.  They are now bankrupt.  Hundreds of thousands of people are unemployed.  There is a link between the banks, Fianna F&aacute;il and developers and the Galway races next week will show that.

	<P>I am looking not only for a debate but for action from the Government, which has failed to provide jobs for 450,000 people who are unemployed.  That is the fundamental task of the Government and it has failed to do that.  It has failed to cater for the escalation in the number of unemployed people.  Senator Norris is correct.  There are people who cannot pay mortgages or buy food and they make choices between medicine or trips for their children.  When will it end?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek a resumption of the debate on health with the Minister for Health and Children.  It was unfortunate but necessary that the debate was curtailed the last time she was in the Chamber.  I look forward to her picking up a number of the outstanding items from the early part of that debate.</P>
        <P>I wish to reflect further on what has happened in the past day or two between HIQA and the HSE with regard to child care.  I refer to the range of issues the HSE has command of and must manage, all going through Professor Drumm, who is a medic turned manager with the greatest of respect to him.  He has to deal with everything from child care to community welfare and assessments by community welfare officers.  All this goes across his desk.  Instead of breaking up the organisation with regard to region, I suggest doing so according to function.  We should allow it to do its core activities, primary health care and hospitals, and find another way of dealing with a range of other functions.  I note the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has written to the chair of the HSE, Mr. Liam Downey, with regard to the HIQA report on shortcomings in child care.  I propose that serious consideration be given to amending the Health Act to the effect that the Minister does not merely write, but can issue a direction to the HSE if it deviates from State policy.  Last week, I raised an issue in respect of mental health provision, which is driven by the document, A Vision for Change, but which is being eroded in an effort to save money.  In such circumstances, the Minister should have the ability to direct the HSE, rather than simply to write to it requesting that it amend its positions.  Such an assertion would permit the Minister to give greater direction to the HSE and there would be more accountability.  It would be a two-way street and the Minister ought to consider this suggestion.  I look forward to a debate on an amendment to the Health Act 2004 and I respectfully make this suggestion to the Leader.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the comments made by Senator Corrigan regarding the position in Iran.  It brings to mind the comments of the late lamented former Deputy Brian Lenihan Snr., in which he spoke of the futility of consistency.  There certainly is a futility of consistency policy in operation within the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Whenever an outrage takes place in the only democracy in the Middle East, that is, Israel, of which tragically there have been many, the Department, the Government and public opinion take an extremely hard line.  In this instance, however, although there is the prospect of a possible tragedy of enormous proportions in Iran, there is almost complete silence from this House, from those who usually march to the gates of Leinster House, from the Government and from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Consequently, I agree with Senator Corrigan that strong statements are needed from this House, the Minister and the Government.  As far as I am aware from media reports, there may have been progress in respect of this particular case.  However, it is absolutely deplorable that any state could provide for the passing of such an horrific death sentence on a child or on an adult.  Members need to express their disappointment on the lack of a Government response to date.</P>

	<P>I appreciate that.  However, Members must make a statement about the role of the Seanad and must revert to the position they always have held and which the Leader has confirmed on so many occasions, that is, that legislation is dealt with fully, absolutely and totally in this House.  Furthermore, Members should not practice the politics of the guillotine.  Unfortunately, I was not in a position last Wednesday to be present in this House for the initial Second Stage debate on the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009.  However, in my preamble to the legislation some weeks ago, I expressed the hope that this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is what time, space and debating time is needed for and I hope the Leader will reflect on his decision last week to guillotine legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to consider having a debate in September on the interim report of the expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt, chaired by Mr. Hugh <Col N="401"/>Cooney, which was published during the week.  Many issues raised by that report are highly welcome.  One issue pertains to the great difficulties being experienced by borrowers who were being penalised with additional penalties.  The report now has dealt with that issue and I am glad this is happening.  Moreover, the report proposes that each bank be obliged to have a dedicated section dealing with mortgages right across the system.  I have undertaken a considerable amount of work on this issue and a report produced by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs contained at least 22 proposals in this regard.  I hope some of them will be integrated into the report by the expert group chaired by Mr. Hugh Cooney, because MABS is a highly important organisation that will play a major role in helping people who are in difficulty with their mortgages.  It is important that we have a full debate on this when the full report is released in September.  We should be able to add or subtract from it as we see fit in this House.  It will be important to analyse the report.</P>
        <P>Some 35,000 people are in major trouble with mortgages.  If we allow this issue to feature beyond September, many more people will be in difficulty.  It is important that the Leader expedite the debate on this as soon as we return after the recess.</P>

	<P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the people of the Inishowen Peninsula.  The parish priest said now is the time for grief and solidarity but that questions will need to be asked and further conversation had in respect of road safety.  It is very important that this happen.</P>
        <P>I support what was said on the HIQA report.  We need to reflect on the disconnect that while we are focusing, justly to some extent, on enlarging the State&rsquo;s ability to intervene where children are vulnerable, it is becoming increasingly clear that the State is no substitute for the family.  We need to discuss in the next term what we are doing to support families to try to ensure children have the best possible start and support in life.  Unless we focus on marriage and the family and are willing to brave charges of political incorrectness, we will not vindicate the rights of children in the longer term.</P>
        <P>I have a question that very much relates to last week&rsquo;s business, albeit connected with last week&rsquo;s business.  I will be tabling a motion for the Order Paper today and will be asking for a debate tomorrow on the question of using the guillotine on Committee Stage debates.  I am very glad Senator Bradford brought this up.  It used to be the Leader&rsquo;s proud claim that Committee Stage debates were not guillotined in the Seanad.  The ability of the Seanad to scrutinise legislation and offer alternative perspectives to those heard in the D&aacute;il was one of our proud boasts collectively.  Last week, however, for political as distinct from emergency or exceptional reasons, that good practice was jettisoned on a fairly flimsy pretext.</P>
        <P>The reason I am asking for this debate tomorrow, and giving the Leader notice thereof, is that we have had longer Committee Stage debates in the past.  It must be said that some Members in this House knew there would be a guillotine.  The Green Party, for example, called an impromptu press conference at 3.30 p.m. before any of us knew there would be a guillotine.</P>

From speaking with people on the peninsula, I know they are preparing for the funerals.  The next three days will be a difficult time during which the funerals, mostly of young people, will go ahead.  Incidents like this focus us on road safety.  It is important we discuss the matter, but acting on it is more important.  I ask that we all redouble our efforts.</P>
        <P>In late March, I tabled a motion on the Adjournment about the annual seat belt review conducted by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and asked that it be extended to school buses.  However, my motion was ruled out of order because the Minister for Transport did not have jurisdiction over the matter.  I thank God that we have not had an incident involving a school bus recently, but were the excuse of the survey not being extended provided to the press or the bereaved, it would not be acceptable.  Our sympathy and solidarity are with the families, but we have a duty to refocus on the issue.</P>

The devastation visited on the good people of that part of the country can only evoke the greatest of sympathy.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader convey the thanks of the House to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his efforts last week following an all-party motion in the Seanad regarding Mrs. Ashanti, who was under the threat of stoning?  Last week, I conveyed to the House the nauseating detail of what might occur.  As a result of the pressure applied by Ireland, the EU and various international agencies and governments, the Iranian authorities stated at the weekend that they would not be proceeding with the execution.  Even at a remove, this example highlights the importance of the effect a parliament can have on a government without interfering with the latter&rsquo;s sovereign right to decide its judicial processes, however one might view stoning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also share the concerns of Senators Corrigan and Bradford regarding the 18 year old woman who was convicted when she was 14 years old.

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have a question.  The point is that the establishment of NAMA was announced in the supplementary Budget Statement in April last year.  The draft business plan, according to which we were to make this phenomenal &euro;4.8 billion in profit, was published on 13 October.  Having nationalised Anglo Irish Bank in December 2009 and appointed public interest directors to all of the banks, there was adequate time for the Government to find out the true story.  It is an abdication of responsibility to suggest it all comes down to the information the Government received from the banks.  NAMA and the Government have a multitude of advisers to check these matters for them.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Government not present, intentionally, a rosy and misleading picture on the profitability of NAMA in order to get the legislation over the line?  It either did engage in a due diligence process on the banks &mdash; it had the capacity to do so &mdash; and hid the figures from us, or it did not, which would amount to a dereliction of duty.  That is what is unpatriotic about the Government &mdash; it misled the Houses and the public on one of the most enormous financial undertakings ever made by the State.</P>

	<P>Like all other Senators, I am shocked by the tragedy on the Inishowen Peninsula in which so many young lives were lost.  It prompts the need for a full and thorough debate on where we are going on the issue of road safety. </P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am aware that the Taoiseach is in New York where he is doing a fine job in raising funds for the development of new technologies.  With that in mind, I ask for a debate on the development of new technologies.  When the Commissioner with specific responsibility for the matter, our own M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, was here recently, she pointed out that the gap in Europe was in the development of the new good ideas.  She suggested that, rather than reinvent the wheel, the new innovative products being developed in Europe, not be sent, for its benefit, to the New World which was only too ready to develop them.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader please request the Minister for Justice and Law Reform for a cost schedule for the civil partnership Bill?  It is unusual that we have not received it.  I requested it twice during the debate last week.  A ready reckoner was provided in the D&aacute;il in which it was quickly indicated that it would cost &euro;1 million per 1,000 couples.  Is it true that, at the lowest end of the scale, we are looking at a possible cost of &euro;73 million per annum within three to five years?</P>

	<P>I add my voice to those of Senators Corrigan, Bradford and others on the situation in Iran and congratulate the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I echo the words of Senator Mooney &mdash; if the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs had an effect last week, that is laudable and something we should encourage.  The case involves a barbaric act, something on which we cannot be neutral.  However, I hesitate in taking the view that we should only protest when these things happen in Iran.  They happen elsewhere also.</P>
     
        <P>Stoning in Iran is absolutely deplorable and disgusting.  It would be commendable if we could unilaterally punch above our weight in making protests as a nation and not under the European umbrella.  We might, however, extend it as we tend to be a little <i>&agrave; la carte</i> about our protests over executions.  Will the House consider why we remain regularly silent when executions take place in the United States of America?</P>

	<P>Professor Robert Butler, a leading gerontologist about whom I have spoken many times in the House, died on 4 July.  Older people across the world have lost a valiant friend, supporter and visionary against ageism.  He coined the phrase &ldquo;ageism&rdquo;, opening up a whole thought process and debate about the subject.</P>
        <P>Ageism, the denial of basic human rights of older persons, is one of the most pervasive prejudices across human society.  In speech after speech, Professor Butler pounded home the message that longevity in the United States had increased by 30 years in the 20th century, greater than the gain during the preceding 5,000 years of human history.</P>

	<P>I certainly am not an ageist.  Senator Ross made a good point about capital punishment.  We are all appalled by the prospect of what is about to happen in Iran.  However, we are slow to point out what happens regularly across the Atlantic.  I am a strong supporter of the United States but when it comes to its capital punishment policy, we should not be afraid to point out our difficulties with it.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Butler&rsquo;s point about the Cooney report and the difficulties experienced by those with mortgage arrears.  A debate should be held on this as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader organise a debate about the HIQA report on the HSE and children in foster care?  Senator Cummins and others have raised this matter before and it is obvious the HSE is out of control.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week in Carlow, the HSE signed a contract to rent premises with no parking facilities in the middle of the town for &euro;365,000 a year to house its occupational therapy and other community care facilities.  This is despite the fact the facilities are already housed in the local public hospital, St. Dyspnea&rsquo;s, which is half empty and could easily be refurbished to accommodate these facilities well into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are serious questions why the premises in the town centre were chosen.  Senator Norris and I have raised the closure of Bethany House, a supported care home in Carlow town centre which equally could be used.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>

	<P>Last night the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin, launched the Galway Arts Festival.  In doing so, she was encouraged to be an artist for a day, as the festival generates a turnover of &euro;20 million and brings 150,000 visitors to the city.  Every day, we come to this House looking for solutions to our current economic crisis, yet there have been many missed opportunities.</P>
        <P>I encourage the Minister to be a film-maker for a day.  Last Saturday, I had the honour of being invited to the world premiere of a Galway-based film, &ldquo;The Guards&rdquo;.  The making of the movie generated &euro;150 million in Galway.  However, it very nearly did not happen because of prohibitive union practices that delayed and added extra costs to filming.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I extend the deepest sympathy and condolences of this House and those of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues to Ms Nuala Fennell&rsquo;s husband, Brian, their children, Jacqueline, Garrett and Amanda and her extended family and friends on the passing of a truly inspirational woman, a loyal and loving wife and mother and a dedicated champion of women&rsquo;s rights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As many of her family and friends will know, Nuala was truly committed to the cause of women&rsquo;s rights and was a leading campaigner in this area long before becoming a prominent member of the Fine Gael Party in the 1980s.  Nuala first came to prominence in 1972 as a founder member of AIM group which was set up to look after the interests of deserted wives and established the first refuge for battered women in Dublin.  It was her commitment, com<Col N="411"/>passion and determination to help those less fortunate than herself that led her to the establishment of Women&rsquo;s Aid in 1974.  Since then, Women&rsquo;s Aid has grown to become the leading national organisation it is today working tirelessly on the issues of domestic violence.</P>
        <P>Nuala Fennell was the first chair of Irish Women&rsquo;s Aid in 1975 and an executive member of the Irish Council for the Status of Women.  Nuala contested the 1977 general election as an Independent candidate but was not elected on that occasion.  It was her prominent role in the campaign for women&rsquo;s rights that brought her to the attention of Garret FitzGerald and the Fine Gael Party in the late 1970s and in the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, Nuala stood as a candidate for the party in the Dublin area.  She was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the Dublin South constituency in 1981 and held her seat in the two elections that took place in the following 18 months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">After the November 1982 election, Nuala was appointed as a junior Minister of State with responsibility for women&rsquo;s affairs and served as Minister of State with responsibility for women&rsquo;s affairs and family law reform from 1982 to 1987.  Nuala was a major force behind a range of reforms introduced to improve the position of women.  She lost her seat in the 1987 general election but was then elected to the 18th Seanad on the Labour Panel.</P>
        <P>In the 1989 general election, Nuala was returned to the 26th D&aacute;il but retired from politics following the 1992 general election.  Her decision to stand down from politics in 1992 was a great loss to our country and to the Fine Gael Party for which she had worked tirelessly over the years.</P>
        <P>Nuala&rsquo;s remarkable achievements as a woman, both inside and outside politics, are a lasting legacy to Irish women and Irish men of today.  She will be truly missed.  She was a remarkable Irish woman.  To her husband, Brian, and her children, Jacqueline, Garrett and Amanda, we extend our deepest sympathy.  Go nd&eacute;anfaidh Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is an honour to pay tribute in the Seanad to the late Nuala Fennell, former Minister of State, Deputy, Senator and equality campaigner, loving wife, mother and sister.  I acknowledge the presence of her family here today.</P>
        <P>The first anniversary of Nuala&rsquo;s death takes place next month and it is an apt time, therefore, to pause and reflect on the lifetime of work of this remarkable woman and what she gave to this country and to the causes which were so dear to her, which made a difference to so many people.</P>
        <P>In 1972, Nuala established the AIM group which was dedicated to looking after the interests of those who were then described as deserted wives.  She worked and led the charge to establish the first refuge for women suffering domestic abuse in Dublin and laid the foundation for the development of many services since then.</P>
        <P>Nuala became the first chair of Irish Women&rsquo;s Aid.  I was reading about her interest in that and the story was that she was watching a television programme about violence in the United Kingdom and saw that there were many Irish women that service was trying to look after who had left Ireland and had no place to go.  She wrote a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> and asked if people were interested in working with her to try to do something in Ireland.  That is how the organisation got established, which has gone on to do much good work and help so many families.</P>
        <P>Nuala was also an executive of the Irish Council for the Status of Women, now the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Towards the end of the 1970s, Nuala became interested in Garret FitzGerald&rsquo;s work with Fine Gael and contested the 1981 election to the D&aacute;il in Dublin South.  She was elected and held her seat in the two elections in the politically turbulent months that followed.</P><Col N="412"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>In many ways the high point of Nuala&rsquo;s career came upon her appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for women&rsquo;s affairs and family law reform in 1982.  She was a strong voice and an advocate for women and equality in the D&aacute;il, in the Government and in public life.</P>
        <P>Nuala played a leading role in the divorce referendum of 1986 and while the referendum was not successful, when one looks back now it is clear she was a politician and a thinker ahead of her time.  Everybody will agree with that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a Minister of State, Nuala succeeded in abolishing the concept of illegitimacy, ensuring that every child was recognised as equal.  It is difficult to believe now that she had to take on that task.  It was a difficult task at the time but she did it and she succeeded.</P>
        <P>In 1987, this House benefited from Nuala&rsquo;s election to the Seanad where she served until her return to the D&aacute;il in 1989.  Despite Fine Gael being out of office, Nuala continued to play an important role through her membership of the Oireachtas committee on women&rsquo;s rights.  She was involved in many seminal reports produced by that committee that led to much change in Irish society during that period.</P>
        <P>In 1992, Nuala retired from politics having served with energy, distinction and determination.  The warmth of the tributes paid to Nuala upon her death from politicians on all sides of the political divide paints a revealing picture of a woman who was respected and admired by all and who was a role model and a source of encouragement to women in politics, regardless of political affiliation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a personal level, Nuala was the first politician I campaigned for as a member of the Women&rsquo;s Political Association.  I recall being drawn to her campaign and her candidacy based on our shared views on equality and women&rsquo;s issues.  Nuala was a trailblazer, and the trail she has set out in politics will never be erased and can only be further developed and progressed.  Indeed, in recent years Nuala said that much work remains to be done.  Much work does remain to be done to ensure there are more women in politics and more attention paid to the issues Nuala cared deeply about but the body of work done by Nuala, and the trailblazer she was, makes that burden all the easier for those of us left behind.</P>
        <P>To Nuala&rsquo;s husband, Brian, her children, Jacqueline, Garrett and Amanda, her sisters, her grandchildren and her wider circle of family and friends, on behalf of Fine Gael and on behalf of women, I want to thank them for sharing Nuala with us.  We are all better for knowing her and working with her, and Ireland is better for her service to this country.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am honoured to have been asked by my group to represent the Independent group in paying tribute to the late Nuala Fennell.  She grew up in Portlaoise and as a Laois man of one remove, I am very proud that county can claim a connection with one of the great forward-looking figures of Irish politics in the second half of the 20th century.</P>
        <P>She was the daughter of an officer in the Garda.  I knew her for many years.  She was one of a formidable group of early feminists.  She gave the impression of owl-like wisdom which she justified by her behaviour and her political activity.  She could get tough, but she was always courteous and honest.  She was the kind of person who gave feminism a good name.  She was a kind of respectable revolutionary.</P>
        <P>I recall when she left the Irish Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement because she felt there was something negative in some of the attitudes towards men.  She always attempted to keep a type of balance in her thoughts and in what she did.</P><Col N="413"/>
        <P>Nuala was taken very seriously, and one can gather that from the attacks on her from the reactionary right.  She was one of a group of people who would be consistently named as representing that kind of progressive tendency, which was rejected and resisted by some.</P>
        <P>She was involved in many organisations including AIM, which has been mentioned, Cherish and the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland.  I had a good deal of contact with her when I was helping to fund-raise for the women&rsquo;s refuge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Her appointment in 1982 was historic.  She was the first Minister of State with responsibility for women&rsquo;s affairs.  If I am correct, that was the first time a ministerial post was created specifically to look after the status of women.  That was historic, but her interest did not end with the end of her active political career.  She was former president of the European Parliament Former Members Association and kept in touch with her colleagues and friends.  We used to see her occasionally because eventually she had a career as a political lobbyist.</P>
        <P>She was a decent sort.  She was somebody who will be very much missed in these days in politics when the apparently modest virtues of decency and honesty are sadly lacking.  I believe she will leave a gap in national life and in the life of Fine Gael, her party, to which she was devoted.</P>
        <P>I was abroad when Nuala died and only learned of her death subsequently.  It gave me a considerable shock to learn that somebody of my own generation who had fought a similar fight had died, in my opinion long before her time.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>I also recognise, as others have done, the presence of members of her family in the Visitors Gallery.  On behalf of the Independent Members, I extend our sympathy to them.  I also transmit the respect, honour and value we place on the work done by Nuala Fennell.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend sympathy to the late Nuala Fennell&rsquo;s family and remember her here today.  It is appropriate that we remember her as a great campaigner.  I remember her as a great social reformer.  The first time I came across her, as was the case for many people, was when she started to write in newspapers and the women&rsquo;s press which at the time was not particularly radical in its content.  However, one of the things she did was to bring issues into the mainstream.  Sometimes we underestimate the power and impact of well written and campaigning journalism.  That is one of the many things Nuala Fennell demonstrated in the course of her very active political life.  We owe her huge credit for all the work she did.</P>
        <P>The sense of the period &mdash; the 1970s and 1980s &mdash; when Nuala Fennell was most prominent comes back to us when we revisit some of the issues, struggles and controversies of the time.  We speak about Women&rsquo;s Aid and the organisations in which she was involved and established and which were portrayed and regarded by many at the time as being marginal.  It was a huge struggle to get notice for the incredible and vital work they had to do.  It is a great tribute to her and others, but Nuala Fennell, in particular, brought issues into the mainstream through journalism and political discourse.  She, in turn, raised them in Parliament.  As Senator Fitzgerald stated, we are inclined to brush aside some of her achievements such as abolishing the concept of illegitimacy and wonder how could we conceivably have had such a thing in our laws, but we did.  We forget how difficult and what a struggle it was at the time for these issues to be confronted to bring about change.  Nuala Fennell taught us that when people were steadfast and tenacious, they could bring about change.</P>
        <P>At some stage we will assess whether we have made a contribution or have been in a position to bring about change, however marginal.  I am sure colleagues will agree that we have to conclude that Nuala Fennell really did make a difference.  In her autobiography she engaged in a rather modest assessment of her achievements.  As a politician, she really did achieve <Col N="414"/>things.  She demonstrated that, with the tenacity political and social campaigners need, change could be brought about, even in an environment which looked hopeless, difficult and cold.  I remember Nuala Fennell as a reformer, a very strong and great Irishwoman and a great politician as a Deputy for Dublin South, an area in which I have an interest.  I note the presence in the Visitors Gallery of members of her family, to whom we convey our condolences and sympathy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Green Party &mdash; Comhaontas Glas, I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the family of the late Nuala Fennell and her political colleagues in Fine Gael.  Nuala Fennell&rsquo;s entry into public life and a position of political prominence coincided with my first experience as a voter.  I remember her as being one of the new breed of women entering Irish politics.  She was part of that vanguard.  That the advances made in the early 1980s seem to have slowed down since is regrettable.  Nuala Fennell made the breach and used the opportunity presented by her involvement in public life to achieve significant legislative change.  The legislation annulling the legal concept of illegitimacy is something with which anyone involved in public life would be very glad to be associated and will forever be associated with her efforts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has also been commented on that her contribution to public life went beyond elected office in both Houses.  Her contribution preceded her election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and membership of this House and continued after her retirement from elected politics in 1992.  Her experience stands as a template in respect of how all citizens can and should involve themselves in public life.  It is about addressing issues of concern, making these concerns known and working collectively to ensure they are addressed.  Not many people involved in public life have attained the status or gained the experience of Nuala Fennell in terms of how Irish society can be changed for the better.  She will be missed as a result of this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in expressing sympathy to the family of the late Nuala Fennell who served in this House from 1987 to 1989.  She certainly loved her years in the Seanad, although she was glad to win back her D&aacute;il seat in 1989 in which she served until 1992.  As many others have stated, she was part of the irreversible movement at the time in highlighting the status of women in Ireland and making it a political issue for the first time.  She spoke about the loneliness she felt when she entered the D&aacute;il for the first time which was almost a male club.  Many female Members of the Seanad have told me that they had similar feelings when they were elected, particularly during their first few months in the House.  I do not think, however, that it prevented her from doing her work, as she was an excellent politician.  She listened and acted on the problems encountered.</P>
        <P>Nuala Fennell made an outstanding contribution as a politician in increasing awareness of domestic violence and the necessity to provide shelter, through the Women&rsquo;s Aid movement, for battered wives and those at the receiving end of male domestic violence.  As Minister of State with responsibility for women&rsquo;s affairs, with a budget of approximately only &pound;50,000, she made a tremendous difference in the Department.  She had no office and no blueprint, but she certainly made up for this with her enthusiasm.  She was a wonderful politician.  I express my sincere sympathy to her family gathered here today.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I extend my sympathy to Brian and the family of the late Nuala Fennell.  When I met her here on the day set aside for female parliamentarians, I asked her if she would be good enough to meet me for a cup of coffee because I had always admired her.  She said she would love to and it is a matter of regret that I did not have the opportunity.  As a young mother, I will always remember her trailblazing and that she was never afraid to speak <Col N="415"/>out on issues in which many were not interested.  She was a role model for me.  She spoke with dignity, respect and honesty, qualities that many involved in public life do not have.  She had all three.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very glad to have an opportunity to pay tribute to my late colleague Nuala Fennell.  I was proud and honoured to walk into this House in 1987 alongside her.  At that stage she was already a political institution.  During the course of the Seanad election in 1987 I met her on many occasions on what was a long and winding road.  I suppose we struck up a friendship through that unusual route.  During our time in politics together, both in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, I hope we had a close bond.</P>
        <P>I would describe her as nothing less than a magnificent person &mdash; honest, decent, kind and generous.  She held strong opinions, but did so with a smile.  She took every political issue seriously but she also had the ability not to take herself too seriously, and that was a marvellous attribute of hers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">She contributed very effectively, not only to the legislative positioning in the Oireachtas in this country but within the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party where she played a significant role.  On an almost weekly basis at the parliamentary party meetings, she certainly had a great deal to say.  She had the ability to inform us of her views, to present her argument coherently and calmly, but also to respect every person, not only in the parliamentary party but in the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I certainly miss her.  In one sense it could be said that over the course of her last few years when she suffered illness, she showed a very different side of a person who was serene, calm and accepting.</P>
        <P>I read her autobiography which, of course, was completed by her husband.  If I am paraphrasing it correctly, the last line in the book is Nuala simply saying, &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we a lovely life?&rdquo;  That speaks volumes of her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">She had a lovely life.  Her life impacted marvellously on this country.  Tens of thousands of people have benefited from the life of Nuala Fennell.  All those of us who were in some way touched by her remember her with fondness.  She certainly was a political institution the likes of which we will not see too many times in this Oireachtas.  May she rest in peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I too extend my sympathy to her family on Nuala&rsquo;s death.  While I did not ever meet her, I had the honour of working with her daughter Jacqueline on a gender and equality committee for Fine Gael a number of years ago.</P>
        <P>Looking back on her life, and having the opportunity to read her autobiography as many others did here, what really struck me is that I completely agree she was a trailblazer for women, not only in politics but in the torch she held for women in everyday life.</P>
        <P>What I admire immensely about her as a politician is she was clearly mission driven as a social reformer.  Her seminal work in areas like Women&rsquo;s Aid in getting rid of that awful term &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo; made an immense difference to people&rsquo;s lives.  It continues to make an immense difference for the amount of women who have come to me since I became a politician who need help in the area of women&rsquo;s refuge and around the whole issue of domestic violence.  She was a true champion and we must remember the work we may continue today has come from her.</P>
        <P>Mission driven in that way is clearly the best type of politician to vote for.  When one comes into politics, one can sway this way and that, but to be that clear about her role as a politician is a lesson for us all and is truly admirable, and it is fair to say her legacy lives on.</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P>When I read her book, it helped me as a woman in politics.  It is interesting what Senator Cummins stated.  Sometimes you have feelings as a woman in politics and often you do not know is it just yourself or do others have them as well.  Reading that book really did help me, especially when she spoke about the whole world of male politics and how in many cases it presented blocks to her as opposed to encouragement, and yet she continued because she believed in her mission.  She knew why she had chosen this path.  It was a lucky stroke for Ireland that she and former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, came together at that point in history because that was good for women&rsquo;s lot.</P>
        <P>Clearly, she was a formidable woman.  It cannot be easy for family to follow in her footsteps, but at the same time what an honour it is because it is a true inspiration for a family to have had such a mother, wife and grandmother.  For me, it also has been really good to hear what everybody else has said about her here today.  It is an opportunity again to reflect on how important it is to have a mission in politics.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is an honour to have this opportunity to pay a brief tribute to Nuala Fennell.  I welcome to the Visitors Gallery her husband Brian, her son Garrett, her daughter Jackie &mdash; unfortunately, her other daughter Amanda cannot be with us today &mdash; her grandchildren Katie, Ian and Eveline, her daughter-in-law Dara and her sister Bernie.</P>
        <P>I got to know Nuala really through her son Garrett and, indeed, her brother Michael.  She had a distinguished career, as has been said and given great testimony to here by so many speakers, in the D&aacute;il between 1981 and 1987 and again from 1989 to 1992, and in this House from 1987 to 1989.  As Minister of State for women&rsquo;s affairs, as has been said by so many, she was a great champion of women&rsquo;s rights and, to quote <i>The Irish Times</i>, she was, &ldquo;Courageous, determined and with an original mind&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I have been reminded that &mdash; from what I heard from her I believe it &mdash; she liked this House very much, both as a Member and in bringing legislation before it, particularly the Status of Children Bill 1986 in which she believed the Seanad really came into its own.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I loved the stories she told in her book about the Seanad campaign in 1987 and her journeys through fields, yards, marts, funerals, shops and so many workplaces.  Of course, coming from where I come, I was particularly taken by her little yarn about not having time to linger at Ladies&rsquo; View on her way to Kenmare. I hope next year another visitor will have time to linger there and to go on to Dina and Glena where Victoria enjoyed afternoon tea &mdash; I refer to Victoria&rsquo;s great-great-granddaughter when she comes, please God.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As has been said, Nuala was an extremely kind, nice and courteous person at all times, and yet she had a steely will.  She knew what was necessary to achieve and she saw it through.  Of course, she had a life outside of politics.  She was a noted journalist before she entered politics and a successful public affairs consultant when she left it.  She is, and will be, missed.

	<P>If I can add to what has been said already, and I adopt all the points that have been made, Nuala Fennell was an outstanding contributor to Irish society and to Irish politics.  She described in her autobiography why she was attracted to Dr. Garret FitzGerald&rsquo;s Fine Gael.  It was his liberalism and enthusiasm for change and a better Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is worth noting that she entered politics in a difficult period of the 1980s and she was part of that period which represented the constitutional crusade.  We remember the term &ldquo;fiscal rectitude&rdquo; and a new approach to Northern Ireland where there was an effort at a meeting of minds.  It is important that context is understood.</P><Col N="417"/>
        <P Just="Left">She wrote of her first branch meeting &mdash; her first contact with Fine Gael was in Blackrock in my constituency &mdash; and described the shock-waves from the assembled men.  I think she represented a new era for Irish women in politics.</P>
        <P>She also represented something else.  It was during her period in representing Dublin South that Fine Gael attained three seats, a feat which was only repeated last year, albeit on a temporary basis but to be revisited.</P>
        <P>I add my voice to the tributes, and my regards to the family here, Brian and the extended family.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris has already spoken on behalf of the Independents but I did not want to let this opportunity pass without expressing my memories of Nuala.  I knew the family, and her father, way back in the 1950s.  When I met Nuala, I did not realise at that stage she was the daughter of her father.  I came to know her and the family, including Garrett, Michael and others.  There is a lovely quote which I have often heard and used before: &ldquo;Whether you believe you can or whether you believe you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;  The difference was that Nuala believed she could change things.  However, she changed them in a manner different from the way many others would have changed them and she did so with humour and by getting people who liked to be in her company involved.  She was committed to the things in which she believed.  She believed very much in those who were not getting a fair deal in the Ireland of the 1970s and 1980s.  She focused, in particular, on the position of women and we have been reminded today of some of the things she did.</P>
        <P>I wish to touch on another aspect of her life, that is, the family she reared.  She was very proud of them and with good reason.  I was surprised to hear Senator Fitzgerald state it was 11 months since she had died.  I had not realised that length of time had passed because it seems she is still a part of our lives.  What I remember most about her is her sense of humour and smile.  There was a sense that, even after she had left these Houses, she continued her commitment because there were other things she wished to do and other changes to bring about.  We will remember her in this and the other House.  I never served with her here, but I know those of us who knew her in those days and afterwards will remember her with great fondness.

	<P>I pay tribute to the late Nuala Fennell whom I came to know in the late 1980s.  We both ran for election in the general election of 1989.  I knew her as a very reflective person who pursued and focused on the issues to which she was so committed, in particular, anything to do with women.  Equal opportunity was the main theme.  She was very aware of the lack of women in Leinster House, an issue on which she made many contributions.  I recall being with her at many residents&rsquo; association meetings and during many debates in Dublin South, especially during that general election campaign.  At no time was she ever confrontational.  We were competitive, but she never took me on on any issue; she was always courteous and kind.  She was a beautiful person and a very good politician.  She was a competitor, but she did not use this trait in the way we all do today.  That is what I remember best about her.  She was a lady.  It was very nice to have known her and I am pleased to be associated with the many tributes paid to her today.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

As has been stated, she was a member of the House from 1987 to 1989, having been nominated by the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  She made a great contribution to Irish political life and the Houses of the Oireachtas in her role as a Senator, Deputy and Minister of State.  She will be remembered especially by many for her role in advocating women&rsquo;s rights, for which she was recognised in her appointment as Minister of State with <Col N="418"/>responsibility for women&rsquo;s affairs.  I extend my sincere sympathy to her husband, Brian; her daughters, Jacqueline and Amanda; her son, Garrett, and extended family who are here today on their sad loss.  May she rest in peace.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the opportunity to open the debate on behalf of the Government which has provided considerable and consistent support for carers during the past decade.  Although carers may sometimes believe their work goes unnoticed by the State, their communities and even their families, the important and valuable role played by them in society has been increasingly recognised both at EU level and in Ireland in recent years.  Caring for another person may have a very significant impact on carers and their families.  This is especially true when care is provided on a full-time basis.  Becoming a carer can be a very rewarding experience, but it often means people make great sacrifices, especially when it comes to availing of employment opportunities.  Sometimes these sacrifices are made at the expense of the carer&rsquo;s own health.</P>
        <P>The national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, included several commitments specifically related to carers.  These include commitments to review social welfare payments, consult representative groups and develop training programmes.  In addition, many of the commitments related to older people are relevant to carers such as to maximise the use of community and home-based care and deliver home care packages.  The national action plan for social inclusion also recognises the valuable role played by carers in society, not only in the commitments specifically related to carers, but also in the sections on older people and people with disabilities.</P>
        
      
        <P Just="Left">Who is a carer? Without being too legalistic, it is worth considering who we mean when we refer to carers.  There are a variety of definitions of the word &ldquo;carer&rdquo;.  Current definitions in Ireland stretch from that used in the census, which records people who provide at least one hour of unpaid help per week as carers, to that used for the purposes of qualifying for a social welfare payment, which states that the carer must be providing full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.  Sometimes we use the terms &ldquo;informal carer&rdquo; or &ldquo;family carer&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;informal&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;family&rdquo;, reflects the fact that the relationship between the carer and the care recipient varies with people caring not only for their own family members but also for neighbours or friends.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Whatever we call them and however we define them, the one thing we all have in common is that at some stage in our lives almost all of us will either provide care for another person or receive care.  Each Member will have a family member involved in caring.  The issues surrounding carers and family care in Ireland are relevant to every one of us and are crucial to Ireland, as a nation, socially and economically.  When someone becomes a carer, his or her circumstances can change dramatically - often suddenly - and he or she can find it difficult to cope financially.  The person in need of care is often the main wage earner in the family or the carer <Col N="419"/>is elderly and relies on a pension or other State benefit.  These and many other factors can put a strain on finances and make it difficult to pay even basic utility bills and living costs.  Becoming a carer can have implications for all aspects of a person&rsquo;s life from taxation to transport and from social welfare payments to accessing health services.  Reflecting this, services and supports for carers are delivered by a variety of Departments and bodies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Social Protection and the Health Service Executive provide a range of supports for carers and it is worth highlighting them.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance is the main social assistance payment to provide income support for people who provide older people or people with a disability with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a specified limit.  Persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance also receive the annual respite care grant, the household benefits package and the free travel pass.  In the majority of cases, persons who are being cared for will be in receipt of a payment in their own right and will be entitled to a free travel pass.  This includes anyone aged over 16 who qualifies for disability allowance.</P>
        <P>The 2007 budget provided for new arrangements whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment other than carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit and who provide someone with full-time care and attention could retain their main welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Similarly, people in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance who may have an underlying eligibility for another social welfare payment can transfer to that other payment and continue to receive up to a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  As of December 2009, 48,223 people were in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, an increase of approximately 11% on the previous year.  Of these, 19,132 were in receipt of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and another social welfare payment.  Since March 2005, two carers providing care on a part-time basis in an established pattern have been accommodated on the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This small change can be of significant benefit in helping families cope with the demands of caring.</P>
        <P>Carer&rsquo;s benefit is a payment for people who have made social insurance contributions and who have recently left the workforce to look after someone in need of full-time care and attention.  Recipients can get carer&rsquo;s benefit for up to two years for each person cared for.  By the end of 2009, 1,917 people were in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P>A domiciliary care allowance of &euro;309.50 per month may be paid to the parent or guardian of a child aged under 16 requiring full-time care.  This payment is not means tested and it provides for the additional costs involved in providing care and supervision that is substantially more than normally needed by a child of the same age.  The parents may also be in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>The respite care grant is an annual payment for full-time carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention.  The payment is made regardless of the carer&rsquo;s means but is subject to certain conditions.  People in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit receive the respite care grant each June.  Others who provide full-time care but who are not eligible for carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit may apply for the grant separately each June.</P>
        <P>Free travel is available to people aged 66 or over and who are resident in the State and to people aged under 66 in receipt of certain disability-type social welfare payments or carer&rsquo;s allowance.  It allows them to use public transport and a large number of private bus and ferry services free of charge.  Free travel is provided to those providing care and satisfying the payment condition in recognition of the additional costs which may occur in assisting the care recipient.  The main objective of the free travel scheme administered by the Department is to encourage older people, people with disabilities and carers to remain independent and active in the community.  It is an important income support for carers but, more important, a support in helping them maintain their inclusion in the wider community.  The scheme permits a recipient to travel for free on most CIE public transport services, Luas and a range of services <Col N="420"/>offered by a large number of private operators in various parts of the country.  A free travel customer can also travel for free on cross-Border journeys between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>In addition to this scheme, the Department of Social Protection contributes &euro;1.5 million every year to the rural transport programme, on top of the contribution by the Department of Transport, in recognition of the carriage of free travel customers.  It is acknowledged that such customers benefit from the initiative, especially those who had no access to public transport prior to the setting up of the programme.</P>
        <P>The household benefits package comprises the electricity or gas allowance, the telephone allowance, which may be paid in respect of either a land line or a mobile phone, and the free television licence.  These allowances provide contributions towards an electricity or natural gas or bottled gas refill bill and telephone bill and cover the cost of the television licence each year.  They are applied directly to bills, where applicable.  The package is available to people aged over 70 who are resident in the State and to people aged under 70 in certain circumstances, including carers.  Only one person in a household can qualify for the package at any time.  In some cases, this will be the carer; in others, the person being cared for.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is committed to ensuring that, in addition to the necessary income supports, carers receive a comprehensive range of services to assist in the caring role.  Caring for a relative who has a disability, is frail or is chronically or terminally ill not only requires a wide range of skills but also requires patience and an ability to empathise at times when he or she may be feeling vulnerable, stressed and frustrated.  The role of carer, while it may be rewarding, can be a 24-7 job and caring can extract a great cost, be it emotional, physical or financial, from the person providing that care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the services provided by the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  Home care packages, HCPs, were introduced in 2006 and are tailored to the needs of individuals whose needs cannot be met by mainstream primary, community and continuing care, PCCC, services.  They can range from therapy and nursing support for a few weeks after a hospital stay to ongoing daily visits from a home care assistant to help the client get out of bed, washed and dressed.  HCPs can include a variety of services such as public health nursing, day care, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, home help, home care and respite care, which are shaped around each client&rsquo;s individual needs.  The packages can be provided through a cash grant, which the recipient can use to purchase the care and support he or she needs, or through the organisation of care services by the HSE.  They can also be delivered in partnership between the HSE and certain voluntary providers and can often include a respite element at local level.</P>
        <P>The packages are enhanced supports over and above existing mainstream community services, with the objective of maintaining older people at home and in their communities.  They are also targeted at those at risk of inappropriate admission to long-term care or acute hospitals or those who require discharge home from acute hospitals.  The HSE provides approximately &euro;120 million per annum to cater for approximately 8,700 clients at any one time or approximately 11,500 during a full year.  Last year, I published a report of an evaluation carried out by PA Consulting Group on the home care package initiative.  The independent evaluation found that the HSE was successful in implementing the policy vision to make HCPs a viable option to support a highly dependent cohort.  An additional &euro;10 million was provided in the 2010 budget to expand the HCP initiative nationally.</P>
        <P>Other supports are provided through programmes such as meals on wheels, day care or home help.  Every effort is made to make each service as flexible as possible to meet individual needs. <Col N="421"/> Total home help hours have increased by 25% from 9.1 million hours in 2005 to an estimated 12 million hours in 2010.</P>
        <P>Respite services are an immensely important support for carers.  These can take many different forms and can be a respite for the carer, the person being cared for or a combination of both.  Through these services we are trying to ensure carers can continue to care in a way that benefits their own health and ensures the best quality of life for them and their dependants.  Investment has been made by the provision of more than 21,300 day respite care places, benefiting in excess of an estimated 80,000 people, and more than 750 designated respite care beds, benefiting approximately 19,000 people over a full year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, when living at home is no longer possible, it is equally important that older people have access to the best possible residential care available.  The Government is committed to ensuring that quality nursing home care is available to all who need it.  It is worth mentioning, in passing, the nursing homes support scheme, a fair deal, which addresses issues of access and affordability, and the standards for residential care settings for older people which address the need to improve quality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recently completed a countrywide series of consultation meetings to hear face to face the views of older people, service providers and representative organisations, with a view to the development of a national positive ageing strategy.  I am pleased to say we have received submissions from the Carers Association, Care Alliance Ireland and Caring for Carers.  Their views and the information they provide will help us in the formation of the strategy.  At all of these meetings, I heard an immense amount of valuable information on a broad range of issues to be considered in the context of the new strategy.  In due course, it is intended to publish a report on the consultation process to highlight the issues which older people and service providers have been bringing to my attention.</P>
        <P>At the public consultation meetings, participants have suggested how services and programmes can be improved and have given views on what works well and on what could be done differently or in a better way.  In particular, they highlighted how service delivery could be enhanced in the light of current resource constraints.  While some localised issues have been raised, in general the themes that arose during the public consultation meetings are broadly consistent with those outlined in the written submissions received.  The top five priority themes that emerged from the submissions were health and social care, 64%; transport, 40%; social inclusion, 36%; housing, 33%; and income and pensions, 27%.  The national positive ageing strategy will set out a common framework for the development of operational plans by Departments.  These will clearly set out their objectives relating to older people, as well as the development of ongoing mechanisms designed to monitor progress and identify challenges facing older people in future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Carers can be any age, from an elderly person looking after his or her spouse, to a teenager caring for a parent or sibling.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, recently launched the carer of the year awards, which include a special award for a young carer.  He was impressed on meeting the winner of last year&rsquo;s award, a young woman who has looked after her mother since an accident left her disabled and needing to use a wheelchair.  Young carers have issues particular to them.  I wish to refer to a recently published report on the lives of young carers in Ireland.  The Study of Young Carers in the Irish Population, undertaken by the Child and Family Research Centre at the National University of Ireland, Galway, was launched at the Carers Association annual conference.  The report found that children are involved in a broad continuum of caring in a wide variety of situations, such as helping with domestic chores and general care, including help with feeding, medication and mobility.  It also found that some young carers also provided psychological or emotional support or provided <Col N="422"/>intimate care, involving toileting, dressing and bathing.  Young carers also find themselves helping to seek support from service providers, translating and interpreting information, helping with paying bills and with post or telephone calls.</P>
        <P>This report is the first national qualitative study of young carers in Ireland and gives an insight into the lives of children and young people who provide care in the home and uncovers the reality of their situation.  While the report is preliminary and exploratory, it marks an important milestone in improving our understanding of the positive and negative impacts for children who are involved in caring and makes a positive contribution to policy development and debate on this issue.  The authors of the report also said they found it encouraging that many of the young carers or their households received supports from the State, whether in the form of home help or respite care, for example.  Dr. Allyn Fives, a co-author of the report from NUIG, in presenting the study&rsquo;s key findings noted that while caring for a family member can have positive impacts for a young person such as greater maturity and compassion as well as closeness to the person cared for by the young person, it must also be recognised that there can be negative impacts, including absence from school, feelings of social isolation, impacts on health, and experiences of boredom, worry and resentment.</P>
        <P>I have detailed for Members the various payments and supports available for carers.  These indicate that the State and the Government are acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason that when resources were available we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for all those who are reliant on the State for income support.  Over the past decade, weekly payment rates to carers have increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit, half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  Where people are caring for more than one person they receive a higher payment.  This equates to the personal rate for a person with the same means who is caring for one person plus 50% of the maximum personal rate.  Recipients with children also receive a qualified child increase in respect of each child.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since the introduction of the carer&rsquo;s allowance in 1990, payments to carers have been increased and expanded.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  As a result, even with the reductions announced in last year&rsquo;s budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carer&rsquo;s allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.  The means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to &euro;1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  The free travel scheme, which I mentioned, has been significantly improved and enhanced in recent years, most notably following the abolition of peak time restrictions in late 2006.</P>
        <P>Carers were identified as a priority theme under the economic and social disadvantage category in the dormant accounts allocation for 2007.  The focus of the carers&rsquo; measure is to provide training to assist carers in undertaking their caring role.  The Department of Social Protection is the lead Department for this measure and the funding is being channelled through the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Pobal administers the measure on behalf of the Department and is responsible for the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the programme.  Applications were assessed by Pobal and 12 groups were approved for funding, in December 2008, totalling &euro;1.48 million.  The draw-down of funding takes place between 2009 and 2011.  The training in most instances <Col N="423"/>commenced in September 2009.  The grants range in size, from the Carers Association grant of more than &euro;500,000 and the Caring for Carers grant of almost &euro;250,000, to smaller grants to groups such as the Rosses community development project in Donegal or the Ballinrobe family resource centre in Mayo.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the needs of carers.  I also fully understand that a wide range of other groups, such as unemployed people, parents, pensioners and people with disabilities, depend on the welfare budget for vital support.  I want to assure the House that the Government, in the context of a very tough budgetary environment, will continue to do its utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in society.</P>
        <P>The requirements of the Department of Social Protection highlight the importance of stable finances.  Over the next five years, the Department of Social Protection will spend over &euro;100 billion.  All of this must be raised by taxation or by short-term borrowing.  Obviously, any borrowing involved must be repaid by the taxpayer at some time in the future.  It is clear that if the Government did not ensure that we had a sustainable financial situation, that as the largest single Vote, the Department of Social Protection and its clients would be the first to suffer.  This Government will of course ensure we provide this money and this support.  It is up to other parties to explain how their policies would maintain the same level of commitment to social welfare clients.</P>
        <P>The Government is proud of its unrivalled record in increasing the level of social welfare payments.  Over the past 12 years, we have increased pension rates by about 120%, unemployment benefits by almost 130% and child benefit payments by over 330%.  The cost of living has increased by approximately 40% over the same period.  We extended coverage, removed barriers and increased entitlements, such that the level and extent of social support payments has been transformed beyond recognition.  Continuing to reflect the trend of recent years and re-affirming Government&rsquo;s commitment to all those in need of support, some &euro;20.9 billion will be spent by Government in 2010 on social welfare provision, &euro;500 million or 2.45% more than 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the economy, following eight consecutive quarters of contraction, the latest GDP data show an increase in economic activity during the first quarter of this year, signalling the beginning of Ireland&rsquo;s emergence from the deepest recession ever recorded here.  More recent statistics, including soft data, point to a continuation of growth in the second quarter also, so the economic outlook for this year in GDP terms is somewhat better than projected last December.  For the year as a whole, an average GDP growth rate of the order of 1% is now anticipated.  The exporting sector, especially parts of the multinational sector, has been the driving force behind the recent expansion of activity.  Excluding the profits generated from multinational exports means that GNP is likely to decline by around 0.75% for 2010 as a whole.  On the assumption that international activity gains momentum and that further competitiveness improvements are achieved, a strengthening of activity can reasonably be expected next year and beyond.  The budget day forecast of GDP growth of 3% in 2011, remains achievable.</P>
        <P>While there are challenges facing the entire economy, including controlling Government spending, there are significant challenges facing the Irish pension system.  In particular, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  There are currently six workers for every pensioner, and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than 2:1 by 2050.  Increasing State pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pension system and also maintain the value of the State pension at 35% of average earnings.  People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 89 years for women and 83 years for men.  People will still, therefore, be <Col N="424"/>spending at least the same amount of time in retirement as they are today, even with a later State pension age.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Therefore, as announced as part of the national pensions framework, the State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the removal of the State pension &mdash; transition, thereby standardising State pension age at 66 years.  This means that the last group of people to receive the State pension &mdash; transition will be those who reach 65 years of age in 2013.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.  The details and timeframes for these changes are set out in the national pensions framework, which was published on 3 March 2010.  An implementation group chaired by the Department of Social Protection has been established to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the necessary reforms into operation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the changes being made to State pensions, both employees and employers must be encouraged to change their attitudes to working longer.  At the level of the workplace, employers must seek to retain older employees and create working conditions which will make working longer both attractive and feasible for the older worker.  Where this is not possible and people leave paid employment before State pension age, they will be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment until they become eligible for a State pension, as is the current situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This framework will have an impact on carers.  People who leave the workforce for periods spent caring can have gaps in their insurance records which can affect their entitlement to a State contributory pension at age 66.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, introduced in April 1994, allows for periods spent providing full-time care to children up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person to be taken into account for pension purposes.  It does not provide social welfare payments while homemaking.  Persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant may engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home for up to 15 hours per week and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention for the purposes of the schemes.  This means that where a carer remains in employment, he or she will continue to pay the appropriate social insurance contribution.  Also, any person, including a carer, may pay voluntary contributions once he or she satisfies certain qualifying conditions.  The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the homemaker's scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least ten contributions on his or her record from the time of entering insurance until pension age is reached, must also be satisfied.</P>
        
        <P>People who qualify for payments such as carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit may, subject to conditions, qualify for credited contributions for the period they receive the payment.  As part of the national pensions framework, homemaker&rsquo;s credits will be introduced for new pensioners from 2012, with backdating to 1994, to replace the current homemaker&rsquo;s disregard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For many of us, especially as we get older, our first choice is to remain living at home in the communities we belong to and are familiar with.  Government policy is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where appropriate, the health service also supports access to quality long-term residential care.  This <Col N="425"/>policy approach is renewed and developed in the partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  I understand that people requiring care face particular challenges daily in their lives and that family carers have to make sacrifices to look after their loved ones.  I have set out in the foregoing the very definite steps the Government has taken to ensure these vulnerable groups are protected to the greatest extent possible.  The Government is well aware of and values the contribution made by carers.  The actions of Government in enhancing provisions for carers in recent years reflect that fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <?oasys _cl14- ?><Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  Carers are the unsung heroes and the poor relations in the health system.  There are a total of 161,000 family carers, 40,000 of whom are providing full-time care for more than 400,000 people with disabilities.  Last week we witnessed the very profound protest and lobbying by people who are disabled and their very strong carers.  While the Minister of State has made a very understanding and sensitive contribution, I cannot agree with her that carers are being supported to the extent they require.  The biggest worry for the carers on that protest to whom I spoke was that the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance or respite grant would be removed or cut.  I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment that this allowance will not be interfered with in any way.  The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance is a measly sum of &euro;106 per week.  Such carers provide up to 60 hours&rsquo; care per week, which is almost full-time care in the home for people with disabilities.  This is very good value for money.  If this care were to be sourced in the private sector, &euro;106 per week would provide five hours&rsquo; full-time care.</P>
        <P>I have had many conversations with the Carers Association which is appalled at the indignity inflicted on some of its members for the sake of saving a few euro.  Community health and community care services are being cut left, right and centre and care-givers are experiencing anxiety in this regard.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue of incontinence pads because this is a grave worry.  This was illustrated in an edition of &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; television programme where one could see the anxiety inflicted on carers.  An incontinence manager is someone who rations the number of incontinence pads for use by elderly people.  I know about this because people have come to me in my constituency about it.  They have told me they are not allowed a sufficient number of incontinence pads for the use and comfort of elderly relatives.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 6 July there was a reference to incontinence managers who were asking carers to bring in wet nappies in order that they could be weighed to see if they were managing resources properly.  I find that extraordinary.  This problem was well documented on the programme &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; by carers who spoke about the lengths of time identified in the draft HSE guidelines which I hope will never be introduced.  A stopwatch will be used to monitor the length of time it takes to get an elderly person up in the morning.  A period of ten minutes is allocated for this task.  What happens if the elderly person has had a bad night and is feeling vulnerable and unwell?  A period of 15 minutes has been allocated for the taking of a shower.  It takes a long time to get an elderly person from a wheelchair onto a shower chair.  If he or she has brittle bones, we must consider the amount of time it takes to dry and dress him or her.  It is nice that a person has ten minutes for breakfast, but it does not augur well if he or she must be fed.  There is no allocation of time for housework such as taking out ashes and setting a fire.  I know home helps who do this, but no time is allowed for it.  There is no time to go to the shop if someone needs a litre of milk.  The public health nurses association has come out against the draft guidelines and I hope the Minister of State listens to it.  She is a caring person who is both practical and logical.  We should remember that if people are kept in their homes, it will save the State billions of euro.</P><Col N="426"/>
        <P>Trinity College commissioned a report entitled, No Place Like Home &mdash; Study of Domiciliary Care Services for Older People.  It documents that it is nine times more expensive to keep a child with a severe disability in hospital or in an institution than at home.  The Jack and Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation funds its activities by recycling mobile phones.  I have sent mobile phones to it.  Some 35 children will reach the age of four years, the cut-off point, beyond which the organisation does not have enough funds to extend the service.  These children are not sure if they will receive support.  A gentleman in Roscommon spoke about his fears.  He benefits from nursing care two nights a week, which means he and his wife can sleep for those two nights.  They would not have this without the support of the Jack and Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation.  We know that if one does not get enough sleep, one cannot cope during the day.  Many of the families affected are in terror and living in fear.  They do not know how they will survive.</P>
        <P>I referred to the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The Minister of State referred to 19,000 wonderful people.  In 2007 the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and respite care grants were allocated in recognition of the great work they do.  They are a unique group which provides tremendous value.  I ask the Minister of State to give us such a commitment.  The biggest fear of the Carers Association is that the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and the respite care grant will be cut.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to young carers.  In that regard, I welcome the report of Dr. Allyn Fives.  The young people concerned provide care before they go to school and are socially isolated.  I warmly welcome the understanding of the Minister of State of the problems faced by this group and ask that she consider them.</P>
        <P>I refer to respite care services.  The Minister of State attended a public meeting in Athlone and witnessed our fabulous centre, Loughloe House, which will be closed.  Now that it is to be closed, there will be no respite care services in the Athlone area.  The Minister of State has said the only way to support those who provide care is to give them a break in order that their mental and physical health can recover and they can continue caring.  Two private beds are being sought to meet demand in the entire Athlone area.  Heretofore, there was a long waiting list to enter Loughloe House or St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  Two beds are being sought in the Mullingar area, while the number of beds in St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital is to be reduced from 190 to 50.  I ask the Minister of State to put her money where her mouth is.  If she is serious about acknowledging the valuable work done by carers, there must be respite care services available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the late Nuala Fennell.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that we are having a debate on a group of people who must fight very hard to have their voices heard.  I welcome the many carers in the Visitors Gallery.  I also welcome the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>I wish to recount a story that sticks in my mind.  It occurred during the general election campaign in 2007 when I called to the door of a house while out canvassing and spoke to a woman who told me she did not work outside the home anymore because her mother was ill.  She had given up her job to care for her.  She asked me to come in and meet her mother.  She told me her mother did not receive many callers and would like to say hello to me.  She brought me to a downstairs room that had been converted into a bedroom for her mother who was lying on the bed and not moving or speaking.  She explained that her mother had become quite ill during the previous year and that there were many days when she did not say or move much.  She took care of her mother to the best of her ability.  I asked her if she ever got a break or received many visitors.  She said no one called to the house.  She told me I might think her mother could not hear me but if I said hello, she would tell her later that I had called.  I left the house and walked down the driveway.  I was profoundly moved by what I had seen and <Col N="427"/>struck by the thought which has remained with me ever since that there were so many quiet heroes living in our communities.  We do not often give sufficient time to or have sufficient regard for them, through no one&rsquo;s fault, as we all have busy lives to live and have to get on with other things.  There are many competing demands on our time.  While I am conscious the Minister of State has many demands on her time and budget, it struck me that these are the quiet heroes, about whom films are seldom made or books written, but society could not survive without them.  The Government would not be able to deliver its care programme or develop the society it seeks to develop without the contribution of carers.  It is important that we are having this debate in the Chamber, as it is important to highlight the role they play.  We must make provision for them, as we could not survive without their contribution.</P>
        <P>Many welcome changes have occurred in our society and Government policy in the past few years.  What drives Government policy is the concept that people must be supported to remain in their homes for as long as possible.  There are advantages to this, in that the benefits in respect of quality of life and of care are known.  Similarly, it is known that it contributes in a meaningful way to the physical and psychological well-being of the person with disabilities.  Moreover, one now can see how quickly hospitals try to get people back home as an infection control measure.  One must be honest that in trying to keep people at home for as long as possible, economic advantages also accrue to the State.</P>
        <P>In realising such a policy, the role of carers is essential and I wish to make the case briefly for maintaining, at a minimum, the supports that are in place for carers at present.  Moreover, the future should be planned and provided for through the publication of the national carers strategy.  I will repeat neither the issues raised by Senator McFadden nor the statistics she has provided.  However, the commitment that was provided for in Towards 2016 to develop a national carers strategy gave great hope to that group of people and I regret it has not been possible to publish it.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this decision.  I am aware of the economic constraints and one must be clear that publishing something does not mean that a commitment is being given to its immediate implementation.  However, it would demonstrate the State&rsquo;s aspirations and ambitions for the future and that it is prepared to plan for and to carve out a path for that future.  Such aspirations are something of which to be proud and not something to be worried or anxious about having out in the public domain.  Consequently, I ask the Minister of State to give consideration to this point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am highly conscious that Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments in recent years have put in place terrific supports for carers and it will be important to build on and continue such efforts.  The Minister of State spoke of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and in particular regarding the introduction of the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  This was highly important and it also will be important to maintain both the carer&rsquo;s allowance and the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, even though the State faces really tough economic times.  I welcome the commitment given in the Chamber today by the Minister of State when she stated: &ldquo;I want to assure the House that the Government, in the context of a very tough budgetary environment, will continue to do its utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in Irish society.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>While I am aware there are many demands, I ask the Minister of State to give particular regard to this group of people.  I do not mean this in any disrespectful way to anyone else who is obliged to seek financial support from the State through other allowances but there is one clear difference between such assistance and the allowances received by carers.  The latter make a contribution to the State in return for the allowance it provides to them.  They make an <Col N="428"/>economic contribution and this sets them apart from everyone else who receives an allowance.  I do not mean this in any disrespectful way but it is important to make this point.  Moreover, in return for the money the Government provides to carers for their contribution to the economy, the State makes savings of multiples of that amount.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the habitual residence condition, which is causing severe hardship.  There are cases of well-meaning people who leave whatever lives they have established abroad to return home to provide care for their relatives.  I repeat that it is extremely important to continue to provide respite and that the existing provisions be built on.  Unless such supports are put in place, it will not be possible to maintain at home the people concerned.  It therefore becomes a false economy whereby for the sake of saving a few euro for a couple of months, it will end up costing the State a great deal more further down the road.  Moreover, it takes away from the quality of life of the person with a disability that it had been possible to put in place in the first place.  Consequently, it is completely counter-productive, does not make sense economically and does not help to realise the underlying policy of assisting people to stay at home for as long as possible.</P>
        <P>Concerns have arisen in respect of home care packages and my office has been contacted frequently by people who have become concerned on finding their needs are increasing and that they need a little additional support.  Such people are afraid to make contact to ask for such support because they fear becoming the subject of a review at which their existing supports will be examined.  The story that has come back to them is that rather than resulting in an increase or enhancement of the support, every review thus far has resulted in a diminution of that support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I again ask the Minister of State to take this point on board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I greatly welcome the much needed report on young carers, which raises serious issues for Members, not least with regard to child well-being issues.  I am highly conscious that it also is very difficult for those people for whom young people are caring.  Such people are conscious that they are asking their sons or daughters to do things they never dreamed they would be obliged to ask of them.  They always had seen themselves in their roles as parents or as the people who would provide the care, rather than being its recipient.  This brings its own difficulties.  As society ages, an increasing number of older people are adopting the role of carers.  It also is beginning to become evident that, for example, in the area of people with intellectual disability, some people with intellectual disability are becoming the carer for older parents, which brings with it its own issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to practical supports, apart from financial or respite assistance, whereby a commitment was given to training.  Carers are asked to undertake practices, procedures and aspects of care that no one who was employed to carry out such tasks would do without the requisite training, whether it be in respect of manual handling or safe lifting.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Corrigan anticipated my first remarks, which were to the effect that the tributes paid earlier to the late Nuala Fennell constitute a highly appropriate context in which to have this series of statements.  I wish to front-load my acknowledgement that this Minister of State is decent and that the economy is bad.  Having got that out of the way, I will review the present position.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech contained some interesting stuff, as well as a certain amount of padding and public relations spin.  As for free <Col N="429"/>travel, everyone is entitled to it.  I will be getting it at the end of this month and consequently, there is no need to congratulate anyone on that score.  That is an old chestnut.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As for home care packages, there is much concern in this regard.  They are available for the securing of the services of commercial companies and this often is unsatisfactory.  The employees of such concerns may not be able to speak English properly or may not have an understanding of the condition and it is a monetary transaction which varies.  I raised this serious question on the Order of Business in some detail on 19 November 2009.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s advisers might look up this contribution because it was in the context of a particular case that was drawn to my attention.  At the time I noted that the National Economic and Social Forum had stated that care workers were sent into people&rsquo;s homes without being the subject of Garda checks and that the HSE had confirmed this was the case.  Moreover, private companies had acknowledged that they had never been inspected and that there was poor or no supervision of staff.  When I sent a copy of my contribution on the Order of Business to the woman who wrote to me, she replied by sending me details of how the situation had deteriorated further.  She concluded by expressing her gratitude to me for taking up the matter but that she would appreciate if I were to avoid giving full details about her sister, as the family believed she would be boycotted by the agencies and that they were all getting older.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State continued her contribution by discussing social services, meals on wheels, day care, home help and so on.  However, these services are routinely removed and I wish to discuss this a little further.  As for respite service, the Minister of State is aware of the demonstrations outside the gates of Leinster House in recent days.  All Members heard the agonising stories of the impact on carers, for example, in Galway on foot of the additional &euro;2 million that the HSE tried to slice off the budget of the Brothers of Charity and what this would do to both carers and the cared for.  As I stated in respect of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill, Members ought to concern themselves with the children in such situations and that the welfare of the child should be paramount.  In respect of policy on this area, the welfare of both the carer and cared for should be the primary concern.  At the end of her speech the Minister of State said: &ldquo;This Government is well aware of, and values, the contribution made by carers.&rdquo;  While it is okay to say that, we ask her to demonstrate this, even in these difficult times.  There are 161,000 carers in the State, 40,000 of whom are providing full-time care.  Their impact is to save the State &euro;2.8 billion per year.  The Minister of State should compare the money paid to carers &ndash; it is paid quite grudgingly and every effort is made to restrict payments &ndash; with the awards made in legal cases where compensation is sought for devastating injury that might replicate some of the conditions of people being cared for.</P>
        <P>Senator Corrigan mentioned, in a quite delicate and understanding way, the failure to publish the national carers strategy.  Will the Minister of State commit to its publication and state the date on which it will be published?  Will she retain the half-rate carer&rsquo;s payment and the respite care grant?  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme continues not to recognise time spent caring before 1994.  Will the Minister of State retain the home care packages at their current value?</P>
        <P>Let me consider the impact of the habitual residence condition on family carers.  This condition does not recognise the unique position of family carers returning to Ireland to provide care and, therefore, it discriminates against them unfairly.  I have been asked by the Carers Association to urge the Minister for Social Protection to waive the condition in respect of persons returning home from abroad to provide full-time care for a family member.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be kind enough to pass on my request.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision of care is of real service to the State.  The application of the habitual residence condition causes great and unnecessary difficulty.  It also causes financial hardship for people <Col N="430"/>who return from abroad.  One should bear in mind that those affected have not chosen caring as a career.  It is a task they have been forced to do by family circumstances.  One ought to remember that the action of carers serves to take pressure off long-time respite facilities, hospital wards, etc.</P>
        <P>In 2009, 35 Irish people were denied grants on the basis of the habitual residence condition.  The condition was put into effect to protect us against welfare tourism.  I accept this but the condition does not always act as desired; it can act against the interests of Irish citizens.  Consider the case of Paul, for example, who returned from the Untied States in 2009 to care for his elderly parents.  His mother had Parkinson&rsquo;s disease while his father had M&eacute;ni&egrave;re&rsquo;s disease and both needed full-time care.  Paul has a property in the United States and, for that reason, was denied any support.  He has no income and is living on a small amount of savings.  Since he is now living with his parents, the home help hours the parents had have been withdrawn.  The authorities give with one hand and take away with another.  This is wrong and unfair.  The home help co-ordinators assured Paul some of the home help hours would be reinstated if he returned to the United States, in other words, if he broke up the family.  Instead of paying, the Department is saying it will withdraw benefits unless Paul goes back to the United States.  Paul now feels that coming back to Ireland to look after his elderly parents has militated against their interests and he is considering returning home.  The welfare of those cared for should be paramount.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One&rsquo;s centre of interest has a bearing on one&rsquo;s eligibility for an allowance.  This is a very complex matter given that so many people took properties abroad, for one reason or another, during the boom years of the Celtic tiger.  Consider the case of Brendan, for example.  He returned from Spain early this year to give full-time care to his mother, who has Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  She was refused the carer&rsquo;s allowance because his centre of interest was deemed to be in Spain, even though the property he owns there is a small holiday apartment and the business he leased there for five years has been wound up.  The man lives at home with his mother and has no income.  That is the reality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One must consider the length of time it takes for the Department to make a decision or consider an appeal.  Terry, for example, came back to Ireland from the United Kingdom because she was concerned about the level of care her elderly parents were receiving.  When she did so, the HSE removed the home help hours and meals on wheels that her parents had been receiving.  Thus, she felt bullied into becoming a full-time carer.  These are the points to which the Minister of State referred.  I am pointing out that the impact on somebody who returns home to look after a parent in intuitive ways is such that benefits are taken away.  That is the nonsense behind the Minister of State&rsquo;s fine words.  The first reaction of the system seems to be to reward the altruism of the returning people by systematically stripping away all the benefits, which is appalling.</P>
        <P>A carer living in County Cork returned from Egypt with her family in 2009 to care for her elderly parents, both of whom were extremely frail and could not live independently.  The carer is not eligible for the carer&rsquo;s allowance because she is not considered habitually resident.  The family is struggling to cope, has no income, and is without many basic services.  The family is now considering putting both parents into a home.  What would this cost the State?  Would it not be more decent, prudent and economical to redress the case in the manner I have outlined?</P>
        <P>The Carers Association has asked me to request the Department to apply a common-sense approach to the assessment of persons returning home.  While I acknowledge that financial circumstances are poor, I urge the Minister of State, whom I know is intelligent and caring, to waive the habitual residence condition applying to those returning home from abroad.  The <Col N="431"/>Minister of State should do the decent thing.  People should not be punished for returning home.  Applying the condition to them is not even in the economic interest of the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is no doubt that carers, both young and old, play a critical role in society that often goes unnoticed.  The recent publication of the first national qualitative study of young carers in Ireland uncovered startling realities concerning the circumstances of young carers.  The study found that there are children as young as five years acting as carers through the provision of general care, emotional support and domestic help.  They are providing care to siblings, grandparents and parents.  The study highlighted that there is a lack of mentoring, therapy and financial support to meet the needs of young carers.  There is no provision for them whatsoever.  Drawing on some of these findings, it is clear the study has identified a vulnerable section of society that is being ignored in terms of recognition and the provision of services thereto.  In light of this, I call for an urgent response regarding the provision of support and protection to young carers.</P>

	<P>Let us not forget adult carers, who also play an outstanding role in caring for the needs of their loved ones.  Only recently, 73 year old Ms Carmel Devaney from Athlone won an All Ireland Inspirational Life Award, of which I am the chief driver, for her sterling work as part of the Athlone Carers Support Group.  Ms Devaney, who has an<?oasys _jy ?>important role at the helm of the group, is supported by committee members Margaret Caulfield and Margaret Fallon.  Ms Devaney says the members meet once a month and the goal of the group is to support all those in the region who are looking after their loved ones, for whatever reason.</P>
        <P>The group invites speakers who talk on all sorts of subjects, from social and welfare issues to manual handling and stress.  Every year, the committee organises a trip, usually abroad, so members can get a break, or respite, from their all-consuming caring work.  Respite has been talked about so much in the past week.</P>
        <P>On accepting her All Ireland Inspirational Life Award, Ms Carmel Devaney said there is a broad range of issues connected with caring practices that need attention.  One is that the carer&rsquo;s allowance is still being means tested.  She said: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a certain amount of income you won&rsquo;t get the allowance, yet we are saving the Government an awful lot of money.&rdquo;  She is worried that not enough provision is being made for the elderly.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">Ms Devaney, the 73 year old chairwoman of the Athlone Carers Support Group, would like more Government-sponsored assisted living centres in which old people could get help while remaining independent.  Private nursing homes are not an option for most because they are too expensive.  Athlone is crying out for an assisted living facility.  In the opinion of Ms Devaney, the Government would want to move on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  For months this side of the House has been seeking a debate on care of the elderly.  </P>
        <P>I will make a couple of specific points at the end of my contribution, but first I will speak about carers and the undervalued role they play in society.  I echo Senator Mary White&rsquo;s comments on young carers and the lack of support available to those who look after elderly relatives.  A few years ago a girl in my area won the young carer of the year award for looking after her grandfather who has since died.  Many other young people do the same and do not receive recognition for their role.</P>
        <P>As Senator Norris stated, because of the work they do carers save the State a considerable amount of money.  They do not do it for the money, but because they are looking after someone <Col N="432"/>they love such as a family member.  The State should do everything in its power to ensure elderly or ill patients and family members who can be looked after at home stay there for as long as possible.  This requires the provision of support for carers.</P>
        <P>We have made significant advances in recent years, but it seems as if the Government is considering making cutbacks.  The an bord snip report which has not been implemented proposed a number of serious cuts which would affect carers.  If the Minister of State does anything in her position, she should ensure the cuts, including the half allowance and so on recommended by Mr. McCarthy&rsquo;s committee, do not take effect.  She should safeguard what is in place and work as hard as she can to ensure this.  Her heart is in the right place so far as supporting the services provided for society by carers is concerned.</P>
        <P>I am involved with the carers association in Kilkenny.  My mother has been a carer for most of her life.  She has never qualified for carer&rsquo;s allowance, despite the fact she has looked after my elderly grand-aunt, my uncle and, before he died, my father.  She now minds my nephew, my godson, who is severely autistic.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The former Minister, the late Seamus Brennan, was a hard-nosed politician, but he did a great deal to recognise the role played by carers and women, in particular, in the social welfare system.  He fully supported the payment of dependent adult allowance to those who did not qualify for an old age pension.  He also pioneered the introduction of pensions for spouses of the self-employed which were threatened by another former Minister, Deputy Hanafin, but I am glad the current Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, recently stated they would not be abolished.  Seamus Brennan is often overlooked in these debates, but he did a great deal of good work in this regard.  While he was a combative politician, he had a good side.  In my eight years in the House he was the most effective Minister with whom I had the pleasure of dealing.</P>
        <P>The carers associations are looking for a number of measures, including a small increase in the number of hours carers are allowed to work outside their caring role.  In their capacity as carers, most work much more than the number of hours in the average working week.  It is good for them to be able to do other work, as stepping away from their difficult situation allows them to keep their minds in order.  I support the request by the associations that the Government not treat the household benefits package as taxable income.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks there has been a number of protests against the proposed cutbacks in respite services.  Cutting the badly needed respite services for carers may result in a saving in the short term, but forcing people to place their loved ones in public or private institutions will cost the State much more in the long run.</P>
        <P>The publication of the carers strategy has been delayed for a long time.  Will the Government publish it as soon as possible?</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on supported care homes and specifically on the Health Information and Quality Authority standards for nursing homes which are being applied to supported care homes which are not and never were intended to be nursing homes.  They are to be found all over the country, but especially in County Kilkenny because Dr. Peter Birch who was Bishop of Ossory many years ago was a man ahead of his time and donated a great deal of church property to local parish communities to provide such facilities.  Last Friday the Mount Carmel supported care home in Callan received a letter from HIQA indicating that the time available to subscribe to the standards was being reduced from three years to 12 months, which period will expire in one month&rsquo;s time when the home will face closure.  It accommodates 20 people on a full-time basis, although they do not need full-time nursing care.  Through supported living measures, they leave the premises during the day, go to the shops and meet their friends.  They <Col N="433"/>could not survive independently in the community, but they have a loving home in Mount Carmel and six or seven other facilities scattered throughout County Kilkenny.  It is appalling that HIQA&rsquo;s standards will be used to close down such facilities or make them so expensive that most of their occupants will not be able to remain.  If they become seriously ill, they will have to attend the acute services at St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny, a private nursing home or one of the public nursing homes in Kilkenny.  However, they are not nursing home patients.  While they are incapable of living independently, they do not require 24-hour nursing care.</P>
        <P>I am appealing to the Minister of State on a personal and political level.  I am not asking that there be no standards.  Some of the scandals in nursing home provision show that there must be standards.  Those who run homes, many of whom do so voluntarily, do not want a situation where there would be no standards either, but neither do they want nursing home standards to be applied to their facilities which are not and never were intended to be nursing homes.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State for one of the most important debates in which I have been involved.  Although it is not possible, I would like the Minister for Finance to sit beside the Minister of State, given that we will soon be facing into a budgetary process that, irrespective of whether we like the idea, will place considerable pressure on front-line services.  We need to ensure such services will remain untouched.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a Green Party Member, I was critical of Fianna F&aacute;il when the Green Party was not in government.  During the Celtic tiger years considerable progress was made in the provision of support for carers.  There is always a long way to go, however, and the measure of society is how well it treats the less well-off.  As Governments changed, I watched as my wife became a carer.  We have a young disabled son.  It is quite extraordinary when one starts off with the whole process because literally one does not know what the hell is going on or what the supports are.  It is not something people generally expect to happen in their lives, to become a carer.  Not many people set out to be a carer in the community from a very young age.  However, it happens to many people and they become carers.  One in 25 in the population is an official carer according to the 2006 census, equivalent to 161,000 people.  As many have indicated in this debate, that level of caring is saving the State &euro;2.8 billion, and the Government policy which states that community care is the right way to go is supported by all parties in this House, I believe, and in the country.  I feel very strongly about that and believe absolutely it is the right way to go and that community care is the best way to care for our people.  Obviously, the elderly prefer to live in their own homes and communities until the very last possible minute.  In the case of any of our children, we certainly want them to be in their own homes, if at all possible.  I understand there are many difficult situations and there is an enormous debate on the whole issue of child protection.  It is not always that easy to achieve, but certainly in any case where a child or an adult can live within the community, he or she should be given the best possible support and services for that to happen.  That is an excellent policy.</P>
        <P>Provision of occupational therapy and speech therapy in schools is something that I have raised before on many occasions.  It is very important that this should be upgraded.  At a time when money is scarce, we need to up our game.  I am delighted the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has pioneered speech therapy within a pilot school programme in Galway.  I want to see how successful a completed pilot is because I believe this can lead to much cheaper and much better speech therapy services for children if implemented properly. <Col N="434"/> We have to look at the best possible way of delivering services in the community and find innovative ways of doing that within society.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I want to mention form filling, which is not something many people would think about in relation to carers.  When one becomes a carer, as my wife and I have, one wants to put every ounce of caring towards the person who needs it.  One does not want to be trooping in and out of administrative centres, filling in forms and being treated as someone who is trying to defraud the State.  I am not pulling any punches in saying this.  At times one feels like that, rightly or wrongly.  One is made to feel as if one is trying to defraud the State of money when one is simply looking for the best services for one&rsquo;s child.  That is not the way it should be.  Obviously, there may be people who try to get a carer&rsquo;s allowance when they are not entitled to it, but the default position should certainly be one of caring for people within the State.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the fact that I have received correspondence from the carers&rsquo; association, Caring for Carers Ireland.  We need support associations for carers.  There has been much talk about respite care, home help and meals on wheels.  I want to ask the Minister of State about training for carers.  When one becomes a carer, one generally does not have training in that regard.  Support and training in the home setting is something, certainly, that could be improved.</P>
        <P>I do not believe we should use the monetary situation as an excuse for denigrating the gains we have got.  We must hold on to those and make every effort in that regard.  If we are going to cut in this budget it has to be from the higher end of things.  I could speak all day on this particular subject, as the Cathaoirleach recognises.  It is a very important debate, and I hope we can come back to it again.  There have been a number of specific measures suggested in this debate.  I hope the Minister for Health and Children and the other Ministers involved in the caring area will look carefully at today&rsquo;s Seanad debate and embrace many of the points that we have sought.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to the various contributions to the debate, I was reminded once again how close to home the issue of carers is.  Each individual carer mentioned represents the thousands of carers from every corner of Ireland &mdash; every parish and every family &mdash; who receive no awards, often little recognition and sometimes not even the awareness of those for whom they care.  People need help and support in doing this and this Government is committed to supporting family carers as much as we can.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the changing circumstances in the past two years we have had to make difficult decisions and reassess priorities.  In the face of enormous economic pressures the Government has chosen to continue supporting carers to the maximum extent possible.  We have retained the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, which I know is of great value to carers, both financially and in what it represents.  We have retained the respite care grant, including for people who do not otherwise qualify for other income supports.  I have taken all the issues on board and, as Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in has indicated, it would be great to have another debate at another time of the year.  As regards the home care packages, my focus last year was on the fair deal nursing home support Bill, and certainly now it is on home and security care.  In my initial speech I mentioned the evaluation we had done of the home care packages, and we are now aiming to standardise access and delivery of these.  They are working extraordinarily well in parts of the country and not so well in others.  We are working very hard in my Department to standardise that access and delivery.</P><Col N="435"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Several Senators raised the issue of the habitual residency requirement.  There are five grounds to be considered based on the rulings of the European Court of Justice, and we can consider the balance of the grounds outside the five, which obviously cannot be changed.  Thirty-five people have been refused out of 19,000 and an appeals process is in place.</P>
        <P>I referred to the positive aging strategy and many Senators have mentioned the national carers strategy today as an issue.  The Government took a decision in 2009 not to publish this strategy.  In 2008 the economy experienced multiple shocks as an unparalleled combination of international and domestic developments impacted.  Reflecting these developments the economy rapidly moved into recession and the pace of this deterioration has to be recalled now against a background of 6% GDP growth during 2007.  The European Council and the European Commission considered Ireland to be at medium risk when it came to the long-run sustainability of the public finances.  As a result, Ireland&rsquo;s stability programme update in October 2008 described safeguarding the public finances as requiring additional policy responses and potentially difficult choices, notwithstanding existing initiatives.  That was the context in which the Government took the decision not to proceed with the carers strategy.  Given the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or timelines which could be achieved.  Rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.</P>
        <P>I refute any suggestion that the Government has no strategy or vision for carers.  Government policy is to support older people, people with disabilities and people with mental health difficulties to allow them to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality, long-term residential care.  The report of the working group on long-term care recommended that a central principle of policy should be to support older people to remain in the community.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in Towards 2016.  It is reflected in the ongoing statements of strategy of the Department of Social Protection and the HSE.</P>
        <P>The Government has a vision for carers, of an Ireland which recognises and respects the valuable role of carers in society by providing them with support, where necessary, to assist them in their caring role and to enable them to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.  That is our vision and it is what guides us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 113, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and has been placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration,&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For the convenience of Senators, the Cathaoirleach has arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the list of amendments it is proposed to group.  A Senator may contribute once on each group of amendments.  I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Minister to speak to the first group of amendments.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="436"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 1 arises from amendment No. 24 which amends the Courts Act 1991.  It makes the necessary alterations to the Long Title as a result of an amendment to that Act being added to the Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 24 relates to the issuing of bench warrants.  It amends section 22(5) of the Courts Act 1991 by deleting the words, &ldquo;if the complaint or accusation has been substantiated on oath and&rdquo;.  That section of the Courts Act sets out the procedures for the service of summonses by the District Court.  It relates to summonses issued under the 1851 Petty Sessions Act and the Courts Act 1986.  Different procedures apply under the two Acts for the issuing of summonses.  Sworn information is required in the case of the 1851 Act but not in the case of the 1986 Act.</P>
        <P>Section 22(4) provides that where a person does not appear as specified in the summons, the court has various options, including adjourning the case to enable the person to be notified of the adjourned hearing.  Section 22(5) deals with the enforcement of attendance by a person who fails to appear on the adjourned date.  The court may issue a bench warrant for the arrest of the person concerned or it may proceed to hear the case in his or her absence.</P>
        <P>In a case stated, the High Court in DPP<i> v.</i> Murphy, October 2009, concluded that where section 22(5) arose, the District Court may proceed to issue a bench warrant but only after hearing sworn evidence.  The requirement that the evidence must in all cases be sworn is causing difficulty.  It is at odds with the practice in the District Court where, until now, sworn evidence was not required.  By removing the words referred to in the amendment, it will be possible to continue to operate on the basis of the practice that applied before this judgment.  I have been advised that such a course is in order since the issuing of a bench warrant is a new and separate procedure, the purpose of which is different from the purpose of the original summons.  Its purpose is to secure attendance.  It does not, therefore, need to reflect the basis upon which the original summons was issued, whether it was under the 1851 or 1986 Act.</P>
        <P>A change in practice would present considerable resource and logistical obstacles for the prosecution, as in many cases prosecuting garda&iacute; are not present and the interests of the State are presented by court presenters.  The amendment does not put the defendant at any new or greater risk but merely returns to the practice and procedure applied for many years.</P>

	<P>Group 2 comprises amendments Nos. 2 and 3 to the interpretation section of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 2 deletes the word &ldquo;Equality&rdquo; from the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to reflect the recent alteration to the name of the Department and the title of the Minister responsible for it.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 arises from amendments to Parts 3 and 4 which concern exceptions to the rule against double jeopardy and appeals, respectively.  Its purpose is to ensure certain terms in the Bill which apply to the ordinary courts may be construed, when the need arises, as referring to a Special Criminal Court and the procedural steps related to bringing a person before such a court.  The terms in question are &ldquo;a jury&rdquo; and &ldquo;a person being sent forward for trial&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 3 concerns the extension of the range of offences to which victim impact provisions apply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 4 arises from the debate on section 4 in this House.  As Senators will recall, section 4 reforms the law relating to victim impact evidence, principally to give the family members of homicide victims the right to make a victim impact statement at the sentencing hearing.  The Bill, as published, retained the existing categories of offences to <Col N="437"/>which the victim impact provisions applied, namely sexual offences, offences involving violence or the threat of violence and attempts and conspiracies to commit such offences.  The amendment takes account of several offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 such as harassment and false imprisonment which may not necessarily involve physical violence but which can cause great emotional distress to victims.  The amendment ensures they are included by adding the words &ldquo;any offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997&rdquo; in section 5(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Criminal Justice Act 1993.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Group 4 relates to the amendment of standards applied to the tainted acquittal retrial procedure, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 5, 10 and 12.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 5, 10 and 12 relate to the tainted acquittal retrial procedure in section 9.  The tainted acquittal retrial procedure is one of three retrial procedures in the Bill, the other two being the new evidence retrial procedure in section 8 and the with-prejudice prosecution appeals avenue in section 23.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This set of amendments raises the threshold that must be met before the Director of Public Prosecutions may make an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal for a retrial and by that court before granting the Director of Public Prosecution&rsquo;s application.  The amendments are intended to ensure an acquitted person is put through the ordeal of a retrial only where there is a real prospect of a conviction, that is, where there is sufficient evidence on which a jury may convict.  Later amendments address in similar fashion the thresholds applying to new evidence appeals and with-prejudice prosecution appeals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 10 substitutes the balance of probability standard contained in section 9(3)(<i>a</i>) by a requirement that there be compelling evidence against the acquitted person before the Director of Public Prosecutions may make an application for a retrial order.  The requirement that the application be in the public interest has been retained.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 12 follows from amendment 10 and substitutes the balance of probability standard in section 10(2)(<i>a</i>) by a requirement that the court must be satisfied that there is compelling evidence against the acquitted person.  The requirement that the granting of the Director of Public Prosecution&rsquo;s application is in the interests of justice has been retained.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 5 inserts a definition of &ldquo;compelling evidence&rdquo; in section 7 which contains the definitions for this Part.  The definition has three elements.  The evidence must be reliable, of significant probative value, that is, of high evidential value and is such that a jury might reasonably be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the person&rsquo;s guilt in respect of the offence concerned.  I want to highlight two points about this definition.  It has been formulated to incorporate the criminal standard of proof in order, as I said, to ensure the Director of Public Prosecutions makes a retrial application and the court quashes the acquittal and orders the retrial only where there is a real prospect of a conviction.  Given that this retrial procedure and the other retrial procedures in the Bill represent a radical departure from long-standing legal principles, it is desirable to provide explicit guidance for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senators will also note the definition refers to a hypothetical future jury.  It does not require the Director of Public Prosecutions or the court to look behind the verdict of the original jury to determine the reasons for the verdict to acquit and the extent to which the taint might have affected their deliberations.  I am advised that if they were required to do so, they would run the risk of infringing the constitutional right to a jury trial.  As Senators will appreciate, the secrecy of jury deliberations is firmly established in law.  Any suggestion it is possible to look behind a jury decision to see the reasons on which it was grounded could be viewed as <Col N="438"/>undermining our system of jury trial.  In the light of this, the formulation in the definition focuses on a prospective jury.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amendment to the definition of &ldquo;compelling evidence&rdquo;.  The opportunity of a retrial in the criminal code, as advanced in the Bill, will strengthen our criminal law.  The definition makes clear what is required in order for there to be a retrial, which will protect all concerned.  The term &ldquo;probative value of the evidence being adduced&rdquo; will ensure the State&rsquo;s time is not wasted and that in respect of a conviction the jury will be the final arbiter.  This will strengthen the code.  I look forward to seeing how this will play out in our criminal law.</P>
        <P>These sections of the new procedures for a retrial are based on the opening up of a previous acquittal.  These amendments were made, following discussion in both Houses and with the Director of Public Prosecutions, to give more guidance to the DPP and the court in regard to the ordering of a retrial and to a certain extent the raising of the standard of proof in that respect.  I believe the Bill is better than originally drafted in that it contains a little more detail and fleshes out the requirement for the DPP and the court, if making an order, to be cognisant of the strong possibility that a conviction must be attained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We move on to Group 5, amendment of definition of new and compelling evidence, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 6 and 7.  The Minister may have already touched on this issue when dealing with the amendments in Group 4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 concern the definition of &ldquo;new and compelling evidence&rdquo;.  I referred earlier to what we understand by &ldquo;compelling&rdquo; in the case of tainted acquittals.  This time the definition relates to the procedure in section 8 which permits the DPP to seek an order for a retrial where fresh evidence emerges post-acquittal.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 6 is focused on the part of the definition which goes to the meaning of &ldquo;new&rdquo;.  It clarifies that the words &ldquo;evidence adduced in the proceedings&rdquo; refers to evidence adduced by the prosecution.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 7 is focused on the part of the definition which goes to the meaning of &ldquo;compelling&rdquo;, namely, paragraph (<i>c</i>).  Subparagraph (i) remains unchanged, namely, the evidence must be reliable.  Subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) have been amended.  The amendment to subparagraph (ii) is aimed at tightening up the wording.  The original phrase &ldquo;is substantial&rdquo; was somewhat at large while the substituted text &ldquo;is of significant probative value&rdquo; clearly refers to the evidential value of the new evidence.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the amendment to subparagraph (iii) is to ensure that it is the criminal standard that applies to the DPP&rsquo;s determination to make a retrial application on the basis of new evidence and to the Court of Criminal Appeal&rsquo;s assessment of the application.  I have already set out in section 9 the rationale for introducing this high standard in the context of the tainted acquittal retrial procedure.  The same rationale applies in this case.  The amendments have the added benefit of applying similar tests to each of the retrial procedures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The next group of amendments is Group 6, amendment of the scope of the new evidence for retrial procedure on tainted acquittal retrial procedure, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 15.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This set of amendments concerns the scope of the new evidence retrial procedure in section 8 and the tainted acquittal retrial procedure in section 9.  The amendments will allow persons charged and sent forward for trial before commencement but <Col N="439"/>tried and acquitted after commencement to be the subject of a retrial application.  Only the trial and the acquittal must follow the commencement of this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators will recall that we debated at length the possibility of applying these procedures to historical cases, namely, to persons acquitted before the commencement of these provisions.  While calls for these procedures to apply retrospectively are understandable, the strength of the advice against doing so was such that I could not accede to them.  To legislate to allow historical acquittals to be reopened would amount to a breach of the doctrine of the separation of powers which is fundamental to our Constitution.  While it is true that such legislation would not alter a particular court judgment, it would have the effect of altering the status of all acquitted persons who are under our law as it stands entitled to an irrebuttable presumption of innocence.  There is also a strong possibility that if we were to allow cases that have been finally disposed of by our courts to be reopened we would be breaching the constitutional right to a trial in due course of law.  Given the limited possibilities for extending the scope of the provisions, the inclusion of those awaiting trial at the time of commencement is as far as we can go if we are to stay within the boundaries set by the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>We now proceed to Group 7, amendments to clarify options available to the court when ordering retrials, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 11, 13 and 14.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 13 make identical amendments to section 10(1) and (2).  Subsection (1) relates to the new evidence retrial applications.  It provides that in the event that the court grants the DPP&rsquo;s application and directs that the acquitted person is to be retried, that direction may be subject to any conditions and directions the court considers necessary or expedient to ensure the fairness of the retrial.  Amendment No. 11 inserts the words &ldquo;(including conditions and directions as to placing a stay on the re-trial)&rdquo; in subsection (1) in order to clarify that this option is available to the court.  Subsection (2) relates to the tainted acquittal retrial applications.  Amendment No. 13 makes the same amendment to this subsection.  Amendment No. 14 was a consequential amendment to subsection (6).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>We now proceed to Group 8, technical and drafting amendments, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 16, 20 and 23.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">These are drafting amendments.  Amendment No. 16 is a minor drafting amendment to section 22.  It has the effect of replacing &ldquo;or&rdquo; with &ldquo;and&rdquo; to allow Rules of Court to be made to provide for the expeditious hearing of the retrial applications and any retrial ordered.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 20 corrects a drafting error in section 26(3), namely, the words &ldquo;, the legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate&rdquo; are added after &ldquo;in respect of the original proceedings&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 23 corrects an error in the layout of the text in section 35(1).  It moves the words &ldquo;before the trial begins&rdquo; to a new line, thus making it clear that whichever of the two options is selected, namely, to return the property to the owner or to dispose of it, it must be done before the trial begins.  That was always intended but this alteration in layout makes the position much clearer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>We now proceed to Group 9, refinement of the scope of the with prejudice prosecution appeal procedure, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 19.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators will recall that I indicated in this House my intention to bring forward amendments to refine the scope of this section in order to ensure that jury <Col N="440"/>verdicts following receipt of all admissible evidence would not be brought into question.  With this in mind this suite of amendments specifies the type of rulings that may be appealed by the prosecution, specifies the standard that must be met before a &ldquo;with prejudice&rdquo; appeal may be lodged by the DPP or granted by the Supreme Court and explicitly requires the Supreme Court to consider the interests of justice when assessing the matter.</P>
        <P>New subsection (3) inserted by amendment No. 17 contains the key changes to this section.  It limits the circumstances in which an appeal shall lie to rulings by a court which erroneously excluded compelling evidence and, in the case of judge directed acquittals, where the direction was wrong in law and the evidence put forward in the proceedings was evidence upon which a jury might reasonably be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the person&rsquo;s guilt in respect of the offence concerned.</P>
        <P>At this point, I draw attention to new subsection (12) which is inserted by amendment No. 19.  It inserts a definition of &ldquo;compelling evidence&rdquo; for the purposes of paragraph (a) of new subsection (3).  The formulation in new subsection (3) not only limits the type of ruling which may be appealed under this section to evidential ruling and directed acquittals that were wrong in law but it also requires the DPP to examine the totality of the evidence in the case to determine whether it affords a real prospect of a conviction in the event of a retrial.  In the case of a jury acquittal on the merits, the focus on evidential rulings ensures that jury verdicts reached on receipt of all admissible evidence are protected.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 18 is consequential on amendment No. 16 and brought the terminology in subsection (5) into line with that used in new subsections (1) and (2).</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 19 substituted existing subsections (9) and (10) with four new subsections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">New subsections (9), (10) and (11) are intended to give more explicit guidance to the Supreme Court when assessing a &ldquo;with prejudice&rdquo; appeal.  Subsection (9) supplemented by new subsection (10) sets out the matters about which the Supreme Court is to be satisfied before it quashes an acquittal or reverses the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal not to order a retrial.  It must be satisfied that the test in subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) is met and that, having regard to the factors listed in subsection (10), it is in the interests of justice to do so.  The factors in subsection (10) which go to the interests of justice test are similar to those that apply in the case of retrial applications under sections 8 and 9.  They include whether it is likely that any retrial could be conducted fairly and the interests of any victim of the offence concerned.</P>
        <P>Subsection (11) again replicates the provisions of sections 8 and 9 which permit the court, when granting a trial order, to make the order subject to such conditions and directions as it considers necessary to ensure the fairness of the trial.  New subsection (12) defines &ldquo;compelling evidence&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Overall, these amendments are intended to ensure due regard is paid to the rights of the acquitted person and that the right to jury trial, a central feature of our criminal justice system, is protected.  These amendments follow extensive consultation with the Attorney General and I am satisfied that the procedure, as it now appears, is sufficiently robust.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the refinement of this section.  As the Minister said, the protection of the right to jury trial is paramount to all accused and acquitted.  The clarification in respect of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision when dealing with prejudice appeals and evidential rulings is welcome.  I believe this section strengthens the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator is aware, heretofore an appeal could be made to a higher court to determine a point of law on a without prejudice basis to the person who was acquitted.  What this procedure is bringing in is the possibility that it would be on a with <Col N="441"/>prejudice basis.  In other words, an appeal can be made in regard to an erroneous point of law which would then have implications because it is with prejudice to the position of the previously acquitted person.  Owing to the requirement to ensure fairness of trial and in the interests of justice, we have inserted this clarification which has gained acclaim in both Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 10, amendment to Courts of Justice Act 1924, is the subject matter of amendments Nos. 21 and 22.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Both sections 31 and 33 as passed by this House amended the Courts of Justice Act 1924, albeit different sections of that Act.  One of the effects of amendment No. 21 is to combine the amendments to the 1924 Act in one section, that is, section 31, with the consequent deletion of section 33 by amendment No. 22.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 21 has two other effects.  Paragraph (<i>a</i>) of section 31, the substance of which was previously contained in section 33, amends section 29 of the 1924 Act to create a limited exception to the normal rule that no appeal lies from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court where the Court of Criminal Appeal has quashed a conviction and granted a retrial.  Amendment No. 21 expanded the limited exception concerned to permit a person who has been granted a retrial to appeal a point that is relevant to his or her defence at the retrial, not only where the point at issue was not adjudicated upon by the Court of Criminal Appeal but also where it was determined against him or her.  The addition of this second scenario contributes to a more complete treatment of this issue.  The normal filtering rules for appeals to the Supreme Court will apply.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 21 also introduces amendments to sections 32 and 33 of the 1924 Act arising from paragraph (<i>b</i>) which abolishes the requirement that a person wishing to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal must obtain a certificate from the trial judge or leave to appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal.

	<P>Group 11, amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act 1967, are the subject matter of amendments Nos. 25 and 26.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 25 deletes the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; between paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) in section 37 and facilitates amendment No. 26 which inserts a new paragraph (<i>c</i>) in section 37.  Amendment No. 26 amends section 24(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967.  The amendment addresses a lacuna in the law governing the production in court of accused persons who had been remanded in custody.  The jurisdiction of a District Court to remand a person on bail or in custody derives from section 21 of the 1967 Act.  That section provides that the court may, subject to the provisions of the 1967 Act, remand the accused from time to time as the occasion requires.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 24 of the 1967 Act deals with periods of remand, including the circumstances upon which a person who has been remanded in custody can be further remanded in his or her absence.  It is clear from subsection (5)(<i>a</i>) that those circumstances are limited to illness or accident.  However, there are situations where it is reasonable for prisoners not to be produced, for example, where they have been lawfully produced before another court.  This can happen where they have charges before a number of courts and remand dates coincide or where they are produced in the High Court on foot of their own application &mdash; normally under Article 40 of the Constitution &mdash; making it impossible for the governor to produce them in the District Court to which they have been remanded.</P>
        <P>This amendment has addressed the difficulty by adding a new provision in subsection (5)(<i>a</i>) to deal with cases where the non-appearance is &ldquo;for any other good and sufficient reason&rdquo;. <Col N="442"/> Where the court is satisfied that the reasons are good and sufficient, it may extend a person&rsquo;s period of remand.  The amendment ensures a non-appearance must be explained to the court&rsquo;s satisfaction.  That is a strong safeguard that will prevent any arbitrary extensions of remand times.  It protects against any abuse and gives good and timely protection to the individual concerned.</P>

	<P>Group 12 &mdash; addition to list of scheduled offences, the subject matter of amendment No. 27.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 27 relates to the Schedule which lists the offences in respect of which the Director of Public Prosecutions may seek to have an acquittal quashed and a retrial ordered on the basis of new evidence.  The procedure is limited to the most serious offences on the Statute Book, that is, offences that generally carry a mandatory or discretionary sentence of life imprisonment.  In line with this threshold, amendment No. 27 added the offence of &ldquo;directing a criminal organisation&rdquo; at paragraph 15.  Senators will recall that this offence was introduced under the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  That Act was enacted after the publication of this Bill.  Therefore, as the offence did not exist when this Bill was published, it was not possible to include it in the Bill at the time of publication.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Seanad, the officials who dealt with this Bill, the Members on the other side of the House and those on my side of the House.  This is a significant Bill that makes a fairly dramatic change in the criminal law.  I believe the procedures under this Bill will be used sparingly.  The main procedures regarding the issue of retrial will be used sparingly.  It was never intended that they would be used very often but only in exceptional circumstances.  The amendments I have brought before the House have changed the original setting out of the way these procedures are to be implemented, both before the Director of Public Prosecutions makes an application for a retrial and for the court to determine whether that application should be granted.  To a certain extent, it might not happen but conceivably it could.  It is one of the reasons I decided to go for this and move forward in the Department.  I was also conscious that Members on both sides of the House had endeavoured to get us to apply provisions of the Bill retrospectively.  However, common sense and legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General dictated that was not possible.  We made a slight amendment to the Bill, but we did not go the whole way to include offences committed prior to its commencement.  The reason is that somebody convicted of an offence has to know what the law is on the date on which the offence was committed.  If the Legislature was to be in a position to change the law subsequent to an offence happening, putting at peril the person who potentially committed the offence or had been acquitted, that would not be fair and reasonable.  There were also good and very strong reasons from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, not least the issue of the Oireachtas interfering in acquittals and decisions made by the Judiciary.  It goes to the very heart of the separation of powers; we cannot interfere with the role of the Judiciary as laid down in the Constitution.  Equally, the phrase &ldquo;in due course of law&rdquo; which is in the Constitution relating to the conducting of a fair trial is a very strong mandate to the Oireachtas to ensure the laws passed are reasonable and fair and do not change the goalposts just because of the political mood of the politicians present in the Oireachtas at a particular time.</P><Col N="443"/>
        <P>I genuinely thank my officials for the work done on this and the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009.  The amount of work carried out in this respect has been phenomenal and I thank my officials for the Trojan work they did, particularly on the briefing material and explanations available for me to give to both Houses.  We are extremely well served by the public servants we have in this respect.  Time and again there is public criticism, but we are extremely well served by our public servants.  I thank publically the public servants involved with this Bill.</P>
        <P>I also thank the Seanad.  I am delighted to see a predecessor of mine has changed his view on its role.  Once Michael McDowell became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and fully understood the examination of legislation by the Seanad, he knew his previously expressed view that it was not required was not correct.  That has come home to me just as much, even though I was never of the view that we should get rid of the Seanad.  Two thirds of all legislation which passes through the Oireachtas comes from the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  The Seanad is an extremely useful tool to me as Minister, the Department and officials.  Quite a number of suggestions have come from the both sides of the House which alerted my officials to issues which did not occur to them.  It is only valid that we have a double examination, checks and balances as it were between both Houses of the Oireachtas, something I welcome.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials.  As he stated, this is an important Bill which makes significant procedural changes to our criminal law, in particular the new rules on retrials.  Some of the changes it makes are very welcome.  I echo the Minister&rsquo;s words on the need to ensure there is adequate protection for the rights of victims.  The new provisions on victim impact statements are to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the role of the Seanad.  On Committee and Report Stages we had very robust and constructive debate and we did attempt to scrutinise the Bill &mdash; fairly I hope &mdash; to ensure it did not encroach unduly on the rights of an accused, something to which we must all have regard, while at the same time strengthening the position of the victim and ensuring victims would not simply be overlooked, as often happened in the past in the criminal justice system.  We have to be conscious of this need also.</P>
        <P>I tabled amendments on Committee and Report Stages.  The Labour Party was the only party to do so in this House.  The amendments were constructive and I am very glad that on Report Stage the Minister accepted the point we had made on the victim impact statement and the need to ensure the family could give evidence as to the effect on the deceased relative between the commission of the offence and the death of the person, if there was a time gap.  This is the lacuna, albeit a rare occurrence I hope, that it is important to ensure is addressed in legislation such as this.</P>
        <P>I am glad to see that amendments were made in the D&aacute;il that took account of some of the discussion we had in the Seanad, in particular on the reference to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act in the definitions section &mdash; amendment No. 4 refers &mdash; and also of the points we made on the respective roles of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the subject of some of the amendments from the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The Minister is correct to state we all very much hope the procedures will be used sparingly, certainly the retrial provisions, because the rule against double jeopardy was very well established in our criminal justice system.  It should not be upset lightly; it should be used sparingly. <Col N="444"/> We have to have regard to the need for certainty and finality in the criminal law, a matter not only for accused persons but also for victims.</P>
        <P>The provisions dealing with victims are very welcome.  In our debate we have sought to ensure there will be an adequate balance in the legislation in order that encroachments on the rights of an accused will not be made in breach of his or her constitutional right to due process, to which the Minister referred.</P>
        <P>The need to ensure the presentation of cross-referencing legislation was at the heart of the comments I made on Committee and Report Stages on the reference to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act.  This is important.  We have too much disparate criminal law legislation and there is a need for codification, something the previous Minister, Michael McDowell, recognised.  I am aware a codification project is under way.  However, we need to stress the point made.</P>
        <P>With regard to the need for greater consistency in the criminal law, a matter that has arisen in discussion among practitioners and at conferences is the need to ensure the permanent status of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Judgments need to be made at a court with permanent status, not one in which there is a rotating series of judges, a point which has been highlighted on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>Very important procedural changes will be made through the Bill and it is vital that practitioners, in particular, are made aware of them.  It is up to all of us to try to disseminate information on the changes and inform people about them.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I thank the Minister and the officials at the Department for giving of their time on the Bill.  It is clear they have put a lot of work into the Bill which makes radical procedural changes to our criminal law.  The rule against double jeopardy, as Senator Bacik stated, has been in place for a very long time.  The exceptions provided for in the Bill give teeth to the Director of Public Prosecutions, in particular, to retry cases where incontrovertible evidence appears at a later date.  We all know stories and the folklore, that people felt X had got away with an offence and was laughing in the face of the law as a result.</P>
     
        <P>This legislation gives teeth to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts, to look at those instances again, give justice and tip it back towards the victim.  It is a vital, delicate tipping balance that will be used sparingly.</P>
        <P>The fact that it also includes persons awaiting trial is an important amendment to those who are worried about certain pieces of evidence not being within grasp at this point in time.  I appreciate very much that we could not bring it back to a historical level and include persons who had already been tried because the principle of legal certainty is such a significant principle to have and hold dear in a democracy.  At the same time, a good balance has been found in this legislation without thwarting that principle of legal certainty.</P>
        <P>My party looks forward to the Bill being enacted and to the strengthening of the criminal procedures as a result.  I thank the Minister for his time.  I also thank him for the comments he made in respect of the relevance and benefit of this House which, I note, were welcomed by my colleague across the floor.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">3.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the anomalous position of persons who marry their employer and who are previously paying class A contributions, but who are left in a significantly worsened social insurance position as a result of marriage.&rdquo;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not going to accept the amendment but I accept the point being made.  There are many issues relating to the 36 rates of PRSI, the different classes, etc.  I am aware of a case, which might be similar to the one to which the amendment refers, where a person who had worked as a PAYE taxpayer in a shop subsequently married the employer and then had a child.  She applied for the maternity payment only to find she was ineligible for it.  Had they had the child and forgot about the marriage, she would still be an employee and would have got the maternity payment.  It seems odd.  I will examine all these issues.</P>
        <P>There are many possible difficulties because one must try to establish in the situation of family members that there is a real working relationship.  I met those involved in one such case who were caught in this particular trap and I expressed understanding of what is, when one looks at it from the way they see it, an unusual situation.  In the review of the PRSI system, the single social payment and so on, we should look at all these matters again to see whether we can improve them.  We must ensure a person could not nominate all his or her family for social welfare entitlements without real work and payment input.  That is the challenge in this case, which I understand is the kind of problem Senator McCarthy raises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  He illustrated an example of the spirit of this amendment.  It never ceases to amaze me that there is a large group of people who do not understand the PRSI codification system, and I would include public representatives in that.  For example, there are persons who up until the budget would not have realised that their PRSI contributions would have covered dental and optical benefit.  They did not realise it until it was gone.</P>
        <P>There is a disconnection in terms of the perception of the categories of PRSI, for example, among persons who move employment.  The majority of those in this House would have moved onto a different class of PRSI when they became Members of the Oireachtas and would have lost some of the benefits that their previous PRSI contribution, if they were in PAYE employment, would have conferred upon them.</P><Col N="446"/>
        <P>In that macro-sense, when the Minister is looking at the system, it needs to be made understandable to the ordinary individual, never mind the practitioners of politics or others who will be using that system to explain cases and deliver a process or a procedure in a particular Department.  It is also important that there is a strong understanding of that.</P>
        <P>I remember a number of years ago when the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coughlan, was Minister in this Department, she was looking at that in terms of jargon busting and using terms that were easy for persons to decipher and understand in terms of communicating.</P>
        <P>A number of years ago, the workload of a public representative, as the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, would have realised in Galway, would have been one-off rural housing and the planning difficulties associated with it being a political hot potato, whereas now the majority of us spend our time working in the social welfare system for those who, unfortunately, find themselves signing on and making inquiries about entitlements.  It is a difficult system to gain a commanding brief of, from our point of view not to mind that of the ordinary individual or customer to whom the Department would seek to provide the service.  It is important in the context of the manner in which the Minister looks at the PRSI codification system that it is made easier for everyone to understand, not least those to whom Department would wish to offer a service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully accept the spirit of what Senator McCarthy says.  I have had a great deal of experience with the social welfare system and how it has developed over the years because at one stage I was effectively the employer.  I was a manager of a co-operative and I learnt many of the crinkles of the social welfare system, unemployment rules, casual labour and so on.  What I have seen over years for all sorts of bizarre reasons, all of which were good at the time, is how it has got ever more complex.  There are 36 different rates of PRSI and I do not believe there are many in the country who fully understand that.  If one holds a medical card it is this, and if one does not, it is that, and there are all sorts of odd situations.  I would much prefer a simpler system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senator McCarthy also will be aware, the challenge in going from where one is to where one would like to be or where one would have constructed it if one was starting with a clean sheet is that it is fraught by the fact that people do not accept one going backwards.  One must improve matters, and then there are issues of funding, etc.  Notwithstanding the statement of the Minister for Finance that there would be a universal social contribution, I do not believe we will get there in one jump.  However, if we could progressively reduce the number of social welfare classes and the sub rates under the various classes, such as A, M, K and S classes which, in turn, are divided into A0, AX, etc., simplify it and see how to reduce the variation in benefits under the different classes, it would represent a good day&rsquo;s work for the ordinary citizen.  I have no notion of so doing but if I held a quiz here on the tax implications of social welfare benefits, I doubt if too many people understand that area fully either.  I understand some of the large accountancy companies claim few people fully understand the tax and social welfare pay-in code in total or the classifications of the various payments one may get.  I believe all of this should be simplified over time and during my time as Minister I will work in that direction.  If, at any time, it is believed a debate on the issue either in this House or a joint committee were warranted, I would make myself available.  If we all put our heads together and put our common experience of the crinkles in the system together, we might improve it.  However, I warn the House that one must avoid unintended consequences which one may not have considered in the first place.  Any changes would have to be carried out carefully.  It will take some time but I am determined to move forward on this agenda in my time as Minister.  I accept the spirit of the amendment if not the amendment itself.  We should all follow this agenda and <Col N="447"/>I am interested in people&rsquo;s input to the agenda.  The Senator has highlighted some rather relevant points.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">3.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the potential yield of each of the following revenue raising measures:</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Several elements are involved here.  One issue relates to the requirement on insurance companies to compensate the Minister for illness and disability payments due to be refunded.  I agreed in the D&aacute;il to examine this issue.  If there is a great heap of money available, it would be very attractive to get it.  It is worth noting that the level of recovery by the compensation recovery unit which operates the legislation in the UK in 2007-08 and 2008-09 amounted to &euro;142 million and &euro;138 million respectively.  The UK is 15 times our size, but even if one takes a factor of ten it would appear to indicate that the reimbursement would be in the range of &euro;13 million or &euro;14 million.  Unfortunately, despite what I and many others would have held to be the case, it would appear there is no big honeypot.  However, &euro;14 million is not to be sneezed at.</P>
        <P>A proposal was put to the previous Minister containing a possible saving of &euro;88 million but it does not appear that any such saving has taken place actually in the UK.  It is unclear how this figure was arrived at.  We must consider the impact on job retention and creation and establish what costs are estimated to offset against any potential yield.  I indicated I would begin to examine this issue to establish if it is worth progressing with.  I trust this deals with the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to PRSI and rental income, a complicated issue.  This matter goes back to a review of PRSI.  We are introducing a universal social contribution to replace employee PRSI.  The situation at present is complex.  At present, self-employed contributors pay PRSI on rental income.  It is not the case universally that one does not pay PRSI on rental income.  In addition, while employed contributors are not generally subject to PRSI on investment income and rental income, there is a liability where the individual concerned also has a trade, professional or <Col N="448"/>partnership income which is chargeable to PRSI as a self-employed contributor on rental income.  I understand the amendment proposes all such income should be subject to PRSI.  At the moment some income is subject to PRSI, depending on one&rsquo;s circumstances and whether one is a self-employed trader or subject to PRSI on rental income.  We are considering the Commission on Taxation recommendations and this will arise in the budgetary context and the review.  It is not off the agenda and it is something I will examine.</P>
        <P>I refer to the matter of mortgage interest supplement and the matter of proof provided when a bank has declined a payment free period.  As I announced last week, we are examining the 30 hour rule.  It has been recommended that we get rid of it.  We insist there should be a six month arrangement with a bank before mortgage interest supplement would kick in.  We also maintain that if the State is paying the interest, it should get bottom dollar interest rates and not pay inflated interest rates to banks.  I am working actively on this.  It is my intention to make changes to mortgage interest supplement in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>I refer to PRSI, capital gains and PRSI classes.  The same point applies and as part of the review of PRSI, these matters will be examined.  The same also applies to the PRSI to share base and the remuneration of share options.  Everything on which one pays the PRSI social contribution is being examined in the context of the new social charge.</P>
        <P>I take the view that in general the more universal a payment and the less exceptions we make, the lower it will be.  In other words, the wider it is, the shallower one can have it.  One mistake made in the past relates to the number of exceptions made.  At times, budget changes were introduced and then people sought exclusions.  The more exclusions there are, the higher the rate must be.  All these issues will be considered in the context of changes to the PRSI system, which are overdue and which, as part of the last budget, we announced and we are actively pursuing.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I refer to matters relating to employers, PRSI and exclusions.  Will the Minister explain why people who were self-employed, who were employers, whose businesses have folded and who have fallen the furthest in many cases have no right to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit?  Many such people are penniless and carry a good deal of debt at present and they have no basic source of cash.  It is rather humiliating for many.  I question the justice in this given that a European citizen from another country can come here and, within a short period, qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Will the Minister explain this anomaly?  What does the Minister propose to do to help our small and medium enterprise people who have fallen on hard times?  Is there anything for them in the form of social welfare benefits?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Such people are perfectly entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Many constituents of mine, who are also constituents of the Senator, are in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Some such people were self-employed and may still have a small self-employed income.  This was the first question I double checked when I came to the Department.  In the old days, when I was working in the commercial economy, I knew many people who had small self-employed incomes and who were in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  I double checked this was the case when I came to the Department.  What can catch some people out is the request for the previous year&rsquo;s accounts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>If such a person has a titim tubaisteach in income, last year might have shown a profit.  This would not entitle a person to a payment but the position may be different this year.  In that case the rule is not absolute.  I have answered innumerable parliamentary questions about this.  If one can prove that the income this year will be nil, one is still entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  I had a case where a person obtained management accounts that showed clearly that in the previous four months there was so little trading, a negligible income was generated.  The simple rule is once there is satisfactory documentary evidence that, for example, a single person&rsquo;s income for the current year will be less than the threshold, depending on his or her family circumstances, he or she will receive the payment.  He or she is entitled to &euro;196 a week and if he or she can prove his or her income will only be &euro;100 a week, for example, he or she will be paid &euro;96 a week.  That is clear.  The difficulty arises where the discretion comes in.  He or she must satisfy the deciding officer that is the case and he or she can appeal.  If an individual had a large income the previous year which has suddenly collapsed, he or she must come up with proof such as the loss of a contract.  In a simple case, he or she might have had a good contract last year with a company, supplier or purchaser and can prove it has disappeared, which gives him or her a clear-cut case when dealing with the deciding officer.  If he or she has lost a job here or there, he or she would have to come up with adequate proof that he or she had no work.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of the self-employed drawing unemployment assistance, we face the challenge outlined by the Senator but, on the other hand, we face a different challenge, which is if the income of a tradesman drops to &euro;100 a week and he or she is paid jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and activity picks up again, the Department is faced with the practical difficulty when he or she is caught working and drawing of establishing when his or her income was not &euro;100 a week.  The Bill provides that the simplest measure to implement regarding the self-employed is to activate them into a scheme, like the farm assist solution under the rural social scheme.  Good luck to them if they want to work in the evenings because they have given us the time, they were paid for it and they can work to their heart&rsquo;s content, subject to periodic means tests into the future.  In that way, money is not being given for nothing and, therefore, the working and drawing issue does not arise.</P>
        <P>The issue is worthy of debate.  They are entitled to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  The rural social scheme is a much better solution for the genuine under-employed farmer and for society and protecting the State&rsquo;s interest than an arrangement under which the person receives a payment and the State gets nothing in return.  In addition, especially with the self-employed, it is difficult to control those who are working and drawing and undercutting honest, decent people who pay their tax and insurance.  They are complaining all the time that they are being undercut by people in the black economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the self-employed people who fall on hard times still qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, even if their accounts are outstanding and taxes are due to the Revenue, given that they do not have the money to pay Revenue because the business has done so badly?  As the Minister correctly said, they are in trouble in the current year but they have to submit accounts for the previous year and they do not have the money to pay tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Revenue must go after and collect taxes where possible, but if a person has no income or assets, it is difficult to collect anything.  If these individuals were taken to court, the court would have to take into account their lack of income.</P>
        <P>On the social welfare side of the equation, we are dealing primarily with small operators and we advise them to go to their accountants and ask them to do up management accounts for the previous four months if last year&rsquo;s accounts are no good.  They will then be able to make a successful claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance based on the management accounts and they can <Col N="450"/>pay Revenue when they can because they will never be able to pay if no income is coming into their house.  These people are small operators earning less than &euro;200 a week and all they need is management or profit and loss accounts, not accounts costing thousands of euro, which show the claimants are not earning money.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">3.&mdash;The Courts Service is required automatically to notify the Minister of upward or any changes in maintenance orders.&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Part 12 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 imposes an obligation on spouses to maintain each other and their children and on parents to maintain their children.  The Act also imposes a liability on liable relatives of recipients of certain social welfare payments to contribute a determined amount to the Department towards that payment.  All one-parent family payment claimants are required to make ongoing efforts to seek maintenance from their spouse or other parent of their child.  This condition must be satisfied in every case.  Section 357 of the Act provides that payments made under a court order for maintenance shall offset, either in whole or in part, as the Department may determine, contributions due by the liable relative.  All liable relatives assessed with a maintenance liability are notified by the Department and issued with a determination order setting out the amounts of contribution assessed.  The method of assessment of the liable relative&rsquo;s ability to pay are specified in detail in regulations, specifically SI 142 of 2007.  Decisions can be reviewed where there is new information about or changes in the financial or household circumstances of a liable relative.  A change in the amount payable through a court order can be notified to the Department by the liable relative and considered in determining the amount of contribution claimed.  I do not know if that addresses the Senator&rsquo;s amendment but there would be an issue if the court had to inform the Department because these cases are held <i>in camera</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I have often raised this issue, which is open to abuse.  Although the amendment warrants serious redrafting, the issue of significant maintenance payments being made under the table and not declared remains.  A good way to address this would be to attach the earnings of the non-custodial parent to the claim or have the Courts Service notify the Department of maintenance orders.  That would place a significant administrative burden on the service.  Generally, in these cases, the male of the species tends not to want to have anything with the raising of his children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Sometimes maintenance orders are not worth the paper they are written on because those affected &mdash; mostly men &mdash; have absconded.

      </Speaker><Col N="451"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The amendment states: &ldquo;The Courts Service is required automatically to notify the Minister of upward or any changes in maintenance orders&rdquo;.  The Senators can bet their bottom dollar if there is money owing to the Department, I will go after it.  Sometimes in the debate on social welfare, there is a lack of proportion regarding the amounts we are dealing with.  While I am not one to sneeze at &euro;1 million, &euro;2 million, &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000, my calculation is that, we spend &euro;3,500 in the Department every second of every working day.  That means we spend approximately &euro;200,000 a minute and approximately &euro;2 million every ten minutes.  The reason I make this point is that the scale of savings to be made by focusing on the bigger issues runs to hundreds of millions.  That is what will make an impact and help to improve things for people.  We could spend &euro;2 million chasing a sum of &euro;3 million, but we could spend the same amount chasing a much bigger fish and get much greater bang for our buck.</P>
        <P>With regard to savings, we will introduce an identity card later this year which will streamline the process in many areas, including service provision and overhead costs, and affect anybody playing the game of double identities.  It will be a high grade identity card.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  There is an even bigger saving to be made by way of an arrangement to enable a claimant&rsquo;s voice to be recognised.  If it is not the claimant&rsquo;s voice, the messaging service will switch off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it voice messaging?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is an interactive service.  One is asked for one&rsquo;s name and PRSI number and if whoever responds is not the claimant, the system will switch off.  It will also be location sensitive.  In other words, if a claimant rings from outside the jurisdiction, the system will cut them off.  The only way the system can be fooled is if a claimant is working and rings from the place of employment.  We recognise this is an issue.  On the other hand, if a claimant takes a half an hour off to sign on, the person behind the desk will not know this either.  We are all aware that people take a day off each week to sign on.  The improvements made will free many front-line staff to chase those considered to be high risk, those who might be working and drawing welfare.  Staff will be free to conduct on the ground investigations.  The aim is to identify and target risk.</P>
        <P>The third area in which there is a huge saving to be made and a significant social objective to be achieved is activation.  This involves putting in place an employment action programme and inviting various claimants to an interview, for example, when they are moving to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance from job benefit or when they are signing on.  They will be asked to consider a job, an education or activation opportunity.  If they refuse and say they are not interested in any of these, it is only fair to send the investigator to ask them some really hard questions.  There are savings to be made by identifying people who are working and drawing benefits.  Any savings made will be applied to activation measures.  This will be a great boon for those who are unemployed.  We are all aware that the majority of unemployed persons are looking for work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the courts system, it should be noted that the Courts Service is an independent body established under statute to perform five functions, namely, to manage the courts; provide services for judges; provide information for the courts system; provide, manage and maintain court buildings and provide facilities for the users of the courts.  Family law is administered <i>in camera</i>.  Conveying information of the nature suggested in the amendment would be in breach of that principle because in a family law case the State is not conducting a prosecution, what one <Col N="452"/>has are two people sorting out their differences in court.  In addition, the functions suggested in the amendment, without the consent of the parties involved, would give rise to data protection issues.  The Courts Service is an independent provider of services for both parties in a case, in this instance, a civil or family law case.  An obligation of the kind suggested would involve the passing of information to the State, a third party, in a case which is private to both parties.  In addition, maintenance is increasingly paid not through the District Court office but via bank transfers.  Therefore, the Courts Service would not have information available on the actual sums of money paid over.  These are the difficulties involved.  I recognise that we do not raise a huge amount of money in maintenance payments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister touched on the issue of abuse.  It is estimated that approximately 10% of social welfare payments fall into that category.  That is a significant amount of money, considering that we are paying out a sum of &euro;20 billion.  Even if the figure was only 5%, the sum involved would amount to &euro;1 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be well worth following the money considering the size of the national deficit and the need to find savings of &euro;3 billion.  Does the Minister think the measures he is taking are adequate?  Also, what has he done about the scandal during the ash cloud crisis with regard to the social welfare payments not collected during those weeks?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted the Senator has asked that question because the ash cloud story is one of the great urban myths.  Some journalist had the story written and then asked the question.  When he received the information, it took him three weeks to disaggregate the information in a way that would allow him retain the original story.  We check claims in the third week of every month.  When the figures are compared with those for previous months, it is found that approximately 2% of claimants do not sign on in any one week.  In the week of the ash cloud, at 2%, the figure was no different.  There was a very good article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> in which the journalist in question used the accurate information.  I give him full credit for his integrity in carrying the story.  When we had the figures available, we looked at the nationalities of the 3,500 who had not signed on.  Some 85% were from a little country called Ireland.  These were the people who were finding cheap flights.  English people accounted for the next largest ethnic group. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">There were people from almost every country in the world, including eastern European countries, Pakistan and Australia.  The list was two pages long.  The myth about cheap flights is nonsensical; some of the countries are so far away it would not be worth someone&rsquo;s while flying here, even to claim the dole for one month.  Therefore, the research proved that virtually no one was availing of cheap flights to fly in to claim payments.</P>

        <P LI="2">3.&mdash;The Civil Registration Act 2004 is amended&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) in section 19, by the deletion of subsection (6)(<i>g</i>),</P>

        <P LI="4">22.&mdash;(1) This section applies without prejudice to the general duty on both parents to register a birth under section 19, whether those parents are married or not.</P>
        <P LI="4">(2) It shall be the duty of a parent whether married to the other parent or not, to furnish to the registrar particulars of the other parent.</P>
        <P LI="4">(3) Where a mother who is the informant for the purposes of section 19, gives particulars to the registrar of the father, those particulars shall be registered following the giving of notice to the person so named, unless he makes a claim, within such period as may be prescribed, that he is not father; and on the making of such claim the matter shall be referred by the registrar to the District Court for directions prior to the registration of the birth.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have sympathy for the thinking behind the amendment, it would raise many problems.  However, the issue is worth debating.  The current position on birth registration is that no man who is not married to the mother can be named as the father of a child in an entry unless there is consent or he is found to be the father of the child by the courts.  Under the provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004, where the parents are not married to each other at the time of the birth, the father&rsquo;s particulars can be registered if the parents make a joint application to do so, or if either makes an application accompanied by a statutory declaration from the other parent naming the father, or if either parent makes an application accompanied by a court order naming the father.  Where a father&rsquo;s details are not registered initially, the parents may re-register the birth to add his details.  The procedures for such re-registration are similar to those for registration.  All such parents married to each other following the birth are legally obliged to re-register the birth under the provision of section 24 of the Act.</P><Col N="454"/>
        <P>In its first report of October 2009 the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs recommended that it be made compulsory for the father&rsquo;s name to be registered on a child&rsquo;s birth certificate and the amendment would support this recommendation.  However, the Law Reform Commission issued a discussion document in September 2009 on the legal aspects of family relationships which included the issue of registration of the father&rsquo;s particulars.  The commission has invited submissions from interested parties and will issue recommendations in a further report which is not expected to issue before the autumn of this year.  The provisions contained in the amendment are premature, as any recommendation by the Law Reform Commission with regard to compulsory registration of the father&rsquo;s details on a birth record would be of considerable significance.  In the circumstances it is considered best to await the outcome of the deliberations of the Law Reform Commission before considering legislation on this matter.  It seems to be very simple but when one examines all the possible and conceivable cases it gets very complicated.  I suggest we wait for the Law Reform Commission.  I know the spirit of the amendment.  The big principle is easy but the devil is in the detail.  I will look forward to studying the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s deliberations in detail which no doubt the select committee will also do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister is genuine when he says he will wait for the report of the Law Reform Commission.  On that basis I will withdraw the amendment.  Nonetheless, this issue needs to be addressed and sooner rather than later.  That was the purpose of the amendment in its entirety, to bring about the closing of a situation which, to say the least, is undesirable.  I know the Minister is probably in agreement and I accept that such a seismic change will cause difficulties.  I look forward to the Minister delivering on a commitment to act upon the spirit of the amendment post the report of the Law Reform Commission.</P>

	<P>The Minister knows I have spoken in the House on the Civil Registration Act with regard to another issue, an amendment of the Act to deal with deaths abroad of Irish citizens and whose deaths are not registered in the State.  I know the Minister has met with some of the families in question who are constituents of ours.  I ask the Minister to say what progress has been made with regard to amending the legislation.  This affects the many hundreds of deaths of people who die abroad who may only have been outside the country for a short time for a holiday or during the summer.  One pressing reason may not have been mentioned in the debate so far and this is the potential abuse of Irish passports.  When a death is not registered in Ireland, the person&rsquo;s passport is still live and if that passport is stolen &mdash; such abuse has happened recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment has a lot of merit and I appreciate the proposer has indicated he may withdraw it.  The Minister has said he sympathises with the sentiments behind the amendment.  We need to give serious consideration to ensuring that birth certificates record the names of both parents, in so far as this is possible.  There should be an onus on people to comply with this condition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have discussed in the House on previous occasions the rights and obligations of fathers which, presumably, will be addressed in the Law Reform Commission report.  I am moved to support the sentiments of the amendment on the basis of a meeting I chaired with a lady called <Col N="455"/>Joanna Rose who was born as a result of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation and the use of a donor bank.  She was very anxious to identify her biological father from the point of view of her own health history, apart from anything else.  She was also anxious to identify her many siblings, having estimated that she had 300 siblings because her father was a student who donated to a sperm bank.  This is a very complicated area in which the rights of children come into play.  I urge the Minister to explore this issue in depth and that the various competing rights and priorities be examined, particularly bearing in mind the right of the child to know the identity of his or her biological parents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo much of what has been said on this amendment which Senator McCarthy has indicated he will withdraw.  This is a very significant area.  Senator Walsh has given an example and there are many examples in ordinary life where fathers are really not that interested in knowing their child even though they are living down the road.  Being a parent brings responsibility and for a long time in our laws we have allowed that responsibility to be avoided.  It is incumbent upon us, as legislators, to ensure that both parents, if possible, can be made responsible for their children, the first step of which is the registration at birth.  This is a significant subject for debate and I am glad to hear the Minister is actively thinking about it.  He realises it is a very complex area which will probably also come within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform when any amendments are made.  This debate is timely when we are facing into a constitutional amendment on children&rsquo;s rights.  The rights of children are paramount.  The Ombudsman for Children spoke today about the rights of the child.  It shows the nation&rsquo;s coming of age when this reality is faced up to.  We have waited quite a while for it and it is overdue.</P>
        <P>The amendment is probably not right for this Bill but it highlights an area which needs significant debate, legislation and much work in various Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator McDonald.  This subject warrants much discussion.  There are mothers who have no idea who are the fathers of their children.  This shows abject irresponsibility which must be addressed.  I do not know how it is to be addressed but certainly not in a social welfare Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Walsh raised an interesting point with regard to sperm donation and a father&rsquo;s responsibility in that case.  I do not think that in the case cited, that father was thinking of the child to be born; he had no interest in his responsibility.  I acknowledge the point about the child needing to know his or her medical history but the other side of the coin is where birth fathers, whose child was being given up for adoption, chose not to have their name on the child&rsquo;s birth certificate.  Under the Hague Convention, fathers will be asked if they want to have their name recorded on the birth certificate.  Ireland will be compliant with the Hague Convention this year when the Adoption Bill becomes law but prospective adoptive parents have been assessed under that for 15 to 18 years.</P>
        <P>We need to legislate for the child and this Bill is not the place to do so.  We did not have this debate in the Adoption Bill.  This issue should be raised in the context of the constitutional amendment on the rights of the child.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Constitution should lay down principles and it should not lay down statute law.  This whole issue is immensely complicated.  Currently in the case of married parents, owing to the statutory presumption of paternity set out in section 46 of the Status of Children Act 1987, that a married man is presumed to be the father of all the children born within that marriage, either or both parents are allowed to register a birth.  This creates a situation that can be difficult and it is a question of whether that should be changed to name <Col N="456"/>the biological father which could cause a few interesting hours of debate in the first place.  The reference to both parents seems to place a duty on both parents to attend to register in all cases.  This is likely to be impractical and potentially unworkable in some cases.</P>
        <P>Section 22(2) appears to propose the imposition of a duty on all parents to give the registrar particulars of the other parent, without exception.  This presupposes that a woman must be aware of the identity of the father in all cases.  It may well be that this is not the case and the imposition of such a requirement may be in breach of the rules of natural justice.  Other jurisdictions such as England and Wales have provided for exceptions to similar provisions involving lack of consent, age, incest and unknown identity etc.  I could go on with the problems this will raise.  I accept the principle but the details lead to a major amount of challenges.  For example, section 22(3) proposes to require the registrar of births to enter the particulars of the named father as given by the mother in the register of births following the issue of the notice to the father unless he rebuts paternity within a period as may be prescribed, in which case the registrar shall refer to the District Court for direction.  The proposal appears to place an inordinate duty on the registrar in assisting in the determination of paternity matters, currently appropriate only to the parents and the courts.  We have a Law Reform Commission that is expert in examining the potential complexities of a change in the law.  We should allow the Law Reform Commission to do its job, issue a report and then examine it carefully.  It looks simple but it is not.  The more one goes into it, the more complicated it gets and one must ask if one wants to go down this route because we may be creating more chaos than we are solving.  This is not a case of running away from a hard decision but ensuring that if one is changing it, it is changed for the better.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">3.&mdash;Section 257(<i>a</i>) of the Principal Act is deleted and the following paragraph substituted therefor:</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 (in the case of an employer) or not exceeding &euro;3,000 (in the case of any other person) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both, and in the case of a person other than an employer, particular consideration shall be given to community service under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983,&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I do not propose to accept this amendment concerning penalties for offences.  The maximum penalty currently in place in criminal cases taken summarily in the District Court is a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 per offence or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both fine and imprisonment.  A commencement order for the Fines Act 2010, which is currently being drafted, will increase the fine from &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,500 per offence.  A community service order under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act may be made by any court other than the Special Criminal Court in respect of any offender over 16 years of age convicted of an offence for which the appropriate sentence would otherwise be one of imprisonment.  The Department&rsquo;s control activities report has been examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Department has a programme of employer inspections to ensure accurate records of employees are kept, the correct class of PRSI is being deducted and remitted, employees are not concurrently working <Col N="457"/>and claiming social welfare payments and employers are aware of their responsibilities with regard to social welfare and tax legislation.  Due to industrial action, total year-to-date control savings and reviews have not been fully recorded.  However, on the basis of what has been recorded to the end of May 2010, approximately 137,000 reviews have been carried out as well as 332 employer inspections, yielding average savings of &euro;110 million.  There are approximately 600 staff at local and regional level whose work includes control activities.  We are continuing to target this area.  Most people brought to court by the Department are not employers; the vast majority are recipients of social welfare.  I will pass the detail onto the Members later.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">3.&mdash;Section 198 of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (3D):</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;(3E) The payment of a supplement towards the amount of rent payable by a person in respect of his or her residence will be paid to this person on the day it is due according to the tenancy agreement of this person with their landlord.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments concern rent supplement.  I need not tell the Minister how much rent supplement is costing the State.  The historical experience of rent supplement is that it is paid for houses, flats and apartments built on foot of generous tax breaks, which contributed to the fuelling of the construction bubble in this country for a significant period.  One of the real casualties of that is that few social houses were built.  At the moment we have too many houses and some people in NAMA are considering knocking houses, which is an appalling vista.  We had a very good system when the State was building local authority houses and giving grants to voluntary organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and organisations dealing with care of the elderly.  They built specific houses for the people they cared for and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was involved in this and was happy to see that diversity in the provision of social housing.  We also had good affordable housing schemes when that was an issue.  The criticism at the time was that there were not enough houses.</P>
        <P>This amendment seeks to address a number of key issues.  I ask the Minister to give an indication of how much rent supplement costs the State.  On the balance of costs, the figures from a number of years ago ran into millions of euro.  The enactment of the legislation establishing the Private Residential Tenancies Board gave us an insight into who owns rental property and who engages in that activity.  What does rent supplement cost and what will it cost in terms of building social houses and stopping this scheme?  What thinking has prevailed in terms of how the Department seeks to raise money and provide better bang for its buck?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>As is often the case on Committee Stage, this series of amendments allows us to wander a little beyond the Bill itself.  Interesting questions have been posed by Senator McCarthy and may be more pertinent to the Minister and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The questions are nevertheless worth asking.  Rent supplement has multiplied one thousandfold over the past 20 years and is an interesting political concept.  Senator McCarthy <Col N="458"/>referred to the tens and hundreds of millions of euro expended on rent supplement.  The Department of Social Protection and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government need to sit down to examine how these moneys can be best expended.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>One of the problems is our obsession with house ownership.  In the past day or two I read a magazine that Members receive from the German Embassy, which gives facts and figures on life in Germany.  The relatively low rate of home ownership compared to renting in Germany struck me.  This is normal across Europe but we have a different way of doing business in Ireland.  Rent supplement has been part of the equation in allowing people to find proper accommodation.  It has a role.  These amendments, which will not be accepted, are about tidying up matters and having certainty and propriety.  I am interested in the broad comments of the Minister on rent supplement and rental allowance.  It is a necessity at a time when we do not have substantial numbers of vacant local authority housing units.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing must work on this.  Most constituents find it hard to accept people are on waiting lists for social housing when there are so many vacant houses in the private sector and at local authority level.  The methodology for allocating housing can be slow and local authority houses in virtually every local authority area are vacant for six to 12 months without being allocated.  This is a problem.  There is the financial consideration of repairing houses and the regulations that mean the house must be in pristine condition before it can be allocated.  Housing is a very interesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Bradford is moving away from the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Sadly, as I predicted, I am moving away from the amendments.  Housing is interesting in the sense that, even when little money is available to be allocated, there is always a choice in how this will be done.  Consideration must be given to the manner in which so much money is being spent on rent allowance, although there are other ways to spend the money, while housing people and their families.  I await with interest the Minister&rsquo;s comments on this issue.  While I will not comment on the specific amendments tabled by my colleague, Senator McCarthy, I will second them for debating purposes.  I refer to the facts and figures in respect of rent allowance and seek the Minister&rsquo;s views on how the money could be used in other ways.  While I acknowledge that I have meandered in my comments, the Minister often meanders to make interesting comments also.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should stick to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Consequently, I look forward to his musings and meandering in response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the proposal made in amendment No. 8 that the supplement be paid in its entirety by the HSE to the landlord.  I seek the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the amendment, in particular, and the efficiency of the HSE&rsquo;s involvement in the paying of rent supplement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>First, since musings and meandering are being allowed, I will revert to the previous&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should note they are not being allowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence.  I refer to the aforementioned employer cases, as I have found the relevant statistics.  In the full year figures for 2009 there were two instances of failure to pay PRSI, four instances of failure to produce maintained <Col N="459"/>records and one case of failure to provide the employment details of employees.  As the total number of employers&rsquo; cases finalised in court was seven, it is a myth that many employers are being caught in serious cases.  As for the outcomes, three were fined, one was given the Probation Act, one was given community service, one case was struck out and one was withdrawn.  If one excludes the latter two cases, that equates to five convictions.  Consequently, it is not the huge ball of wax that people sometimes consider it to be.  Therefore, the amendment would not have had the effect Senator McCarthy might have anticipated.  However, it is worth asking the question and the answer is interesting.  Certainly, when I received the statistics, it was reassuring.</P>
        <P>As for rent supplement, I held a meeting on this issue last week with Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Communities of Ireland and one other group.  I held meetings with some of them previously and continuously engage with them.  Many issues arise in this context that must be considered.  First, the State is paying approximately &euro;500 millin &mdash; I believe &euro;512 million was allocated in the Estimate this year &mdash; which is a lot of money.  Second, one must be clear that my Department, not the HSE, is the payer.  While community welfare officers handle this matter for my Department, they, in turn, are due to transfer to the Department of Social Protection, which will make it much clearer that it is the payer.  However, my Department neither has nor seeks to have a relationship with the landlord.  In other words, the tenant, not the Department, is the tenant of the landlord.  If we were to make the Department the tenant of the landlord, there would be further complications about the appropriateness of the accommodation and so on.  Obviously, the Department sets a general condition when paying, but, fundamentally, one picks one&rsquo;s own accommodation.</P>
        <P>While the Department asks for PPS numbers, it does not receive them in all cases.  In fact, it does not receive them in many cases.  I should specify &mdash; funnily enough, some of the aforementioned groups dealing with tenants are reluctant to impose this &mdash; that every landlord should produce a PPS number or there will be no rent supplement payable.  Moreover, this is the time to do this when there are plenty of houses on the market and when it is a buyer&rsquo;s, rather than a seller&rsquo;s, market.  It is not satisfactory that someone could rent a house, have the State indirectly pay for it and not account for all of their taxes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, I was a little taken aback when I found that some of the groups were reluctant in this regard.  They suggested it would place an onus on vulnerable persons.  However, I do not perceive it in that way because there is adequate accommodation available and those who find it difficult to find accommodation should be given assistance.  Once it is known that one either gives one&rsquo;s PPS number or one will not be able to rent one&rsquo;s property, particularly while there is a glut in the market, the numbers will be forthcoming.  I am interested in hearing Members&rsquo; views in this regard.</P>
        <P>A second point is that having made checks, my Department provides data for the Revenue Commissioners, on which they engage in data matching.  The rate of compliance with the tax law is very high, at approximately 88%.  Consequently, there is a high rate of compliance and there is not a large number of landlords who are not paying their taxes, according to the data being matched.  The good news is that although my Department is receiving a much lower number of PPS numbers, when the names and addresses are forwarded and there is data matching, the compliance level is high, which is important.  However, it should be at 100%.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss this issue with the Private Residential Tenancies Board because it is very important that when someone rents a property, particularly when he or she receives State aid in doing so, the law is fully complied with by the landlord.  While my Department does not <Col N="460"/>have a direct relationship with the landlord, there should be a method, whereby it would make sure the landlord was complying with the law on registration.  In this regard, the question on the standard of accommodation, etc. should be basic, but that is the responsibility of the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  However, it is important to tie together these matters as best we can to ensure a better standard of accommodation is provided and that people are not renting substandard accommodation.</P>
        <P>Other issues arise in respect of when one should pay.  There is discretion to pay deposits when it is considered necessary.  In many cases, it is not needed, as a person who rents a property has sufficient money for this purpose.  Alternatively, in some cases, people must rent for a while before being placed on the housing list and so on.</P>
        <P>The other issue to which Senator Bradford referred is valid.  Some persons have been in receipt of rent supplement for far longer than two years.  The reason this is happening is complex and it is not completely due to the failure of local authorities to provide housing.  In some cases, people have rented good accommodation, are comfortable in it and have a good relationship with their landlord.  They are living in a good area and do not particularly want what is being offered by the local authority because they might consider that they would be moving from a mixed to a socially segregated area.  There are many complex reasons associated with this issue.</P>
        <P>That said, I intend to discuss this matter with my colleagues during the holidays when one will have an opportunity to discuss issues that sometimes can be difficult to discuss when the D&aacute;il is sitting.  My gut feeling is that in an ideal world one should move to the rental accommodation scheme after a certain period.  In addition &mdash; I acknowledge I am straying as far or perhaps further than Senator Bradford &mdash; I believe in the provision of integrated housing.  I refer to RAPID programme areas and the areas in which there are the greatest levels of deprivation in our society, regardless of the town in question, and compare the chances children have when growing up in rural Ireland, irrespective of parental circumstances, against those of children in urban areas.  Segregation in our cities and towns has been an utter disaster; one could get much better outcomes in more mixed societies.  The question on the reason children born in certain areas of our towns have from the day they are born a much lower chance of, for example, finishing second level or going on to third level education, have a much higher chance of winding up addicted to drugs or in prison than those born in other areas warrants wider debate.  This is not fault of the child, as all newborn children are equal.  Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was a very good measure because it moved in the direction of mixed housing.  I suspect that one reason people are hanging on to rent supplement is some parents perceive short-term renting as offering a better outcome for their children than perhaps being accommodated in a segregated housing estate.  Moreover, the statistics bear out the point that they could be correct.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, I do not agree with the German model.  While I have nothing against long-term leasing, whatever suits the Germans suits them.  There are two points we must consider on housing, one of which is that, for some reason, the Irish do not respect things they do not own in the same way as they respect things they own.  Those of us who have canvassed in housing estates could tell the purchased houses from the rented houses.  We all know this can be done.  Ownership is fundamental in respect of this Bill.</P>
        <P>I concur with the theory that people who own property respect it, feel part of society and are more likely to be contributors to voluntary organisations.  Ownership changes one&rsquo;s psychological and social position and one&rsquo;s self-worth.  I am still very old-fashioned in my belief in this regard.  When people advocate newfangled social theories, they often want to try them on the less well off.  I always say that if it is such a great idea, we should see whether the very rich <Col N="461"/>opt for it, and that if they do the rest of us will consider it.  Many people who are fairly well off are very quick to suggest others should do things they would not dream of doing themselves.  We should always be a little wary of this syndrome.  When one meets people working in planning units in local authorities, for example, they are dead set against rural houses, but when one inquires as to where they live, one finds they are living in them.  I will say no more on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose the amendment.  I am not sure whether it will be pressed.  I welcome the announcement that the community welfare officers will be transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  That represents an holistic move.  It is far better to have the staff within the one Department.  We may need to examine the relationship between the RAS and local councils.</P>
        <P>I support the Minister&rsquo;s idea that the PPS numbers of 100% of landlords should be provided.  This one small move will assist in stamping out potential problems or fraud in this area.  The amendment would play greatly with landlord and tenant laws and affect rights to tenancies if the Government is paying the rent.  This was touched upon by the Minister.  The amendment cannot be accepted for this reason.  I understand the sentiment behind the Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment but I do not believe its objective can be achieved in this way.  PPS numbers would assist in addressing the matter.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Minister&rsquo;s pronouncement on social housing and the comparison between the Irish and German models, we could have a debate on this in the next term.  I fully support and agree with the Minister&rsquo;s view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated the cost of the rent supplement totalled &euro;500 million.  How many people are in receipt of rent supplement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 95,000 people are receiving rent supplement and 32,000 are in receipt of payments for more than 18 months.  The provision for 2009 was &euro;510 million and that for 2010 is &euro;512 million.  The Deputy must understand rents have decreased and, therefore, the allocation will accommodate more people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Ninety-five thousand is the general figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We inform the PRTB of new tenancies but not all tenancies must register with the PRTB.  All this must be followed up.  I am very keen to try to achieve the best value possible for the tenant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Minister that the German model is not my personal preference and that I illustrated it for the purpose of debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The sum of &euro;510 million is a hell of a lot of money, bearing in mind that the tax compliance rate is 88%.  All the people who are making money from rental income should be paying tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>They should be assessed and pay their tax.  While it is good that the compliance rate is 88%, this suggests 12% of people are not compliant.  Given the cost of &euro;510 million, one wonders how many of the 95,000 recipients are renting properties from those landlords who are among the 12% of non-compliant persons.  In the context of budgetary changes, it is helpful to know these statistics.</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>With regard to the 32,000 people who have been in receipt of payments for 18 months and longer, I understand the PRTB seeks PPS numbers when a tenancy is registered, at least from the tenant.  I am not entirely sure about whether they are sought from the landlord.  I have dealt with cases in this area and found the PRTB to be very helpful.</P>
        <P>From debating legislation in this House, I know the PRTB is not a State service.  It is not a public service and is run by a private company.  Am I correct in that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as I know, it is a board under the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I believed there was more distance between it and the Department.  I found the board very efficient and good at providing advice sought by public representatives for constituents.</P>
        <P>Why are all tenancies not registered with the PRTB, as stated by the Minister?  If the State is paying &euro;510 million per annum, it would be very helpful to know the PPS numbers of the landlords.  It is not beyond reason to be given this information.  I wish the authorities luck in bringing the 12% who are not compliant into the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I know but private people are living in them.  From my experience as a constituency politician trying to get councils to make improvements to houses, I believe it would be far more helpful to have them brought under the auspices of the PRTB.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister that Irish people really like to own their own houses.  It is very self-evident that resident associations always flourish in housing estates where people own their houses.  In my area, unfortunately, the local authorities are not building any new houses and have not done so for a long time.  I agree with the Minister that being on rent supplement continuously for two years does not ensure regularity for families.  The RAS scheme is very good.  Perhaps we should explore further the idea of having leases of a more long-term nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We are straying far from the amendment.  All details of new rent supplement tenancies are electronically provided by the Department to the PRTB.  Where registration is required, the landlord has up to one month after the commencement of the tenancy to register with the PRTB.  Not all tenancies are required to be registered with the PRTB as the relevant legislation, the Residential Tenancies Act, provides for certain exceptions.  According to the PRTB, these cover business premises, even where partly residential; a dwelling to which Part II of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act 1982 applies, i.e. formerly rent controlled dwelling occupied by the &ldquo;original tenant&rdquo; or his/her spouse, or to which Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980 applies, i.e. long occupation equity lease tenancies; a dwelling occupied under a shared ownership lease; a dwelling in which the landlord is also resident; a dwelling in which the spouse, parent or child of the landlord is resident and there is no written lease or tenancy agreement; and a dwelling that is occupied rent free.  Senators will note there are very good reasons for most of the exceptions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated he would have discussions with some of his colleagues, presumably including those from the housing sector, over the course of the summer.  The Department of Social Protection will be providing &euro;500 million to resolve a problem that, from a political perspective, should be solved by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  We often mention how, through the decades, a lack of joined up Government planning has posed a difficulty.  Does the Minister&rsquo;s Department have a working group or would it try to develop one with the appropriate housing Department to consider how best to use this sum of money?  Only when the Minister put the amount on the record in his informative responses were we struck by the figure.  In the current economic climate when billions and trillions are mentioned, &euro;500 million does not always hit the front page, but it is still a great deal of money and we have a duty to determine how best to use it.</P>
        <P>Our primary duty is to ensure that citizens are housed in the best possible circumstances.  We must be thankful for how rent allowance has contributed to the solution, but the amount of money is considerable and, from a long-term perspective, the two Departments must ensure it is spent in a strategic and well planned manner.  Is the Minister in discussions along these lines and will we see new policy initiatives?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure it would be quite so expensive or that there are always cheap options.  I suggest we do a little sum.  We are spending approximately &euro;500 million and the 95,000 households can be rounded up to 100,000.  At an average cost of &euro;150,000 per house built by a local authority, the total is &euro;15 billion.  It will be 30 years before we spend &euro;15 billion housing those 100,000 households.  As such, the option might not be the dearest.  Indeed, it might be cheaper than building a house and handing it over.  The question is whether the social outcome is as good.  The debate should centre on what is best for the tenant.</P>
        <P>The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, has many attractions.  Transferring people onto long-term tenancies after two years provides them with security in their houses.  It also allows the prospective tenant to choose the property and removes social segregation, as someone can choose an available property in a mixed area.  It is better than rent allowance because it is more secure.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced that there is a cheap way to house 100,000 tenancies.  After a certain time, people are entitled to a more permanent arrangement for their social good.  I must ask myself which is better.  Should I put people into large, clustered housing estates and segregate everyone or should they be mixed around, which is the current tendency?  There are mixed opinions on this question, as some permanent residents do not like tenanted residents.  The former might prefer long-term tenanted residents, people with an interest in the properties in which they live, over short-term tenanted residents who do not care about the condition of the properties, whether they are painted and so on.</P>
        <P>Many issues must be discussed, although they are more proper to a housing debate.  It is useful for us to consider this particular payment in the social context as opposed to in terms of its cost alone.  The cost is not too expensive, since borrowing &euro;15 billion tomorrow to house 100,000 families would not leave one with much change.  Some people&rsquo;s housing needs are short term.  Given family formations and so on, short-term accommodation will always be required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">3.--The Minister shall, within 2 months of the enactment of this Act, report to the Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection on the progress made in establishing a register of Irish citizens that have died abroad.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister is acutely aware of this situation.  Some months ago, family members of citizens who died abroad made a strong and reasonable case for the registration in Ireland of their loved ones&rsquo; deaths.  That both families needed to travel to America to organise the documentation and so on was heartbreaking.  The young men in question died in their prime.  As a nation, it was unpatriotic of us to refuse to allow their families to register their deaths.  The committee discussed the possibility of our Embassy in America registering their deaths.  Senator Healy Eames, who has been vocal on this issue, attended that meeting.  She highlighted a situation regarding the passport of a deceased person.  There is potential for such passports to be abused.</P>
        <P>Consider the heartache.  Those families are in limbo and the situation is uncertain.  The Minister should reconsider his position.  He is far-thinking and connected with the people.  He has the ability to look on my amendment favourably.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator McFadden&rsquo;s amendment.  Recently, people who gave evidence at a committee rightly encountered problems with the media afterwards.  It is bad enough that a family must bury a son or daughter.  We are discussing someone who takes a year out &mdash; economic necessity might not allow for that now &mdash; to go to Australia or America, has a tragedy befall him or her and arrives home in a coffin.  Unfortunately, a family living near me in west County Cork needed to undertake one such visit to Australia.  On top of this was the technical administrative grief of trying to register a death in Ireland.  Every effort should be made.</P>
        <P>The Minister discussed patriotism, the 85% of Irish people and the ash cloud.  This is another situation that uniquely pertains to the citizens of this Republic.  We owe a duty to the unfortunate people who, after going through the horrific ordeal of burying a family member, must deal with this ridiculous situation.  No Minister would add to a grieving family&rsquo;s burdens and the current situation does not exist just to do that.  Nonetheless, having heard the evidence at first hand and given that families have suffered because of the system, there is an onus upon us.  Senator McFadden&rsquo;s amendment is worthy of acceptance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accept the amendment because the issue is too complicated.  The Chief Registrar was with me when I met the families.  We had a good discussion with them and are considering the issue in the context of an amendment to registration law.  There are a number of issues to be dealt with.  The extension to all citizens who die abroad is impractical.  Under our law, if one is the grandson or granddaughter of a person born in Ireland, one is entitled to Irish citizenship, so we are talking about millions of people.  That is definitely out of the question.  The debate centres around other people&rsquo;s domicile, and mostly this refers to people who went away, for example, on holidays, so the legislation would have to be confined to that.  It would not be practicable to go any further than that.  One then gets into other issues.</P>
        <P>The documentation required for the registration of a death in the State is based on the requirements of the civil registration legislation.  Should the provisions be extended, registrars would, as a matter of routine, be required to deal with documentation based on a variety of legislative provisions for many countries.  This would inevitably undermine the present standardised approach relating to evidence of the event and the recording of the details of the deceased.  This would have an effect on epidemiological studies and so on.  There would also be the issue of resolving arguments about the cause and place of death and so on, where such arguments arose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the issues the families mentioned was that it would not be a death certificate in the legal sense we know it in Ireland.  What they really want is a recording of the death in Ireland, not necessarily the document that is needed for all types of legal purposes which is normally obtained from the country of origin.  There is an exception in our law which provides that if a country does not provide a death certificate, we can do it.  That is in law.  If one dies in a country that will not provide a death certificate, one can be obtained here.  Where a person dies in a country with a well developed registration system and the death certificate can be obtained, for legal purposes that document covers everything.</P>
        <P>I have heard what the families have said, that they want some Irish record of the death.  Whether that would be a death certificate in the legal sense or something slightly different is worth looking at.  We will examine this situation and I am anxious to progress it in the context of any further law.  It will take time and the families know and are agreeable to that.  I have given an undertaking to review the existing provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004 and this issue will be dealt with in that context.  I have to engage in considerable consultation before this matter is brought to a conclusion.</P>

	<P>The Minister has met the families and knows precisely what they are requesting.  I would not for a second propose something that involved us in the complexities of citizenship.  We shall come to that or related aspects when we discuss amendment No. 15.  There are significant issues to be addressed.  The Minister knows exactly what the families want and if it is reasonable or practicable, there should not be any difficulty in meeting the need.  Regardless of what the document is to be called, they are seeking recognition in this country that they have lost a loved one abroad.</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated that the amendment was too technical to take on board.  He cannot accept this amendment or any other at this time because in the event he did, the D&aacute;il would have to be recalled and we all know that in practice this will not happen.</P>

	<P>This amendment proposes that, &ldquo;The Minister shall, within 2 months of the enactment of this Act, report to the Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection on the progress made in establishing a register of Irish citizens that have died abroad&rdquo;.  I have no problem.  If the Senator wants me to report progress, all he has to do is table a motion for the Adjournment or on Private Members&rsquo; time and I shall come in at any time.  In terms of a technical amendment, it is superfluous.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I know the grandparents particularly well.  While the issues identified do not appear to represent insurmountable barriers, it is clear that whatever is decided will require careful consideration, comprehensive interdepartmental consultation and discussion among Government agencies.  The families accepted that this was going to take time and I was very clear in my comments.  When one is at this a long time, one knows that teasing out legislative issues takes time and that we are always overpromising and underdelivering.  My policy is to try to be kind to people by explaining why it takes time and the natural length of time these things take.  It is not an excuse for doing nothing but rather so that people do not get unrealistic expectations.  I have also undertaken to consider this issue to see whether it may be resolved and bring in legislative change to the Civil Registration Act to address this issue to their satisfaction.  The families have been very reasonable.  When they met the registrar and heard about all the complexities, they took them on board, and I believe they were willing to accept something less than the full registration of the death of every Irish citizen abroad, which is impracticable.  We are moving forward and perhaps the best thing we could agree today is that some time in the autumn, either through promotion in the House or on foot of a request for me to address an Adjournment matter, I will come to the House to give an update of where we are.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">3.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 2 months of the enactment of this Act, report to the Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection on the progress made on providing a system of attachment to social welfare payments for fines and civil debt.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks that the Minister, within two months of the enactment of the Bill, would report to the Joint Committee on Social Protection on the progress made in providing a system of attachment to social welfare payments for fines and civil debt.  This amendment was also discussed in the D&aacute;il and I feel very strongly about people going to jail for not paying small amounts of debt.  There is a good deal of frustration, especially within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and an enormous waste of money where garda&iacute; bring someone to court, he or she is sentenced to jail and released the next day.  This amendment seeks to allow fines and civil debt to be attached to social welfare payments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a fines Bill which allows for instalment payments.  The court decides what a person can pay.  There is always a problem with people on social welfare.  One cannot go below the supplementary welfare rate which is the same as the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance basic rate and the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit basic rate.  The fines Bill is the way to go.  The Department recovers moneys owed to it.  I get endless representations from Deputies and Senators asking for the Department to go easy in such cases.  I have sympathy for those affected because none of us can live beneath a certain threshold.  The best approach is to stop people receiving overpayments because going after them to retrieve them can be a painful experience.  While overpayment can be hard to avoid if people do not give all the information, one still cannot get blood out of a turnip afterwards.  Even if one had all the orders in the world, there is only so much money that can be taken off a social welfare recipient.</P>
        <P>I believe the Fines Act was a great step forward.  Before that, one person earning &euro;100,000 a year and another earning &euro;10,000 could both be fined &euro;1,000.  It was not the same penalty, however.  The first person could easily pull out a cheque book, write the cheque and not think about the fine again.  For the other person, however, it would have been a huge penalty.  The Fines Act addressed this anomaly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It must also be remembered the numbers brought to court for social welfare fraud are relatively small.  Overpayments occur for many reasons.  The most common is the older person whose social welfare payments continue to their next-of-kin but the older person had money in the bank which they did not declare.  Some time after they died it can come out in the <Col N="468"/>probate.  These are the overpayments we get without fail.  While people must declare as they have an obligation to do so, on the scale of wrongs that have been committed in our society I am not sure these are the greatest.  There is also a burden already on those less well off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that going to jail for petty indebtedness is not the best approach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  If people knew the system, they should not go to jail for debts.  A court will not require them to pay a debt they cannot pay.  A court will not order someone to pay an amount of their income that they need to live on.  The instalment payment system introduced by the Fines Act has been a step forward in this regard.</P>
        <P>Over the years I have seen people go to jail for the non-payment of ordinary debts.  The only reason this happened was because they did not understand that if they went to court, admitted their debt, had the court examine their means, then the court could not order them to pay more than they could reasonably afford.  I encourage people to use MABS, the free advisory budgeting agency, which will give them this advice.</P>
        <P>This is not a licence for people to ignore their debts, however.  The Fines Act does ensure people are not sent to jail unnecessarily.  While we must acknowledge the prisons are not exactly full of debtors, I agree there are other approaches in dealing with this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>One always finds the guy who does not want houses built in rural areas is the one with the nice little house tucked into a little green field on the side of a hill.  It is the same with social welfare fraud.  While I accept fraud deserves to face the full rigours of the justice system, I always ask those who go on about it their views on tax evasion.  Tax evasion is as serious a crime as social welfare fraud.  While I accept he cannot give me an exact figure, will the Minister give us an approximate figure as to how much social welfare fraud costs the State every year?</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago two brothers were murdered by gangland criminals in this city.  The media coverage said they were known to the Garda, as if their lives were worth less and almost justifying their murders.  There are several people who walk freely around the Republic who almost brought the economy to the brink of collapse.  They are also known to the Garda but then that is a societal interpretation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The anecdotal evidence on guesstimates for social welfare fraud we receive from community welfare officers and those in the Department suggests a 5% to 10% figure of the overall budget.  If that were correct, it would mean it is a very significant sum of money, some &euro;2.5 billion.  Redistributing that among the needier in the system would make a big difference.</P>
        <P>The battle against social welfare overpayments or mispayments is difficult because of this country&rsquo;s certain traditions and culture.  If it were presented not as an attack on social welfare fraud but an attempt to ensure moneys in the budget could be used more effectively to look after those most in need, we might be a little more successful.  We spoke earlier about housing.  Similarly, when we go tackling fraud and evasion, there is something in the Irish psyche that does not warm them to that sort of battle.</P>
        <P>Is there any possibility of getting an accurate figure for social welfare payments made in error?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2009 the Department had a target of making savings of &euro;616 million in social welfare fraud.  In 2010, the target was significantly lowered to &euro;533 million.  At <Col N="469"/>such a time of budgetary pressure, is it correct to do this since one would expect us to go really hard against those committing fraud?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I approach this from different angles.  The Department carries out fraud and error surveys in payments.  At times it can be very hard to differentiate between fraud and error and whether a person culpably held back certain information.  We all have had constituents in our offices telling us they did not understand the system.  Sometimes one believes them; other times not.</P>
        <P>Then there is the born loser who if they knew how to do it straight would have got as much as they did doing it illegally.  Maybe I am a little softie in that I do not pass moral judgment on any of these people.</P>
        <P>All Members have had the case of a person inheriting money that was not declared.  Again, it was a case of people not understanding the rules or believing them a little penal, with which some of us would agree and others would not.  Naturally, when an interest rate of 20% is being charged on capital, there will be two views on the matter.</P>
        <P>We should try as far as possible to eliminate wrongful payments.  There are two ways to do this, one of which is to police the system more.  I have statistics for the checking of errors, fraud services and so on.  The second way is to change the structure which may be facilitaing cheating.  By changing it, one eliminates the opportunity to cheat.  We need to identify the areas in which fraud is likely to occur.  We are all aware that, despite having money in the bank, people will claim benefits.  We will get the people concerned sooner or later, given that there is an effective system in place.  While it would be better if we could recoup this money earlier, we get it back in the end because when probate is taken out, there is an obligation to make a declaration.</P>
        <P>One of the main ways identified by which people engage in fraud is that they claim using two identities or child benefit payments at 15 post offices.  Members will be aware of the game played in this regard.  There is a simple answer, namely, the introduction of a high quality card providing for facial recognition, similar to a passport with a chip.  This would be worth more than any number of inspectors running around trying to check up on people.  Through the use of technology, we could tighten the system and close down the opportunities for abuse.</P>
        <P>Another way identified by which people engage in fraud &mdash; I suppose this is understandable if one is tight for cash and under pressure, although it is not justifiable &mdash; is that they work and draw benefits at the same time.  I cite as an example a self-employed carpenter who has hit hard times, is in receipt of benefit and takes on a job not expecting to have one the following week but who then gets another one the following week.  The structure in place is wrong, as it is too tempting to do this.  One would have to have an army of people policing everybody and every back kitchen being constructed.  My general view is that self-employed persons would be much better off participating in activation schemes which would allow them to work at night, as long as they paid their taxes and PRSI.  On the other hand, if one gives them approximately &euro;204 a week and allows them to work for 19.5 hours, one receives a huge contribution for them and value for money; it is a win-win.  In this way one structurally solves the problem of fraud in the system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another area in which it is obvious people are breaking the rules is that of cohabitation.  It is advantageous because people receive two single payments and two rent allowances which is better than one full payment and a two thirds payment if one is cohabiting officially.  I do not believe anyone can quantify the level to which this is happening.  It was proposed that a single working age payment be introduced.  The late Deputy Seamus Brennan introduced proposals that would have assisted in addressing the cohabiting rule, which is unenforceable.  It is a difficult area to police.  There are approximately 620 staff at local, regional and national level <Col N="470"/>engaged on a full or part-time basis in the control of fraud or abuses of the social welfare system.  This figure includes 392 inspectors.  However, if the system easily lends itself to cheating, all of the policing activities in the world will not eliminate it.  I am examining the areas wherein there is widespread fraud to determine why it is taking place and the motivations for it to see if we can change the system to make it easier for people to operate legally.  Many years ago when tax rates were high, people cheated because the advantages of working in that way were so minimal.</P>
        <P>I do not know what the level of fraud is, but I do not believe a saving of &euro;2 billion can be made.  If somebody could come up with a programme to save me &euro;2 billion, I would take it on board like a shot because there is an awful lot I could do with such a sum.  I will not go easy on those who cheat the system.  I am examining the biggest structural areas which offer the greatest opportunity to engage in fraud.  However, I do not believe there is that kind of money to be plucked from trees.  We should try to keep things in proportion.</P>
        <P>Tax cheating was mentioned.  If one took it to the absolute letter of the law, it is fair to say the amount is mega .  With no disrespect to anyone, there are many PAYE workers, not to mind self-employed persons, who are always the target in terms of tax cheating, who do the odd job, give grinds and so on who do not necessarily declare it on their tax forms.  Technically, anybody who accepts a tip in a restaurant and so on and does not declare it for tax purposes is breaking the law.  It is not only the big guys who are involved in tax fraud, to be puritan about this, although I am not making any judgments.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On social welfare fraud, one must keep a sense of balance and reality.  We have all had to do this when confronted by a person who received an over-payment.  The people concerned are not the biggest cheats in the world.  In recent times I have received representations from Senators and Deputies about over-payments, asking if the Department can go easy on those concerned, as they cannot afford to pay and so on.  While, on the one hand, I want to eliminate opportunities to engage in fraud and cheat, we must also keep a sense of proportion, as most of those in receipt of social welfare payments are not in the higher echelons when it come to cheating the State of major amounts of money.  In this regard, it is interesting to note, when one looks at the number of convictions for social welfare fraud, that it normally involves small sums of money when compared, for example, to what we see in the newspapers for tax defaulters at the top end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody is suggesting the Minister is going easy on fraud.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  I support his notion that a change in the structure would be far better, rather than sending out inspectors to stumble on incidents of fraud.  The Minister&rsquo;s example of back kitchen extensions is a good one.  Perhaps if we had helicopters flying around the place, we would notice some of them.  Self-declaration of works might be the way forward.  The Minister mentioned the introduction of an identity card and the giving of PPS numbers, all of which will assist in the crack down on fraud.  Change in the structure is important.  If a system is not defrauded or challenged easily, people will be far more compliant, as happens in all walks of life.</P>
        <P>I know as a practising solicitor that often during the Celtic tiger years banks did not look for insurance from solicitors when sending in requisitions for cheques.  They do now.</P>
     
        <P>In the same way perhaps the banks should request the PPS numbers, the insurance certificates and the C2 certificates of the builders.  There is widespread abuse at the lower end of the construction trade in terms of people claiming and so on, but the best idea to which I heard the Minister refer was that self-employed people should be immediately subject to the activation rule because they can contribute.  There are many examples of that.  We see with NAMA, <Col N="471"/>for example, and many other cases where people in the self-employed trade could and should offer something in terms of payment.  There is much sense in what the Minister said.  I fully support his efforts to bring that to fruition and I hope we will see it soon.</P>

        <P LI="2">3.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 2 months of the enactment of this Act, report to the Houses of the Oireachtas, on the progress made in reducing the processing time for social welfare payments.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is about waiting lists in terms of processing claims.  In my own area of Athlone and its environs the processing of people&rsquo;s claims is excellent.  I compliment the staff on the courtesy and decency they show to people who find themselves out of work.  In other areas of Westmeath, especially the Mullingar and Castlepollard area, difficulties have been experienced.  I appreciate those difficulties are being addressed but I regret to say that officials in the Department of Social Protection who are following up people defrauding the system have been put on desk work and are trying to process claims, which is somewhat of a contradiction.  This is a valid amendment which asks that the Minister would give Members a progress report at some point on the way these issues are progressing.</P>

	<P>When I came into the Department I was asked in an interview about my role as Minister.  On most occasions the media focus on policy changes and I believe in policy changes, but I have often said that if someone owned a factory which had a good policy but was not producing the goods, the factory would not last very long and it certainly would not give a good service.  If someone had a restaurant that had a policy of having the best organic food but was not producing or cooking that food very well, it would not have many customers.  Similarly, it is not good enough for the Department of Social Protection to have a good policy.  I fully agree with the Senator and I have said from the outset that delivery of the service to the punter on the ground is essential because the person who goes into an office looking for a payment does not worry too much about the policy.  They just want to know when they will get a cheque and how much they will get in the cheque.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We pay 2 million people a week and therefore the numbers we are dealing with are huge.  It is fair to say that there has been a huge increase in the customer base, so to speak, in recent years but the Senator can rest assured that both I and the Department are focused on delivery.  Part of this Bill, for example, deals with the delays in appeals, which we will come to again, but I also believe we must examine a range of ways of streamlining the delivery of the service to the person on the ground and, if necessary, simplifying schemes to ensure there is less work involved.</P>
        <P>One of the major delays involves means testing.  Anything that must be means tested requires a great deal of homework.  It is sometimes difficult to get applicants to give details but if we activate people, the means test is not as critical because they are either eligible for the payment or they are not and they get the full payment if they are working.</P>
        <P>We must examine a range of ways of speeding up the processing of these lists.  The Department is doing a great deal in that direction and I have no problem in giving updates at any stage, and not only on the local areas.  I believe that was done previously in terms of the length <Col N="472"/>of time it takes to process jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in every local office.  The Senator can rest assured that I will be giving updates and that I am focusing on this issue.  Our determination is that we have efficient procedures in place.</P>
        <P>I wrote to all Senators some time ago regarding representations made to me by public representatives.  I felt at that stage that unless they were still outstanding, giving answers for January, February, March and April was a waste of time.  If the client had found out the information in February, there was not much point in telling the Senators in June.  I thank the Senators for the spirit in which that was received.  Unless Senators come back to us with an outstanding query, we are taking those as read.  The reason I did that was to try to give answers more quickly to the recent queries to ensure backlogs do not develop in terms of queries and that Senators do not get answers to queries three months after their constituents get them.  The departmental officials have been very helpful in that regard.  We hope constantly to improve the quality of service to ensure we not only have good policy but good delivery as well.</P>

        <P LI="1">14.&mdash;Section 220(2)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of the Principal Act are deleted and the following paragraph substituted therefor:</P><Col N="473"/>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister.  I was delayed at a health committee meeting and I thank Senator McCarthy for moving the amendments in my absence.  How much child benefit is being paid in respect of children who reside in other EU member states?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to comment on the amendment which seeks to provide that where two parents or guardians have joint custody of a child, the child benefit may be apportioned between them.  Generally speaking, joint custody does not mean that a child lives with one parent for three days of the week and the other parent for four days of the week.  It is usually the case that a child lives with a parent from Monday to Friday and then goes to the other custodian at the end of the week.  If child benefit were to be split on the basis of joint custody, it would be very difficult to work out.</P>
        <P>We have eminent judges who take a long time to examine issues such as this one.  They consider the issue of income to the household and child benefit is added to that to ensure the parent involved in the normal day-to-day care of the child gets the child benefit.  In a case where both parents are not very well off, the question arises as to the household in which the benefit is best placed.  Where there is abuse of that position, it is always open to the parent who believes there is such abuse to go to court because applications for maintenance can always be reopened in court.  While I understand the tenet of the amendment, which is honourable, it would be unworkable and the current system is sufficient to deal with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Just over 5,300 mothers reside in another EU member state whose partner or husband is either employed in Ireland or is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment in Ireland.  We should put this in context.  Total expenditure on child benefit in 2008 and 2009 was in the region of &euro;2.5 billion.  If one takes &euro;2,500 and then one puts &euro;1 million after it, we are speaking about &euro;20 of the &euro;2,500.  I am not denying it is &euro;20 but it is not a huge amount of money and it is because there is an obligation under the European Union.  What we have been doing, which is worth much more money than trying to avoid a European Union obligation, is writing to recipients of child benefit to check whether they still reside at the address we have.  The number of returns we get where the person is not known at the address are significant.  For every 9,000 letters we send, we get responses that 100 people are not known at the address, which is significant when the total numbers are all stacked up.  This includes writing to Irish people.</P>
        <P>In 1,500 responses to every 9,000 letters people do not return it in the envelope.  In some cases, as soon as the payment is missed, the envelope comes flying back to us.  It is unfortunate that people do not return it but it has been important for us to run the rule across the board, not only across those who came to live in Ireland but also those who permanently live in Ireland, to ensure they are living here and entitled to child benefit.  Savings are being made there and they will be far greater and fraud elimination will be far greater through changing this rule whereby one can work here legitimately and have the payment paid to a spouse in another country.  It is less than 1% of the payment.</P>
        <P>The scheme does not provide for the splitting of payments between parties irrespective of the formal custody arrangement.  Where the child is mainly resident with the mother, the child benefit is paid to the mother.  If the child is resident with the father for more than half the time, the benefit is paid to the father.  There is no provision for circumstances where the child is resident with each parent for exactly half the time and there would be severe difficulties in trying to determine this administratively in the event of a dispute.  As child benefit is paid on a residence basis, a change to a formal custody or guardianship arrangement would change <Col N="474"/>fundamentally the base on which child benefit is paid for all recipients of child benefit and not only in those circumstances where parents have separated.  I understand the Law Reform Commission is examining the legal aspects of family relationships further and will issue a report later this year.  It will examine all these matters and I will re-examine the issue of appropriate payment arrangements for child benefit in light of this report to ensure it reflects the most up-to-date thinking in the area.</P>
        <P>We must be careful that any change we make does not discommode the many for the few.  It is one of the problems.  I am always very sorry for the odd cases but we also have to be careful not to discommode the many for the few.  If one can come up with a solution that gives to the few without discommoding the many, I will be fine with it, but if it creates a hugely complicated situation instead of the situation we have, which is relatively straightforward and satisfies 99%, I would say not to change it unless we are absolutely sure that will not be disturbed and that we are going to a better place for the remainder.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">14.&mdash;In all decisions relating to what constitutes a reasonable or suitable offer of training or employment, or in relation to any other activation measure, the interests of a child dependant shall be considered before a payment is suspended, reduced, or stopped.&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This comes back to the question of fraud.  At times, we underestimate the safeguards we have in our arrangements.  As a Deputy I have dealt with social welfare appeals officers for years and the funny thing is that I cannot go near them now.  Until I came into this great job I often went to the social welfare appeals office or sent someone from my office.  I always found the appeals system to be very benign, informal and fair.  One is told what all the issues are.  In the changes we are making, whereby if one refuses either a job or suitable training opportunities there is a penalty, one must take it that we are doing so because we need to clamp down on those who never seem to be available no matter what is offered to them.  Therefore, they seem to be too busy doing something else.  We have had much talk about fraud this afternoon.  As far as I am concerned, one has to have some sanction against such people.  The intention is to use the savings to give activation and better opportunities to those who are genuinely unemployed &mdash; the vast majority &mdash; and move forward.  I cannot see that it is fair and reasonable that society must run with its hands tied behind its back all the time in dealing with people who never seem to be available.</P>
        <P>I know of people in receipt of social welfare payments who, to be quite honest, are not employable even on a scheme.  They are very few in number but they exist.  Chasing them is a waste of time and would serve neither society nor the individuals involved.  Now that we are introducing various activation schemes, I would like to take a systematic approach.  Everyone, or at least the vast majority, in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is by definition probably employable unless he or she had a breakdown, in which case he or she should really be on illness benefit.  Therefore, it is reasonable to engage in activation people who go over the threshold from jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Every reasonable person who is genuinely unemployed would welcome any type of social activity that was reasonably suited to their gifts rather than sitting mindlessly at home all day, every day.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However, we have to have some sanction for the 10% who just do not turn up and when they are made turn up, they refuse training and work.  It is not fair on the genuinely unemployed, who are the vast majority.  There are people who never seem to be available.  The supplementary welfare system and the appeals system are in place for those who are really done down and in common with many Deputies and Senators, I have never seen the appeals system being less than fair.  The benefit of doubt has always been given in marginal cases to the appellant and statistics from the appeals office bear this out.</P>
        <P>I ask Senators to accept that, as a Minister, I am fairly tolerant about people but I passionately believe that there is a small coterie of people who are working and drawing and I must have leverage and sanction to deal with them.  That is what this is about.  It will not be unreasonable and I assure Senators of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  The child dependant is the kernel of the issue as far as I can see.  That is my concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The jobseekers&rsquo; guidelines proved for a person&rsquo;s family circumstances to be taken into account.  For example, it may be unreasonable for a person with certain family responsibilities to seek work which involves a considerable amount of travelling time to and from work.  Also, while the guidelines for the jobseeker&rsquo;s scheme do not specifically mention child care, it is one of the aspects which could impact on their availability.  A deciding officer must take all matters into consideration, as provided for in the the guidelines.</P>
        <P>As Senator Prendergast is aware, the policy is to make the schemes included in the activation programme local in nature.  For example, the rural social scheme, the CE scheme, etc., are local in nature.  The Senator can take it, therefore, that somebody who has children will not have to travel 100 miles to take up a job on the minimum wage.  That does not and will not happen.  If it were and an unreasonable view was to be taken, I would be the first to come in here to amend the scheme.  However, it does not happen in practice.  At times, the more one legislates, the more one creates chances for persons to make excuses, while those who are legitimate lose out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, before section 19, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;19.&mdash;The Minister will take all practicable steps to ensure that courses of training provided in accordance with section 62A shall be appropriate given the person&rsquo;s existing qualifications and experience.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments are about training.  I am asking that courses being provided apply to the person and his or her existing skills and circumstances and, as the Minister stated, not be held a significant distance from where he or she lives.  I am asking, for instance, that the Department not offer a barrister a dog-grooming course.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="476"/>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking that the course be relevant to his or her qualification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be relaxing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be, but I am not a barrister.</P>
        <P>I have concerns.  While I completely understand what the Minister is saying about sanctions, that 10% of people, no matter what the Minister does, will want to find a lazy way out, do not want to work, want everything for nothing and have never known anything other than this, however, there are others who need to be motivated.  Given that the Department only has 61 job facilitators to deal with the 450,000 unemployed &mdash; each one of these 61 facilitators is responsible for 7,000 persons &mdash; I cannot see how they would be able to counsel, motivate and support that many persons.  That is a considerable number of persons to have to deal with.</P>
        <P>The idea behind the work placement programme put in place 12 months ago by the two Ministers, Deputies Hanafin and Coughlan, is a really good one.  Some 2,000 positions were provided, but the uptake has been disappointing.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister has to say in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree the training provided should be suitable, although there are very few activities in life from which one would not profit.  In my own career, having finished a degree, I wound up as a manager of a farmer&rsquo;s co-operative.  I have pulled sheep from lorries and also thrown them into them; I have humped bags on my back and done anything and everything that has had to be done, including sweep floors.  To be honest with Senator McFadden, I do not think it did me any harm; I am much better for having done it.  I worked on the factory floor in a timber mill when somebody did not turn up in the morning, even though I was the manager.  We did not have the money or the luxury to let the work stop just because somebody had not turned up; one just stood in the line until a replacement was found.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not being unreasonable.  I would expect much more from myself than I would of others in a state system.  However, if we are interested in the wellbeing of people, in my experience a person who is working, no matter at what he or she is working, or attending a course has a much greater chance of getting a job that the person who is sitting at home and staring at the wall.  We must activate people.  I would always encourage those who are unemployed, if they came to see me as an individual, not as a Minister, to take what was going.  I have a line for young people, that if they are given a job sweeping the floor, they should sweep it well and they will get a better job.  That might sound like kitchen sink type thinking, but I honestly believe we would do people a disservice, particularly young people, if we encouraged them not to become engaged.  Of course, we should try come up with courses that suit applicants; that makes common sense.  I always believe in giving people the job that suits them, but if it is a choice between any job and doing nothing, they are better off in some job than doing nothing.</P>
        <P>A second issue concerns employment action programme, EAP, numbers.  Senator McFadden may wish to take them down because they are interesting.  Between January and December 2009, 86,782 persons were referred &mdash; 53,638 left the live register, while 33,000 are still on it.  Of the total number, 65,600 were interviewed.  Some 4,000 were placed in a job, 9,000 were placed on a F&Aacute;S programme, 1,599 were provided with education and training courses and 24,000 left the live register.  Of the F&Aacute;S interviewees, 39,000 without a direct placement left the live register.  As I stated, 26,000 of those who were interviewed remained on the live register.  The non-attendees, those who never turned up for interview, numbered approximately 20,000, of whom 14,000 left the live register.  I accept that we must be careful with the figures.  We know that 60% of those on the live register receive some placement after three months.  Therefore, many of them might have been in a position to get a job and their disappearance from the live register might have had nothing to do with being asked to attend for interview. <Col N="477"/> Of 10,000 placed on the live register, only 4,000 remain after approximately three or four months, after which the rate of decline is very slow.  It is even slower after a year.  After a year we intend to see what has happened to the remaining 4,000.  We will want to see how many have disappeared and if there has been an increase in the number who disappear off the live register when one asks the question a second time or if is it just a natural process.  I will need to have something to offer those whom we will interview a second time.</P>
        <P>The point in bringing all of the schemes within the remit of the Department is that I have activation funding, with unemployment programme funding, and can activate more people, particularly if I can make savings in identifying those who should not be on the live register in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Minister has stated is plausible, but I am wondering about the 20,000 who have nothing.  After all of the measures taken, there are still people who find it ever so difficult.  They are called back for the next interview and so on.  I realise it is very difficult within the Department because I know and meet the people involved.  I realise some of the F&Aacute;S and community employment schemes are operating at full capacity.  What is the position of those who make up the percentage that find it very hard to get a job or be placed on a suitable course?  There are people in that category who are willing to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why one must consider the Bill from here on in its totality.  We pay out &euro;4.3 billion in unemployment payments.  Effectively, we put it to the people concerned that they can have the payment, but they must be available for work.  However, if they do work, they lose it.  That is what we say to them in simple English.  We spend approximately &euro;500 million on community employment and rural social schemes and community service programmes.  We intend to transfer the &euro;500 million to the same Department which administers the sum of &euro;4.3 billion.  The purpose is when such schemes are within the remit of one Department, it is a good deal easier to transfer between subheads.  We are keen to pay more people to do something because this is what they wish to do also and pay fewer to do nothing because that is what those who are genuinely unemployed do not wish to do.</P>
        <P>Having people participating in schemes is considerably more expensive than having them on the dole.  There is a cost to placing them on schemes.  However, there is a great societal gain to be made if they are working in providing care for the elderly or the young, in after school services or environmental works.  However, there is a cost in my Department&rsquo;s budget.  The rural social scheme is a good deal more expensive because of the training element of community employment schemes.  Some of the difference in the cost could be met by separating the wheat from the chaff.  The wheat represents those who are unemployed and genuinely seeking and capable of work.  We should place them on schemes.  The chaff represents those who draw unemployment payments, but when they are called up, they suddenly disappear off the live register.  The savings could be used for the purposes of engaging in activation.  That is where we wish to go and if we can move in this direction, we can secure a double gain.</P>
        <P>We deal with something all Senators have discussed with me time and again, that is, fraud and people claiming who are not entitled to do so.  We aim to use the benefits of any savings to help directly those who are genuinely unemployed and knocking on our doors each day seeking placement on a community employment scheme, rural social scheme, community service employment scheme or something to do because they are going out of their minds.  We have evidence to show that health is affected by unemployment.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="478"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>There is evidence to show family circumstances are affected by unemployment.  My life experience informs me that if one creates employment and people get up in the morning with a purpose, it changes their life and they will say as much.  That is where we are going with this legislation.  If someone asked me to move in that direction without giving me a sanction for the person who does not turn up, after some time, he or she will cop on to the fact that I cannot do anything about him or her.  I must be able to impose a sanction on those who do not turn up and are always full of excuses but who are not willing to do anything.  That is what this is about.  However, it will be done in a fair and targeted way.  I have discussed how we can target it with the Department.  I believe in the gateway approach, that is, as people go through a process of three months and one year, we pick them up at certain milestones along the way and try to help them.  In addition, if they are not available for activation, we ask some hard questions</P>

He has referred to those involved in courses having a greater chance of gaining full-time employment than those who sit at home looking at the walls.  Unfortunately, I know many who are unemployed and they do not sit at home looking at the walls.  The are seeking employment and some of them will be affected by the measure in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister has admitted the activation programmes are not in place.  This is completely premature.  We need the Government to put in place training programmes and come up with a strategy suited to people&rsquo;s needs.  The HEA is not properly funded for the number of courses it must provide this year.  It is already refusing entry to some courses.  The Minister has suggested the measures will be carried out in a targeted way and I have no doubt that will be the case.  However, he also contests that this will be done in a fair way and I disagree with him in that regard.  The social welfare legislation during the past two years and in recent budgets suggests &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; is not in the vocabulary of the Government.  This is a dangerous and premature measure because the activation courses and measures are not in place.  It would give discretion to an inspector to cut a payment made in the past on basis that a person did not take up training.</P>
        <P>We must consider the greater issues involved.  My party has been critical of some of the training provided.  I listened to the T&aacute;naiste when she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  She referred to some of the training courses F&Aacute;S had provided in the past as being questionable.  We must ensure training is suited to people&rsquo;s needs.  Our job creation strategy argues that for the 86,000 young people unemployed we should consider their long-term career prospects, given that each individual has different needs and skills and different training programmes would best suit their needs.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware from his previous role of people who have taken up training.  There are cases on my desk of people who have taken up F&Aacute;S training and other courses.  They enjoyed the training and believe it will lead to employment.  I have no wish to be critical of all F&Aacute;S training courses.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Training is the means by which to get people back to employment based on their needs and skills and the areas earmarked for future employment creation.</P>
        <P>There are situations where people are involved in training and who must travel from A to B.  They live in remote, rural communities in which there are no bus services.  I have just finished dealing with a case in my office in which B&uacute;s &Eacute;ireann has cut back further on services to west Donegal, affecting the townlands of Dungloe, Lettermacaward and Glencolumcille, <Col N="479"/>such that people cannot get to the training centres without using private cars, if they have them.  If they are unemployed, that is one luxury they might have to give up and, therefore, they may be obliged to use to use taxis.  In some of the cases with which I am dealing this has happened.  People are using taxis to get to and from the training centres.  Sometimes it may be down in black and white that a training course has been provided.  However, the cost of availing of such a training course could be prohibitive and, therefore, it may not be practical for such persons to take up these courses.</P>
        <P>This measure has not been thought out sufficiently.  It is premature and can be used to penalise the unemployed who are not sitting at home looking at the walls, who wish to become involved in training to get back into real, valuable and meaningful employment.  However, the courses and jobs are not available.  This gives too much latitude at a time when the alternatives are not in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot agree with the Senator who obviously has not read the whole Bill.  Commencement orders are involved.  One primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for activation.  However, it is a question of considering which comes first: the hen or the egg.  As far as we are concerned, it is interlocking.  As the Senator is aware, the putting in place of the rural social scheme transformed the lives of many farmers who came to me from throughout the country to inform me of the benefits in getting work which suited them in their communities.  This worked because the schemes were well organised by the communities and were a transforming feature in the lives of the people concerned.  They were not unemployed because they had farms.  Let us consider someone who is totally unemployed.  The rule for getting an unemployment payment is that a person is not in full-time education or in work.  There is the problem of not having anything to do because that is the condition on which the payment is given.  My proposal is that people are given something useful to do.  I come from a strong community background and I believe communities should have a great deal of involvement in resolving their own problems.  I have not seen communities in all my years creating jobs in both the commercial and voluntary sectors forcing people on to unsuitable schemes.  They matched people to jobs they were good at because that generated the greatest return for the community.</P>
        <P>I have a clear plan, even if the Senator does not know about it, whereby communities are motivated to create jobs through schemes and they are allowed to decide their priorities, whether it is environmental work, training children in music, sport and so on or after school care.  Much work needs to be done in our society.  If we do this through the community structures under F&Aacute;S, the rural social scheme, the community services programme and so on, we need not worry too much about the communities matching the skills of their people to their requirements.  I have too much respect for communities to think they will not do that.</P>
        <P>With regard to more formal courses, there are plenty of protections in the law regarding unreasonable questions being asked and reducing the payment because the training was not warranted on the basis of existing qualifications and experience and so on.  Plenty of protections are in place and I do not believe what I propose will get anyone except the people we should get and if Senators want to dodge around that because of so-called concerns, they are not in tune with what people are saying on the ground, which is that the genuinely unemployed should be helped in every way and they are crying out for opportunities to serve their communities and those who are not genuinely unemployed should have their payments stopped.</P>
        <P>We will continue to disagree on this.  I come from a community background where I was a Gaeltacht co-operative manager for many years working with other co-operative managers to transform some of the most isolated, rural communities in the country.  We know what we did for our own people in bringing them from idle communities to working communities and the social benefit we generated.  The disciplines we imposed reduced the incidence of social prob<Col N="480"/>lems such as alcoholism, marriage breakdown and so on because we created jobs and a work ethic.  Other areas had &ldquo;poverty programmes&rdquo; and they are worse off in the context of social problems now than they were 30 years ago whereas we transformed the social reality of people&rsquo;s lives in our communities while starting out at the same time.</P>
        <P>In this case, we are acting in the best interests of our citizens and when we go to the electorate in two years, a large number of people will say the Government and I were right, we did what was in the interests of society and we had the courage to do it and all the sceptics who said we would not create jobs and training places were wrong because we had a plan that clearly worked.</P>

I would welcome that because the Minister referred to the Government&rsquo;s record in transforming communities and so on.  He knows my community and the constituency I represent.

	<P Just="Left">This affects 30% of the workforce in Donegal and, unfortunately, they are dependent on social welfare payments.  If the Minister wants a pre-election debate, we can have one.</P><Col N="481"/>
        <P Just="Left">I understand there are activation measures but, as the Minister asked, is this the chicken or the egg?  People are not crying out for legislation that will penalise them if they do not take up a training place, whether adequate.  They want training courses and, more important, the jobs that will follow.  They want a job creation strategy and a stimulus package from the Government.  The Minister should outline what is in place and if people are defrauding the system, they need to be taken out across the board.  He will get support across the political spectrum for that initiative.</P>
        <P>However, that is not the issue in these amendments.  As public representatives, we deal with cases day in, day out where legislation is being implemented by officials on the ground in a way that is unfair and callous and penalises people on the lowest incomes in our society.  I will not pass judgment on the Minister&rsquo;s intentions, as he may be introducing this in good faith, but this measure gives officials discretion to cut social welfare payments in circumstances where training courses may not be adequate.  For example, a participant might have to travel by taxi to a course and, therefore, incur a large cost.  Where is the provision in the legislation to exempt them?  If somebody from Gweedore has to take a taxi to and from Dungloe, which is only seven miles over the road, five days a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments are concerned with appropriate training places and the issue is whether it is appropriate for somebody to have to incur exorbitant travel costs.  It is alright for Ministers with a Mercedes at their backsides but it is different for people dependent on a social welfare payment who must put their hands in their pockets to pay taxi fares, which could cost more than 60% of their income.  That is my problem.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the regulations.  We are going back over the debate we had on the previous section.  The regulations clearly provide that if the distance involved in travelling to a course is unreasonable, it must be taken into account and, therefore, the Senator can discount that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In deference to the Senators who have been here all afternoon, we should not go back over issues that have been already dealt with.  The situation with regard to this issue is a bit like St. Augustine saying please make me good, but not quite yet.  I have a simple view on the issue.  The Senator said he is all for catching people who defraud the system, but when a proposal is put forward on how to catch them, the Senator opposes it and suggests I am trying to catch out people who are legitimately unemployed and in hard circumstances.  I find that difficult to take from the Senator.  I have spent a lifetime working in communities creating employment.  I have never had a commercial job and all of the people who have worked with me know that I have dedicated my life to community development and job creation.</P><Col N="482"/>
        <P>What we are saying is that we need money.  The Senator has spoken about stimulus packages.  That is fine.  We have a stimulus package and are spending &euro;6 billion on capital expenditure every year.</P>

	<P>Yes, but I am trying to answer the point made by the Senator.  All we are saying in this section is that we can create savings which we can reinvest to create new opportunities for those who are unemployed.  I find it very difficult to understand why anybody would oppose that.  I certainly do not think that those who oppose it are acting in the interest of those who are genuinely unemployed and asking us to do something about it.  Why should we not use money that can be saved from those who should not get it for the benefit of those who need it for a better life and employment?  I have no problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for this section is to provide for the recruitment of retired social welfare appeals officers to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  We debated this issue in the D&aacute;il and there seemed to be some concern at the wording.  I assure Senators that their concern that it might be possible for me to appoint my buddies is unfounded.  It would be impossible for me to do that.  The wording being used in the section is the exact same wording as that used with regard to the Minister appointing deciding officers or appeals officers within the Department.  I assure Senators that this is something I am doing very reluctantly, but it is the lesser of two evils.  We have had a huge increase in the number of social welfare appeals and I owe it to the people to try and reduce those appeals.  The people who do this work must be very skilled in the law.  It would not be possible, even if a Minister was so tempted, to appoint people who did not have the appropriate qualifications.  The problem for me in terms of internal promotions is that it takes a long time to train appeals officers because they must have comprehensive knowledge of social welfare law before they are appointed.  I understand the Senator&rsquo;s concern, but I do not think there is any grounds for it.  The section has the same wording as that used for appointments of deciding officers.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 22</P>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 25, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall, within one month of the commencement of this section, report to the Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection on the progress made in reducing social welfare appeals office waiting list.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This is similar to the previous amendment.  I would like the Minister to lay a progress report before the House on progress on reducing numbers, particularly given the growth of appeals from 15,000 in 2007 to 35,000 in 2010.  The Minister has said he will bring back retired appeals officers and I am aware that both Fine Gael and the Labour Party have questioned the appropriateness of this.  I regret that the Minister is not creating new jobs or providing new jobs for those who need them.  The delay in dealing with appeals is 53 weeks for child benefit, 38 weeks for illness benefit, 30 weeks for farm assist and 34 weeks for the State pension.  This is far too long to wait for an appeal and it is not fair or right.  We spoke about valuing people and making this a person-centred service that would provide a good quality service.  It is reprehensible that there is such a delay in the appeals process for so many people.  This is a worthwhile amendment.  We require a report on the progress being made with the reintroduction into the system of the retired appeals officers.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="484"/>
      <?oasys _cl14- ?><Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I, too, have questions in this regard.  I understand the issue of skills and the fact the people concerned have the skills.  However, why do we not promote from within and create new jobs at entrance level in the Department instead of bringing back retired social welfare officers to act as appeals officers?  How will these people be remunerated?  Will they receive their pensions and be paid at the same time?  Perhaps those are matters for another debate.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I support the amendment and agree that we need a report on the progress being made in reducing social welfare appeals.  It appears the letter of the law is being applied in a harsher way than in the past.  One case referred to me relates to where a social welfare payment was denied to an individual because the social welfare inspector called out to the house on two occasions, but because nobody was home, the inspector deemed the person did not live at that address.  As a result of queries made through a Deputy, the person asked how he was deemed not to live at that address just because the inspector found nobody at home, but the Department could not provide a satisfactory answer.  A parliamentary question was submitted on the issue and as a result of that, and dialogue with the staff in the Department, the person was granted his social welfare payment.</P>
        <P>Questions must be raised about the spike in social welfare appeals at this time.  Of course we have a higher number of people unemployed, but it seems there is a more rigorous approach within the Department.  People are being refused on their first application.  As the Minister is aware, many people do not appeal the refusal.  I may be wrong, but I believe the approach within certain sections is to refuse first.  For example, in the case of the person who was not at home on two occasions when the officer called, his application was refused and he was not entitled to his payment.  If I called to the house of any of us on two different occasions, there might be nobody at home either.  However, this is the approach used by officials in the past.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister stands over a social welfare inspector who calls to a home on two occasions and finds nobody at home and then cuts off the payment from the State which those people are dependent on to survive, then a wider debate is required.  Those are the decisions being taken in some cases.  I know many staff in the Department who are working under significant strain and pressure and are trying to beat the timeframes and long delays that have been mentioned by Senator McFadden.  Unfortunately, these cases are on my desk.  They are undisputed, black and white cases and this is why they are being refused.  There is an issue but I would welcome a report and I do not see any harm in reporting to the committee about progress made on appeals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer the Senators&rsquo; questions, eight retirees are working an average of two days per week.  This is roughly equivalent to three full-time equivalents.  This will continue to the end of the year.  It is a temporary arrangement which will be reviewed at that stage.</P>
        <P>The Senator raised a very valid question as to their pay arrangements.  They are paid on a <i>per diem</i> basis, based on the mid-point of the standard modified assistant principal scale.  This is subject to tax, PRSI, income levy and pension levy and subject to the normal pension abatement arrangements.  This means they cannot earn more in any tax year than they would have earned before retirement.  There is no honey pot in this one.</P>
        <P>There is a significant learning curve for appeals officers when assigned.  They must become familiar with the entire social welfare code and also with other legislation which may impact on entitlements, such as employment law and also with administrative law, case law and EU <Col N="485"/>law, as it affects social welfare entitlements.  A new appeals officer will generally operate under the wing of an existing appeals officer for approximately three months.  The level of complexity of a case as assigned will increase as time goes on.  Experience shows that it takes up to two years for a new appeals officer to develop sufficient experience and knowledge to deal with most types of cases at full productivity.</P>
        <P>The challenge is to get a quick fix.  We all agree that immediate changes are required.  In order to deal with the situation, two additional appeals officers were assigned to the office in 2009.  These are above the retirees who are being employed on a part-time basis.  An additional two administrative staff have been approved for the office.  These officers have been assigned to enable 6,800 cases to be dealt with on-site in Longford without the need for the transfer of the majority of these cases to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <P>There is currently an in-depth review of process in the office being carried out by the Department&rsquo;s business process improvement section.  Enhancements to the office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems are being put in place which will greatly improve the flow of work in the office.  Overtime, including on Saturdays, is being worked by staff of the office in an effort to reduce the backlog.</P>

	<P>This information is more to do with amendment No. 19.  We are on amendment No. 20.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The appeals office is an independent office which does not come under my remit in its operation.  However, I discussed with officials the need to ensure that simple appeals with clear solutions should not go down on the same flow chart as appeals dealing with means tests or medical reports.  They must find ways of dealing quickly with the simpler appeals because the longer the queue, the more people are ringing up to look for answers.  It is hoped that by the end of the year, the chief appeals officer will be able to report that we have made significant progress in dealing with appeals and that this problem is being brought under control.  The real reason for the problem is a significant increase in appeals.</P>
        <P>In reply to Senator Doherty, a total of 2% of decisions are appealed.  There has been a high success in appeals but part of the reason is that when a case goes to appeal, the person will supply more information which if provided initially, would have won the case at that stage.  If new information is provided, the case goes back to the deciding officer and he or she has an opportunity to change the decision if it is believed that, based on the further information, an unwarranted decision was made.  This is very common in medical cases.  The doctors provide a lot of medical information with regard to various claims such as carer&rsquo;s allowances and so on but they do not address the real question of whether the person is capable of work in the case of illness benefit.  They outline the medical condition but do not give a clear opinion on capability for work which is the crucial sentence.  This is similarly the case with regard to appeals for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The crucial question is whether the person needs full-time care and attention.  I have discussed this matter with the chief medical officer.  There may be a case for better medical certification with more details on it so the pertinent questions are addressed and to save time and the need for people to appeal.  I am all in favour of such a process.</P>
        <P>On the case of the two visits referred to by Senator Doherty, I cannot comment on an individual case because I do not know whether that was the full story.  All I can say is that I have found the investigative officers I have dealt with for the past 20 years to be thorough and helpful.  I have on occasion made representations and they have explained to me they were trying to persuade the applicant to provide further information and if I could persuade the applicant to supply it, they assured me they would have no problem in passing the claim.  If I had not made a representation, they would be unable to ask me to help as a third party.  A <Col N="486"/>representation must be initiated.  It may be the case that the staff in Donegal are different but I do not think so.  The staff in the Department are very good although with a staff of 5,000, not all of them will be uniformly helpful but in my long experience dealing with the Department from the outside, both as a Government Deputy and Senator and in Opposition, I have found the departmental staff to be helpful in the main and anxious to deal fairly with the customer.  I have found the appeals officers extremely fair.  I have noted that appeals hearings have procedures in place that certainly put people at ease.  They are very open to appellants being accompanied and they always are prepared to share the information in the file so one is not led into places.  The appeals system, in my opinion and experience, is very fair.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>The kernel of the issue is that all these appeals are being made because people are desperate and they need the money to survive.  They need to put bread on the table and to pay the ESB bill.  We should not lose track of the fact this is the reason for the significant increase in appeals.  The bottom line is people really need the money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify for the record of the House that when I was referring to the case of the two calls that it was a colleague here in the Oireachtas who referred that story to me.  For correction, it was not a member of the Department&rsquo;s staff, unless they are doing constituency work in Donegal.  My more general point is whether it would be acceptable for a social welfare inspector to refuse on the basis that nobody was in the house when he or she called and therefore proof of address could not be verified.  If that is allowable within the rules and regulations, we need to ensure it is applied in a fair way.  I am positive people are giving false addresses to scam the system.  We must have balance.  My question about appeals directly relates to this amendment and the report to the Oireachtas.  We know there has been a spike in appeals and we know there has been a spike in the live register, which accounts for it.  Has there been analysis by the Department to take account of the rise in the live register and the number of payments made versus the number of appeals?  What proportion of appeals is being made compared with last time?  Are we seeing a proportionate increase in appeals or is it at the same level?  Is the percentage of appeals for applications processed three years ago neither higher nor lower than the current percentage?  This is a worry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The simple answer on this subject that I follow with interest, and I am not speaking <i>ex cathedra</i> anseo, is that the percentage has not changed dramatically.  It is a percentage of the number of applications, not of the total number of people in payment.  It concerns the number of people who have made new applications.  There has been a surge in the number of applications for illness benefit and carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Much of this goes back to what Senator McFadden said, that people on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance when it runs out, they have a spouse with an occupation and then they apply for the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The person being cared for must be medically qualified and people are pursuing different avenues.  We all know these people in the constituency clinics.  There are many more applications and people are making more than one application.  To my knowledge, <Col N="487"/>there is no change in the percentage of applications decided on.  Many people are transferring from jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit has relatively few appeals because if someone has not made the contributions, they do not receive the payment.  If the person attends the clinic of a Member of the Houses, he or she could count the number of contributions and explain that the number of contributions was insufficient according to the rule in the book.  The Member could then advise the constituents that an appeal would not work.  On the other hand, in the means test, the cattle, sheep, pigs and cows are all counted and it is much more subjective.  Inevitably, people go to a clinic when they are disappointed with the level of payment they receive and the Member may ask if the person included all the hay and the silage he has bought.  The person might say they forgot to put in the hay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach.  I am speaking on behalf of the 32 survivors who comprise the Irish Thalidomide Association.  I want this case put right.  I support the calls of deeply committed citizens who have been wronged in a shameful way.  Thalidomide caused significant suffering and permanent disability and contributed to deaths.  It is more than four decades since this tragedy occurred.  Despite some advances in the package of measures announced by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, in April, there is still much unfinished business.</P>
        <P>I was deeply moved by Ms Mary Duffy, an artist living in County Wicklow, who wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> in May that she was conflicted by a reluctance to ask for what she needed because she could not bear the pain of being refused.  On the Government offer of &euro;2 million in compensation for survivors of thalidomide, she wrote that it opened a deep wound and stuck in the knife.  The time has long since come for the State to do its part in healing these wounds.  As a public representative, I feel a strong sense of duty to continue shining a light on this injustice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The members of the association are remarkable.  They have undertaken the burden of a campaign for justice that they should have been spared.  Their campaign persists because of the inadequate response of the State.  In the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, there is cross-party support for the campaign.  The association&rsquo;s secretary, Ms Finola Cassidy, is in the Visitors Gallery.  The cross-party support must be met with action.  The survivors of the thalidomide drug are owed an apology, appropriate compensation and access to the legal documents of the time.  They did not receive adequate support as children and remain in need today.  This issue can and must be put right.  The wrong cannot be undone, but justice can and must be achieved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghlacadh leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht na ceiste seo a ard&uacute; anseo inniu.  I am replying to this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the position in respect of the matter raised by the Senator.  She will be aware that the Minister has met the Irish Thalidomide Association a number of times since 2008.  At the Minister&rsquo;s request, the State Claims Agency considered the association&rsquo;s claims and made recommendations to her.  Following consideration of the agency&rsquo;s report, she announced on 27 April that the Government had accepted the report and decided to provide additional services and financial supports for survivors of thalidomide.</P>
        <P>The Minister subsequently met groups representing survivors of thalidomide and briefed them on the Government&rsquo;s decision.  At those meetings, a number of issues were raised by legal representatives on behalf of the survivors&rsquo; organisations, including the issue raised in the Senator&rsquo;s motion.  The Minister informed the survivors that she would have the issues considered in consultation with the Attorney General.  She will proceed on the basis of his advice.</P><Col N="490"/>
        <P>A detailed response to all of the issues raised by the solicitors for the Irish Thalidomide Association will be issued shortly.  In circumstances where it is clear that litigation is being contemplated, Members will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to enter into detailed discussion on the specific issue raised in the motion at this point in time.</P>
        <P>The additional measures announced by the Government were the provision for special care packages for thalidomide survivors living in Ireland, the designation of a senior manager in the HSE to act as a liaison with regard to the survivors&rsquo; ongoing health and personal social services needs, a one-off <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &euro;2 million to be divided equally between the survivors, the payment of an annual lump sum in addition to current payments of up to &euro;3,680 for survivors in the most severe category and the provision of financial assistance for transport needs.  This is a reasonable and compassionate response aimed at meeting the medical and other needs of survivors.</P>
        <P>The thalidomide product sold in Ireland was manufactured by Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal, a German company.  Irish survivors of thalidomide receive compensation from a German foundation set up for that purpose of up to &euro;1,116 per month tax free.  In addition, the German Government has recently awarded an additional annual payment of &euro;3,680 per annum.  A monthly allowance is also paid by the Department of Health and Children and is currently up to &euro;1,109.46 per month.  The majority of Irish survivors are in receipt of the maximum allowance from Germany and Ireland.</P>
        <P>Combining German and Irish payments, the average total amount received by Irish survivors is, therefore, &euro;26,000 per annum, with the maximum being &euro;30,386.  The monthly allowance is tax-free and is not reckonable for State benefits, including the disability allowance, which is currently &euro;849 per month.  Each individual is automatically entitled to a medical card.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister joins me in saying that the State has great sympathy for the survivors and it is most regrettable that they should have been put through so much pain and suffering.  I assure this House of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the health care and related needs of all the Irish survivors of thalidomide.  All her actions to date have been prompted by this commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister very much.  The provision of special care packages is very good, no doubt, but the once-off, <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &euro;2 million to be divided equally between the Irish survivors is not appropriate in any sense.  Each of the survivors has handicaps of varying degrees, so there is no logic to that.  All of them are in constant pain.  The secretary of the Irish Thalidomide Association is in the Visitors Gallery.  She is in constant treatment with physiotherapy and was in traction this morning.  It is not this Minister&rsquo;s responsibility but I would like him to listen to what I am saying.</P>
        <P>Why did the Department of Health in 1961 not issue an immediate withdrawal of thalidomide when it was notified by the manufacturers that it was causing birth defects?  Dr. John O&rsquo;Connell, who is a former Minister for Health, said in his autobiography that he was able to buy the thalidomide drug in the west four years later off the shelf and without a prescription.  I put on the record again the substance of my matter, namely, the need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the reason the Department of Health in 1961 did not issue an immediate withdrawal of the thalidomide drug when it was notified by the manufacturers that it was causing birth defects.</P>
        <P>President Kennedy gave a gold medal in 1962 to one of the chief directors of the FDA in the United States because she refused to pass the thalidomide drug.  We are not blaming the present Minister for Health and Children for this, incidentally.  I am disappointed, however, <Col N="491"/>because we need an apology on behalf of the State.  There has been a lack of humanity in dealing with the 32 survivors, who are very brave individuals and put enormous pressure on their bodies.  No one expected them to live to 47 or 48.  Their limbs are older than their equivalent normal age by about 30 or 40 years and that is why they are in such constant pain.  They are an inspiration and I hope this Minister will duly report back to the Minister for Health and Children.  There is cross-party support for this in the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am staking my reputation on this and putting it on the line, but I shall support this group through thick and thin.  We have had issues such as this in the past where the Government postponed solving situations, and this will end up the same way.  I do not see why we cannot have proper compensation and each individual assessed in that regard as well as a full apology from the State.</P>

However, I am reliably informed as recently as this afternoon by the Galway-based Hope 4 Disability &mdash; the Minister probably knows Mr. Eamon Walsh &mdash; that they will be cut by 45% when the Brothers of Charity reserves run out by the end of this year.  Two community houses will be closed and day care services will be reduced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is enormous confusion and uncertainty.  As the Government takes its respite for the summer, carers are still not sure whether they will get any break.  Let us be clear about what we are talking about.  In front of Leinster House last week as well as in Galway and Castlebar where there were other marches, the Minister had an opportunity to see disability with his own eyes.  People with disability &mdash; in many cases, permanent and total disablement &mdash; can only be included in society in some shape or form if they are cared for and if the carer is valued.  The carer is a critical person in the relationship with the disabled person.  The carer is the abled person who minds the disabled person.  It is the duty of the State to mind the abled person, namely, the carer.  Otherwise the entire service would fall apart, and most of these people are doing it voluntarily.  To cut their respite care services would be the final straw.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a week that saw people with intellectual disabilities and their families take to the streets to protest against cuts to essential front-line services, confusion and uncertainty still reign about what the Government and the HSE have committed to.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney and the Minister for State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Moloney, all stated that front-line services, in particular respite care, would not be cut as a result of the budgetary cuts that have been imposed on service providers in the sector.  They failed, however, to deal with existing cuts to services that have seen respite centres closed, community homes consolidated, people forced to move from their homes to more crowded accommodation and day services curtailed.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware of the human rights investigation of abuses into the John Paul centre in Galway which showed that such abuses took place among young disabled adults there, whereby young people with autism, for example, were crowded into rooms that were only suitable for children.  In some cases their knees were up as far as their chins.  This is criminal stuff.  If we start closing community houses, they will all have to be lumped in together in fewer <Col N="492"/>houses.  Is this the record and the legacy this Government wants for people with disabilities?  It is going to put the service back 50 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has failed to give any assurances for the future of services when families have already been informed that they are to be cut back seriously or closed by the end of the year.  People with intellectual disabilities and their families are still very concerned and scared for their future.  Some families are trying to cope with the existing withdrawal of supports, especially respite care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s attack, via the HSE on the disabled is cruel.  The Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, and now perhaps this Minister are saying there will be no further cuts to respite care services.  Has the HSE in Galway been told that, because it is planning for more than &euro;4 million in efficiency cuts &mdash;  &euro;2 million in March and &euro;2.5 million announced just two weeks ago?  That is double what the McCarthy report recommended.  That is how tough this is.  We know the recommendations in the McCarthy report were tough but he never recommended anything this size on the disability sector.  I want the Minister to clarify the position and give the truth to this sector.</P>
      
        <P>Will he give a guarantee that respite care services will not be cut by the end of the year when the Brothers of Charity funding runs out, that the two extra community houses will not be closed and day services reduced?  Some of the language used by the HSE in this case such as the word &ldquo;efficiencies&rdquo; is not pleasing.  These are real cuts which hurt real lives.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I thank my lucky stars I do not have a disabled person for whom I must care.  If I did, the very least I would need would be a two-day break or holiday occasionally to regain energy to continue caring.  These carers are incredible, giving their heart and soul to their work, by which they are inspired and the relationship in caring.  They need to be supported.  Those who will be affected by the cuts are the most vulnerable and voiceless.  If the Government continues with the cuts, it will just bring them more pain.  The greatest service the Minister could do is to instruct the HSE in Galway not to introduce any cuts to respite care services in the disability sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has made the Government&rsquo;s attitude to the importance of respite care clearly known.  I have worked for many years with the Brothers of Charity and Ability West in Galway and I am more than aware of the challenges faced by the sector.  I will continue to work with them in helping to overcome the challenges we all face.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment in the areas of disability and mental health is consistent.  Overall, approximately &euro;1.6 billion is spent annually by the health service on disability programmes such as residential, day care, respite care, assessment and rehabilitation services.  The ways in which services are delivered are examined on an ongoing basis to ensure people with disabilities are provided with the best possible services in an efficient and appropriate manner.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, that it is very much aware of the valuable contribution Brothers of Charity Services Ireland makes to the provision of services for people with intellectual disabilities across the country.  In 2009 the HSE provided over &euro;176.9 million for the organisation, an increase of &euro;39.6 million since 2005.  This sustained level of additional investment reflects the significant growth and development in Brothers of Charity Services Ireland in the recent past.</P>
        <P>The Government is very aware of the importance of respite care and front-line service provision for families of both children and adults with disabilities.  It is actively working to ensure these front-line services are protected.</P><Col N="493"/>
        <P Just="Left">Following the introduction of cost containment and efficiency measures in the 2010 budget, the HSE advised all agencies providing services on its behalf of their financial allocations for 2010 and the required adjustments.  The reductions in the allocations for disability service providers in 2010 related to staff pay reductions in line with national guidelines, the Government moratorium on recruitment and a 2% efficiency saving to be applied to non-front-line services such as non-pay expenditure, transport costs, rationalising management structures, merging service functions, merging service providers, etc., without impacting on users of such services.  The HSE is required to apply these efficiencies across all service areas within the HSE and all HSE funded service providers under section 38 of the Health Act, including Brothers of Charity Services Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully aware of the challenges which the reduction in allocations will present to organisations in ensuring they meet the needs of service users and planning for emergencies that arise throughout the year.  It also recognises that maintaining service levels within available resources will require significant levels of co-operation, change, flexibility and creativity but firmly believes that it can be done.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for disability issues and mental health, Deputy John Moloney, met the HSE assistant national director responsible for disability services on several occasions in recent weeks to discuss the emerging challenges in the voluntary intellectual disability sector.  The HSE was asked to confirm that the reduction in financial allocations to the voluntary agencies in the disability sector was applied consistently across all HSE regions and in line with the reductions applied elsewhere in the health service.  The HSE was also requested to validate, as a matter of urgency, the methodology used by it to calculate the reductions in allocations for the various agencies.  The Senator is aware of what arose in Galway.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to the HSE clarifying the position.</P>
        <P>It is noted a majority of service providers are continuing to provide respite care services, despite the reductions in their allocations.  The arrangements for the public sector moratorium apply across the publicly funded health services and there can be no question of exempting voluntary service providers or providing them with additional funding.  This would undermine the strategic objectives of the Government&rsquo;s policy to reduce staffing levels and achieve payroll savings to bring the public voluntary finances into sustainable balance.  Voluntary providers, in common with the HSE, need to identify and implement under the public service agreement whatever changes in staffing levels, skills mix and work practices are necessary to protect services within the reduced level of funding available.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Minister of State met Brothers of Charity Services Ireland on 7 July, together with senior officials from the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, to discuss the importance of maintaining front-line services for people with disabilities.  The outcome of the meeting was a clear undertaking on all sides to work in partnership in order that services such as respite care could be maintained.  I know Brothers of Charity Services Ireland is anxious to work in partnership in resolving these issues.  It is as keen as the Government to ensure services are protected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is actually saying the cuts will be implemented.  Brothers of Charity Services Ireland is covered by section 38 of the Health Act and must adhere to the efficiencies the Government is seeking in the sector.  This year 26 of its staff will retire and, accordingly, will not be replaced.  How can the service avoid the public service <Col N="494"/>adjustments the Government requires from affecting its provision of front-line services?  The Minister has not given me any good news tonight.  How will we protect these services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has sought clarification on the even distribution of savings as they were constructed in such a way that they should not impact on front-line services.  As this is an ongoing process, the Minister will only be able to pursue the matter further when the information is received from the HSE.  The intention is to ensure services such as respite care are maintained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>People were marching last week in protest against these cuts because they were concerned that they would not be maintained.  They are under threat.</P>

	<P>I met the representatives of the Brothers of Charity last week.  We are all committed to ensuring front-line services are maintained, in particular respite care.</P>

	<P>The Minister has requested information and when it is received, the matter will be discussed further.  The Brothers of Charity indicated the issue of continuing respite care services would come to the fore at the end of the year.  They told me that some months ago.  Apparently, it was indicated to them at a recent meeting that further cuts were to be implemented.  The Senator will be aware I have not mentioned further cuts this evening.</P>

    <Title>Civil Marriage Registrars</Title>
      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ar dt&uacute;s ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chuir roimh an Aire.  My motion relates to couples in the north east who wish to say &ldquo;I do&rdquo; but who must say &ldquo;I would if I could but I cannot.&rdquo;  Numerous constituents have contacted me about the lack of available registrars in the Louth-Meath area to perform civil marriage ceremonies.  One constituent who wishes to marry on a Friday next March-April 2011 has been told it is not possible and has been offered a Tuesday as a possible day for her marriage.</P>
        <P>The Central Statistics Office has stated the number of civil ceremonies will in future surpass the number of religious ceremonies.  In 1996, the number of civil ceremonies stood at 6%.  In 2006, this figure was 23%.  Another issue of concern is the lack of off-site ceremonies.  One&rsquo;s wedding day should be a special day for oneself, one&rsquo;s partner and extended family.  Not everybody wants to marry in a registry office.  People often chose to marry in off-site ceremonies.  This should be provided for.  The purpose of the Central Statistics Office work is to ensure we can plan ahead for the future.  This issue requires serious consideration.</P>
        <P>There is a lack of flexibility across many elements of the public sector.  This issue needs to be addressed.  I am aware it has been proposed that registrars be redeployed from one area to another to perform ceremonies but this is not always practical or feasible.  I hope the Minister can address this issue.  I have been told that in the Louth-Meath, Cavan-Monaghan region there are four registrars, one of whom is due to retire and another of whom is on maternity leave.  This leaves only one registrar to perform ceremonies as one person needs to man the office.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this information.  Civil ceremonies in Drogheda are performed on a Tuesday or Friday only and there is no one free to do off-site ceremonies on a Friday. <Col N="495"/> Perhaps the Minister will outline if there is any way around this so people can be accommodated.  I raise this issue to ensure the Government is planning for the future to ensure people, who give approximately one year&rsquo;s notice of their intention to marry are not told they must pick a Tuesday only to have their wedding ceremony.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis as ucht na ceiste a ard&uacute;.</P>
        <P>I will briefly outline the management and organisational arrangements for the delivery of civil registration services.  Under the provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004, the Registrar General is responsible for the maintenance, management and control of the system of civil registration.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, is responsible for the provision of registration services direct to members of the public, including solemnisation of civil marriages.  The country is divided into eight regions, each region equating to an area covered by the former health boards, and each region is managed by a superintendent registrar appointed by the HSE.  All registrars are HSE staff members and the funding of the service is provided for in the annual Vote of the HSE.</P>
        <P>The staffing levels in the HSE civil registration service were established as a result of an independent review carried out under the modernisation programme, including grading structures and job descriptions.  The total number of staff approved for the region, which includes Louth and Meath, was 16.25 whole-time equivalents.  The region also includes Cavan and Monaghan.  The job descriptions designated staff at grade V as solemnisers of civil marriages.  Civil marriages are also solemnised by one grade VI member of staff and by the superintendent registrar as required.</P>
        <P>The number of staff at grade VI was approved at three &mdash; one each in counties Louth, Meath and Cavan.  One grade VI is based in Dundalk and the superintendent registrar in Drogheda.  The system of bookings for marriages is managed centrally in the superintendent registrar&rsquo;s office and registrars from across the region are deployed in a flexible manner, consistent with the provision of an efficient service.</P>
        <P>The number of civil marriages has been growing in recent years.  For example, civil marriages as a proportion of total marriages has risen from an average of 23% a year from 2005 to 2008 to 29% in 2009.  The actual volume of civil marriages increased by 20% between 2007 and 2009.  This, coupled with the option to have a marriage at an off-site location, has increased the workload on registration staff considerably.</P>
        <P>The current position is that the region has a full complement of registrars who solemnise civil marriages.  The superintendent registrar has confirmed that, while every effort is made to facilitate couples with their chosen date, this is not always possible due to previous bookings having been made on the date-time in question.  In all cases, an alternative date is offered and every effort is made to provide the best possible service, given the resource limitations and growing demand for civil marriages.</P>
        <P>The matter raised by the Senator is of vital importance in view of the fact the right to marry is enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and the special protection afforded the family under the Constitution.  Consequently, I will arrange to have the issue brought to the attention of the HSE to allow the matter be kept under review and appropriate action taken, where necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  As stated in the Minister&rsquo;s reply, the country is divided into eight regions, each region equating to an area covered by the former health boards.  The Minister will be aware the north east has in recent years exploded in terms of population.  We need to examine this issue in terms of increasing the number of <Col N="496"/>civil registrars in the area.  As the Minister stated, there will always be resource limitations, in particular given current affairs.  However, we must accept the reality in terms of where the population is leaning.  The CSO figures extrapolate where we are going.  There is a growing demand for civil marriages and as such this issue requires serious consideration.  I hope the Minister will bring the matter to the attention of the HSE.  I will make every effort to bring it to the attention of the HSE in the north east.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask the HSE to address the issue.  I again confirm that the right to marriage is fundamental and we must within reason facilitate it.</P>
