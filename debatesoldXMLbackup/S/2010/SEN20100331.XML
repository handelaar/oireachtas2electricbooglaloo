	<P>I have received notice from Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss progress on the establishment of an independent electoral commission.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>

I have selected the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Malley, McFadden and Keaveney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

	<P>So much happened yesterday of such scale that, at times, it is quite difficult for us to comprehend the nature of what is happening to our country.  Two points that stood out yesterday have to be emphasised on the Order of Business.  The effect of the decisions the Government took yesterday will be to double the national debt.  As a consequence of all the moves that are being taken, some &euro;40 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money will be pumped into Anglo Irish Bank.  That is significantly more than the amount of tax that is collected in this State in any given year.  When the Government talks about issues like this, it is quite happy to quote what is being said about them in the international press and the financial media.  It is important to look at this morning&rsquo;s editorial in the <i>Financial Times</i>.  In fairness, it says that some parts of the Government scheme have to be noted and recognised, but it goes on to say it should only be done if two criteria are met &mdash; &ldquo;if the cost to taxpayers has been minimised&rdquo; and it &ldquo;draws a line under the bank&rsquo;s losses&rdquo;.  The newspaper states &ldquo;unfortunately .... neither of these conditions has clearly been met&rdquo;.  The section of the editorial relating to the exposure of taxpayers continues &ldquo;unfortunately, the resulting losses will not be shared beyond the equity holders&rdquo;.  This brings us back to the losses faced by taxpayers as a result of events at Anglo Irish Bank.  Why are the bank&rsquo;s bondholders not being allowed to suffer the same losses as its shareholders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s bondholders not being allowed to suffer the same losses as the bondholders in Independent News and Media, for example, or the bondholders in Waterford Wedgwood?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer is quite clear.  In the run up to yesterday&rsquo;s announcement, many of us suspected that the Government was being run for the benefit of insiders.  We now know beyond any doubt that this is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="935"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The welfare and benefit of our country is not being given the same priority as the welfare and benefit of professional investors.  Their interests and their profitability is being put ahead of the interests and profitability of our country.  Many commentators said yesterday that this whole affair is a tragedy.  On my way to the House, I read a definition of &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; in today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i>.  It suggested that tragedies take place in three phases.  The first stage is hubris, or false pride, as exhibited by the Government over recent years.  The second is folly, which we saw yesterday.  The third stage, of course, is the fall.  The actions and decisions taken by the Government yesterday, which will have such a bad effect on future generations, have brought its fall nearer and made it all the more certain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It ill behoves anybody to cast aspersions on anybody in the middle of all this.  I perfectly understand the views of the Opposition parties.  I recognise the responsibility of Ministers and other politicians in this regard.  I recall that we welcomed the appointment of the new Governor and expressed trust and confidence in him.  I recall that we welcomed the appointment of the new Financial Regulator and expressed trust and confidence in him and in his background.  I also recall that when we discussed NAMA, we emphasised the importance of the EU&rsquo;s response to it.  These are important issues.  I thought we had allowed the three authorities in question to run the rule over what we did.  They have approved the progress of the Government and given it significant support.  I recognise that the Government has spent 18 months developing this approach.  While I support everything Senator Donohoe said about the impact of previous decisions on taxpayers &mdash; he is completely right &mdash; I have to look at the position of Anglo Irish Bank.  In October of last year, Fine Gael quite correctly agreed with the decision to support that bank and its savers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in favour of supporting savers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying this in an oppositional way.  Nobody can claim to be right on this issue.  People have to indicate how they came to form a judgment on it.  As I see it, the winding down of Anglo Irish Bank would cost as much as the recapitalisation of the bank.  The difference with recapitalisation is that we still have a bank at the end of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not own a bank now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>People can argue all they want.  It may be the case that other Senators are right and I am wrong.  I do not think people on this side of the House are more honest than people on the other side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe that to be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>One cannot say that about Fine Gael.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>People have to make the best judgment as they go along.  The reality is that if we let the bank die, it will have an impact on funds and savings, on our international reputation and on the cost of future borrowing.  These are real things.  I may well be wrong about it, but I can understand the Government&rsquo;s position.  I will support the Government&rsquo;s position, with extraordinary reluctance, for those reasons.  That is not to say Senator Donohoe was not completely right in everything he said.  I differ from him in the conclusion I have reached at the end of my deliberations on the matter.  There are other options.  It is not correct to say there are no alternatives.  There are alternatives.  There are none that are attractive at <Col N="936"/>this stage.  I completely support Senator Donohoe in the sense that I would love those who invested in Anglo Irish Bank to take a hit on this matter.  However, I am not prepared to cut off my nose to spite my face.  We need to deal with the bigger issue of the Irish economy and the Irish people.</P>
        <P>I spoke yesterday about the question of Quinn Insurance, which has now been related to the collapse of PMPA 20 or 30 years ago.  PMPA was a company in crisis at that time.  It was not operating at a profit.  The issues are completely different.  I would like to make a point to parties on all sides of the House.  I did not realise until this morning that we are still paying the 2% levy that was imposed on all insurance policy holders to pay for the PMPA black hole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, we are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Before Senators get too enthusiastic, I remind them that all parties have been in government since then.  Many of us, including the Leader, have worked to reduce the cost of insurance.  Why has nobody stopped this 2% levy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not paid in 1997.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is the cost of the black hole caused by the collapse of PMPA has been well paid for.  Questions have to be asked about why we are still paying the levy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It brings in approximately &euro;200 million a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>While the point Senator O&rsquo;Toole makes is well made, we must bear in mind that my party, like Fine Gael, has been in opposition since 1997.  If we were on the other side of the House, the country might not be in the mess it is in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Not only are we still paying the 2% PMPA levy, but there are people in this country who are paying a pension levy even though they will never see a pension.  I refer to part-time firefighters in west Cork and cleaners in schools throughout the country, for example.  It is a mystery that the PMPA levy still exists after 28 years, but it is also worth mentioning that legislation passed in this House and the other House means that people who will never get a pension have to pay the pension levy.</P>
        <P>I hope somebody on the Government side can answer a question about an aspect of yesterday&rsquo;s announcement.  What is the obsession with Anglo Irish Bank?  Who influences Government policy in this area?  We are giving &euro;40 billion to the bank.  I would like to return to a point made by Senator Norris in the context of the budget of 14 October 2008.  He referred to comments made by the then chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, to the effect that the Government was right to withdraw medical cards from people over the age of 70, as an example of the type of mindset that existed in banking circles in this country.  We also need to investigate the politics behind what has happened in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s policies on land speculation and tax incentivisation encouraged the behaviour that led to the development of the blackest hole there has ever been in the Irish economy.  The bailout, if I can borrow the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s <Col N="937"/>expression, is &ldquo;truly horrifying&rdquo;.  The Government does not have a policy on job creation and protection.  I ask Senators to reflect on what &euro;40 billion could do for job creation in this country.  We are throwing money at the system.  I sincerely hope it works as if it does not, the hole will get deeper, the mess will get murkier and we will saddle generations of Irish people with debt for years to come.  Later this morning, the Taoiseach will be announcing the latest live register figures in the D&aacute;il.  Up until the end of February, they stood at 437,000.  Many people on the live register are block layers, plasterers, carpenters, electricians and so on.  These people depended on the construction economy, which was a bubble created by the Government.  Those people will see no bailout.  They are fighting to pay utility bills and to put food on their table, but there is no bailout for them.  It is unconscionable that Anglo Irish Bank will get &euro;40 billion given that it played Russian roulette with the economy and the people who ran the bank conducted themselves in a way that was ignored by those in the highest levels of the Government.</P>
        <P>It is refreshing to hear Matthew Elderfield talk about the current financial situation in Ireland.  He is somebody who will not take prisoners and who is not accustomed to the cronyism in this country.  He comes with an objective eye and if he sees something that is wrong, he will attempt to correct it.</P>
        <P>The taxpayer is being used and abused by this Government.  It has let the banks off the hook and that simply is not good enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>These are worrying times.  The fishermen in the State must still go out and cast their nets.  The farmer must tend his sheep and cattle this morning, irrespective of the financial disaster that has been outlined here today.  Unfortunately, much of what has been outlined is true.  I rise today in the midst of this crisis to speak about something close to my heart.  I was promised a debate on the fishing industry this time last year, especially in view of the Common Fisheries Policy that is being renegotiated in Europe.  I am delighted to hear a fresh voice from the new Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries, Deputy Sean Connick, who said that the Irish fishing industry is not up for sale.  I wish him well in these negotiations that are so important for a small section of the community that sometimes suffers discrimination.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know it is not possible this week, but I would like to have a debate on the fishing industry before the end of April.  I am sure much of this morning&rsquo;s debate will go over the heads of fishermen, farmers and ordinary working people, but they must still earn a living.  The Leader should give this debate priority status when we return in a few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek a debate on accountability and responsibility.  Yesterday, the taxpayer was once again asked to foot the bill for the failed policies of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in government.  What was the Financial Regulator doing?  What was his terms of reference?  Was he doing his job?  What were the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance doing?</P>
        <P>I disagree with the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  The citizens have a millstone around their neck.  Senator Boyle may well laugh and smirk, but what upsets me more than anything else&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>You should not comment on people across the floor of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is that you came into the Government on a horse, promising openness and transparency, and you have sold your soul to Fianna F&aacute;il to stay in power.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I will give my response in a minute.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Address your comments through the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s party has left the ordinary people down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked two questions already.  The ordinary person has been let down.  It is about time the likes of former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, as well as the current Taoiseach were held to account for their stewardship of this country.  Unemployment is at 13% and we have a massive bill for the banking crisis, yet all we have to show for it is complete emptiness.  There is no hope, no vision, no jobs policy and no leadership.  The people are emigrating and the Green Party is happy to cosy up to Fianna F&aacute;il in Government.  If that is what its members want, then they should stay in power and wreck the country.  I plead with them to get out of office and let those of us who have the interests of the people at heart to go in and govern so that there might be fairness and equality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Every day in this House there is a debate on accountability and responsibility, and I am glad to have such debates at any time.  When NAMA was agreed by this House and the other House last year, the debate was whether the haircut on the loans from the financial institutions would be sufficient.  The legislation allowed for a haircut of 30%.  At the time of the debate, I said that the haircut should be closer to 50%.  The actual haircut is 47% and this shows that NAMA is working.</P>
        <P>We are not criticising the Government here.  We are criticising the decisions made by the Governor of the Central Bank and by the newly appointed Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, who has been praised already by a Member of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>So it is somebody else&rsquo;s responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can politick all he likes about the policies that led us here, but if he cares about this country, he must understand that the actions taken now are the most cost efficient decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a bit rich.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>They are being made on the basis that they have to be made for the future of this country.  If we were to consider the options that were thrown off the top of the head by Members opposite over the past nine months, we would be paying multiples of the figures that have to be spent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not take them off the top of our heads.  The figures were examined and costed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact that such figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No interruptions, please.  I will adjourn the House if this continues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;had cold water poured on them by leaders of Fine Gael would indicate to me that they were ill thought out.  Over the past 15 months, we have gone through widespread consultation involving independent officers, we have appointed a Financial Regulator from outside the State who had no previous connection with Irish financial services, a Governor of the Central Bank who was not appointed under the previous system whereby the Secretary General of the Department of Finance was upgraded.  There is now a new way doing <Col N="939"/>things and of facing difficulties.  If Members on that side of the House were a real Opposition and if they cared about the future of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is great to be passionate now.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Donohoe made a very reasoned and fine speech.  Unfortunately, the debate has descended since then.  This is regrettable because the matter is far too serious.  We have to learn to listen to each other, whether or not we agree.  It is up to us to take the temperature down a little bit and apply reason to these issues.  I regret that there was a headline in a newspaper today which stated that various people should be shot.  These people have done appalling things and have landed this country in misery, but how would that misery be alleviated if some lunatic took up this proposal and murdered one of them?  This is the kind of thing done by Republican Party members in America.  They call for President Obama to be put in the crosshairs.  Too many people have been subjected to violence.  They should be subject to intellectual scrutiny, held to account and possibly sent to jail, but I do not think this kind of overheated debate is a good idea.</P>
        <P>Somebody said that nobody has been right on this.  Senator Boyle has indicated that he was partially right, and so was I.  The figures posted yesterday were similar to those I put on the record, but thanks to the media, nothing I said was ever reported because I was not looking for heads and buckets of blood.  None the less, I am constantly criticised.  I got an abusive letter today stating that I am part of the corruption because I tried to take a rational and dispassionate view of things.</P>
        <P>Mr. Peter Mathews is somebody for whom I have great respect and whose figures I have sometimes quoted in the House.  Everything that was said yesterday, horrible as it was, vindicated what he tried to communicate to Members of this House.  Will the Leader seek to make an arrangement to afford Mr. Matthews, who is correct in his figures and has not been partisan, an opportunity to speak to some of the people who are now guiding our economy?  While I know he has had a brief conversation with the Minister for Finance, I would like him to be able to talk to Mr. Alan Dukes to discuss these figures, not in an overheated fashion but to see if there is a way forward because there may be.  The country has been through such <Col N="940"/>situations before.  Political events affect financial ones.  When the Irish Parliament was collapsed and absorbed into the parliament at Westminster, it was seen as a catastrophic event by many and it had an effect.  Belvedere House, at the top of North Great George&rsquo;s Street in Dublin, was sold to the Jesuits in the aftermath of that event for about one third of what it had cost to build 50 years previously.  That is the kind of haircut that had to be taken before, yet things recovered.  I hope that in five or ten years&rsquo; time perhaps this ludicrous amount of money that is being filched from taxpayers by these dreadful, misguided people who so foolishly embarked on adventures will come back to the taxpayer if these matters are prudently managed.  They need to be prudently managed, however, not made the subject of mud-slinging and an ignorant debate.</P>

	<P>The two Independent Members of the House who have spoken, Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Norris, have, in many ways, enhanced the image of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  They have made a case for its continuation.  I do not say that in a patronising way but genuinely.  If we do not approach the momentous difficulties we face in a practical, realistic and honest way, we will not be serving the requirements and rights of individual citizens.  It is obviously the Opposition&rsquo;s duty to engage in robust debate, particularly on such an issue and it has done it exceptionally well.  It would be totally wrong if we were all yes men and women in such a debate, as it is vital to embrace all the expertise available on both sides of the House.  I compliment the Deputy Leader for the manner in which he has researched the subject and expressed his particular views.  </P>
        <P>Last night I was listening to the editor of the <i>Irish Independent </i>on the television programme &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo;.  He was so realistic and the manner in which he made the case for action surprised me; he put it in a global context.  No one could say any newspaper, the<i> Irish Independent</i> included, was exactly pro-Government in the last couple of years.  However, there was a definite sea change in the presentation made on the programme last night.</P>
        <P>Even though there must be cut and thrust in our debates, there is still an opportunity for Members of this House and likewise in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to work together to bring about the required solution.  We are all waiting to see how yesterday&rsquo;s decisions concerning the banks will be viewed in the European Union and elsewhere.  If we are talking about creating jobs and relieving the pressure on individual citizens, we will not do it in the manner in which such debates have unfolded in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments expressed my colleague Senator Donohoe on yesterday&rsquo;s announcements by the Minister for Finance on recapitalising the banks.  I join Senator Buttimer who sought a specific debate in this regard.  We all remember that two weeks before the guarantee was introduced, the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service had a meeting with the Financial Regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank who told us we had the best banks in Europe.  That was two weeks before the Minister introduced the guarantee which was supported at the time by Fine Gael, as it secured the future of our entire banking sector.  There needs to be a level of openness and honesty in this debate which has not been evident heretofore.  Senator Boyle inferred that people who opposed the Government&rsquo;s position somehow did not know what they were on about, or were not being realistic or honest.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech yesterday was distinctly lacking in an outline of alternative proposals the Government might have examined.  The Minister came with his guarantee which received widespread support at the time.  We were told it would achieve a certain objective for the banking sector, yet he has come back three or four times since.  The figures are appalling.  The <Col N="941"/>Minister himself said they were horrifying and he is correct.  The most significant thing we will ever do as Members of the Oireachtas is to discuss what the Minister put before the D&aacute;il yesterday.  We will have a debate on the matter later.  I do not subscribe to the view, as espoused by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, that the international markets are looking at Ireland and depending on the Government to pay for the misdemeanours of a private entity in the shape of Anglo Irish Bank, or that they see the Government as a bottomless pit to support the antics of Mr. FitzPatrick and his friends in development, politics and the Government, Fianna F&aacute;il in particular.  The international markets are mature enough to realise that Anglo Irish Bank is not of systemic importance to our banking structure and that it should be wound up in an orderly fashion.  That is what the Opposition is proposing.</P>

	<P>That is where the Senator is coming from.  This is all about hunting.  It has been a seriously difficult decision to arrive at and to receive any level of support for what is being proposed, but it is the most cost-effective option before us.  I have yet to hear an option being given by Fine Gael that would be less costly, although I would look forward to hearing it.</P>
        <P>I am seeking a debate on planning and how it fed the monster before us.  If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, had not withdrawn the development plan for County Monaghan &mdash; a plan on which the cheerleading was led by Fine Gael councillors &mdash; it would have gone through.</P>

	<P>By way of example, if the plan had been allowed to go through, there would have been further lending of further bad development proposals and God knows how much extra NAMA and recapitalisation would be costing us now.  There is a public dimension to this.  There is culpability, perhaps not on the part of the Government but on the part of council members of all Opposition parties.  I, for one, want to see the Opposition behaving in an responsible manner throughout the political system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday one newspaper carried a report on the interests of Members of this House.  I was rather embarrassed to discover that it said I was the only shareholder in Anglo Irish Bank, which is not correct.  I was a shareholder in a property which had an address at Anglo Irish Bank.  I want to correct that point because I was embarrassed by the report.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to discover yesterday that we were to have a debate on banking today.  Such a debate should not take place on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that such a debate is taking place on the Order of Business.  Since yesterday we have had clarity on the amounts of money involved.  Is the cost of bailing out the banks lower than the cost of letting them go to the wall?  That is the debate we need to have today.  We have allocated three hours and I hope we will have that debate.</P>
        <P>I would like to see a debate take place very soon on the insurance industry.  If it has been arranged for tomorrow, I am pleased.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I was jolted by the discovery this morning that we were still paying levies introduced on the collapse of PMPA 28 years ago.  While I look forward to the debate tomorrow, we should also be discussing in today&rsquo;s debate on banking the alternatives to what was proposed yesterday.  This is an interesting debate and it is the right time to have it.  Let us make sure we will have it during the time allocated rather than on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with interest that I hear my colleagues talk about events in the financial and banking sector.  I look forward to the debate in the House today, in which I hope to be able to participate.  The rescue package announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, proves that we are facing up to the current difficulties in the banking sector, have acknowledged the large scale of our problems and are taking the necessary steps to resolve these issues.  We will all have an opportunity to make our case later today. </P>
        <P>To remain on the subject of financial matters, I asked the Leader previously for a debate on the aviation industry.  What progress has he made, with the other party leaders, in that regard?  We must consider the opportunities arising in the aviation sector and address some of the difficulties being experienced by our national airline, Aer Lingus.  I note from reports in today&rsquo;s <Col N="943"/>newspapers that the company&rsquo;s 2009 results show losses of &euro;130 million, with an operating loss of &euro;81 million, four times greater than in 2008.  While there has been a change in the management structure, there is still much to be discussed.  I would like to see such a debate take place as quickly as possible.  As I said the last time I made a contribution on the issue, there are considerable opportunities for job creation around the north Dublin hub, particularly in the areas of aviation colleges, maintenance, leasing and so on.  In this regard, we could consider the model of Parc Aviation.</P>
        <P>The HSE is an important body.  Will the Leader indicate how the position of chief executive will be filled, particularly in the light of the recent media coverage about Professor Keane?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the reversal of the decision to withdraw the air-sea rescue service from Waterford Airport during night-time hours.  It was a ludicrous decision from the beginning and I am glad it has been reversed.  I acknowledge the fact that the Government has recognised the error it made and that it has been rectified.  Everyone in the south east welcomes this.</P>
        <P>The United Kingdom has introduced a 14-year sentence for the importation or sale of mephedrone.  When will this substance be banned in Ireland?  There is a suggestion we are waiting for a uniform system for banning such products from the European Union.  I suggest all products in head shops be licensed by the Irish Medicines Board and the Food Safety Authority.  This would be the way to solve the problem and rid the country of this scourge in every town and county.</P>
        <P>I ask our Green Party colleagues on the other side whether Fianna F&aacute;il has had any representation on Monaghan County Council in the last 15 years.  It is a question they should ask themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the decision to retain the 24-hour air-sea rescue service in the south east.  The whole incident was a public relations disaster.  I am not sure what decision, if any, was made initially but it has worked out to our benefit.  We will now have a faster service in the south east and on the entire island owing to improved technology and the provision of more helicopters.  It is to be hoped more lives will be saved.  It is a good news story.</P>
        <P>There has been much comment today, rightly so, about our realisation yesterday of the extent of the banking crisis, which is an appalling vista.  I have the utmost trust in the sincerity of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who shows energy, enthusiasm and a commitment to get the country out of the crisis.  Apart from the treatment of Anglo Irish Bank which does not sit comfortably with me, he is going about it in the right way.</P>
        <P>The headline in the <i>Irish Daily Star</i> this morning was, &ldquo;They deserve to be shot&rdquo;.  This resulted in an inundation of text messages to radio stations agreeing with the sentiment expressed.  Even though it is a stark headline, it has tapped into the strong feelings of the public on social justice.  The people are so angry they want to see heads roll.  They want to see people being jailed, as Bernie Madoff was in the USA for 150 years.  This symbolised that the federal government was on the side of the people and that the perpetrators were going to pay.  Taxpayers are upset at having to pay for the crisis.  As a parent, I do not want to see my children paying the price for today&rsquo;s decisions in 25 or 30 years&rsquo; time &mdash; I am sure those other Senators who are parents feel the same &mdash; however, they will have to do so.  If we were to see heads roll &mdash; if we were to see the people who got us into this mess being thrown into jail without mercy &mdash; people would start to believe at least that the law was on their side, but we are not seeing this.  Personal debt collection is an absolute joke.  People come to ask me what they can do about their debts, but they see builders going around in their SUVs and with their palatial homes and swimming pools and nothing can be done about it.  That is the next move that must <Col N="944"/>be made.  It is not an issue for the Minister for Finance; it is more in the realm of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the reconfiguration of hospitals in the south east.  I must be honest and admit I was appalled by the statement of the Minister for Health and Children on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; the other night that the decision would not be political but would be made by clinicians.  The Minister needs to realise that the issue of accident and emergency and maternity units in counties is very much political.  We need a debate in the Seanad to get the message through that it must not be a clinical decision.  Politicians obtain and retain services in their counties.  That is what we are about and the Minister must be told this.  We need a debate on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the fact that we are having a debate on banking, given that there is only one issue in the public mind today, as evidenced by the headlines, that is, the enormous amount of money we are pouring away to keep the banks afloat, particularly the zombie bank known as Anglo Irish Bank.  The same questions are being asked by everybody: why are we doing this and how much more do we intend to spend on this bank?  Those on the other side have suggested it would cost more to wind it down, but the real worry is that we simply do not know how much it will cost to keep it afloat.  We have already spent &euro;4 billion; yesterday we pledged to spend another &euro;8.3 billion and there is another &euro;10 billion needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will discuss that matter in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The real fear is that there will be even more required.  If Anglo Irish Bank keeps demanding more money from us, it will turn out that an orderly wind-down would have been a far better and more cost-effective way of dealing with this zombie bank.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator McDonald that this is an issue of justice as much as of finance.  People want to see accountability and feel, in particular, that those who ran the banks which now require the largest bail-out from the taxpayer should face justice.</P>
        <P>I also request a debate on the prosecution of sex offences.  We had a good debate yesterday on the issue of domestic violence and I see in today&rsquo;s newspapers a welcome announcement by the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Fachtna Murphy, that he is establishing a new central sexual crimes management unit to ensure there will be a better rate of prosecution of sex offences.  It is a major concern to those working in this area that the rate of prosecution of reported sex offences is so low.  There is a low rate of reporting of sex offences, but even of those that are actually reported, few are proceeded with.  I am delighted the Garda is establishing this unit, but it is scandalous that it has taken it so long to do so.  The Commissioner said the new unit was prompted by the Ryan and Murphy reports, but it should not have required that.  There are still serious questions to be answered about the failure to investigate known convicted sex offenders, such as former priest Bill Carney who was profiled in a recent BBC &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; programme.  I welcome the initiative, but it is overdue.</P>
        <P>I also seek a debate on alternatives to imprisonment.  I will facilitate an Irish Penal Reform Trust briefing today for all Members in Room A in Leinster House at 12 o&rsquo;clock at which invited guests will examine the Fines Bill and discuss the need to ensure reform of our sentencing system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the call for the banning of methadrone.  In the United Kingdom, no fewer than 26 people, mostly young, have lost their lives as a result of taking this substance.  A Commons committee has recommended that it be made a class B drug, which is a step in the right direction.  We are in a race against time and must act with great haste to ensure this substance is put where it belongs &mdash; out of the reach of both young and old.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="945"/>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of those who have contributed this morning seem to feel they were the first to highlight the current crisis.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  When both I and Senator Boyle were Members of the Lower House, numerous debates were held during our five years there on the issue of where the country was going wrong.  However, the Government chose to ignore the issue.  Senator Boyle has now joined the Government and is apologetic on its behalf.  Therefore, he should stop acting as if he was the guardian of the truth over the years.</P>
        <P>I would like a debate in the House on the public sector deal proposed by Government and the public sector unions.  Over the past number of years, many promises have been made with regard to reform of the public service under benchmarking reforms.  There has been some successful reform in the sector, but there has also been botched reform, specifically within the health services.  There are also areas where there has been no reform whatsoever.  If the latest agreement with the public sector unions is to have any credibility, the issue must be discussed in both Houses of the Oireachtas in order that we can see what level of reform is planned.</P>
        <P>Before we move on to the debate on the banking crisis, I would like to remind the Government parties, that the public is as mad as hell and no amount of mocking it or taking it for granted will save the sorry backsides of either Fianna F&aacute;il or the Green Party this time around.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate that is to take place later today on the banks.  We should also have a debate on the issue of how the matter is being reported in the media.  I see a difficult situation arising.  In the past we had hyper positive reporting of just about everything to do with our economy and anybody who said anything negative was pilloried or heralded as a prophet of doom.  Now, however, we seem to have gone to the opposite extreme and anybody who says anything positive about the economy is pilloried as an idiot.  We have gone from one extreme to the other, but neither is entirely right.  Both good and bad things are happening.  People on both sides of the House appreciate that the key issue is that small and medium enterprises need to be able to rebuild the economy.  It is not all about the banks, but about the fact that ordinary people need to be able to get back to work so we can build up the economy.  The Minister announced yesterday that &euro;3 billion was being set aside for small and medium enterprises, which I consider good news among the significant negative and bad news we heard.  We should highlight this, but when I saw it in the newspapers, I found it buried on page 10 and hardly given a mention.  We, on both sides of the House, need to keep our eyes on the ball.  We need to ensure the economy can recover and should not focus on bad news all the time.</P>
        <P>With regard to reporting of what is happening, I mentioned previously that the Romanian Senate debated this issue and unanimously passed a motion that there should be a quota of both good and bad news on such stories.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very difficult to blame the media today for reporting the bad news when we see the billions that landed on the shoulders of taxpayers yesterday.  There <Col N="946"/>has been much talk about accountability and responsibility this morning.  We on this side do not need any lectures on responsibility from a Government that, strikingly, refused to apologise yesterday for the situation we are landed in.  While the banks clearly have responsibility, our political leaders should also accept responsibility.  There are issues of accountability and responsibility for the Government, but it has neither accepted nor acknowledged these.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle spoke earlier about accountability and responsibility.  I refer briefly to the Private Members&rsquo; motion on the lost at sea scheme which is down for this evening and note that once again the Government does not accept responsibility or accountability.  Members know full well that the joint committee has already refused to discuss the lost at sea scheme report and has refused to take on board a detailed discussion or investigation of what the report contains.  The Green Party said this should happen, but its representative on the committee did not attend for the vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>Where is the accountability and responsibility in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for so speedily arranging the debate on the banking situation for today.  It is interesting to note from the Opposition this morning that there was knowledge in the Lower House during the previous term of Government of the difficulties in the banking sector.  There was awareness of how difficult the situation was and of the property bubble that would create difficulties.  That being the case, why did the Fine Gael manifesto in 2007 propose a complete abolition of stamp duty?  That demonstrates the hypocrisy of pointing the finger at us in a self-righteous manner when Fine Gael was going to throw petrol on the flames with its proposal to abolish stamp duty on property completely.</P>
        <P>I support the call made for the banning of methadrone and suggest we have a debate on the issue.  Perhaps we could focus on the need for each drug to be approved before it can be sold.  We are aware that by the simple change of a compound, the methadrone could reappear in head shops and be legally sold.  I suggest that before a drug could be sold, it should be approved, thereby putting headshops out of business.</P>

	<P>We need a steadier hand on the tiller.  I welcome the provision in the Central Bank Reform Bill, as published yesterday, which requires and aims to ensure proper fitness and probity of nominees to key positions in banks.  This is long overdue.  Due to the fact taxpayers are putting so much extra equity shareholding into the two main banks with large branch networks, the Minister should insist on more public interest directors and ensure the people responsible for the appalling mess and disastrous decisions are removed forthwith.  They should be long gone.</P>

	<P>I agree with colleagues and welcome the Cabinet decision to do a U-turn on a search and rescue helicopter emergency service in the south east.  That decision <Col N="947"/>should never have been made and the reversal of it is a victory for people power and common sense.  I am glad the decision was reversed.</P>
        <P>Today, a burden of over &euro;5,000 will be placed on every man, woman and child in the country as a result of the recapitalisation we heard about yesterday &mdash; the &euro;22.5 billion that will be required to recapitalise the zombie Anglo Irish Bank.  I agree with those who say the entire system must be purged of both banking and political leaders.  Discussion of this crisis is very relevant.  It was due mainly to the lack of oversight and regulation for many years.  There must be accountability.  Therefore, I support the calls for a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>I agree, to an extent, with Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in&rsquo;s assertion that there is a need for good news stories.  In recent days I attended a function at Kel-Tech Engineering in Waterford .  Kel-Tech is a small manufacturing company which employs over 60 people and it received an international award from Caterpillar for the work it was doing.  It must be acknowledged that small businesses remain successful and competitive and the public must be informed about good news stories such as that to which I refer.  We cannot give up on high quality manufacturing and the message must be got across that a great deal of such activity continues to be engaged in.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader make time available for a debate on dental health?  The dental treatment services scheme has been cut to a large degree.  If we fail to invest and make proper resources available in order that people might avail of proper dental services and practise good oral hygiene, we will be obliged to deal with the issue of tooth decay in the future.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this important matter at some future date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I take issue with the remarks made by Senator Hanafin.  It is outrageous that he should distort the record of the House and suggest that in the past Fine Gael did not vigorously oppose the policies that led to overheating in the economy and under which spending was mismanaged.  In successive budget speeches Deputy Richard Bruton outlined the difficulties that would arise in this regard.  In so doing he continued the tradition of economic prudence established under the Government led by Mr. John Bruton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>John Bruton was job-sharing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s remarks are outrageous and need to be withdrawn.</P>
        <P>In the light of the enormous public anger that is apparent this morning, I call on the Leader to ask the Government to provide a public apology.  If it provided such an apology, it might prove to be the starting point in assuaging the public anger to which I refer.  Is it not clear that a distinction should have been made in the Government&rsquo;s approach to subordinated bondholders?  The people concerned speculate for speculation&rsquo;s sake&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Those to whom I refer are aware they are taking risks and operate on that basis.  Is it not the case that we should have adopted a different approach to these individuals?  Was the Government hoodwinked and sold a pup in this matter?  Will the Leader indicate that a mistake has been made and that the matter will be addressed?  We are giving money to people whose business is gambling.  These individuals make high profits one day which are balanced by losses the next.  We are guaranteeing their activities.  I accept that this is a small element of the problem but the money involved would be sufficient to allow us to build new hospitals and schools.  What is happening is wrong.</P>

	<P>Senators Donohoe, O&rsquo;Toole, McCarthy, O&rsquo;Donovan, Boyle, Norris, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, John Paul Phelan, Dearey, Quinn, McDonald, Bacik, &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, Hanafin, Coghlan, Coffey and O&rsquo;Reilly expressed their serious concerns about banking issues.  As Members are aware, statements on banking are due to be made immediately after the Order of Business until 2 p.m.  It is my intention that the debate will be rolled over and continued after the Easter recess in order that we might monitor progress.</P>
        <P>The announcements made yesterday are extremely serious in nature.  The country and the Government have been presented with a major challenge.  I was a Member of the House when our colleagues on the benches opposite were in power and there was a great deal of activity.  At the time a great deal was said about future generations.  Ten to 12 years later, however, there was a budget surplus.  It is swings and roundabouts with regard to matters such as those under discussion.  The circle will be completed.  Ultimately, best practice must be observed, which is what is happening in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and with the new Financial Regulator.  People can feel more confident with regard to transparency and openness.  We look forward to assisting the Minister for Finance and the Government in any way possible during this difficult period.  I look forward to colleagues&rsquo; contributions to the debate on banking due to take place following the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris requested that Mr. Peter Matthews meet Mr. Alan Dukes.  I will endeavour to ensure such a meeting takes place.  The Senator&rsquo;s suggestion in this regard is worthwhile.  I listened to Mr. Dukes, a former Minister for Finance, on the radio this morning and I am of the opinion that a great deal depends on his past experience.  He is again doing the right thing to assist the country.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Dearey referred to matters relating to the insurance industry, Quinn Insurance in particular.  The House is due to hear statements tomorrow on the importance of competition in the insurance industry.  I will be proposing that the debate also be rolled over until after Easter in order that progress, particularly in respect of the Quinn Group, can be monitored.  The Quinn Group has done so much in the context of reform of the industry and assisting in lowering premiums &mdash; whether they relate to employer&rsquo;s liability, public liability or commercial, private, motor or health insurance &mdash; across the board.  The company has been the main driver in making the insurance market in this country competitive.  I served as Chairman of the Oireachtas committee which carried out a four and a half year inquiry into the matter and issued three interim reports, as well as a final report.  I certainly want to see competition in the marketplace.  That last thing we want is for the 5,500 employees of Quinn Insurance in this country and the 1,500 people it employs outside this jurisdiction to be placed under threat.  The Quinn Group is a shining example of success.  However, what is happening illustrates the depth of the downturn nationally and internationally.  Members can take it that the Government will be doing everything possible to assist everyone employed by the Quinn Group.  It will also ensure this competitive player remains in the market.  I hope the matter will be brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
        <P>Senator Dearey also requested a debate on planning.  In the light of the forthcoming legislation on planning, such a debate would be extremely timely and I will have no difficulty in allocating time for it.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan requested a full debate with the new Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries, Deputy Connick.  Again, I will have no difficulty in arranging such a debate, which is long overdue.  I will make this a priority following the Easter recess.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer, Boyle and John Paul Phelan requested a debate on accountability and transparency.  I will make time available for such a debate.</P><Col N="949"/>
        <P>Senator Callely called for a debate on the aviation industry and the jobs relating thereto.  I have agreed to arrange such a debate which will be facilitated following the Easter recess.  The Senator also requested a debate on the up-to-date position on health issues.  I have already provided a commitment to the effect that such a debate will take place.</P>
        <P>Senators Cummins, McDonald and Coffey all welcomed the reversal of the decision to withdraw the search and rescue service from the south east.  Many colleagues, particularly, as Senator McDonald correctly stated, those on the Government side, were involved in ensuring this happened.

        <P>Senator Twomey called for reform in the public service.  This is very timely and, as I stated yesterday, I strongly welcome the outcome of the discussions between the Government and the public sector unions.  We know this is very good news for the economy and the country.  I thank all those involved in the Croke Park talks for their positive and pro-active contributions, in particular the two facilitators, Kieran Mulvey and Kevin Foley.

    <Title>Banking: Statements.</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Prior to making my statement, I wish to inform the House that as a result of the reshuffle last week there are now two Ministers of State at the Department of Finance, something which I greatly welcome, not least with regard to the business of this House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, will reply to this debate.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the final phase measures that the Government is taking to restore stability and certainty to Ireland&rsquo;s banking system.  The banking measures announced by the Minister for Finance yesterday are the latest in a series of successful measures taken to stabilise the banks and to protect the interests of the taxpayer and depositors.  They are the final steps in the process that will secure the future of the Irish banking sector, which is crucial to ensuring that the Irish economy can benefit from the global economic recovery that is now in train.</P>
        <P>While economic activity remains weak, having introduced budgetary adjustments of more than &euro;15 billion over the past two years the Government&rsquo;s fiscal position is credible.  Our efforts to restore stability have been positively received throughout Europe and around the world.  As a result, we are now in a position to return to economic growth on a more sustainable basis.  I draw attention to an article in today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> under the headline &ldquo;Wounded Celtic Tiger shows signs of clawing back growth&rdquo;.  It states that it is becoming apparent that Ireland&rsquo;s modern economy is holding up well.  The decisive steps announced by the Minister yesterday for our banking sector will generate the same sort of confidence in Ireland as the steps taken towards our fiscal position.  The measures announced yesterday will position our banking <Col N="952"/>system to play an important role in our recovery.  While the cost of facing up to our problems is unpalatable to all, there is not an alternative.  The price we pay is the price of long-term stability.</P>
        <P>The Government is recapitalising the banks in order that the system as a whole can return to its rightful role of provider of credit to the real economy.  Well-capitalised banks are in a much better place to lend and with so much attention focused on NAMA and capitalisation, the lending targets outlined by the Minister yesterday should not be overlooked.  Furthermore, the banks will be required to realign their business practices with the needs of the modern Irish economy.  Strategically targeted lending to small and medium enterprises, which all recognise as the lifeblood of the economy, will provide a welcome fillip to employment and growth in this sector.  The provision of working capital for businesses is simply essential and entrepreneurs must be provided with the tools to demonstrate their innovation and ideas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not wish to interrupt the Minister of State, will copies of the script be made available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Minister has set specific lending targets for AIB and Bank of Ireland.  They will make available for targeted lending not less than &euro;3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  In particular, it must include funds for working capital for businesses.  This represents a considerable increase on lending last year.  To ensure the proper management of these funds, the two banks will be required to submit SME lending plans by both geography and sector for 2010 and 2011.  Mr. John Trethowan, as the Government&rsquo;s new credit reviewer, will be reviewing bank lending policies as part of his remit.</P>
        <P>The first loans have now transferred to NAMA and the agency&rsquo;s painstaking approach to the valuation of the loans will result in the maximum level of protection for the taxpayer.  The first tranche represents roughly one fifth of the total amount to be transferred and comes from the ten largest borrowers.  The bottom-up valuation means the banks will incur heavy losses on the loans which NAMA will acquire from them, which in some cases will amount to more than 50%.  The banks must deal with the resultant losses now as any delay would only lead to stagnation.  The losses on these loans, together with the capital requirements outlined by the Financial Regulator, have made clear the likely requirements of the banks and building societies.  In this regard, I now wish to address the impacts on each of the institutions.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has determined that Bank of Ireland must raise additional equity capital of &euro;2.7 billion by the end of the year to meet the new capital standards.  Bank of Ireland already has taken action to address its capital needs through private sources and the Government has committed to supporting the bank in its efforts through the conversion of preference shares.  The State intends to achieve full value for its investment while remaining a minority shareholder in the bank.  Recapitalising Bank of Ireland will maintain its strong presence in the international capital markets and provide loan finance to individuals and businesses, while supporting Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.</P>
        <P>The regulator has determined that Allied Irish Banks must raise additional equity capital of at least &euro;7.4 billion by the end of the year to meet the new base case capital standards.  In view of the extent of capital to be raised, Allied Irish Banks will be required by the regulator to produce a detailed capital plan by the end of April this year.  However, the sale of its assets in the United States, Poland and Great Britain will assist the bank in meeting its capital requirements.  The State is willing to convert some or all of its preference shares to provide additional capital in the form of ordinary equity if capital cannot be accessed privately.  If private capital proves unavailable, the State will have a majority shareholding in Allied Irish Banks as a listed <Col N="953"/>entity.  This is preferable to the prospect of an under-capitalised or barely adequately capitalised bank stagnating in the economy.</P>
        <P>Clearly it has proved extremely difficult to find a solution for Anglo Irish Bank, given the poor quality of its very sizeable balance sheet.  The Minister for Finance reiterated yesterday that winding up the bank is assuredly not a viable option as the cost would be too great.  Such a measure also would cause such disruption to the financial system that it could generate enormous and long-lasting economic instability for the State.  As the Minister informed the D&aacute;il, Anglo Irish Bank was much larger relative to the Irish economy than was Lehman Brothers relative to the United States economy.  Given that the failure of Lehman Brothers brought the global financial system to the brink, it is clear that the disorderly failure of Anglo Irish Bank just two weeks later would have had a similar effect on the entire Irish financial system.  The Government is providing &euro;8.3 billion to support the capital position of the bank to take account of the bank&rsquo;s losses to date.  There is no alternative to this capital injection that would meet the bank&rsquo;s unavoidable obligations at a lower cost.  The Minister&rsquo;s actions are the logical step towards stability in our banking system.  The new management team in Anglo Irish Bank is not part of the old guard and is demonstrably committed to implementing a strong risk management system and to reducing the bank&rsquo;s cost base.  Its actions and policies are designed to lead ultimately to the creation of a smaller and stronger bank, leaving the remainder in the form of an asset management and recovery company.  The Government&rsquo;s overriding objective is to maximise the potential return for the taxpayer in recognition of the very significant State support that has been afforded this institution.</P>
        <P>As this House will be aware, Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, was heavily exposed to property speculation and as a result will transfer approximately 80% of its assets to NAMA.  It requires a significant injection of capital.  The Financial Regulator has determined that INBS will need an injection of &euro;2.6 billion to remain compliant with its current regulatory capital requirements.  Again, the provision of this capital is the least costly option available to the Government as without this capital injection, the taxpayer would be obliged to shoulder the significant and immediate costs in meeting the deposits, bondholders and the liabilities due to the ECB.  The State will have extensive powers, as well as economic ownership of INBS, following the issuing of &euro;100 million in special investment shares in the institution.  The remaining capital required by INBS will be injected by way of a promissory note.  This will have the effect of spreading over time the cost to the Exchequer.  The Government favours a swift sale of INBS or its integration with another entity.</P>
        <P>While EBS is less exposed to the property development sector, it none the less requires the injection of capital by the State.  The regulator has determined that the society will need an injection of &euro;875 million to meet the target sufficient to ensure 8% core tier 1 capital.  Again, this will be done through the issuing of &euro;100 million in special investment shares in EBS.  The State will consequently control EBS.  The State has committed to providing the remaining capital required by EBS by way of a promissory note which will spread over time the cost to the Exchequer if the society cannot access the requisite private capital.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that recapitalisation requires substantial investment by the State in the banks, although payments will be structured in a way that eases the burden on the taxpayer.  These actions are being taken for a good reason, namely, that the banking system may return to its rightful role as provider of credit to the real economy.  No other course of action would result in a swift return by the banking sector to its function as a provider of finance.  By forcing the banks to recognise their losses upfront, the Government can rid the system of these speculative loans and end the mismanagement of the banking system.</P><Col N="954"/>
        <P>The suggestion remains that the nationalisation option would have been less costly.  The argument seems to be that if only the Government had nationalised AIB and Bank of Ireland, it would have eliminated the valuation risk pertaining to NAMA and as a result there would have been no need for the concept of long-term economic value.  As the Minister announced last night, had the Government opted to do this, the losses crystallised at the two main banks still would have had to be fully recognised and real capital still would have been required.  As the full owner of these institutions, the State would have been obliged to cover the totality of this enlarged capital requirement with no prospect of new private sector funds contributing.  All in all, there is strength in the view that the option chosen by the Government is the least costly to the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>The detailed Central Bank legislation outlined in the D&aacute;il yesterday ensures greater protection for our economy from the irresponsible actions of financial institutions in recent times.  A combined regulator and Central Bank will ensure enhanced scrutiny of our banks.  It will have stronger powers and will be in a position to exercise them more frequently and more stringently.  The Central Bank will itself be subject to increased Oireachtas scrutiny and we must never again be in a position where the banks treat the taxpayer with disdain.  The new Governor of the Central Bank and the new head of the Financial Regulator are committed to this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Being in this House, I cannot help but remember the debates on the Financial Regulator six or seven years ago, as do, I am sure, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senators Norris and MacSharry.  The tendency in the argument was to try to push the Central Bank and the regulator as far apart as possible.  The drawbacks of this argument are now evident, as is the importance of their working together.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is no question but that there are large costs to resolving Ireland&rsquo;s banking crisis.  Nevertheless, there are also significant benefits for the State and its taxpayers from these initiatives.  As the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have explained, the economy should grow faster because the Government has set the banking system on the correct path again, it is likely that NAMA will deliver a net gain for the taxpayer, particularly as the agency has pursued such a robust valuation process, the NPRF will have a valuable shareholding in the two main banks that have the potential to realise gains, the taxpayer has a proven gain of &euro;1 billion, which will accrue in six months time from the bank guarantee schemes, and reinventing Anglo Irish Bank as a much reduced but sound credit institution that can be sold to private investors at a later date will go some way towards recouping the taxpayers&rsquo; assistance to it.</P>
        <P>Ireland now enjoys the confidence of the international markets because of the determined and successful steps the Government has taken to place our public finances on a more sustainable footing.  It is clear that facing up to the problems presented by the severe downturn in our fiscal position has paid off.  The actions announced yesterday will have the same effect on our financial sector by compelling the banks to face up to their difficulties.</P>
        <P>With reference to past debates on social partnership, I am glad that an agreement has been reached.  It is subject to ratification by the social partners, but I hope it will bring the current action to an end and help to underpin stability and confidence in the new course that we have been required to adopt.</P>
        <P>The banks have been forced to recognise their losses and the Government, on behalf of the taxpayer, has committed the capital that will ensure we have a banking system to serve this economy as it recovers.  The certainty provided will further boost international confidence in this nation, its people and its economy.  It will, therefore, smooth Ireland&rsquo;s path to economic recovery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is strange that, in the course of this debate, the Government has accepted no blame for putting our country in this position.  The people know what happened to the economy, that poor regulation, free-wheeling bankers and a few Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers brought us to this point.  Given the Cabinet sub-committee on the economy, Ministers carrying on as if this situation has nothing to do with them are disrespectful of the people paying for it.</P>
        <P>The people will not forget how this situation came about.  It does not matter how many silver-tongued Ministers and their apologists try to mislead them.  Some of last night&rsquo;s contributions by Ministers in the Lower House showed a disregard for their role in bringing this country to its knees.  I assure those Ministers that, when the opportunity presents itself, people will make them pay for shattering their dreams and destroying their children&rsquo;s bright futures.  The people know what needs to be done, but they do not like it.</P>
        <P>An atomic bomb was dropped on the economy during Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s tenure as Minister for Finance.  That situation has continued during his tenure as Taoiseach.  Those who claim we will come out of this in a few years know they are speaking rubbish.  Populists with devastating financial policies will ruin the country for at least a decade.  We only need to consider the Great Depression.  It took the United States 20 years to come out of that.  What Ireland is facing is much greater than anything we have faced in the years gone by.  The sums are massive.  Beyond the billions of euro to be given to Anglo Irish Bank and other institutions, we are borrowing &euro;20 billion per year to pay for public services.</P>
        <P>We are in an unbelievable economic crisis the type of which Ireland has never seen previously.  The Government needs to acknowledge this fact.  The vainglorious carry on of Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Ministers would sicken one.  I would have expected a bit more from the Green Party, as it was not involved when we were led into this crisis.  However, its party conference last weekend saw no acknowledgement of a problem or the need to do something about it.  All it could do was celebrate getting an extra junior Ministry.  The Green Party Ministers&rsquo; view of politics has become so simplistic that it is time to get rid of them.</P>
        <P>I am annoyed by Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers who, in trying to justifying what they have done, trip over themselves to tell us that Europe, international bankers and the IMF are supportive of their management of the economy.  They are accountable to the people and they should acknowledge what they have done to the country.  The Minister of State should remind his party colleagues that mocking the people in ministerial contributions on the crisis is foolish.</P>
        <P>The economy is shrinking.  Our GNP is shrinking dramatically while our national debt is increasing.  The scale of the bailout is significant.  The Government will put more than &euro;8 billion into Anglo Irish Bank during the coming weeks.  That is the amount we will spend on educating every person in the primary, secondary and university levels this year.  At least we will get a return on their education, but we will get none from the &euro;8.3 billion to be poured into a financial black hole.  The money will be gone, <i>finito</i>.  The &euro;16 billion in loans to be transferred to NAMA is equivalent to the amount the HSE will spend this year on providing a health service for every man, woman and child who requires health care.  Of the &euro;16 billion to be transferred to NAMA, &euro;7.5 billion has already been written off.  The value of the remaining &euro;8.5 billion in loans is questionable.</P>
        <P>To try to get the general public to understand these massive figures, we should consider the figure of &euro;75 billion.  The Government will only spend approximately &euro;59 billion this year.  We should try to put the amounts involved in NAMA into context.  The household mortgages of the ordinary men and women on the street, including the Minister of State and myself, are valued at approximately &euro;120 billion.  The cost of the NAMA project will probably be approximately &euro;80 billion.  It is like telling people that, for every &euro;10,000 of their mortgages, the State will borrow &euro;6,000 to pay for the reckless behaviour of a few bankers, sleeper regulators, a <Col N="956"/>hubristic Minister for Finance and the then Taoiseach.  The then Taoiseach should have made a statement in the Lower House last night instead of avoiding facing up to his responsibility for destroying this country.</P>
        <P>People understand that they will be paying off debts in the years to come because of what occurred.  We are not discussing free money.  This is a debt on the people.  Paying off that interest will lead to cuts in social welfare and further cuts in health and education.  It is amazing to listen to the Minister for Finance being so strong in his defence of subordinate bond holders.  These are international risk-taking investors.  I do not see the same concern for shareholders in Irish banks.  The majority of Irish bank shareholders are conservative, low risk-taking individuals.  Many are elderly people who are financing a pension with share dividends.  They have been completely ruined, wiped out and destroyed.  Nevertheless, the Minister&rsquo;s concern remains with subordinate bond holders.  The international gamblers on the banking scene are still the Minister&rsquo;s number one concern.</P>
        <P>Why has the Minister not cleaned out the boards of the banks for which we are now responsible?  This is maddening the people.  We are bailing out Anglo Irish Bank to the tune of tens of millions of euro, but we are also bailing out Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  We deserve to see something done about this.  Why has the Government not demanded a wholesale clean-out of the boards of these two banks?  Do not tell me we need the expertise of all of these individuals.  Some of them clearly did nothing while they were being paid massive sums of shareholders&rsquo; money to sit on these boards.  We must not let them do the same thing with taxpayers&rsquo; money and be rewarded for doing nothing.  The Minister needs to wake up, show some mettle and get rid of the boards of these two banks.  His lack of resolve is an indication of his guilt regarding his Government&rsquo;s massive role in this crisis.  This is the only explanation for his lack of resolve in cleaning out these boards.  He needs to do it.  Over time, history will tell us what exactly happened and how the Government was misled.  They must feel very foolish.  They should examine at their every policy in this area.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister being truthful about the valuations he has presented so far?  He says the haircut will be approximately 43% across all financial institutions.  I have been thinking about this matter.  Very few homes have lost more than 50% of their value while the value of development land and half-built commercial enterprises has collapsed by between 70% and 80%.  Most of the valuations being done for NAMA are of development land and of half-developed housing estates and commercial enterprises.  The haircut figure seems very low for the type of property being transferred to NAMA.  We are given the impression that the NAMA properties will receive the same level of haircut as every home in the country.  Domestic houses have dropped in value by approximately 40% but the assets being transferred into NAMA have lost considerably more in value.  I believe these figures are wrong.  We need more clarity about this.  It is not long since banks were telling us they were well capitalised, doing well and not exposed. We have been made fools of for a number of months.</P>
        <P>I have many questions for the Minister of State and I fear we will have to return to this topic at a later date.  The discussion on NAMA should be a longer-term one.  What has been reported in the media in the past 24 hours is not the full picture.  I believe the banks are hiding much information.  Valuations are not accurate and the amount of money required for this enterprise is much bigger than we have been told.  The taxpayer is not getting the full story.  This is a black day for the people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>The events of recent years have been horrific.  That was the word used by the Minister for Finance yesterday to describe the figures relating to the banking crisis, <Col N="957"/>the amounts of capital required and the loans which need to be transferred to the National Asset Management Agency.  There is no question about that.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey referred to the Government&rsquo;s responsibility in this regard.  It would be disingenuous of anyone to say, retrospectively, that this was seen coming.  While there were bears in the market and individuals who predicted that the events of recent years were likely to happen, no one predicted the scale of what happened.  Besides, a stopped clock is right twice a day.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris often quotes Professor Brian Lucey, the respected economist and associate professor of Trinity College, on the NAMA project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Sometimes, and some of his views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Certainly.  Professor Philip Lane, professor of international macroeconomics, has a different view.  I respect the fact that there is difference on this issue and that it is the function of the Opposition to oppose.  One of the nation&rsquo;s strengths, which is acknowledged in international commentary, is the public debate on this issue as we have taken the appropriate actions in recent years.  How can Senator Twomey claim we were fuelling the boom irresponsibly at a time when Fine Gael was advocating a reduction in stamp duty and increases in expenditure and salaries and all of that kind of thing?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With the benefit of hindsight, I regret that a national and international regulatory regime allowed us, nationally and internationally, to get into the horrifically difficult position in which we find ourselves.  All of the people are justifiably angry, not least at the pay-cuts which have been suffered by many families working in the public sector and at the unpalatable nature of the support we have had to give to our banks, because of their systemic relationship to the health of our economy and our people.  I am angry at that too.  I would like my pound of flesh and to see those who are guilty held to account.  I have no doubt that due process will provide us with that pound of flesh.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Government have announced a number of inquiries.  One will be conducted by Mr. Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank.  One will be conducted by international experts who will help to scope out the terms of reference of the statutory commission of inquiry which will assess the performance of everyone &mdash; in politics, Government, business, banks and elsewhere &mdash; during the crisis and in the run-in to it.  This will ensure we have the accurate information needed to prevent this kind of situation happening again.</P>
        <P>I would like to see more international co-operation in terms of regulatory change to prevent this kind of thing happening in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not seen that to the extent I would like.  I found it worrying to hear the British Prime Minister suggest at a recent G8 meeting that a fund should be put together to cover losses of this nature when they occur again in the future.  We should be providing to ensure these things cannot happen in the future.  I know international cross-border regulations are difficult and I do not know under what auspices one could regulate matters.  Perhaps it could be done by the United Nations or the World Bank.  However, we should focus on that in a major way.</P>
        <P>Since the crisis has occurred the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has acted decisively but has taken the necessary time to ensure the steps taken were the correct ones.  The bank guaran<Col N="958"/>tee scheme was introduced initially, followed by the establishment of NAMA and yesterday the initial transfer of bad loans to NAMA was made following a long period of due diligence, which I, as a valuer in my previous career, believe was extremely prudent.  I am pleased about the extent of the write-down at the level of around 40% on average.</P>
        <P>I am confident that NAMA will be profitable in the long term.  However, in the context of the support of Anglo Irish Bank, it was not possible to effect the kind of wind-down immediately that some people would have wanted or in the way that Fine Gael would have liked in the short term.  One cannot contemplate what would amount to sovereign default, not on the subordinated debt which amounts to &euro;2 billion in Anglo Irish Bank and which the Minister said post-September they will examine under advice, but in terms of senior debt.  One can negotiate and speak with bondholders but one cannot default.  That would have cataclysmic implications for our integrity as a sovereign nation.  Deputy Bruton in the other House often refers to the Washington Mutual situation where senior debtholders were allowed to go to the wall but that was a completely different situation because its umbrella company issued the bonds.  In Ireland it is the banks who issued the bonds and therefore they have to be protected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Lehman Brothers, which was allowed to go to the wall, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, made reference, constituted 4% of the US economy and we saw the effects that had throughout the world.  The balance sheet of Anglo Irish Bank, on the other hand, constitutes half of our economy.  Therefore, to let it go at a cost of &euro;70 billion in terms of the liabilities to the State would have been catastrophic for our nation and for our integrity as a sovereign State as we move forward.</P>
        <P>People such as Senator Norris, Professor Brian Lucey and other lecturers in economics in Trinity and elsewhere have issues with NAMA and do not believe it is the way forward.  That is fine and the expression of such different views is important, as otherwise we would merely have public administration, but there is a critical mass of support nationally and internationally for the steps the Government has taken.  For example, today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Financial Times </i>states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland is no Greece.</P>
        <P LI="1">After almost two years of unrelieved misery during which Ireland had sometimes appeared, in local parlance, to have lost the run of itself, a battered and moth-eaten Celtic tiger may be picking itself up.</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . Ireland looks not only to be managing it but doing so with informed public debate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That commentary is welcome.</P>
        <P>Business groups such as IBEC and Chambers Ireland have welcomed NAMA.  The commentary in today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>The Irish Times </i>is worth mentioning.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . it is worth remembering that when NAMA was first proposed over 12 months ago, Ireland faced a predicament not unlike the one Greece finds itself in today.  The State of national finances was such that serious doubts existed about our ability to manage our way out of our problems and there was a real possibility that debt markets would be closed to us.</P>
        <P LI="1">Things have improved dramatically since then, due . . . to the Government&rsquo;s efforts to resolve our banking crisis.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While many difficult decisions have been made by the Government, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in particular, has taken the required time to be considered and thoughtful in the <Col N="959"/>approach that has been taken to ensure our taxpayers and citizens are protected to the fullest extent possible.  There will be a cost for that protection but we hope to minimise that by ensuring Anglo Irish Bank operates under new management and with a new business plan to provide that some of the investment that is being put into it can be recouped by the taxpayer.  On the other hand, in terms of the performance of NAMA, the other banks and the substantial holdings that the National Pensions Reserve Fund now has in those banks, I believe a profit will be made for the country.  That has been borne out already in terms of the &euro;1 billion that has been provided as a result of the guarantee that was given to the banks.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate there is a need for opposition, informed debate and different opinions as we seek to ensure we find the correct solutions to our problems, as we look to the future it is our responsibility to be confident with the template that now exists.  We have stabilised our financial position and banking system and the bonds that will be given to the banks, through the operations of NAMA, will provide liquidity &mdash; which was missing for the past 18 months &mdash; which will allow banks to lend to viable businesses and families who are much in need of credit.  I used the word &ldquo;viable&rdquo; because under no circumstances should the kind of reckless irresponsible lending that took place here ever be tolerated again.</P>
        <P>I welcome the moves by the regulator to shore up the capital positions of the banks &mdash; to insist on an 8% core tier 1 capital position.  In terms of credit availability, I also welcome the directions from the Minister , Deputy Brian Lenihan, on the amounts of money to be lent to SMEs to support industry.</P>
        <P>As we look to the future, we must be vigilant and ensure the correct oversight of NAMA and our banking and regulatory position, but we must be confident, having taken so many difficult decisions during the past 18 months, that we are on the right road to recovery.  That has been borne out by national and international commentators.  It is time in these Houses that we looked to the future with similar confidence.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  Senator MacSharry referred to the words of the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in the other House and I would like to do the same.  The Minister said that &ldquo;At every hand&rsquo;s turn our worst fears have been surpassed&rdquo;.  That is a very stark statement.  He went on to say &ldquo;Some institutions were worse than others, but the fact is that our banking system to a greater or lesser extent engaged in reckless property development lending&rdquo;.  How true is that.  A Member on this side of the House referred to a few bankers.  It was not a few bankers who were responsible but the entire financial elite and not only in this country.  This was a global infection.  Although we are tinkering with the system, and with NAMA we are basically still only tinkering with it. It is tragic that we are not addressing the system completely.  We are not addressing it radically or fundamentally.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry spoke about international regulation, of which I am all in favour.  There is another aspect I have raised repeatedly but I have not been listened to and that is partly due to the intellectual laziness of the media who will not take up challenging ideas no matter how often they are made in this House.  Among the elements that I regard as criminally responsible is not only the regulatory system but the ratings system.  How often have I had to say why does nobody challenge Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, Fitch or Moody&rsquo;s, the people who validated the toxic bundles, the mortgages in the United States, that proved to be fatal to the entire system and that brought down the banking system there?  They were allowed to continue and to rate Iceland as a triple star country a week before it collapsed and we are still allowing them to rate us.  Why does somebody not address that?  Why do they not establish an international, <Col N="960"/>properly remunerated system of rating, independent of its reliance on corrupt profit from the people they are validating?</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan well in every sense, both in his personal health and in the financial medicine he is dosing out to this country.  He is a man of courage and integrity.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The doubters had been provided wrong.  NAMA has carried out its valuations in a hard-headed commercial manner.</P>
        <P>It applied the valuations that certain Members of this House said it needed to apply.  We were right and the record will show that.</P>
        <P>However, I still believe it would have been possible to wind up Anglo Irish Bank.  The Minister referred to the costs involved.  The costs involved, as I understand them, would not have been in any sense substantially greater than the costs in which we are already involved and we would have had a greater yield and greater profit.  One of the people who has advised me on this is not Professor Brian Lucey but Mr. Peter Matthews.  He has been right time and again and every figure from him that I gave has been vindicated.  This is a moment when we need to unite and avail of wisdom from wherever we can avail of it.  I, therefore, appeal to the Minister, as I did to the Leader on the Order of Business today, to facilitate a meeting between Mr. Matthews and certain people leading our financial institutions.  I very much welcome the fact that, imaginatively or perhaps in a Machiavellian sense, the Government installed as chairman of Anglo Irish Bank Mr. Alan Dukes who has a very clear financial record.  A series of meetings should be facilitated between Mr. Matthews and the people mentioned.  The Minister referred to our problems.  I reject what he said.  The problems we face are not of our creation.  Again, they are due to this small elite.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad the Minister spoke about setting specific lending targets for AIB and Bank of Ireland and targeted lending of a sum of not less than &euro;3 billion to industry.  That is what I would concentrate on.  I know it is wonderful that there are good articles in the <i>Financial Times </i>about the Celtic tiger licking its wounded paws and so on and that confidence is important.  We are always being preached to about market values but they do not seem to apply to the big boys.  It is like that ghastly woman in America who said only the little people paid tax.  Apparently, market values do not apply to the big boys.  We must concentrate on the ordinary people who are a hell of a lot more important than the subordinated bondholders or senior creditors in the banks.  I applaud this aspect which I hope is true.</P>
        <P>As I said at the beginning, AIB will be nationalised.  I suggested a national property management agency in January 2009, three months before the Government came up with NAMA.  I said we needed a radical solution to take a clear, surgical approach and merge and nationalise the banks and operate them in the interests of the people.  I still believe this and know it is radical.  People speak about our reputation internationally but what reputation do we have?  We have none.  Therefore, we must look after the people.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned yesterday, I am very interested in the way Bank of Ireland has been operating.  It magically reduced its exposure from a sum of &euro;16 billion to &euro;12 billion.  One must wonder why.  I am certain it was to avoid nationalisation and a majority takeover.  I do not believe it is honest and that it will be able to avoid it.  It has told us it will be able to raise money in the international markets but let us wait and see.  It told us this before but each time it lied.  Why should we believe it is correct now, although perhaps it is?  I am not that impressed by the fire brigade measures required of some of the banks, or that they are implementing themselves, including selling off profitable investments abroad.  That gives one a boost or a <Col N="961"/>once-off cash injection but then it is dead.  Perhaps I am thick but would it not be a little more sensible to hold onto them, milk and maximise them in order that they would continue to yield profits?  The reason the banks are doing this is that they want to avoid nationalisation.</P>
        <P>I will support the Government in anything sensible it does.  The record of the House will show that this morning I held myself aside from carping political comment because the situation was too serious.  It is worse than in 1929.  One of the real problems will emerge when the situation begins to spiral.  If the entire mortgage market collapses and people are unable to repay their mortgages, that will kill off another source of income for the banks.</P>
        <P>We must very careful and prudent and support the Government but I lend my greatest support to investment in productive industry, in which matter Seanad &Eacute;ireann has played a role.  We dealt with the Energy (Biofuel Obligations and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill a week or two ago and have potentially helped to create 1,000 jobs in Waterford.  While we can do this, we need to be clear, rational and sensible and face up to the liars and crooks in the banking system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing time.  I welcome the Minister of State and his words.  I also welcome the banking supplementary documentation booklet we received, in particular section 7 which contains frequently asked questions, which is very useful.  I am glad we are having this debate today but I would like to ensure it is a debate which will help us to arrive at conclusions.  Let us not only talk about the past and who is to blame.  Let us look for alternatives to the proposed solutions if they are not the right ones.</P>
        <P>What do we know today that we did not know yesterday?  There is some good news.  We know less money is needed for AIB and the Bank of Ireland on condition that they sell assets.  The bad news is that we need another &euro;10 billion for Anglo Irish Bank.  I was embarrassed to read in one of yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers that I was a shareholder in Anglo Irish Bank, a matter to which I referred on the Order of Business today.  I have never been a shareholder in Anglo Irish Bank.  I am a shareholder in a fund which had an address at Anglo Irish Bank.  I say this to ensure no one will believe I am speaking out of place.</P>
        <P>There was good news yesterday.  There is now clarity about what NAMA will pay for the loans and the capital requirements of the banks but questions remain.  The real question is whether the cost of bailing out the banks will be lower than the cost of letting them go to the wall.  The answer is not clear because we are not sure how much it will cost.  There is talk of a figure of &euro;31 billion in fresh capital and perhaps extra debt of &euro;40 billion.   There is not an easy answer, although there is an alternative in that we know what would happen if the banks were to fail.  The credit worthiness of the nation would be severely damaged.  In this regard, we need only look at the situation in Iceland and Greece.  This time last year we were at the same level.  We are not now included but there is no guarantee that this solution will solve the problem.  However, the Government has taken action.</P>
        <P>We will need to keep a close eye on the matter, as we know what happened in the past.  I always worry about over-regulation because it stifles the economy but there is little doubt that regulation is needed.  If we are to solve the problem and look to the future, we must ensure we have something in that regard.  The target set by the Financial Regulator of a reserve of 7% for every &euro;100 lent is tough.</P>
        <P>The main aim, as stated, is to provide capital for small and medium-sized enterprises.  We have allocated sums but we cannot click our fingers and instruct the banks to do something.  If I was a banker, I doubt I would give money to people looking to borrow unless they had a proposition that could pay its way.  I am not sure it is easy for a state to instruct a bank to do something.</P><Col N="962"/>
        <P>Should the State-owned Anglo Irish Bank be kept?  The State has put &euro;22 billion into it but keeping it could cost a further &euro;30 billion in the next ten years.  The banks need so much capital because NAMA is valuing loans at a figure of closer to 50% rather than 30% as was the case last September.  That is both safe and worthy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A strong message must be sent to international financial institutions, investors and those about whom we are concerned.  I also read the <i>Financial Times</i> which contained three articles, one of which was critical, while the other two would give one a great deal of confidence.  In one article it was stated that, with the public finances stabilised, the Minister had already made the harsh political choices to rein in the budget deficit, in the process setting the standard for the eurozone&rsquo;s ailing economies.  That is good news and for it to appear in the <i>Financial Times</i> is acceptable.</P>
        <P>Another article welcomed the new Financial Regulator and stated he was untainted by his predecessor&rsquo;s cosy relationships with the banks.  These are very strong words.  It also stated the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s plan of action showed determination to repair the damage inflicted by previous sloppy management and regulation.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about how we are going to achieve the aims outlined.  We will need to keep a close watch and maintain close scrutiny.  However, I am very confident that the Financial Regulator will be strong in this regard.  I am a gardener and spend a little time growing vegetables.  I could never grow celery until I read somewhere that celery seeds should be planted in ground prepared two years previously.  While I am still not good at growing celery, I have learned that one must plan, watch and wait.  In the context of the banking system, we must be patient and alert and scrutinise matters to ensure the same mistakes are not repeated.</P>
        <P>While I have always been concerned that excessive regulation poses a danger of stifling the economy, enterprise, enthusiasm and business ideas, in the case of banking, we took our eye of the ball.  Let us ensure we do not do so again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn has correctly noted that we must look forward as we attempt to deal with the banking crisis.  We should also note examples of how other countries addressed similar crises.  For the past 18 months we have been trying to develop a coherent response to probably the most difficult circumstances any Government has had to face in financial services.  While the period required for a response has been the subject of political criticism, it has been well spent by the relevant arms of the State.  For instance, two new officeholders, the recently appointed Financial Regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank, ensured the financial institutions were examined in detail and this scrutiny allowed the Government to make the decisions announced yesterday.</P>
        <P>While the Swedish response to the crisis in its banking system has been cited frequently, there was a seven month gap between the advent of the crisis and the government adopting a solution to it.  In the United States the response to the crisis was quicker but much of the $700 billion package for the banking system announced by the chairman of the Federal Reserve was unconditional, an issue that has been the subject of much justifiable political criticism.  Our neighbouring jurisdiction took a bank by bank approach in fully nationalising Northern Rock and taking a 70% shareholding in Royal Bank of Scotland.  However, even that approach has been subject to political criticism.</P>
        <P>The series of measures announced yesterday is correct and vindicates many of the earlier decisions made by the Government.  It is unfortunate that much of the debate has focused on the concept of establishing an asset management agency, in our case, the National Asset Management Agency.  An asset management agency would have formed part of any decision <Col N="963"/>by any Government to address the problems in the banking sector.  The alternative proposals submitted by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party both featured asset management vehicles.  In the case of the latter, the proposal was to establish an asset recovery trust.</P>
        <P>In addressing a crisis in financial services one must first ensure clean balance sheets can be achieved to assist future reinvestment.  This is the reason for the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  If yesterday&rsquo;s decision shows anything, it is that the correct decisions were made on the valuation of bad loans.  An average haircut of 47% indicates that NAMA is doing its job well.  I am confident that it will continue to do a good job and will not incur costs for the taxpayer during its lifetime.  I am also confident that as a result of the support we give to our larger financial institutions, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, to allow them to become more buoyant and re-lend in the economy &mdash; the whole point of the exercise &mdash; we will recoup to the taxpayer any investment made.</P>
        <P>The point of contention is the approach taken to Anglo Irish Bank.  No one is happy about the circumstances surrounding the bank which has shown itself to be an odious institution.  Having arrived at a point where we must deal with the mess created by its policies, no one can be pleased with how the institution worked.  The choice available to the Government is whether to walk away from the problem immediately or manage it over a long period.  The correct choice has been made.</P>
        <P>Some have advocated walking away from an institution the balance sheet of which at the peak, as Senator MacSharry noted, was half the value of the economy in a given year.  In contrast, the value of Lehman Brothers, a bank which collapsed in the United States, amounted to only 4% of the value of the United States economy.  Allowing Anglo Irish Bank to fail would have had a cataclysmic effect on the economy and cost many billions of euro in up-front capital to pay off depositors, not only under the guarantee scheme introduced in September 2008 to provide the confidence required in the financial system but also under the terms of the deposit guarantee scheme which pre-dated September 2008.  If we had paid every depositor in September 2008, we would have paid much more than what is required under the current proposals.  Paying up front would have required the Government to borrow and pay interest on the borrowings.  Its approach is to manage our way out of the situation.</P>
        <P>Anglo Irish Bank will become a much different bank under the proposals.  Its board of management has changed, as has its focus.  It will become a smaller bank with a different focus once its remaining assets have been separated as part of a good bank-bad bank approach.  This policy is welcome, as it will result in significant resources being returned to the Exchequer.  If we were to adopt a fire sale approach to Anglo Irish Bank of trying to cover existing depositors and selling assets, we would be dependent on the vagaries of the market at the time of sale and would still have to repay the large borrowings required to rescue the bank.  This approach is neither logical nor worthy of consideration.</P>
        <P>The other aspect of the Government&rsquo;s approach to managing Anglo Irish Bank is that the process will be completed over a period.  A promissory note will issue and while the money will be guaranteed, it will be invested in instalments of 10% over a ten-year period.  This approach is preferable to borrowing the entire sum up front to address the problem immediately.  We must take a carefully managed approach because we also need to address other funding and expenditure problems.</P>
        <P>Political debate has been diminished by the decision of many of those who oppose the Government&rsquo;s approach not to accept the bona fides of individuals who have been brought into the process.  These individuals have performed commendably since being appointed.  I have in mind the newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, who has an academic background and did not take the traditional route to his position at the helm <Col N="964"/>of the Central Bank.  His appointment signalled that the Government wanted to take a different approach to addressing this issue.  In addition, the Government appointed a new Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, who, in stress testing the banks to ensure they are fully capitalised institutions capable of lending in the future, has shown himself to be the regulator we did not have in recent years.  His appointment also gives great confidence.</P>
        <P>Another element of the Government&rsquo;s package, one on which there has been little comment, is that it will result in banks lending again.  This is the most important issue in terms of public confidence.  Senator Quinn referred to the difficulties which would arise from interference in State-owned institutions, for example, in directing them to make individual loans.  While such interference will not take place, the Government, through various statutory instruments, may stipulate the types of lending in which the various financial institutions should engage and the various sectors to which it should lend, including in percentage terms.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the appointment of Mr. John Trethowan, whom I met in the context of the excellent work he did on behalf of Danske Bank in rescuing National Irish Bank after its crisis.  We need to have confidence in the ability of such people, their willingness to do the job and their experience of having tackled similar situations.  Members of the Opposition might want to make this issue a political contest, but it is too important to reduce to normal points scoring.  It is a question of the economic well-being of this country and of those who will be part of it in the years to come.  Those who engage in name calling and points scoring about the approach being taken are ill serving politics.  It is fair to talk about the policies that may have brought us to the point.  The policies that inform the decisions being made now have been agreed on with the utmost sincerity.  We believe they are needed to restore our financial services sector and to give our economy a basis for the future.  Such decisions may be unpopular and unpalatable, but they are right.  If I did not believe that, I would not be standing here, my party would not be in government and the Government would not be proposing this package of measures.  The adoption of this policy, which has been informed by our participation, our proposals and our agreement, is necessary and right.  I hope that will be accepted by others as they see notice that we are overcoming the initial hurdles brought about by this crisis.  If they form an alternative Government in the next few years, they will have to adopt this policy in exactly the same way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Since the Minister for Finance gave an update in the D&aacute;il yesterday on the cost of the banking and building bailout, some 100 babies have been born with a debt of &euro;9,000 hanging around each of their necks.  That is the start in life this Fianna F&aacute;il Government has given them and the 1.5 million more babies who will be born in this country over the next 20 years.  These children will grow up deprived of the best possible health treatment, education and standards of living.  This is already happening, as the Minister of State is aware.  Health care budgets are being slashed, we are going into reverse on class sizes, children with special needs are losing their special needs assistants, the cost of going to third level college is escalating and one in every three young people cannot get work.</P>
        <P>Charles Haughey, Liam Lawlor and Ray Burke, not to mention other Fianna F&aacute;il politicians who are less well known, fiddled this country out of millions of euro in the past.  It was a drop in the ocean compared with what this group of Fianna F&aacute;il leaders has done.  When I reflect on the appeal of the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on 14 October 2008 for us to do our patriotic duty, I find it even more repugnant now than I did then.  This Government is helping a small coterie of its business buddies to steal at least &euro;32 billion from their fellow countrymen.  Back bench Deputies and Senators are in cahoots with this great banking and building swindle.  It is the biggest robbery in the history of the State.  The biggest victims are young people.  The Government is taking money from their pockets and putting it into the wallets of builders and <Col N="965"/>bankers.  It is uncomfortable to think this will continue for years to come.  It is Robin Hood in reverse, stealing from the poorer and giving to the rich.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance announced last December that he intends to introduce a new social contribution levy in the next budget.  Will he be honest enough to introduce a bank contribution levy as well?  Young people will be paying such a levy for years to come as we attempt to come up with &euro;32 billion and probably more.  Will it buy us control over bankers&rsquo; salaries?  It is unlikely, given that we have seen pay increases in Anglo Irish Bank and NAMA in the past fortnight.  Has it given us control over bank policy on lending?  It has not, because businesses cannot get credit.  More and more small businesses are going out of business every day because they cannot get credit to keep going.  Will this approach give us control over bank policy on lending?  Will it give us control over bank policy on charges?  AIB has just increased its mortgage lending rates and the other banks are sure to follow.  Will it give us a more competitive banking system?  I do not think so, as non-Irish banks are fleeing the market and leaving the field open for the old cartel to do what it does best.  People will not have a choice.</P>
        <P>The Minister will tell us that new regulations are in place to ensure what happened before cannot happen again.  We have already seen that the regulations are protecting the markets and not the real economy.  Yesterday, we were told the banks will have to meet a core equity ratio of 8% by the end of the year.  That means the money the Government has given the banks will sit in their vaults doing nothing other than supporting their share prices.  That would not have happened had we nationalised the banks, as the Labour Party suggested in 2008.  Countless experts &mdash; far more than those who agreed with the Government&rsquo;s policy &mdash; agreed with us.  Speaking of agreement, the Government obtained the agreement of its colleagues for NAMA on the basis that the banks would pay a 30% discount, but it was way out in that regard.  It was wrong by more than 50%.</P>

	<P>It is a shame that the Government&rsquo;s supporters in the D&aacute;il failed to bear this in mind last night when they voted to support a plan that has not turned out as intended.  The Minister released the figures at 5 p.m., but by 10 p.m. they were all able to vote in support of them.  They did not take much time to think about it.  They do not seem to be very concerned about the biggest thing that has ever happened us.  As Senator Norris said, it is bigger than 1929.  Where is the hue and cry that accompanied the plan to reduce the drink driving limit?  Many Deputies reacted to that plan with horror and shock.  The belly aching that followed the recent Cabinet reshuffle told us everything we need to know about the priorities of Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers and their Green Party colleagues.  They are willing to destabilise the Government for the sake of jobs for the boys and drinks for incompetent drivers, but when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance admit to a &euro;22 billion mistake, they do not speak a word in anger.  That is what they are telling us today.  They keep saying that letting Anglo Irish Bank go to the wall would have cost &euro;70 billion, but that is because they bought it instead of letting it fail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>

	<P>To put &euro;22 billion into the bank is a mistake of epic proportions.  The bank in question was run by Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, David Drumm and Willie McAteer.  It lied to the market about its true financial position.  It was involved in the Irish Glass Bottle site fiasco.  Its directors gave themselves secret loans.  The Minister for Finance and his Government colleagues have presented themselves to the people and said &ldquo;trust us&rdquo;.  How can we do so, when we know how gullible and wrong the Government has been?  Where is the evidence to show it knows what it is doing?  Where is the evidence to suggest it is motivated by the public interest?  What advice was the Government acting on when it gave a blanket guarantee to Anglo Irish Bank?  We would like to know that.  The figures we were given in 2008 have proved wildly wrong.  The Government trusted people who were obviously not trustworthy.  It refused to take control of banks that are important to this country, while buying in entirely to those that are not.  There will be a price to pay for this.  We are paying for it already.  The people who will pay the highest price have not been born yet.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I am standing in for Senator Hanafin.  I welcome the transfer of bonds, or non-performing debt in the banks, to NAMA.  There is no doubt that what the banks have done has been shameful.  They have been in denial for over three years.  Lies were told to Oireachtas committees over the past three years.</P>
        <P>I welcome NAMA for a number of reasons.  It forced the banks to tell us the truth, which we received yesterday.  In the case of Anglo Irish Bank, it was worse than we thought.  Nevertheless, we know exactly where the bottom is now.  I welcome the plan that has been devised by the Government over the past 18 months as well as the stabilisation of the banks which has ensured we are credible on the bond market.  We also have a big financial services industry that employs many people.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is important we send out the right message and, in that respect, all we have to do is look at how the market received yesterday&rsquo;s news.  It was very positive.  Bank of Ireland shares went up 20% and AIB shares went up 7%.  Our approach was generally welcomed by the European markets, and the ECB congratulated Ireland on the way we are dealing with the current banking crisis and tackling our finances.  I welcome the news we have got from the unions over the weekend which will ensure the work done over the past three budgets to correct our finances will mean we are all working together.  This provides a great opportunity to start from here.  It would be foolish to think there will not be difficulties.  There will be difficulties we will be able to work ourselves out of them.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party Members were the first to say we should have nationalised the banks.  We now know that if the banks had been nationalised, all the debt would have been taken on.  That is what we have seen with Anglo Irish Bank.  Our approach with the other banks has been to allow a certain amount of market and Government support to ensure our banking system continues.  The Governor of the Central Bank has ensured these banks will be well capitalised and will hold 8% of their deposits on their books at all times.  That is a very sensible approach because if we have any shocks in the system afterwards, then at least the banks will be able to deal with them.</P>
        <P>Yesterday was also an important day for small businesses in that &euro;3 billion was put into AIB and Bank of Ireland and ring-fenced for enterprise and SMEs.  That sends out an important message.  We all know the majority of our workers are employed by SMEs and we know these SMEs have been starved of finance for the past few years.  It would be foolish to think that we will go back to the old ways of excessive lending to businesses that will not be able to stay in the marketplace.  The banks would be foolish to lend money to such businesses.  A more sensible approach has to be taken with finance, and the main reason the banks are keeping 8% of their deposits on their books is because we have too much personal debt.  Nobody has mentioned <Col N="967"/>credit card debt and the dependence on things like hire purchase and so on.  It is sensible to go back to having well-financed banks, and this is the plan which NAMA and the Government have put together.  It is vital we continue with that.  The international markets are telling us we are doing the right thing and that we should continue.</P>
        <P>The Opposition should not accept everything we are saying.  It is good to be critical and to tease out these things.  It is also important to have a balanced debate.  The contribution from the Labour Party was sad to say the least.  Its Members are not living in the real world.  With respect to the Senator in question, I do not believe she has any business experience in making comments of that nature.  We are here to find solutions and I believe this is a solution to our problem.  It is a very expensive solution and we should learn lessons from it.  The Government has a certain amount of responsibility, but the banks were private entities and the Financial Regulator did not do his job.  We have seen how well the new Governor of the Central Bank is doing his job in the last day or so.  Mr. Elderfield is there to assist him and he is a fine man of great ability who understands the banking system which will be more solid when he is finished.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for explaining the proposals on yesterday&rsquo;s NAMA announcement.  He did a fine job in presenting the issue.  Even though there is much bad news, there is a plan that will ensure our banking system will continue.  It will help our economy which is the most important thing.  We have to spread this out over a number of years, and that is how NAMA will make a profit at the end of the day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank him for his introduction to the debate.  I had to smile when listening to Senator Butler.  Some Members find it very difficult not to be blatantly political about the issues of the day.  I assure the Senator that he will not get that kind of contribution from me.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate.  We are in an appalling mess.  We cannot do good for our economy without a properly functioning banking system and the provision of credit to the economy.  All of this is vital and the businesses that need this credit are the lifeblood of our economy.  I welcome the specific lending targets laid down for AIB and Bank of Ireland of not less than &euro;3 billion for new and increased credit facilities to SMEs in 2010 and 2011.  In that respect, I welcome the appointment of my old friend, Mr. John Trethowan, as the credit reviewer.  I knew him as a genuinely prudential banker, which is what we need now.  He is an honest broker who, I have no doubt, will do a good job and make a good call on the risks involved for any application.  There is some puzzlement regarding AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The AIB haircut will be 43%, while the Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s will be 35%.  As was outlined yesterday, the Minister envisages we will have a minority stake in Bank of Ireland, but a majority stake in AIB.  The capital requirements are different in Bank of Ireland where &euro;2.7 billion has been estimated as the additional equity capital requirement, while in AIB it is &euro;7.4 billion.  There is a considerable difference therefore.  That said, however, AIB has more assets, particularly outside the State in America, Poland and Britain.  Bank of Ireland has some assets in Britain.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, there will be a conversion of the preference shares to equity.  I would like to hear the Minister of State comment on why there is an absolute need for that.  Why is that so?  The European Commission has not yet ruled on the plans for the individual banks, but I noted from the Minister&rsquo;s speech that an extra plan is required from AIB by the end of April.  I would like to hear more detail on that when the Minister of State responds.</P>
        <P>Timing and market sentiment are important for these institutions.  While we would all welcome the sell-on by both of those systemic banks because they have a large branch network and are so important to the economy, the timing of that is important.  Much play has been made of the fact we do not want a fire sale.  At the same time, however, the banks need to <Col N="968"/>realise these assets in order to reduce their dependence on the State.  In AIB&rsquo;s case, is it an absolute necessity that the State will have to have a majority stake?  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on the conversion of preference shares to ordinary ones in that regard.</P>
        <P>I also welcome what has been announced concerning the Central Bank.  We were notified of a Bill in that regard yesterday, which is an important step.  I never believed in the twin-pillar approach that was adopted in the past.  I am not too sure how that policy emanated at the time, but it was probably through the Progressive Democrats.  In any event, I am glad that a unified Central Bank is envisaged when we get through the three Bills that have been promised, one of which was published yesterday.</P>
        <P>An important aspect of the reforming legislation is the power to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial institutions.  That vetting procedure is important because of what has happened and the mess we are in.  There should have been a wholesale clear-out and replacement of the people &mdash; both at board and top management level &mdash; who made these reckless, appalling property-based lending decisions and who landed us in this mess.  It happened at Anglo Irish Bank, but has not yet occurred &mdash; or not completely &mdash; at the other institutions.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s view in his reply.  Given that we are putting up all this extra capital, the Minister should have a firmer and steadier hand on the tiller, with more control.</P>
        <P>The appointment of more public interest directors is a vital prerequisite if the banks are to reposition themselves properly in order to restore confidence.  Once AIB and Bank of Ireland have proceeded with the sale of assets, as they are required to do, I do not see why they cannot go to the market to raise additional capital from investors and run a rights issue.  I hope both banks will position themselves to do that.</P>
        <P>The provision of a third banking force is also important.  Perhaps the Minister of State can comment on what will be possible regarding the problems with the Irish Nationwide Building Society and the EBS, or is anything possible?  Will the Department steer through an amalgamation there?  That would be in the national interest.  Thankfully, Irish Permanent looks all right and is not involved in the recapitalisation process.</P>
        <P>Like so many other speakers, I welcome the appointment of Dr. Patrick Honohan as Governor of the Central Bank and Mr. Matthew Elderfield as the Financial Regulator.  They are sound individuals who have started very well and hopefully they will continue in that vein.  As the chairman-designate of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Alan Dukes, has shown the capacity to do a good job of steering it in the right direction.  In an orderly fashion, he will get it down to a core, slimmed-down bank, including the asset management recovery division.</P>
        <P>It is intended that further down the line, the taxpayer will recoup some of the losses, although certainly not all of them.  It seems to be a bottomless pit and we have got ourselves into an appalling situation.  Nonetheless, I am confident that with proper management and a firmer hand on the tiller, better direction can be given to the two main banks, so they can steer their way through for the betterment of our economy and everybody involved, including depositors and investors.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yesterday, I was in Intel as part of an Oireachtas committee examining energy uses.  Intel is a major employer and a big user of energy.  As our costs are going through the roof, we needed to talk to them about what they are doing and what we could be doing.  The one message we got at Intel was that their competitors are other units within the Intel community internationally.  They compete with them for investment.  Intel&rsquo;s headquarters in America reads the press in Ireland where local politicians do down this country.  People who are reputed to be future taoisigh do nothing but undermine investment here.  It really struck me because last week all the Ministers were flying the flag abroad.  We have an open door to the rest of the world to sell Ireland, yet there is so much bickering at home.  There is an element of political point-scoring, but there is a point at which matters become far too serious for this.  We must all rise above the issues and remember whom we serve, namely, as Senator Prendergast mentioned, the children not yet born.  The best thing we can do for them is not to cry over spilt milk but to make sure the best and soundest investments are made and that we maintain a positive approach in resolving our issues, rather than do the country down.</P>
        <P>It has been mentioned that the international press, including the foremost financial newspaper, the <i>Financial Times</i>, has given a good report on what the Government is doing.  It was not easy for anyone who had to vote for these measures yesterday.  Of course, they would rather be spending the money on schools and hospitals and delivering better public services generally, but we are where we are and now need to make sure we get the best deal.  We would do well to try to keep this in our focus.  The best result would be to make borrowing cheaper for Ireland, not just for the State, but also for the people who are investing in the country.  We can do this by selling a good story about Ireland.  I know it galls the Opposition to think the Government did the right thing in the last budget, but we are reaping the rewards because we can borrow more cheaply.</P>

	<P>I listened to the Taoiseach talk about this matter this morning.  The international financial system is so precarious; it is all built on confidence.  Let us consider the overnight decision taken 18 months ago to guarantee deposits.  Had we not done that, the banks would have gone down.  It is easy, with the benefit of hindsight, to say Anglo Irish Bank is not of systemic importance.  Once one bank went over the cliff, the others would not have been far behind.  They were all tied together.  We can all be wise after the event and theorise about what may or may not have happened.  However, the one thing that is for sure is that the Government had no option but to do what it did.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party takes pride in the fact that it voted against the Government&rsquo;s decision.  I genuinely believe a failure to act would have led to the collapse of the economy, which is not something we can countenance.  Similarly, the Government had to make the decision it made yesterday.  One could hear in the voice of the Minister for Finance his disgust at what needed to be done, but it does need to be done.  The best thing we can do is to remember that this is our country; it belongs to all of us.  The Government members may be the ones who are making the decisions now, but the time will come when the Opposition will be in charge and its members will need to think about what they have said and done.  It is time we adopted a responsible attitude to the future of the country.  We are where we are and must pull together, rise above politics and bear in mind the generations to come in making the repayment of these loans as easy and swift as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it &uacute;r agus d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis as na c&uacute;raim&iacute; nua at&aacute; aige.  </P>
        <P>This is an important debate.  When I speak after Senator O&rsquo;Malley, my script usually goes out the window because she gives me so much food for thought and says so much with which I disagree that I must respond to some of her points.  I have always said that what we say in the House is based on our ideological positions &mdash; what we believe is fair and right &mdash; and no one here, whether in Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in or the Labour Party, sets out to hurt the people or the community, but the reality is that one&rsquo;s decisions and priorities do hurt people.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley has said we need to do the best for the country, but it is clear that from the Government&rsquo;s point of view what is best for the country is best for the banking sector, as it wants to get that sector up and running again.  I take a different view.  If we are to stand by the country, as the previous speaker said, we must stand by its citizens, those who are sending text messages to radio shows today to say they support the sentiments expressed in the over-exaggerated headline in the <i>Irish Daily Star</i> because they feel it reflects their mood.  The disgust with the banking sector, developers and the approach of the Government can be clearly seen in the lack of support in the last few months for its plans for economic recovery.</P>
        <P>The Government has not, as the previous speaker said, acted swiftly.  My oldest son is not even in primary school; he will enter later this year.  However, when he is sitting the leaving <Col N="971"/>certificate, he will still be paying back the loans announced last night in the D&aacute;il.  That is not swift action; it is pain that is being inflicted on the people which will recur.  It is wrong that this has happened in the first place and that we are in this position.  It is wrong that the Government prioritises the banking sector over its citizens and that we intend to penalise future generations for the sins of the few.</P>
        <P>We hear from the Government that the decisions taken yesterday mean we can borrow at the same rate.  However, it does not talk about the fact that we have doubled the national debt or that we will borrow &euro;2 billion every year to sort out the mess.  It also fails to mention that if we are really serious about sorting out the economy and getting it back on track, the only way of doing so is not to make decisions that ensure we can borrow at the current rate but to work towards a situation in which we will not need to borrow any more.  The only way to do this is to create employment.</P>
        <P>Over a ten to 15-year period we are talking about an injection of &euro;22 billion to &euro;32 billion and a &euro;50 billion transfer to the NAMA operation.  Let us consider what we could actually do with a sum of &euro;22 billion.  We could create a jobs stimulus package, as we in Sinn F&eacute;in have done and as every party in opposition should be doing.  We should be providing solutions and trying to convince the Government that they are sensible solutions that could be adopted.  We have shown through our jobs stimulus package that we could create jobs, not only for the young unemployed but for all sections of society.  If we were to have a &euro;22 billion jobs stimulus package in the economy, although we are not arguing for this but for a smaller stimulus package, how many of the 450,000 who are unemployed would go back to work?  How much would that save in reduced Government borrowings in the future?</P>
        <P>We all know that social welfare payments for those lucky enough to be over 25 years cost the State around &euro;10,000 per person.  If a person is in employment, the State benefits by around &euro;12,000 in direct taxation.  Thus, for every person we can remove from the live register, there is a saving for the Government of more than &euro;20,000.  That is the only way we can deal with the deficit.  That is where we should be focusing our resources and investing for the next ten years.  That is where we should invest the &euro;2 billion the Government has decided to invest in failed financial institutions to rescue a number of investors who gambled on the practices of the banks.  It has decided that over the next ten years we will put &euro;2 billion aside to sort out that bad gamble.  What we should be doing is putting &euro;2 billion aside in a job stimulus package to get people back to work.</P>
        <P>I met a Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, in my home parish in Gaoth Dobhair recently at a meeting with young people who for the past two years have been seeking a youth worker for their area where there are more than 1,000 young people under the age of 25.  The project there closed because of a lack of funding.  A youth worker is required and co-funding exists for that.  The sum required for this year is &euro;27,000.  The Minister of State said a decision would be made by the HSE later this month.  While I hope that will be a positive decision, the Minister of State said he could not guarantee funding because there is no extra money.  I hung about after the meeting and spoke to some of the young people.  They do not understand what is happening in the economy or what happened yesterday, but they understand that a significant amount is being put into the banks.  We are talking about the Monopoly figures of billions of euro mentioned last night &mdash; &euro;20 billion here and &euro;10 billion there &mdash; and about the young people in Gaoth Dobhair who want a safe space.  One of the young people, a 17 year old, said to one of the volunteer workers: &ldquo;I am tired of drinking.  It is getting me into trouble.  I just wish the project was back up and running because it gives me a safe space.&rdquo;  We must put money into this and similar projects.  We must find the &euro;27,000 that will benefit the real citizens and people of the country rather than the FitzPatricks or the Fingletons or those on the board of NAMA who got increases in pay or Anglo Irish Bank staff who got increases.  We must try <Col N="972"/>to bring benefits to ordinary young people, people who have to attend schools in prefabs and people whose mothers, grandmothers and grandfathers are lying on trolleys.  These are the people we need to help.</P>
        <P>On the day of the first budget that took place after I became a Senator, when the Minister was in the House making his proposals, I walked across the road where I saw two people who were sleeping in a doorway on Grafton Street being moved by the Garda.  These are the people we need to bail out.  It is sickening that the Government has taken a similar approach to the one taken by the Garda on that occasion.  There are other options.  The mantra that we are where we are is unacceptable.  We are where we are because the Government has taken decisions to prioritise one area over another.  I believe the country is better than where we are now.  I do not believe in the attitude of burying our heads in the sand or of telling a good story as the previous speaker suggested.  I had the opportunity yesterday to sit down with an international investor, a person involved in a group that intends to invest approximately &euro;1 billion in the north west.  International investors do not want to be spun a line.  They want the hard facts and want to see decisive action.  That is what is missing at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, to the House and congratulate him on his new appointment and the instant success he had in the early hours of the morning the other night with the deal with the social partners.  Never was social partnership more needed than at present.  We could do with some social partnership when it comes to dealing with the banks.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  The collapse of Anglo Irish Bank is the worst and most expensive financial scandal ever to occur in Ireland.  The dimensions of the disaster and the gravity of its consequences have no parallel in the history of the State.  Not alone did hundreds of small, honest shareholders and investors lose their savings, the people must pay for generations to mop up the mess.  The bill has arrived and we are paying it through higher taxes and cuts to pay and to health, education and welfare services.  We will pay, as will our children and grandchildren.  I will not dwell on the investments forgone, the health care denied or the education system that will be impoverished for three generations because of the bailout, because I do not want to incite a revolution.  We might well ask how it happened, who caused it and who was responsible for fiddling while our new Rome burned.</P>
        <P>We know who was Minister for Finance when Anglo Irish Bank was run in a manner that would have been considered reckless for a wild west casino in a gold strike town.  However, that was then and this is now.  When doubts were expressed by the Central Bank about the property bubble, the then Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;Build enough and they will get cheaper&rdquo;.  That was then and this is now.  The then Minister for Finance is now the Taoiseach and his hand-picked successor in the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, must admit no mistakes, confess no fault nor own up to any responsibility, for that was then and this is now.</P>
        <P>Anglo Irish Bank must be propped up, not because this is the best option for Ireland but because Fianna F&aacute;il cannot own up to the mistakes made by the former Minister, Deputy Brian Cowen.  Due to its reckless governing then and owing to it choosing the wrong option now, Fianna F&aacute;il has sold three generations of people into debt slavery.  Every man, woman and child owes &euro;1,300 a year just to service the telephone figures of money Deputy Brian Lenihan is borrowing for the banks.  The fact that almost 70% of that vast capital will go to a bank that does not lend, does not improve credit flow by one red cent, but which sits and stews in its own putrid mess, is both a national and international scandal.  Time was when we might have heard the voice of the Green Party raised in opposition against such a scandal, but it has been even more cheaply bought than the banks.  It was bought for an extra ministerial position and <Col N="973"/>a prospective ban on hunting in rural Ireland.  The cost of the mess is vast, mind-numbing sums of money no matter which option we choose.  However, there are options.</P>
        <P>If the Government cannot see there are alternatives to loading Mr. FitzPatrick&rsquo;s mistakes onto the people, it is wilfully and recklessly blind.  There are none so blind as those who choose not to see.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not want to see what it has done or what it is doing.  As Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen deliberately inflated a property bubble and sucked thousands of young men into unsustainable construction jobs.  He made the Exchequer pay for hundreds of hotels, sucking many more thousands into unsustainable construction jobs and bankrupting our hotel industry.  At a time that called for restraint and demanded prudence, he was an incendiary in a bush fire of speculation.  Now, he and his hand-picked successor, Deputy Lenihan, are loading the debt that Fianna F&aacute;il policy created onto the heads of Ireland&rsquo;s children</P>
        <P>Anglo Irish Bank, like a septic boil, sits at the centre of that debt burden.  That bank&rsquo;s collapse is due to appalling management, dodgy share dealings and barefaced cronyism.  All these faults were encouraged, facilitated and aided by a Government lax in regulation, obsessed with property and living on the proceeds of a bubble.  The relationship between those who should have regulated Anglo Irish Bank and the Anglo Irish bankers was too close, too involved and too indulgent.  It was more interested in furthering the interests of Mr. FitzPatrick than protecting the interests of ordinary investors and the people.</P>
        <P>Deputy Lenihan and Fianna F&aacute;il may believe the Taoiseach is a sainted victim of circumstance, an innocent on the road to Jericho who fell among thieves, but I do not.  I have some questions to put and would like answers to these questions in the Minister&rsquo;s response to the debate.  Mr. FitzPatrick&rsquo;s reckless mismanagement and failures have brought us to the current mess and juncture.  When did Deputy Cowen, as Minister for Finance, become aware of Mr. Se&aacute;n Quinn&rsquo;s enormous contracts for difference exposure in Anglo Irish Bank shares?  Did the shareholding of Mr. Se&aacute;n Quinn or the Quinn Group in Anglo Irish Bank reach or exceed 30% at any stage during his purchases and the unwinding of his contracts for difference position?  What effort did Deputy Cowen or his Department make to clarify the ownership of Anglo Irish Bank in the first three months of 2008, given that there were strong indications that the Quinn Group or Mr. Se&aacute;n Quinn had built a considerable stake in the bank through a combination of contracts for difference and direct share purchase?  When did Deputy Cowen become aware that the positions held by Mr. Se&aacute;n Quinn on Anglo Irish Bank shares was untenable and needed to be unwound?  Did Deputy Cowen, officials at the Department of Finance, the Financial Regulator or the Governor of the Central Bank express any concern to either Se&aacute;n Quinn or Anglo Irish Bank management or board at the short selling of the bank&rsquo;s stock resulting from rumours about the size of Mr. Quinn&rsquo;s CFD position?  When, and by whom, was approval &mdash; as is required by law &mdash; provided for Mr. Quinn or the Quinn Group to own 10% or more of Anglo Irish Bank?  Did the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, discuss such approval with the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland or its Governor?  If such approval was provided, why were the public and other shareholders not informed?  If approval was not sought and given, then why was the law flouted?  When did the then Minister for Finance become aware that the 25% stake that resulted from the unwinding of Mr. Quinn&rsquo;s position overhung the market and threatened the catastrophic slide in the share price of Anglo Irish Bank?  What contact did the then Minister or officials from his Department have with the board of management of Anglo Irish Bank on the issue of this shareholding, and its implications for the bank, in March and April 2008?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  Outside of the resolution of the banking crisis, the two most important issues for this country are the retention of existing jobs and the delivery of public sector reform.  As these constitute part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s new brief, I wish him the best of luck.  I know he will be extremely successful.</P>
        <P>My overriding concern during the financial crisis has been the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new employment.  The protection and creation of employment are dependent on credit being made available to viable businesses, particularly small and medium size enterprises, SMEs.  The latter will be crucial in leading the way out of this recession.</P>
        <P>The measures announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, yesterday will place the banks in a much stronger position than before.  Specific lending targets have been imposed on AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Both will make available at least &euro;3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities for SMEs in 2010 and 2011.  This allocation will include funds for working capital for businesses.  It represents a significant increase on the 2009 figure and will assist business development.  Bank of Ireland and AIB will also be required to make available &euro;20 million each for seed capital for ventures supported by Enterprise Ireland.  Such ventures will be vital in supporting new opportunities.  Each of the banks will also establish a fund of up to &euro;100 million for environmental, clean energy and innovation projects.  This is in addition to the &euro;100 million provided under the recapitalisation last year.</P>
        <P>In his statement to the D&aacute;il, the Minister recognised that Irish banking has been overly focused on property-related lending and has not engaged in an adequate fashion with modern economic sectors.  He has now set out targets for the banks to work with Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Banking Federation in order to develop a full range of banking services and to make available new credit products to the modern and innovative growth sectors of the economy.  Everyone is aware that small and large businesses, sole traders etc., cannot obtain access to cash or credit for current expenditure or investment purposes.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the credit review process previously promised by the Minister for Finance has been set in train since yesterday.  As the Minister for Finance informed the D&aacute;il, AIB and Bank of Ireland will be subject to this process, which will be headed by Mr. John Trethowan and which will allow individual enterprises, sole traders and farmers who have had credit refused or withdrawn to apply for an independent review of the bank&rsquo;s decision.  Where the reviewer recommends that credit should be granted, the bank is required to comply with the recommendation or explain why it will not do so.  This process will also provide an accurate assessment of banks&rsquo; lending policies and procedures.  The administrative arrangements are already in place and the relevant statutory instrument was laid before the D&aacute;il yesterday.  As a result, applications for reviews can now be made.</P>
        <P>The credit review process will give viable businesses in all sectors an opportunity to obtain an independent second opinion where credit is refused or withdrawn.  The review will ensure the banks, which have been supported by the State and the taxpayer, comply with their responsibilities to the economy.  Mr. Trethowan will outline his work in this area later in the week.  Representatives of ISME and the Small Firms Association, SFA, and members of the <Col N="975"/>general public state on radio each day that the banks are not making cash available to them.  In such circumstances, I am delighted with the establishment of the credit review process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always a pleasure to follow my namesake.  There is no doubt that Anglo Irish Bank has poisoned the well of this country&rsquo;s banking sector and also its economy.  What happened at that bank led to the making of the decisions that were announced yesterday in the D&aacute;il.  I do not accept, however, that this issue can be reduced to alleging wrongdoing on the part of certain named individuals.  I agree with people who state that in so far as wrongdoing is found to have occurred, those involved should be brought to book.  I would be as strong as anyone in advocating that this should happen.</P>
        <P>It is part of an emerging narrative, particularly on the part of the Government, to seek to reduce this problem to the proverbial small number of bad apples.  I do not accept that when considering what occurred in the past ten to 12 years, it is possible to reduce the wrong that has been done to the people as something which resulted from the actions of three, four or even half a dozen wealthy, or formerly wealthy, individuals.  We would be doing a real disservice to the people and this country&rsquo;s history if we insisted, even for one minute, that this was the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a great word which continues to be bandied about in respect of the banks, particularly Anglo Irish Bank, namely, &ldquo;systemic&rdquo;.  I am extremely interested in the use and abuse of this word.  Like everyone else, I have a reasonable understanding of what it means in the English language.  However, it has been employed by the Government, particularly in the context of Anglo Irish Bank, in the same way that Americans use the phrase &ldquo;Too important to fail&rdquo;.  As I understand it, if a bank is of systemic importance this means its tentacles and those of its business reach so far into the heart of the economy that if it got into difficulty it would, by necessity, have to be saved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am intrigued by the statements made in the past 24 hours to the effect that the contents of the balance sheet of Anglo Irish Bank constitute half of the value of the Irish economy.  I had not previously come across such statements.  In fairness to the Government, if what is being stated is true then this would point to the importance of Anglo Irish Bank being somewhat systemic in character.  Is it truly the case that the contents of one relatively young bank could constitute half the value of the country&rsquo;s economy?  If the answer is yes, how was this allowed to occur?  In a country where people were previously informed that competition and the plurality of banking services were extremely important, how was such a position allowed to develop?  There is a need for someone to clarify the position, particularly in the context of the absence of regulation for such a long period.  How did the contents of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet come to constitute such an enormous part of the economy?</P>
        <P>I stated earlier that Anglo Irish Bank poisoned the well.  I simply do not accept that poison could not be detected until the entire well had been contaminated.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle and O&rsquo;Malley stated the right thing had been done yesterday.  I want more evidence and detail, particularly on the Anglo Irish Bank question.  Perhaps colleagues opposite are prepared, for whatever reason, to accept what they are told to be the case on the basis of a mere assertion and being told something is true.  However, I will not accept it, unless it is demonstrated to me to be true.  Perhaps it will be demonstrated to me to be true that it is necessary to save Anglo Irish Bank, a bank which looks to me to have very little life in it.  When I discuss it in private with colleagues opposite, they agree with me, roll their eyes and state it does look like it is a dead duck but that it is what we have to do.  This morning I heard Mr. Dukes, chairman designate of Anglo Irish Bank, state he would be prepared to produce the relevant figures in order that Members of the Houses and others could assess the statement <Col N="976"/>that it was necessary to save it.  Where are these figures and why can we not have them in this debate?  Why is it merely an assertion and a claim all the time?</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle made the extraordinary statement that what had occurred vindicated the position of the Government on the guarantee.  How is it conceivable that attracting to the people a bill of multiple billions vindicate the position of the Government?  Even the honest Members opposite &mdash; most of them are honest &mdash; accept this is extraordinarily painful to have to do but how does it constitute vindication?  Statements such as this are made all the time that are not borne out by the evidence or the facts.</P>
        <P>It is all very well for Senator O&rsquo;Malley and others to criticise the Opposition for making outlandish statements in circumstances where she states, again without a scintilla of evidence or support for her statement, that she genuinely believes that if the bank guarantee had not been given on 29 September, it would have led to the collapse of the economy.  That is purported to be a statement of fact but what backs it up?  Where is the evidence for it?  The Labour Party does not engage in self-congratulation on not supporting the bank guarantee.  We stated it was excessive and guaranteed things that did not need to be guaranteed.  Certainly, there was an argument for guaranteeing deposits but a considerable amount of the debt guaranteed should not have been guaranteed and drew us into the vortex in which we find ourselves and from which it will be so difficult for generations of Irish people to get out.  It will be many years and budgets before there is light at the end of the tunnel.  How can Senator O&rsquo;Malley state that if the guarantee had not been given, it would have led to the collapse of the economy?  What a statement to make.  I am drawing attention to it because it is one of many statements that are made opposite in support of what the Government is doing.  I do not think colleagues opposite have more information than we do.  I suggest &mdash; I am open to being corrected if I am wrong &mdash; that the only difference between them and us is that they have a responsibility, as they would see it, to back up what the Government is doing because they make speeches and contributions but they do not have evidence to back up what they state.  They state it is cheaper to keep Anglo Irish Bank and have this bailout.  There is no question that it is a bailout; if it is not, what is?  They state it is cheaper than the cost of letting the bank go to the wall.  Perhaps I could be persuaded that is the case but yesterday I heard someone state the cost of retaining it and the cost of letting it go were starting to converge.  It might arise that it might be cheaper in the long run to let it go.  Can we not have the facts, information and the evidence rather than a mere assertion along the way?</P>
        <P>Others have called for this debate to be continued.  I heard Senator MacSharry make such a call.  When we do so, will we have information and evidence circulated in advance in order that Members of the Houses and the public will be able to see the basis upon which their money is being committed?</P>

        <P>When I was preparing for this debate, I took some time to read the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s statement on banking and the supplementary documentation supplied to the D&aacute;il yesterday.  As I was reading the main content of the document, my eye caught the legal notice on the first page.  It states:</P><Col N="977"/>
        <P LI="1">None of the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency, the National Asset Management Agency or any of their agents or advisers makes any representation, express or implied, with respect to the accuracy, verification or completeness of any information contained in this document, or accepts any responsibility for its contents.</P>
        <P FLI="0">With such a statement at the beginning of a briefing document for a discussion on such important legislation, is it any wonder people such as me and Senators Alex White and McFadden are justifiably sceptical about the statements we hear made on yesterday&rsquo;s announcement?  My party voted in favour of the bank guarantee scheme and I spoke in the debate that night.  I believed then and still do that it was right to vote in favour of it.  However, we were offered the guarantee as something that would deal with the difficulties the banks were facing and would move the economy forward.  That did not happen.</P>
        <P>The previous recapitalisation of the banks cost approximately &euro;11 billion.  That was also put forward as an injection to get banks lending again, but that did not happen either.  Now we have the third attempt by the Government to deal with the issues raised in the banking industry and are asked to believe this is the big bang that will sort out everything and get credit flowing again.  Such a track record stretches credibility for us to accept it.  I am reminded of what happened in the general election of 2007 and how the country was festooned with posters proclaiming, &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;.  Yesterday we saw what the &ldquo;more to do&rdquo; was all about.  The people were truly chilled by what it had done to them and will do to them.</P>
        <P>Among the huge facts about the scale of the problem unveiled yesterday three stand out; two are economic and one is political.  The first economic point is that the national debt will be doubled.  The second is that if the plan is carried out, Anglo Irish Bank will receive approximately &euro;40 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money, which is more than all of the tax revenue in a given year.  The political point is that the one person at the centre of this cobweb of regulatory failure and business malpractice is the Taoiseach because he was Minister for Finance during the period when it took place and had ultimate responsibility for the regulatory regime in place, the spend and tax policies of the country and is now running it.  He is at the centre of the cobweb of accountability and regulatory collapse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Despite everything that took place yesterday, three very big questions remain unanswered.  The first, to which many of my colleagues have pointed, concerns the future of Anglo Irish Bank.  I will emphasise the question I asked earlier: why is the course of action to manage debt open to Independent News and Media and Waterford Wedgwood not open to Anglo Irish Bank?  What is the future of Ireland&rsquo;s banking industry?  What is the plan for consolidating and integrating it?  We know two of our major banks have 30 days in which to come back to the Government with a plan.  What is the future of the tens of thousands working in the banking industry?  It must be pointed out that almost every other developed economy throughout the world put in place plans for banking capitalisation and to solve the problems of the banking industry a year ago.  Why has it taken us so long to do this?  With all of the claims made for competence, credibility and agility on behalf of the Government, the fact that it took so long to put a bad plan in place only proves to me that the only thing it is good at in dealing with the banking crisis is being consistently wrong.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Minister shall within three months of the commencement of this Act, publish a report on the provision of secure care under this Act which shall include consideration of how such provision compares with best practice internationally.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is a request to the Minister of State that within three months of the commencement of the Act, he will publish a report on the provision of secure care under this Act, which should include a consideration of how such provision compares with best practice internationally.  This amendment relates to the requirement to have outcome-focused research on the experiences of children in secure units and high support care.  The actual experience of children must be examined and the gaps within the system will be identified by conducting such research.  This Bill provides an opportunity to review the provision of secure care as it operates at present.  Obviously, being in secure care often constitutes an extreme situation for children and it is important to analyse critically their experiences within such units, to try to consider them as objectively as possible and to learn from them and gather the research therefrom.  It is clear that the units around the world which operate most effectively and which have the most success employ quality assessments.  I have worked with some units of this kind in England and what is needed from the outset is a quality assessment that leads to a proper treatment plan for the individual, which is regularly reviewed, monitored and evaluated as one goes along.</P>
        <P>Clearly, as I noted previously, a child will only be in this situation when he or she is at extreme risk and hopefully, when the child no longer needs such a level of care, he or she will be taken away from such a secure centre.  Best practice indicates that one needs high quality step-down facilities to ensure that such a child can move on and get the best possible help.  All the research I know of on children who are in care states that doing high quality work with the family while the child is in care can be to the child&rsquo;s advantage in many cases.  Therefore, family work would form an essential part of any programme of work with a child who is in a secure unit, wherever possible.  One thereby acknowledges the significance of the family for the child <Col N="979"/>and how, even if the child is in secure care, the family&rsquo;s dynamics continue to be part of that child&rsquo;s life and to affect his or her development, future and care.</P>
        <P>In a point that is pertinent throughout the Bill, a child&rsquo;s presence in a secure unit is no reason to ignore the voice of the child but is quite the opposite.  One must listen clearly to the child or young person&rsquo;s comments on the experience he or she is having in the secure unit.  It is essential to build into the Bill this concept as strongly as possible in order that the child&rsquo;s rights are respected and that he or she is consulted.  Even though a child may be in a secure unit, one can and should have extremely high standards.  It should be a positive therapeutic experience and treatment for the child.  If all these requirements are to be met, by accepting this amendment the Minister of State has an opportunity to review what has been learned from the secure units thus far, to continue this process of learning about the experience of the child and to evaluate it critically.  I am interested to learn whether the Minister of State proposes to accept this amendment and will await his response before making further comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to record my strong support for this important amendment tabled by Senator Fitzgerald and it will be interesting to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  This is a relatively new area of policy delivery and a number of reports have been prepared.  While not all the information available is universally positive, there definitely have been improvements that it is important to acknowledge.  However, one still heard stories about difficulties that arose during the so-called economic boom when it frequently was reported that there were difficulties in recruiting and retaining suitably qualified and experienced staff.  This area may not have been perceived across the entire system as being as important as were some of the other services.  It was something of a Cinderella service, to coin that awful clich&eacute;.  This point has been made in respect of some of the secure units and there have been flashpoints involving serious and negative reports on some people&rsquo;s experiences.  While I am sure this is an area to which the Minister of State is committed, international best practice exists, as Senator Fitzgerald noted.  The purpose of her amendment is to induce the Minister to publish a report on the provision of secure care, having regard to best practice internationally, and consequently I support this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of special care has been the subject of considerable research in recent years, including last year, when the Children Acts Advisory Board commissioned an independent report, which will provide an overview of the applications for admission to special care made by the HSE&rsquo;s local health officers.  It traces and tracks outcomes for the children who were the subject of such applications up to November 2009.  The research has been undertaken by Social Information Systems Limited and in addition to the Children Acts Advisory Board, the HSE and my office are represented on the steering group.  Obviously, I continue to have regular meetings with the HSE to review this area and an individual has been assigned specific responsibility for special care and alternative care.  Moreover, it is worth noting that under section 8 of the main Act, namely, the Child Care Act 1991, there is an obligation to have an annual review of adequacy of service, which applies across the board.</P>
        <P>Finally, it is worth pointing out that HIQA produced a report last year into special care and high support.  It concluded that serious problems existed in respect of health and safety issues and there were some issues regarding the vetting of staff.  In general, however, it highlighted that the provision of services in our special care units was good by international standards and that children who were in such units were aware of their rights and felt comfortable discussing them and what they were entitled to do.  The outcomes were good for those children.</P><Col N="980"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>I will not accept the amendment as adequate research and reports are available to us, whether through the Health Information and Quality Authority, the Children Acts Advisory Board or the statutory report that must be produced annually.  In the past 18 months we have ensured the statutory report is produced more contemporaneously than used to be the case.  These reports used to be published two or three years after the years in question but they are more timely now, which is a welcome change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Minister of State is satisfied with the methods already in place to review what is occurring, but will he ensure the annual report compares what is being done in Ireland with best international practice?  Perhaps he could incorporate the thinking behind the amendment.</P>
        <P>He mentioned that even the HIQA report raised concerns about staffing levels and some other matters.  Obviously, we have learned much from our experience with closed institutions.  Where there are such institutions, one needs to be sure monitoring mechanisms are in place, that best practice is continuously upheld and that we are doing our best for those who end up in those secure units, namely, the most vulnerable children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that we want to adhere to and surpass the best international practice.  There is no reason we should not since we are an advanced industrialised nation that probably knows more about the damage that can be done to children in institutions than any other country.  We want to learn not only from the past but also from our neighbours.  We also want to surpass the high standards we have set.  I accept Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments and I will raise the matter with the HSE when it begins its review of the adequacy of services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment to the effect that, in so far as he can, he will ensure a comparison with best international practice will be one of the criteria by which the HSE will examine the situation in its annual report on secure units.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P><Col N="981"/>
      
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first I have heard of the ruling.  How is it a potential charge?  I am sure this is just a glitch in the system, but I have not even received a letter about the ruling.  I accept that one normally gets a letter, but I literally did not know of the ruling until I stood up to address the amendment.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an amendment to and extension of the Child Care Act.  Its Long Title states: &ldquo;to make further provision in relation to the care and protection of children&rdquo;.  We should take a holistic view of what we mean by care and protection when discussing this question.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests, including those of the Minister of State, the agencies and the Senators addressing the question, that we not confine ourselves to dealing with crises, namely, where an immediate intervention must be made to take a child into care.  Part of what the Minister of State is doing through this Bill is solidifying and codifying the basis on which these orders are sought and obtained.</P>
        <P>In all these circumstances, we should be prepared to go much further than simply dealing with what occurs when it unfortunately becomes necessary for a child to be taken into care.  We should have regard to the reality faced by many homeless children and young people on the streets of our cities and towns.  There is probably a spectrum ranging from homeless to situations in which a child is in such a vulnerable position that he or she must be taken into care to avoid or address a danger to that child or others.  Would the Minister of State consider this as a context for what is being done in the Bill?  Would it be necessary to introduce measures to ensure that, where children become or face becoming homeless, sufficiently robust measures are taken and early warning signs are heeded?  Not for one minute am I claiming there are no services and neither am I claiming there is no basis for agencies to take action, but we should strengthen those services and take steps to ensure the relevant agencies, including the HSE, can move quickly to deal with a homeless child and provide suitable accommodation.  That child might not be in immediate danger and, therefore, is not amenable to a care order being entered into or sought in respect of him or her.  Unless it is an unfair phrase, however, he or she is on a risky road towards the types of measure that must be taken in the context of this legislation.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that so many young people find themselves homeless.  Would the Minister of State consider addressing this fact through this legislation or elsewhere?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with what my friend and colleague, Senator Alex White, stated on this issue.  Before continuing and given that the Senator did not receive notification that his amendment was deemed to be out of order, will we find that other amendments have been ruled out of order?  Perhaps we could be advised.  These are idiotic rulings and they place the Seanad in a position of contempt because it is insupportable to claim that the Seanad should be precluded from discussing particularly relevant sections simply because of some archaic notion that we should not be trusted with the public purse strings.  The crowd that has been in charge of the Exchequer for the past while is in no position to cast stones against the Seanad, which has a responsible view in these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>For the Senator&rsquo;s information, I understand that amendment No. 23 has also been deemed to be out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is most helpful and I thank the Acting Chairman.  It was worth hanging around, since he did not mention my amendment No. 27 and I presume it is all right.  One could sustain an argument that anything would create a charge on the Exchequer.  We have just dealt with Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment, which referred to publishing a report.  While that might not have cost much, it would certainly have incurred a charge on the Exchequer.  How absurd is this type of situation?  I thank the Acting Chairman for informing <Col N="982"/>the House that one other amendment has been ruled out of order, which is something we were not told.  The rules of the House need to be examined substantially.  It would be absurd to be able to cause a report to be made on a particular subject without being able to table an amendment on it, yet we can ask for a report on these situations.</P>
        <P>The nub of the matter is the question of services provided to homeless children.  They must be appropriate.  Senior members of the Judiciary have castigated the Oireachtas for allowing a situation in which children were placed in inappropriate accommodation.  This is not a reflection on the Minister of State or his advisers, as the situation has been the tradition for many years.  Was it Judge Hubert Wine who&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It was before my time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was probably before the junior Senator&rsquo;s time, but I remember the event.  The amendment deals with the kind of accommodation.  It is an excellent amendment which goes directly to the heart of what the provision should be.  I hope the Minister of State will give careful consideration to these necessary functions.  The amendment calls for a room for each child; adequate and suitable furniture; a sufficient number of lavatories, wash basins, baths and showers; adequate facilities for laundry; adequate light, heat and ventilation; sufficiently clean premises, appropriately decorated and maintained in good structural order; adequate recreational facilities; and an appropriate and adequate level of security.  It also states the accommodation provided by the executive should be appropriate to the age and support needs of the child who is homeless and that the executive should further seek to provide a child who is homeless with appropriate long-term accommodation and care.  You see, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I have managed to slip the wording of the amendment into the record.  This is a worthy amendment.  It neuters this House if it can call for a report but cannot deal with the nuts and bolts of it.  </P>
        <P>While we have not been able to have a detailed discussion of amendment No. 3, we have been permitted in debating section 5 to deal with some of the issues it raises.  By that fashion, we have laid the issues before the Minister of State.  With goodwill and despite the fact that the amendment was, technically, ruled out of order, I am sure he will give it some consideration.</P>
        <P>I bear in mind the serious situation in which the country finds itself.  We had a major debate this morning on the critical financial situation facing us.  Everyone is being whacked.  We all received letters yesterday about how much was being taken out of our salaries, which is appropriate.  People like ourselves should be addressed first before cuts are imposed on young and vulnerable people in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot second-guess the decision to disallow the proposed amendment and I am slightly restricted in what I can say.  The existing section 5 of the 1991 Child Care Act talks about suitable accommodation.  It does not go into the detail of laundry facilities, toilets, wash basins or recreational facilities, which are all very admirable and things we would expect.  In order to reflect what we consider to be appropriate and civilised standards of accommodation for anyone, HIQA will be facilitated in the course of this year, pursuant to the Ryan implementation plan, to inspect all facilities provided for young people, homeless or otherwise.  It has its own standards which are reflected in the youth homeless strategy which sets out some of what is expected of State provision for children in need of accommodation.  </P>
        <P>Regardless of whether the proposed requirements would impose a charge on the State, I am perplexed that the amendment refers only to the standard of accommodation and not to other issues such as the location of the accommodation and its proximity to the young person&rsquo;s family, education, employment, training and other standards.  These are normally dealt with in <Col N="983"/>strategies, guidelines and statutory instruments rather than in the substantive body of legislation.</P>
        <P>I hope it will provide some reassurance for Members to know that the original section 5 which the amendment would have replaced talks about available suitable accommodation.  The standards are outlined in the strategy which is enforced by HIQA which, I think everyone would agree, is having an effect on all health services and particularly on child protection and welfare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that since I last rose to speak I have found on my desk a letter addressed to Senator Phil Prendergast which makes the point about the amendment being ruled out of order.   I wish to correct matters.  A letter was sent.</P>
        <P>I agree with much of what Senator Norris said about the basis on which amendments were ruled out of order.  I propose to raise this matter at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

        <P>I thank the Minister of State for what he said.  I understood him to say he thought the issues raised by me and Senator Norris were incomplete and that we could have gone further.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I simply commented, by way of an aside, that it was unusual the amendment restricted itself to accommodation standards.

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, line 31, to delete &ldquo;detention&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This has more to do with the language of the Bill than with anything else.  When we discussed this matter on Second Stage, I had the impression the Minister of State was somewhat sympath<Col N="984"/>etic to the point being made about the use of a word such as &ldquo;detention&rdquo; in a child care measure.  The word belongs to the language of the criminal justice system and one would not wish to see it in child care legislation.  It was for that reason that my Labour Party colleagues and I tabled this amendment to remove the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo;.  We suggest its replacement with the word &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I am not wedded to a particular word.  If the Minister of State has a better or more appropriate one, I will be happy to debate it with him.  I would have thought we could all agree that the use of the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo; was not appropriate.  It is associated with criminal proceedings and criminal decision making regarding children is what we are trying to avoid.  We need words which clearly mean something.  We know we are talking about taking children into care for their protection and the protection of others which does involve an element of their being taken into a secure environment.  To that extent, we understand where the use of the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo; comes from.  However, in the context of this legislation, it should be replaced by one which more suitably describes what is being done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very glad Senator White tabled this amendment.  I had thought of putting my name to it but I am very happy to support and second it.</P>
        <P>I have met various groups, some in Leinster House and others in my house, to discuss this matter.  Language is one of the questions they dealt with.  There is a history in this country of children being placed in institutions.  Some were detained in reformatories by order of a court, although they had committed no criminal act.  This was a shocking business and I know the Minister of State is particularly sensitive to these issues.  We are lucky to have such a humane person in charge.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the young people concerned use and prefer the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo;.  It is a neutral word between &ldquo;detention&rdquo; and &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo;.  With the best intentions, the word &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo; may also sound a little patronising.  The word &ldquo;placement&rdquo; has the support of common usage by the group which avails of these services.  This is an important amendment.  Language helps to create attitudes.  I hope the Government is disposed to accepting it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This point arose on Second Stage.  I would be interested to hear if the Minister of State accepts there is a principle and important point regarding the use of language.  This word arises in a number of sections.  The Minister of State does not appear to have tabled any amendments in respect of it.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware that Barnados, the Irish Association of Young People in Care and the Irish Foster Care Association have all expressed concern about the use of the word &ldquo;detained&rdquo; in the legislation and would urge the Minister of State to change the language used in the Bill as a matter of priority for the reasons outlined by Senators Norris and Alex White in terms of the messages it sends out and the attitudes it can contribute to forming.  The use of language is important in the Bill.  The words &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo;, &ldquo;placement&rdquo; or &ldquo;housed&rdquo; could be used instead of &ldquo;detention&rdquo;.  Even though we are talking about a secure facility, clearly, the focus on children in secure units is a hope that the placement and housing of them there will lead to rehabilitation and a better future for them.</P>
        <P>The word &ldquo;detention&rdquo;, as Senator White said, is associated with criminal proceedings.  The general perception from the groups working directly with children is that the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo; is not the best use of language in terms of this Bill and that it would be better if it reflected what is needed to protect and support children at risk because of welfare issues rather than criminal issues.  There is a real point in this respect and it is not simply a matter of arguing about words.  A message is given in the language used.</P><Col N="985"/>
        <P>As Senator Norris pointed out, we know of the experience of the children who were sent to reformatory schools.  These are different times and when we reflect on the language and procedures that were used at that time we note they were appalling.  Words defined that they be detained.  They needed care but the approach taken towards them &mdash; I believe it was by the ISPCC and others &mdash; meant they were dealt with as though they were criminals when what they needed was care, attention and welfare.  I would be interested to hear if the Minister has considered this issue in terms of the language of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Norris&rsquo;s suggestion of the use of the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo; is good in terms of changing the nature of the language used.  I am interested in the principle that a person is branded, tarnished or tarred for life if he or she is tagged as having been in a detention centre or having been detained.  I hope the Minister of State will be sympathetic to the proposed change in the language used.  However, I understand that there might be a difficulty in changing the wording because of the nature of the Bill and if one has gone through a court procedure, the existing wording may be related to, for want of a better term, other legal jargon.  Therefore, this proposal may present a difficulty.  The proposed word &ldquo;placement&rdquo; offers a neutral space for people with complications in their lives and it is not a term like &ldquo;detention&rdquo; with which they will be tarred or branded forever.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s justification for accepting or not accepting the amendment or whether he will consider changing the nature of the language used in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to intervene briefly.  I found the reference I made in my contribution on Second Stage where I flagged this issue.  I said:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is also the matter of language.  I had a visit from people involved in the care of young people who are concerned about the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo;.  They suggested it might appear to criminalise all the children in question.  Children themselves speak of securing their &ldquo;placement&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If the Minister of State was amenable, I am sure Senator Alex White and myself would be prepared to table an amendment to substitute the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo; for &ldquo;detention&rdquo; on Report Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have truly horrible memories of my detention in a noxious, snotty Protestant boarding school.  I joke about being detained there but I felt I was imprisoned.  Detention was a punishment and it brought shame.  Detention was also involved in the excellent day school I attended subsequently.  We felt really humiliated it we were detained.  It meant we had done something really wrong and we were being punished for it.  Sometimes I had to write lines or sit at my desk for two hours and I was probably the only person in the room and some unfortunate master had to supervise me.  Therefore, the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo; is a little negative and I am grateful, as I am sure is Senator Alex White, for the support of Senator O&rsquo;Malley on the Government benches and, of course, Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sympathetic to the points that have been made.  As Senators Norris and Fitzgerald said, language has a capacity to effect change.  I also believe that.  However, the proposed amendment underlines the difficulty of the situation in that it is proposed to substitute the word &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo;, which implies some previous wrongdoing.  The capacity of the criminal justice system to rehabilitate an individual is a term that is very often used in the context of detention and sentencing in the criminal justice system in general.  The alternative use of the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo; has been suggested and it was proposed to table an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.  I would consider such an amendment at that time.</P><Col N="986"/>
        <P>It would be confusing to insert that term in the Children Act 2001 because it deals with children detention schools.  I do not believe anyone would argue that when one is dealing with a children detention school, one is dealing with a child that has committed an offence under that Act.  If one makes an order under that Act, it is appropriately referred to as a children detention order and not a children rehabilitation order.  We need to distinguish care from detention in regard to offending &mdash; in other words, the Child Care Act as against the Children Act 2001.</P>
        <P>In the context of this Bill, our legal advice on the use of the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo; is that it is appropriate to the circumstances of this Bill.  The Act must be very clear that special care involves the detention of a child.  To use any other word would be likely to mislead and make the position uncertain for the courts, the HSE, the children, parents, guardians and the general public.  As to the fact that special care involves the detention of the child, currently, the High Court orders made, which provide for special care for children, are called detention orders.  Successive court judgments have used the term &ldquo;detention&rdquo;.  Judgments have been clear in their distinction between detention in a special care facility and detention under criminal statutes.  In terms of special care, in judicial review proceedings, its use does not connote any criminality on the part of children.  It is for that reason that I would not accept the amendment at this time.  However, at a later Stage in the Seanad or D&aacute;il we could have further discussions on the issue.  The proposed amendment underlines the difficulty but I am not unsympathetic to the intentions of the proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo; is used in various judgments cannot be the end of this matter.  Once a word enters into the language and the nomenclature, if that is the right word, that is the language everybody uses.  We are the Oireachtas and are in an important position of being able to change legislation and by doing so we can change the way matters are referred to.  If we make such a change in legislation that becomes a new way of describing a situation.</P>
        <P>I am interested in what the Minister of State said and I understand his point regarding the intent of the use of the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo;.  I accept his comments on the use of the word &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo; and would have no difficulty in agreeing to Senator Norris&rsquo;s suggestion of the use of the term &ldquo;placement&rdquo; or perhaps &ldquo;secure placement&rdquo;, which would denote the notion of detention.  Detention means that a person is not free to leave.  We should be clear about what it means.  I understand where the Minister of State is coming from in this respect.  Language must mean certain things.  I cannot go so far as to use woolly language to make a term sound like something else when we are talking about somebody not being free to leave a centre.  There are plenty of words in the English language and we do not have to use words such as &ldquo;detention&rdquo; that are so closely allied to the criminal justice system.  The term &ldquo;placement&rdquo; or &ldquo;secure placement&rdquo; would bring us pretty much along the road to what we need to describe in the Act and in the legislation generally.  I maintain my objection to the use of the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo;, as I thought the Minister had although perhaps he had an opportunity to examine it more closely.  I will be happy to explore with Senators Norris and Fitzgerald the use of a word such as &ldquo;placement&rdquo; or a similar word on Report Stage to get around this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what my colleague, Senator Alex White, said.  We certainly will consider this on Report Stage.  Has the Minister of State any information on when Report Stage will be taken because we are only dealing with Committee Stage now?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Alex White made a really good point that we have the opportunity to change the language used.  I urge the Minister of State to consider this.  We all know how much courts have to learn about how they treat different groups of people, whether children, women, sexual assault victims or otherwise.  The courts must learn and change.  This is an opportunity to change the language we use when speaking about these children who are in need of care.  We suggest the words &ldquo;secure housing&rdquo; but &ldquo;secure placement&rdquo; is another suggestion.  If we can get away from the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo; and create a new description, it will have meaning.  It is an opportunity for the Minister of State and I am glad he has said he will consider it on Report Stage as it will be really important.  Those other words build up a different image from the word &ldquo;detention&rdquo;.  For those children looking back, the Minister of State would be doing them a great favour.  Even though it involves a court procedure, a secure placement and is serious, this suggestion is worth looking at.  I hope that by the time the Bill is finalised, the Minister of State will have changed the language in it.  I know he is going up against precedent in courts and tradition, but the courts have much to learn in terms of being more child sensitive and more sensitive to different categories of people who appear before them, although they have learned much.  This is an opportunity to refine the language and it should be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I add some additional support to my three colleagues who have spoken positively about this.  We seem to be moving in the direction of the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo; or some form of words involving the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo;.  As I said, the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo; is in common currency among young people.  This change would validate the use of that word and would strengthen that reinforcing language.</P>
        <P>In regard to the very proper query raised by Senator Alex White to ensure language is not just fuzzy and sentimental and that we realise there is an element of restraint, that there is no opt out and that one cannot walk out of a secure placement, the Minister, in a sense, addresses that in a Government amendment.  That amendment deals not only with the supervision and monitoring of the children but also with situations in which they are kidnapped or they abscond.  It makes it very clear that they are required to stay in the secure placement.  It is perfectly obvious that amendment will pass because it is a Government one.  Within the next hour, the situation to which Senator Alex White properly drew our attention will be materially implanted in the Bill in a way that there can be no possibility of misunderstanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate is a very useful one because it underlines the difficulties in this area.  As Senator Alex White said, one does not want to include particular language in the Bill for the sake of it and to make it sound less than it really is.  There needs to be precision and clarity about what is meant and what we are trying to achieve in this legislation.  Special care is a unique form of care for any child and it is distinguished from all other forms of care in that it is in a secure setting.  One cannot leave it and a child would not be placed in that type of care unless there was a pattern of doing harm to himself or herself or to others or of absconding.  It is very distinctive and it can only be for a very short period.  It is designed specifically to try to stabilise a difficult situation for a child.  It is important, therefore, that the language is not casual or does not try to effect an atmosphere in the legislation.  It needs to be precise and distinguished.</P><Col N="988"/>
        <P>Placement is what happens with all children, whether in foster care, high support or other residential care.  They are all placed as such.  Therefore, the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo; may not be sufficient to achieve what we are talking about.  We are talking about trying to distinguish this from the criminal justice system while retaining the distinction from the rest of the care world.  That is the difficulty. The legal advice we have is that &ldquo;detention&rdquo; is the appropriate word, that it creates that distinction and that it is used in both the care and the criminal justice systems.  However, I remain open to further discussion about this but we have underlined in the discussion we have had that it is not something that is easily done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am more attracted by the words &ldquo;secure placement&rdquo; because there is an element of neutrality and also an element of clarity.  It indicates that there is not the option to move out of the environment.  It is also positive.  The Minister of State referred to situations not only of anti-social behaviour directed towards other people or other patterns of behaviour but also of self-harm.  The word &ldquo;secure&rdquo; is good because it means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>All placements should be secure.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>How does it distinguish that?  That is the difficulty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It means they are secured against harming themselves.  That is quite a good word.  I am very glad the Minister of State is open to further argument on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>We could canvass some other options between now and Report Stage.  In situations such as this when one brings forward a proposal which may not be perfect and the Minister is not amenable to accepting it but understands the argument behind it, I am always struck that the person who is in the best position to come up with alternatives is the Minister and his advisers.  They would know what would pass muster.  That is not meant as a criticism.  If the legal advice is that we need to denote a sense of restraint, as Senator Norris said, the English language is a reasonably flexible instrument and it must be possible for us to come up with wording that would satisfy both requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It should include the word &ldquo;placement&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I think so.  The words &ldquo;secure placement&rdquo; are as close as one can get.  Rather than just being prepared for us to canvass alternatives, I hope the Minister of State will consider the matter with his advisers and come up with wording that might suit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The effect of this amendment to section 23B(5) and (6) is to ensure the HSE retains more responsibility than was previously provided for in the published Bill in respect of children who are the subject of a special care order and where such special care is being provided in a unit which is subject to an arrangement under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  This amendment is in accordance with our legal advice.  Section 38 of the Health Act 2004 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Health Service Executive may enter into an arrangement with a person to provide a special care unit.  The amendment ensures that, where a child is the subject of a special care order and provided with special care under section 38, the HSE will supervise and monitor the special care unit in question, establish procedures for the notification to the HSE of the release of the child pursuant to section 23NF(9), that is, where the child requires medical treatment, assessment or examination immediately or his or her release is required immediately on compassionate grounds, and be informed by the person with whom the section 38 arrangement has been made if a child is unlawfully moved, absconds, fails to return, is prevented from returning or missing from the special care unit.</P>
        <P>In subsection (6) of the amendment the various sections that will apply to the person with whom an arrangement is made under section 38 of the Health Act 2004, as amended, are stated.  The effect of the changed references is that the HSE retains authority to decide on the special care to be provided for the child, give consent to a medical or psychiatric assessment, an examination or treatment in respect of the child and the application for a passport for the child to allow him or her to undergo a medical or psychiatric assessment, an examination and treatment outside the State or to permit him or her to reside outside the State with a parent or relative.</P>

	<P>What agencies are supplying a service under section 38 of the 1994 Act and how many children are being cared for by agencies other than the Health Service Executive?  The Minister of State is correct that a clear line of accountability and responsibility from an outside care provider to the HSE is required in the circumstances set out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>My information is that special care is not provided other than by the HSE.  Section 38 of the 1994 Health Act allows such care to be provided other than by the HSE from time to time.  The section is facilitative and anticipates that in certain circumstances a child with highly specific needs may, from time to time, avail of services outside the State, for example, in the United Kingdom.  The issue of scale arises owing to the small size of the country.  In such circumstances, the HSE wishes to retain control over the management of the care of the child.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has indicated that a child may need to travel abroad for two forms of treatment, one of which is psychiatric care.  Is the nature of the medical advice or treatment for which a child will be allowed to travel specified or is the provision general in nature?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I raised my earlier question is that care services have been privatised in other countries.  Care services could also be provided by a voluntary organisation or private company here and the idea of using private companies to provide such services has been discussed.  I welcome clarification that children are not being cared for by organisations other than the HSE.  If, however, this type of care service was outsourced to another agency, these provisions would clearly apply.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="991"/>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s question, section 38 of the Health Act 1994 provides that the Health Service Executive may enter into an arrangement with a person to provide a special care unit.  The amendment proposes that, in circumstances where a private provider is involved in the care of a child, the HSE will retain control over treatments, applications for passports and other matters for which a parent would normally give consent.  As I indicated, there are no private providers operating in the area of special care, although private companies operate in areas such as foster care and residential units. </P></Speaker>

        <P LI="1">In page 24, to delete lines 22 to 32.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Questions arise about the importance of consultation with a child in special care or his or her parents and-or guardians.  The amendment relates to the determination by the HSE that a child requires special care.  Section 23F(4) allows the HSE to bypass consultation with the child, a parent and-or guardian and a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> if it is satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe it is not in the best interests of the child to do so.  Placing children in care is a serious matter and, where possible, one should seek at all times to consult parents, guardians and the children concerned.</P>
        <P>Even in circumstances in which a child is in secure care, it is extremely important, in the vast majority of cases, that work continues with family members and the child in question.  It is also important for the child&rsquo;s long-term future that ongoing consultation takes place.  While there may be cases where this is not possible, I question the necessity of including in legislation a provision that the Health Service Executive shall not consult the child, a parent having custody of a child, the child&rsquo;s guardian or a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i>.  This provision could be open to abuse.</P>
        <P>Children are placed in secure care only in extreme circumstances and they and their parents face great stress as a result.  It may prove too easy to decide against consulting the key people cited in the subsection.  Therefore, I seek to delete the provision for that reason.  It is important to keep open communications with all the parties involved rather than bypassing them.</P>
        <P>This is a strong exclusion which I fear will be overused.  It provides that consultation will not take place when the HSE has &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; to believe it is not in the best interests of the child to consult the persons cited.  &ldquo;Reasonable cause&rdquo; is a legal term.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the thinking behind the provision because there is a danger it will be overused and lead to bad practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s doubts about this provision.  Section 23F(4) states the HSE may choose not to consult, having regard to the protection of the life, health and safety of the child, in other words, in circumstances where the child may be in serious danger.  The provision that it will not consult the child appears strange.  Will the Minister of State outline the circumstances in which he or his advisers believe this power will be necessary?  I find it difficult to imagine such a circumstance.  The only one which comes to mind is where a child is in danger from actions of the parent.  While such cases have arisen, if the child was <Col N="992"/>in a secure placement, I am not sure how such a circumstance could arise.  If these circumstances could arise, they would be remote.  I ask the Minister of State to provide some examples.  It may be just about arguable that a guardian or parent who has custody of a child should not be consulted but I cannot envisage circumstances in which it would not be appropriate to consult the child.  Do the words &ldquo;a person acting<i> in loco parentis</i>&rdquo; in subsection (4)(<i>d</i>) also cover a guardian <i>ad litem</i>?  If a court appoints someone to be a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, it would be odd if this function was removed in certain serious circumstances.  I, therefore, ask the Minister of State to give examples of circumstances in which it would not be appropriate to consult the child and indicate whether the words in subsection (4)(<i>d</i>) also cover a guardian <i>ad litem.</i></P>

	<P>Can I ask about an aspect of this amendment that has attracted my attention?  Perhaps the Minister of State will be able to explain it well.  It seems this section of the Bill does not make it necessary to consult any of the four people listed in it.  I am not sure I understand it correctly.  I accept it might be necessary not to consult a parent or a guardian, but it is hard to understand why at least one of the four people should not be consulted.  Perhaps I have not thought of a specific circumstance.  I spoke recently about my concern that Ireland is becoming such a nanny state that we protect ourselves from everything.  Maybe there is a very solid and valid reason for this provision.  I assume everything is covered by the use of the term &ldquo;having regard to the protection of the life, health, safety, development or welfare of the child&rdquo;, in the context of the HSE being &ldquo;satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe it is not in the best interests of the child&rdquo; to consult one of these people.  However, I am concerned that nobody will be consulted.  The Minister of State may well have a valid reason for doing this, but it seems to be over the top.</P>

	<P>I disagree with what the previous speakers have been saying.  Traditionally, we always thought the best interests of the child were served in the home and by the family.  We have learned time and again that is not the case.  This measure recognises that the home can be a dangerous place for a child.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  That is more or less what I said, but what about the child?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>A child might run away if he or she thinks a care order might be applied for on his or her behalf.  I think this provision should be retained because it offers flexibility.  It is a recognition of modern life that it might not always be appropriate to consult those who represent the child &mdash; the parents etc.  We need to modernise our attitude to the family.</P>

	<P>It has happened time and again &mdash; more frequently in recent times, unfortunately &mdash; that people were afraid to send anyone into the family home or even into a foster home.  People do not like to interfere with the traditional set-up.  We are getting a bit more modern now.  We recognise that children are not necessarily safe from their parents or, in certain instances, from themselves.  The Government is right to reject this amendment and thereby leave this provision in place.  I strongly believe we need to recognise that children&rsquo;s family members are not necessarily always the people who look after them best, unfortunately.</P>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley pointed out that a child might become a flight risk if he or she becomes aware that consideration is being given to an application for a special care order.  We have to understand that the High Court, rather than the HSE, makes special care orders.  That is what this legislation is all about.  Clearly, there are circumstances in which the parent or guardian of a child might be causing the trauma that requires him or her to be brought into special care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that even a guardian <i>ad litem</i>?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  This relates to a pre-court consideration by the HSE.  The appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, which is dealt with later in this legislation, happens when an actual court case is in&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not possible that such a guardian might have been appointed by a previous court?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be quite possible if continuing care applications were being made on foot of previous or outstanding care issues.  I will have to give further consideration to whether such a guardian needs to be included.  I do not think it does.  A person who acts <i>in loco parentis</i> is likely to be a social worker rather than a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it be possible to make it explicit on Report Stage that a guardian <i>ad litem</i> is not contemplated by this section?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider that and try to come back to the Senator in due course.  As I said, the HSE does not make special care orders.  That is done by the High Court.  The proposed section 23F(8) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Where the Health Service Executive applies for a special care order and, in accordance with subsection (4), it did not carry out the consultation referred to in subsection (3), it shall inform the High Court that the consultation was not carried out and of the grounds for not carrying out that consultation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the safeguard.  There is a well-founded understanding that there are circumstances in which there may be reasons not to consult some or all of the individuals listed.  For that reason, I do not propose to accept Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand what Senator O&rsquo;Malley means.  We all accept that the family can be a very dangerous place for a child.  There is no doubt about that.  Equally, information we have received on foot of recent scandals has highlighted that care situations can be dangerous as well.  That is the reality.  Sometimes the resources are not there.  We have seen injustices.  In effect, children in care who may be in quite high-risk situations might not have a social worker assigned to them and may be quite isolated.  I remain concerned about the possible absolute exclusion of anybody other than HSE staff when decisions are being made under this section.  It seems reasonable to consult &ldquo;a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i>&rdquo;, if such a person is available.  I am concerned that this section provides that it might not be &ldquo;in the best interests of the child to consult with all or any of the following persons&rdquo;.  It is a little dangerous and it could be over-used.  If a family welfare conference is not held, I accept that one has to go to the High Court to explain why it was not held.  I think the Minister of State said one has to do the same thing if one excludes all of these people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="994"/>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There is some protection.  I ask the Minister of State to see if it would be possible to build in a consultation with somebody acting <i>in loco parentis</i>, if such a person is available.  It would be worth changing the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposal, whereby the HSE will not have to consult with any person at all, so that it is not so total.  I accept that there may well be circumstances in which there is no one to consult.  We could allow for that as<?oasys _jy ?>well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>This section deals with the determination by the HSE that a child requires special care.  Amendment No. 12, in my name, relates to a similar issue of consultation in the context of a different section, which deals with the functions of the HSE when providing special care.  I am proposing that consultation should be provided for in such circumstances.  I have listened to the comments of Senators and the Minister of State.  Having read this section of the Bill, it seems that it contains a mandatory requirement for consultation.  The basic provision in this section is a mandatory requirement for consultation to take place.  Senator Fitzgerald is seeking to remove a subsection that provides for an exception to the mandatory requirement that there should be consultation.  I think I am right in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I would say there is probably some comfort to be gained, for the purposes of this debate, from the fact that the section we are discussing provides that there must be consultation, before setting out that there are circumstances in which it may be determined that consultation would not be appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the exception to the rule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It sets out the parameters within which that consultation should not take place.  It is very much framed as an exception, rather than a rule.  In those circumstances, I have some sympathy with the argument that this subsection should remain in the Bill</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is doing a much better job of explaining this section than I did.  I should have pointed out at the beginning that the proposed section 23F(3) sets out the rule and the proposed section 23F(4), which Senator Fitzgerald proposes to delete, sets out the exception to the rule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>

	<P>I am glad the Minister of State has said he will give some consideration to the possibility of making it clear that a guardian <i>ad litem</i> is not contemplated by section 23F(4).  I would like to reinforce my support for any examination of whether that is necessary.  I would like to point something out in response to Senator O&rsquo;Malley, whose astute views in these matters I value greatly.  I did say I accepted there were circumstances where the family might be a threat to the child or the guardian, but I was concerned about just two of those four categories, namely, consultation with the child and consultation with the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, in case that was covered.</P><Col N="995"/>
       <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I made a clear statement in another debate about the family and I made the point about the importance of language.  I have just taken part in a recording on RTE where there was reference to the so-called pro-life lobby, and we have let them away with that one.  The self-styled, self-appointed and self-regulated Iona Institute has been described by <i>The Irish Times</i> as pro-family.  The rest of us did not come down from the hot tap in the bath.  We are all part of the family and we are all pro-family, but there are circumstances that can be a danger to the family.  I gave the example of the very tragic recent cases of incest, where both parents were sexually abusing their children.  Only a lunatic would support the behaviour of that family just because it was a family.  I completely accept Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s reservations and the point made by Senator White that these are the exceptions.  Nevertheless, it is appropriate that this House should tease them out.</P>

	<P>This amendment is in accordance with legal advice received on the issue of medical consent.  The Bill allows the HSE to consent to medical assessment, examination and treatment.  It is important that the HSE, when providing special care to a child, has the capacity to consent to medical treatment when it is necessary to do so.  However, the effect of this amendment is that the HSE&rsquo;s right to consent does not affect the validity of any consent which could lawfully be made by any other person, such as a parent, a guardian, a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> or a child in the context of section 3 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.  The substantive law on consent to treatment remains the same.  The only difference is that the HSE will be in a position to consent lawfully in the context of providing special care to a child.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 44, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsections:</P><Col N="996"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Regard shall be had to the views of the child, having regard to the child&rsquo;s age and understanding, prior to taking steps under this section.</P>
        <P LI="2">(3) Regard shall be had to the views of any parent of the child prior to taking steps under this section, and save where such steps are urgent, the court shall give such directions as are appropriate where the Health Service Executive proposes to take steps to which the parents do not consent.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We discussed earlier the issue of consultation where the HSE had to make a determination that a child required special care.  In this section, we are dealing with instances where the child is already in special care.  The extent to which there should be consultation with the child and the parent is the subject matter of these amendments.</P>
        <P>There is a list of things the HSE is required to do under the Bill in these instances.  The list seems to be reasonable and is the sort of thing we would expect from a set of procedures.  The list codifies the regime that should exist.  Our amendment requires that the views of the child who is the subject of the special care order should be taken into account when taking any steps under this section.  This is entirely consistent with the debate we have had on amending the Constitution to provide for enhanced children&rsquo;s rights.  All parties were keen to include a provision in our report that, where practical, the views of the child should be taken into account.  If there are any circumstances in which the views of the child should be taken into account, then it is where the child is subject of a special care order.  The suggestion that the views of the child should be taken into account almost seems to speak for itself.  In case there is concern about the child&rsquo;s age or maturity, we have included a provision that regard shall be had to the child&rsquo;s age and understanding.  If this amendment were accepted, the HSE would be entitled to have regard to the child&rsquo;s maturity and understanding in the circumstances.</P>
        <P>The second pillar is that regard should be had to the views of any parent of the child prior to taking steps under the section.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;regard&rdquo;.  There is no suggestion of a veto or that the views expressed by the parent would have to prevail but that they should be taken into account prior to taking any steps.  Again, to provide comfort to those who feel it might be necessary to take urgent action, there is an exception by the inclusion in the amendment of the wording &ldquo;save where such steps are urgent, the court shall give such directions as are appropriate where the Health Service Executive proposes to take steps to which the parents do not consent&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Representatives of Barnardos made the point to me that where a child is taken into care, we do not want, unwittingly or unnecessarily, to rupture any connection that may still exist between the child and its parent or parents.  There is often a dislocation problem in these situations whereby the child has become removed from its parents and there is a dysfunctional relationship or none at all.  In so far as there is a relationship or the possibility of a future relationship, it is important it is maintained and that no steps be taken that would have the effect of rupturing any fledgling relationship.  In these circumstances, I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This section deals with the functions of the HSE when providing special care.  Once a special care order has been made, it gives the HSE far-reaching powers to carry out various medical or psychiatric assessments, while it also deals with the issue of the passport.</P>
        <P>There is no requirement on the HSE to apply to the court to dispense with parental consent.  These powers would appear to exclude the child&rsquo;s family or a guardian <i>ad litem</i> in a way that could disadvantage the child.  There does not seem to be any right of the child to be heard.  It <Col N="997"/>is important that this should be possible.  Does the Minister of State expect the HSE to consult in the normal way if a guardian <i>ad litem</i> was<i> in situ</i>?  I take it that the guardian <i>ad litem</i> does not go away just because the child is in care.  It seems important therefore not to exclude a requirement to dispense with parental consent in these situations.  It is also important not to exclude the child&rsquo;s family or the guardian <i>ad litem</i> because that could disadvantage the child.  It is similar to some of the discussions we had earlier.  These are cases where the exclusion we discussed earlier does not necessarily apply.  To begin with, there may well have been consultation with the child&rsquo;s family.  It is just that when one is going that step further in terms of treatment, there is no consultation requirement.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to recall that amendment No. 14 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 44, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) Nothing in subsection (1)(d) or (2) shall be construed as making ineffective any consent which would have been effective if those provisions had not been enacted.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Bill allows the HSE to consent and the amendment to which I have just referred allows that other previous, existing consents would not be invalidated.  Therefore, they can co-exist and there is no question of eliminating the consents that would have existed prior to this Bill.  For example, if a parent or child has a right of consent, it would continue to be valid, and would not be invalidated as a result of the previous amendment.  The question of consultation is quite separate to consent, which is a veto.  Consultation is simply having reference to comments that are made by the categories of individuals that are listed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I should draw Members&rsquo; attention to later sections which indicate this has been contemplated.  On pages 57 and 58, section 23NM deals with the provision of information to certain persons.  Subsection (1) states the HSE shall, from time to time during the period for which a special care order has effect, provide a parent having custody of the child with information etc.  Equally, section 23NN states the parent of a child may make an application in writing for information on the care of the child.  Therefore, consultation is ongoing and continues throughout the period of the order, but there is also the issue of consent so that any pre-existing consent, prior to the application of this Bill, will continue to be valid.</P>
        <P>However, there is another issue which Senator Alex White raised in amendment No. 12.  I am inclined to accept the first part of that amendment, which states that &ldquo;Regard shall be had to the views of the child, having regard to the child&rsquo;s age and understanding, prior to taking steps under this section&rdquo;.  I think it is worth inserting that in the Bill.  I will therefore accept that proposal, but I would like to examine the phraseology, as well as detaching it from the second part of the amendment, which I tried to refer to in my original comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for taking on board that proposal.  I have no difficulty with him considering the language involved.  He did not mention the second part of the amendment which states that &ldquo;Regard shall be had to the views of any parent of the child prior to taking steps under this section&rdquo;.  Was the Minister of State including that in his comments on the information point later in the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The second part of the Senator&rsquo;s proposed amendment states that:</P>
        <P LI="1">Regard shall be had to the views of any parent of the child prior to taking steps under this section, and save where such steps are urgent, the court shall give such directions as are <Col N="998"/>appropriate where the Health Service Executive proposes to take steps to which the parents do not consent.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, that consent is implicit in the previous amendment.</P>

	<P>Unfortunately, amendment No. 23 is out of order because there is a potential charge on the Exchequer.  If Senator Fitzgerald wishes to raise a point, however, she can do so under the section.</P></Speaker>
        <P>Amendment No. 23 not moved.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Part of this section deals with the right to representation and the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  We have already raised the point about the voice of the child being heard as regards making a special care order.  There is no automatic right to any representation for the child, either through the guardian <i>ad litem </i>or a solicitor.  The question is whether the child should be provided with an automatic statutory right to representation.  Where the child is old enough then obviously age appropriateness applies.  If they have the competence to instruct a solicitor, should they be entitled to legal representation?  Where the child is not old enough, should a guardian <i>ad litem</i> be appointed to act in the child&rsquo;s best interests?  In addition, should a solicitor represent the child&rsquo;s view to the court and be their court advocate?  Having worked in that area, I have to say the guardian <i>ad litem</i> is a very useful role.  It is in a unique position, which is separate to all the others involved in this decision.</P>
        <P>If it were possible to have this automatic right for the child, either through a guardian <i>ad litem</i> or a solicitor, it would strengthen the Bill.  Children who are subject to special care orders can feel isolated and may see everyone as the enemy.  However, if they feel somebody is representing them who is independent of the HSE or their family, that can be important.  I ask the Minister of State therefore to consider whether he believes the opportunity for the child&rsquo;s voice to be heard should be strengthened by provisions such as these.  The Minister of State <Col N="1000"/>said earlier he was willing to consider part of Senator Alex White&rsquo;s amendment No. 12, which suggests that might also be possible under this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to reinforce what Senator Fitzgerald has said.  I wish to comment, as I did previously, about these kind of rulings.  There may be a situation in which an extra charge is imposed on the Exchequer.  I have raised a situation where I do not think it is appropriate for the Seanad to be precluded in this area.  If we examine the situation confronting us, however, the only way in which a charge could be created on the Exchequer is whereby that in itself reveals that it is not automatic.  That is the only way in which a charge could be created, so we know from the ruling out of the amendment that it is not automatic.  That is the first thing to be established by the procedures of this House.  Second, I have been advised by our distinguished guests from Barnardos in the Gallery that, according to the best figures they can get, not more than 50% of cases have a situation where the guardian <i>ad litem</i> is appointed.  Thus, there is a big gap.  Again, this may be because the figures are not easily available or analysed, but perhaps it is more than that.  Certainly, there is no doubt that it is not obligatory; nor is it in place as the result of a directive from the Minister.  It is important that we extend it, if possible, in order that it would become automatic.  I mention this because I have just been told &mdash; I was pleased to hear it &mdash; that in a recent unreported case Judge Gibbons commented on the guardian <i>ad litem</i> system and stated he was very pleased such a service was available in the State.  He said that if the Seanad had done nothing else except establish this system, which it did about 20 years ago on the basis of an amendment from me and former Senator Brendan Ryan, it would justify its retention.  Those are strong words from a judge and I regret his comments were not reported.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>They have been now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They have and I made damned sure they were.  When we hear people who are practising at judicial level say that this is a valuable and important service provided in the interests of the child by the State, we know we should seek to institute it as far as possible.  Perhaps the Minister of State knows of a reason it is not always good for this service to be provided automatically.  I support the thrust of what Senator Fitzgerald said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question that guardians provide a great service.  In fact, Barnardo&rsquo;s provides almost all of the guardians; therefore, one would expect it to be positive about the provision of the service.  The Senator said guardians <i>ad litem</i> were appointed in 50% of cases, but that is not the case in respect of special care, in which a guardian <i>ad litem</i> is always appointed where an application is made.  In other cases the figure of 50% is probably correct.  The courts have discretion in this regard.</P>
        <P>Judge Gibbons is a distinguished and dedicated judge who has done great work in the area of child care and I agree with his view on guardians.  Last year the Children Acts Advisory Board launched a guidance document on guardians <i>ad litem</i> and we undertook at the time to see how the guidance would work.  In the Ryan report implementation plan I undertook to consult my ministerial colleagues on regulating the area.  One of the unusual aspects is that the HSE pays for guardians <i>ad litem</i> but opposes them in court, in a manner of speaking, although we are trying to achieve a non-adversarial context for special care orders.</P>
        <P>Questions arise as to how the sector will be regulated, where the work will be done and who will pay the guardians.  I am working on these as we speak.  I do not want to make any changes in legislation until I have completed that work.  I indicated I would do this and intend to complete the work as soon as possible, probably within the next couple of months, in order that we can have some indication of where we will be going.  Until such time as I have had an <Col N="1001"/>opportunity to assess the impact of the guidelines which were launched in May last year, I will not be accepting amendments in this regard.  As I said, my information is that in all special care applications children are represented by guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  We are only dealing with special care today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comments.  Clearly, he will consider this issue again when he has had a chance to examine the implications of the report about which he has spoken.  The issue is automatic representation.  I am heartened by the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement that a guardian <i>ad litem</i> is appointed in all special care cases, but the point with regard to the amendment is that while the HSE and parents automatically have expert representation, either through a solicitor or FLAC, there is no automatic right to representation for the child.  The amendment would build in such an automatic right for children.  If it is happening, would it not be a good idea to place it on a statutory footing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>This is one of issues we are considering in our assessment of the implementation of the guidelines on guardians <i>ad litem</i>, not just in the special care area but throughout the sector.  Substantial legislation may be required, or little or none.  This work has been carried out only since May last year.  However, some regulation is definitely required, as is a change in the way guardians are paid in order that unseemly disputes between the HSE and guardians are eliminated.  It is an excellent service and works well.</P>
        <P>The question that follows on from this is whether all guardians need to be legally represented.  If the HSE is legally represented, one would say there should be an automatic entitlement to proportionate legal representation, whether it be a junior counsel, a senior counsel or a solicitor.  Clearly, this would involve a charge on the State and one can see why the amendment has been disallowed by the Bills Office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about a serious situation in which a care order is made against a child.  If this issue is not dealt with pending the resolution of disputes about expenses or other issues that arise, perhaps it should be clarified in advance of the passing of the Bill in order that the Minister of State can make a decision in the legislation about the role of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Perhaps the Department could consider this before the legislation is passed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>It is possible.  We will see how long it takes for the Bill to be passed.  If the Senator&rsquo;s amendments were to be accepted, there would be automatic legal representation in all care applications, not just special care applications.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I understand.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker><Col N="1002"/>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>My apologies.  This is tied in with the previous discussion.  The Minister of State mentioned the fact that there were some issues with regard to guardians <i>ad litem</i> and their expenses.  I tabled this amendment in order that I could ask him to clarify the matter.  The Bill introduces a new subsection (3A) in section 26 of the Child Care Act which allows the HSE to apply for an order for costs from any other party to the proceedings.  If the guardian <i>ad litem</i> is considered to be a party to the proceedings, as is the case under the new Bill, what is the purpose of the subsection?  For example, could a guardian <i>ad litem</i> find himself or herself personally liable?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Bill the objective of the amendment to section 27 of the Child Care Act is to provide the High Court with the power to procure reports on any question affecting the welfare of the child in special care hearings.  The amendment also provides that a guardian <i>ad litem</i> may apply to the court seeking directions to procure a report on any question affecting the welfare of the child.  That right accrues to the guardian <i>ad litem</i> under the Bill.  Therefore, I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 66, before section 22, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;22.&mdash;Section 45 (as amended by the Act of 2004) of the Principal Act is amended by substituting the following section for section 45&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;45.&mdash;(1)(<i>a</i>) Where a child leaves the care of the Health Service Executive, the Executive shall, in accordance with subsection (2), assist him for so long as the Executive is satisfied as to his need for assistance and, subject to paragraph (b), he has not attained the age of 21 years.</P>
        <P LI="2">(b) Where the Health Service Executive is assisting a person in accordance with subsection (2)(b), and that person attains the age of 21 years, the Executive shall continue to provide such assistance until the completion of the course of education in which he is engaged.</P><Col N="1003"/>
        <P LI="2">(2)(a) The Health Service Executive shall assist a person under this section in one or more of the following ways&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) by causing him to be visited or assisted;</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) by arranging for the completion of his education and by contributing towards his maintenance while he is completing his education;</P>
        <P LI="3">(iii) by placing him in a suitable trade, calling or business and paying such fee or sum as may be requisite for that purpose;</P>
        <P LI="3">(iv) by providing a residential aftercare programme for him;</P>
        <P LI="3">(v) by co-operating with housing authorities in planning accommodation for children leaving care on reaching the age of 18 years;</P>
        <P LI="3">(vi) by arranging for any existing or emerging health care needs to be addressed by appropriate qualified persons;</P>
        <P LI="2">(b) For the purposes of this section, the Minister shall prescribe the manner in which aftercare is to be provided by regulation.</P>
        <P LI="2">(3) Any arrangement made by a health board under section 55(4) or (5) of the Health Act, 1953, in force immediately before the commencement of this section shall continue in force as if made under this section.</P>
        <P LI="2">(4) In providing assistance under this section, a health board shall comply with any general directions given by the Minister.</P>
        <P LI="2">(5) For the purposes of this section, the reference in subsection (1)(a) to the care of the Health Service Executive includes special care provided under Part IVA (as amended by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2010).&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Now that this amendment has been moved, I feel secure in the knowledge it has not been ruled out of order.  At the significant risk of cutting off my nose to spite my face, I must say I find it difficult to understand how other amendments have been ruled out of order on the basis that they are a potential charge on Revenue, even though they do not look like they are a potential charge, but that this amendment, which certainly could be a charge on Revenue if it was accepted, which I hope it will, has not been ruled out of order.  There appears to be extraordinary inconsistency applied with regard to the rule about a charge on the Revenue.  In case the Chair changes its mind on this, I will move on quickly.</P>
        <P>There was some discussion on this matter on Second Stage and I feel we are all, including the Minister of State, agreed on the general principle of the importance of aftercare.  This is something that has only emerged in recent years in this debate and it has been put on the agenda very forcefully by organisations such as Barnardos, Focus Ireland and the Irish Association of Young People in Care.  I compliment those organisations, especially Focus Ireland, on the tremendous work they do in this area by pulling together the information and experience and focusing on individuals who find themselves in the kinds of situations we are debating here in a somewhat cold way.  The organisations do tireless work in this area and have pushed us to make changes.  Those of us who have an interest and political responsibility in this area have been pressing the Government to go further than a general commitment to the principle of promoting aftercare and continuing a level of contact and support for people who are no longer in care by virtue of their age.</P><Col N="1004"/>
        <P>What we want to do through this amendment is to put that commitment into statutory form through legislation in order that we can then rely on the fact that it will be delivered and that controls will be put in place to ensure standards and parameters are applied with regard to what aftercare means, how it will apply, whether it will have a residential component and whether it will include assisting with employment, education, health care needs and all the other holistic areas and issues that should be taken into account for anybody who has been in care and who now faces the world without being in a secure placement.</P>
        <P>What we have in mind with regard to the components of an aftercare service or commitment on the part of the State are set out in some detail in our amendment.  The amendment is self-explanatory and I do not have to persuade the Minister of State or anybody else present of the importance of the principle behind it.  What we seek is to carve this into legislation to ensure it is made into a real and robust commitment on the part of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator White.  It is absolute madness and legislative lunacy to allow this amendment be put forward, although we are all glad it has been allowed.  Subsection (2)(<i>a</i>)(iii) states: &ldquo;by placing him in a suitable trade, calling or business and paying such fee or sum as may be requisite for that purpose&rdquo;.  God almighty, if that does not clearly spell it out that we are creating a charge on the Exchequer, nothing else could.  It is obvious a charge is created and allowing the amendment be proposed highlights the absurdity of what happens here.  I hope this reaffirms my colleagues on the need to bring this issue to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges again.</P>
        <P>This issue also gives rise to another matter and causes one to wonder why there was no objection to the amendment.  In other words, are only certain amendments objected to on this ground and is the creation of a charge on the Exchequer used for political purposes because the Department does not particularly like someone?  Does the Department sometimes agree to let it through, even if it creates a charge on the Exchequer?  The situation seems daft.  We could not possibly have a better example of the situation than Senator White&rsquo;s amendment which clearly specifies that money shall be paid.  If the Minister of State can put forward a situation where this amendment does not create a charge on the Exchequer, I suggest that knowledge and wisdom should be passed on immediately to the board, directors and chief executive of NAMA, because that would solve the whole problem there.  We could squiff away all the billions we liked and not create a charge on the Exchequer.  It would cost nothing.  That is wonderful.  It is magic.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 27, in my name, suggests replacing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and, like Senator White&rsquo;s amendment, deals with the issue of aftercare.  Aftercare is very important because there must be follow through for people.  It is inhuman to contemplate a situation where young people, having suffered a period of distress and having been rehabilitated and helped feel better about themselves, are then dumped out into the world without any transition period.  People would not be happy to do that to their own children and it is an issue we need to examine.  I understand the Minister of State has given an assurance this will take place and stated it is virtually implicit in the Bill.  Does a directive to the HSE in this regard exist?  Various groups have tried to ascertain from the HSE whether there is a directive but they have been unable to get that information.  Will the Minister of State tell the House whether there is such a directive?  It would require a directive from him to ensure this provision is consistently applied.  Is there such a directive and, if not, will he commit to making such a directive?  We would all be satisfied with that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1005"/>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The key question is whether aftercare for young people who have been in care should be provided for on a statutory basis.  Obviously, there are responsibilities in this regard but too often in the past, once a young person had reached 18 years, that was the end of the responsibility.  We know there has been significant informal contact between children who, for example, left children&rsquo;s homes or other facilities.  Such contact should be more comprehensive than this.  The question is how we can achieve that.  Clearly, there are financial implications.  Senator Norris was correct.  It is extraordinary that Senator White&rsquo;s amendment, which is very comprehensive and inclusive, has been allowed despite the significant costs associated with it.  If the State is to provide aftercare costs, as it should, there are financial implications.</P>
        <P>This is a question of how we can implement the provision of aftercare.  I believe that if the State has had a child in care, its obligation does not finish when the child reaches 18.  To highlight the point made by Senator Norris, we must consider what the obligations are currently and how the situation is handled on the ground.  Is there a directive in place to ensure as many resources as feasible are in place for young people who still need help?  Would the Minister of State consider placing this on some form of statutory footing?  That is what we are seeking to do in our amendments.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the organisations involved.  Young people in care had no voice for a long period.  No one listened to them and they were neither represented nor organised.  However, in recent years there has been a complete change in recent years, which is to be welcomed.  Those to whom I refer now have a voice and they have been extremely forthright in outlining their needs.  What we are trying to do is clarify what are the current obligations and discover whether the Minister of State is considering placing this on a statutory basis, whether in this legislation or elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senators indicated, this matter has, as a result, in part, of a campaign run by Focus Ireland and other organisations, given rise to a great deal of debate and analysis.  Section 45 of the Child Care Act states the HSE may assist a person for as long as it is satisfied that there is a need for such assistance.  The discussion in which we are engaged focuses on whether an obligation to provide aftercare is created in circumstances where the HSE forms the view that there is a need for assistance.  As stated on previous occasions, where a view is formed that assistance is required, there is an obligation to provide aftercare.  Therefore, it is not merely facilitative, it is mandatory where a need is identified.  It is clear that not every child in care will require aftercare but there are those who do.</P>
        <P>We are trying to grapple with how the section should be interpreted and whether legislative change will be required.  That is why Senator Alex White&rsquo;s proposed amendment was accepted.  If it is an obligation that arises on foot of an assessment to the effect that there is a need, it is clear that nothing will be changed by using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  We show a distinct lack of faith in the staff of the Bills Office by suggesting they might not have noticed this or are simply asleep at the wheel.  We have had a discussion with them about whether, depending on the interpretation of the existing section, substituting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; might result in a charge on the Exchequer.  In many senses, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; implies an obligation.</P>
        <P>As stated previously, under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, local authorities were obliged to provide adequate accommodation for Travellers, even though the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was used in the relevant section which was challenged in the High Court on a number of occasions.  Various items of jurisprudence will show that the relevant section was interpreted by the High Court as meaning that local authorities were obliged to provide accommodation in circumstances where none was available.</P>
        <P>The legislation before us is at the cutting edge with regard to how we mind children in care.  Those who require some help after they leave care are the most vulnerable and they are not <Col N="1006"/>in the majority.  Most children who leave foster care do not require aftercare.  However, those who leave residential care do.  Bearing in mind that there are approximately 5,500 children in care, only a small number will require aftercare.  Even if additional resources are required, from a policy point of view, we must tackle this issue.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The lesson we learned from the Ryan and Murphy reports is that children who were in care went on to have difficulties relating to addiction, the criminal justice system, family breakdown and many other issues.  There are still children in care who continue to emerge from it without proper provision being made in respect of them.  That is not good enough.  The HSE has indicated that it wants to expand its aftercare facilities.  We carried out an audit of such facilities throughout the country and it emerged that the provision of aftercare was remarkably inconsistent.  A post code lottery more or less obtains in respect of whether people will obtain services.</P>
        <P>I am determined that we will fashion some change.  The Bill is the only mechanism by which such a change might be introduced in the near future.  Unfortunately, it deals with special care.  It is slightly untidy to introduce amendments relating to all children in care to legislation designed to deal with those in special care.  However, this is the only opportunity we will have to alter the position.</P>
        <P>I am giving the matter serious consideration.  I am not in a position to accept amendments today, particularly in view of the fact that we are involved in ongoing discussions.  A change in policy will be required which will require consideration on the part of the Government.  It is crucial that we respond to the amendments tabled by Senators Alex White, Fitzgerald and Norris.  I do not know what our response will be but we will be returning to the matter.</P>

	<P>What the Minister of State said was extremely helpful.  I warmly welcome his comments.  As demonstrated previously, he has taken an extremely responsible approach to this matter.  On the basis of what he said, I do not intend to press the amendment in my name.  I hope it will prompt a further evaluation of what might be the future possibilities and options in this important area.  I thank the Minister of State for his remarks.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cost involved, I made no comment about the Bills Office.  I do not want anyone to believe I took a shot or had a cut at that office.  Those who work in it are highly professional and I have no difficulty with them.  My problem relates to how business is ordered in the House.  The relevant Standing Order refers to amendments which impose a charge may not be moved except by way of Government amendment.  That is a matter for an order of the House, not one for decision on the basis of advice given by professionals in the Bills Office who do an excellent job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not cause me any bother to take a shot at the Bills Office if I felt like so doing.  I do not believe the staff of that office merit my taking a shot at them.  However, if they did, I would certainly not be afraid to take my shot.  The Minister of State can obfuscate matters as much as he likes but I have no doubt that a clear conflict arises.  Anyone considering the matter would be aware of that fact.</P>
        <P>Perhaps it was an oversight, but the Minister of State did not answer the two specific questions I put to him.  The first relates to whether there is a directive to the HSE which stipulates that aftercare should be provided, while the second is whether the Minister of State will issue such a directive if one has not already been given.</P>

	<P>The Ryan report implementation plan states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The provision of aftercare by the HSE should form an integral part of care delivery for children who have been in the care of the State.  It should not be seen as a discretionary service or as a once-off event that occurs on a young person&rsquo;s 18th birthday.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The implementation plan also makes a number of recommendations in respect of aftercare and states the HSE &ldquo;will ensure the provision of aftercare services for children leaving care in all instances where the professional judgment of the allocated social worker determines it is required&rdquo;.  It makes further recommendations in respect of research and longitudinal studies.  A directive is, therefore, in place.</P>
        <P>As stated, we carried out an audit of aftercare services and discovered that their provision throughout the country was inconsistent.  The one thing over which the Houses have control is legislation.  In such circumstances we should not leave matters open to interpretation but rather should spell out exactly what we believe should be the case.</P>
        <P>In his Budget Statement in December the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced, as part of the funding related to the Ryan report implementation plan, that an additional &euro;1 million would be set aside for aftercare in 2010.  That is a mark of the Government&rsquo;s commitment.</P>

        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is0p11- ?><?oasys _ix ?>calls on Government to immediately instruct the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to carry out a thorough investigation into the Lost at Sea Report.</P>
        <P>I join the Acting Chairman in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Connick.  It is not his first occasion to be here but it is his first occasion to debate across the floor from us and I wish him well in his new appointment.  He has come here to respond to an important Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; motion, supported by many of our Opposition colleagues, concerning the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on the lost at sea scheme and the role, function and status of the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>I commence my remarks by quoting a concluding comment made by the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, in her report of December 2009:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Office of the Ombudsman relies on the authority which comes from its independence, impartiality and competence to gain fair play for people who have been wronged by public bodies.  As Ombudsman I do not make binding decisions.  The Department is free in law to reject my recommendations.  My only recourse, when I consider that a public body&rsquo;s response to a recommendation is unsatisfactory, is to make a special report to each House of the Oireachtas under the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  This is such a report.</P>
        <P LI="1">I respectfully ask the Houses to consider my report and to take whatever action they deem appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a very significant statement from the Ombudsman.  We request the Minister of State and his Government colleagues to allow the report on the lost at sea scheme to go before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for full debate and deliberation.  This matter was previously discussed in the Seanad, the other House and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  At the pertinent meeting of that committee a motion was submitted in the names of some of the Fine Gael and Labour Party Oireachtas Members requesting the committee to investigate fully the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on the lost at sea scheme.  However, that motion was defeated by the Government majority on the committee.  The committee met again today and very significant correspondence which had been received was presented to us.  This was a letter from Deputy Sargent in which he stated to the Chairman:</P>
        <P LI="1">I write to say I would support an invitation being extended to the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, to attend and discuss the comprehensive Special Report prepared by her Office regarding the &ldquo;Lost at Sea Scheme&rdquo; with your Committee.  From her public statements, I feel sure the Ombudsman would welcome such an invitation.  The Office of Ombudsman rarely feels it necessary to make such statements.  Accordingly, I believe that issuing an invitation to attend the Committee would reflect well on the integrity of the Office of Ombudsman and the Oireachtas.  I thank you for your consideration of this matter.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This was a significant intervention from Deputy Sargent and the Green Party component of the Government.  Perhaps as a result of that and of this motion being put before the Seanad, we were informed at this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that an invitation was due to issue to the Ombudsman to present her case before it.</P>
        <P>I welcome this degree of progress but in this motion we are calling for the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to carry out a thorough investigation into the report on the lost at sea scheme.  Obviously, the attendance and co-operation of the Ombudsman would be integral to that investigation but if the investigation were to be deemed worthy of the word it would also require the appropriate personnel involved in the scheme at official <Col N="1010"/>level, at political level via the office of the former Minister, the complainant and others to come before it not simply to make statements but to take questions and engage in frank and open dialogue with us.</P>
        <P>I want to make it very clear that in moving this motion we on this side of the House aim to be neither judge nor jury.  The Ombudsman has produced a comprehensive report.  As the Minister of State is aware, this is only the second time in the history of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office or, to put it more dramatically, the history of the State that such a special report has been presented before the Oireachtas and Members must take note of its significance.  It is not the role of Members to be the final jury or judge but to ensure the report is examined in minute detail and that the serious questions posed in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report are answered fully.  Moreover, the former Minister, Deputy Fahey, who has frequently claimed on radio to have been vindicated by the report, although many disagree, and who appears to stand over fully the decisions he took must have his case presented before and debated with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Similarly, all concerned must be heard and interviewed before the joint committee and I hope progress can be made.  This is the reason the wording of Fine Gael&rsquo;s motion is deliberate and careful.  It seeks a full examination of the report and that a thorough investigation be undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is aware of the tragic background to this case.  In October 1981 a fishing vessel sank with the tragic loss of five lives.  The history of this tragedy has been well documented and many Members have met family members of the tragic drowning victims.  The Byrne family, in particular, which brought the complaint obviously was greatly affected by the loss of two family members, namely, a father and son.  The remaining family members who have had a difficult time financially and in all aspects of life subsequently presented their case before the Ombudsman who submitted the report to the Oireachtas.  This is a substantial matter of concern, public policy and political decision-making.  It has been given a thorough, detailed and fair examination by the Ombudsman in her report.  She is entitled, as she noted at the outset of her presentation, to make findings and, where she considers that such findings are not being responded to adequately by whatever is the appropriate Department, to follow up with her inquiries and make a special report.  That is the reason the report is before Members.</P>
        <P>The country has been well served by the Office of the Ombudsman since it was first created many years ago.  If memory serves correctly, the first person appointed to be Ombudsman was Mr. Michael Mills.  Across all Departments, many investigations have been conducted and many individual queries, concerns and worries have been addressed and, in many cases, redressed.  Government policies have been changed and legislation has been amended on foot of thorough investigative work by the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>The report pertains to one individual scheme.  As the Minister of State is aware, the complainant had grave concerns that a particular scheme was designated and almost ring-fenced to suit a small number of applicants.  I do not use the word &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; because Members are neither judge nor jury but there certainly is a substantial body of opinion to suggest all was not well with the aforementioned scheme and the decisions taken and exclusions made.  This pertains to taxpayers&rsquo; money, Government decisions and families that were adversely affected.  It relates to families whose way of life, income and family members literally disappeared.  This is the reason Members must ensure the concerns outlined by the Ombudsman and contained in her report are not simply left on the shelves of the Oireachtas Library but are fully and thoroughly investigated.  I ask my colleagues across the floor of the Chamber why anyone should fear the asking of questions or the provision of information.  Why should anyone fear giving the opportunity to all those affected, on both sides of the argument, to come before the <Col N="1011"/>Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to state their cases, take questions and highlight their views, arguments and concerns?</P>
        <P>The joint committee is the most appropriate venue in which to pursue and I hope finalise the work commenced by the Ombudsman in her report.  She recommended that a particular sum of money be paid to the Byrne family but this appears to have been rejected by the Government to date.  However, I hope that, on foot of what appear to be second thoughts on the part of the Green Party in particular which presumably led in a small way to the mini-U-turn of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food today, the report can be investigated in the thorough fashion it deserves.  As a member of the aforementioned joint committee, I believe all of its members would be willing to examine the report in a neutral fashion without prejudging the outcome and accept this is a personal report by the Ombudsman and that others may have alternate views.</P>
        <P>While the joint committee&rsquo;s members will listen to their views and presentations, they cannot afford to sweep the report under the carpet or state that, while they acknowledge the Ombudsman has made serious allegations about the workings of a particular scheme, they intend to do no more about it.  For politics to be well served, the Office of the Ombudsman to be respected, the role of the Oireachtas in holding the Executive to account to be upheld and the role of Oireachtas committees to be enhanced, respected and used to the full, it requires at a minimum that the report should be placed before the aforementioned joint committee.  Moreover, this should not take the form of a simple presentation by the Ombudsman but should allow for a full debate and investigation with all the affected parties concerned.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should listen favourably to Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal which constitutes a fair and balanced approach to the report.  Members are not here to condemn but to try to shed light on this tragic scenario, as well as on the political and administrative decisions taken which have caused and continue to cause such distress to so many.  Moreover, the proposed amendment tabled by Government Members, if it remains the official position, does not constitute a sufficient response.  The holding of a full investigation by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should be supported by everyone who is genuinely concerned about bringing this tragic case to a conclusion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.</P>
        <P>Statements were made in the House previously on the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on the lost at sea scheme.  In the contribution made by the former Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, he clearly pointed out that &ldquo;eligible applicants were those who had lost a fishing vessel between 1980 and the establishment of the sea fishing boat register in 1990, but who had been unable to replace the fishing vessel for verified financial reasons.&rdquo;  A superficial understanding of this case might lead one to conclude that this sounds relatively straightforward.  One might conclude that a scheme was set up for boats lost between 1980 and 1990, to which anyone who wished to so do could apply and that the applicant in the case under discussion did so one year after the closing date and that a report was produced by the Ombudsman who found in favour of the applicant.  If asked what was the likely outcome, one would have been likely to suggest the Ombudsman would find the application had been made outside the time limit, that it had been too late and that the applicants had been given plenty of time in which to apply.  For most, this is what a superficial understanding of the report would suggest.  However, for the first time, the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, has proposed that it be referred for a full debate in the Oireachtas.  Consequently, if this is how the Ombudsman feels about the report, one might conclude there must be something to it.  When one hears that the Government has tried to block discussion on the report at a committee, one really starts to become concerned about <Col N="1012"/>what is going on.  When the Minister of State responds, he must clarify why the Government is blocking our motion.</P>
        <P>The debate on 18 February was a good and open discussion on this issue,.  It was kept below the political radar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the report, no strong political attacks were made on anyone.  Instead, it was a question of asking for an examination of the matter and for some straightforward answers.</P>
        <P>The more the Government tries to block discussion, the more suspicious I get about the report&rsquo;s background and what it is the Government is afraid of.  Objecting to something this strongly means the Government is afraid to have the type of to and fro discussion on a report seen at committees.  This worries me.  Concerns might have been raised about the luck of the successful applicants, two of whom got a large tranche of the tonnage handed out by the scheme, but discussions of that type occur.  However, when the Ombudsman raises concerns about the way in which the scheme was established and administered, we need a deep discussion if we are to fulfil our roles as Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>This is probably the new Minister of State&rsquo;s first opportunity to get involved in a meaty issue in his Department.  Perhaps it is an opportunity for him to put his stamp on the matter and to support a call for a full debate on the reason so many concerns have been raised by the Ombudsman and the question of why the Government is afraid to answer them.</P>
        <P>Our previous debate on the issue was not emotive.  No one tried to claim the Government was the big bad wolf or that it was hammering down, so to speak, some poor, unfortunate family.  The circumstances had been pointed out and we avoided being overly emotional and overly political because most Senators wanted straightforward answers.  We are seeking the same today.  Why does the Government object so much to the discussion of this issue in a public forum?  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food voted to block a discussion.  I have sat on other Oireachtas committees and there is usually a political aspect to a vote that is called to block a discussion of a document.  However, when the Government calls a vote to obstruct a public debate on a report of the Ombudsman, do the Senators opposite not view it as a serious issue?  In light of concepts like democracy, transparency, openness and accountability to the people, I would have concerns about a Government party that called such a vote.  It is not important that Senators might wish to say outside the House that they are favourably disposed towards a debate.  Instead, they should exercise their power to call for the debate.  We will revert to this issue repeatedly until the Government starts giving satisfactory answers.  Clearly, there is a reason it is not prepared to discuss the report fully.  We want straightforward answers.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State has read the report and the previous debates on this issue, that he has noted the concerns raised and that he will respond to them.  He should not give us the reheated speech the then Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, gave on 18 February.  The Minister of State should not take issue with the same two points.  Neither should he tell the House that certain matters are not relevant.  I do not want to rehearse my speech.  I raised an issue about a fisherman in County Wexford that I am sure would be of greater concern to the Minister of State, but I will not discuss it again.  I hope he will not insult the intelligence of the House by providing a reheated speech.  My memory might not be great, but I can remember most of what was said on 18 February.  Some good points were raised and I hope the Minister of State has read the contributions which were made only a few short weeks ago.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s <Col N="1013"/>response should supply straightforward answers.  Otherwise, he will develop a habit of returning to the House to answer questions on the report.</P>

	<P>I will cite some facts, although I am sure the Minister of State will reiterate them.  The lost at sea scheme was a limited scheme introduced in June 2001 with a closing date for applications of 31 December.  It must be remembered that the scheme was specifically targeted at people who had been fishing and wanted to continue fishing.  It is also important to remember it was a time-limited scheme intended to assist families in obtaining a replacement for a lost vessel owned and skippered by the applicant or an immediate relation.  The objective was to allow fishermen or their immediate families, including women, involved in fishing to return to fishing and not, as some inside the Houses have been led to believe, to award any monetary benefit.  The then Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, made this point numerous times when he spoke in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Any person or group of people wishing to return to a career in fishing would need to buy a replacement vessel with the necessary capacity that, in time, would have become a valuable commodity, since the overall capacity of the Irish fleet was capped under EU management rules.  The scheme, when introduced, was both opposed and supported within the industry.  Opinion was divided because some considered it would be unfair to award free tonnage to some, while others had to pay a high price for theirs.  I reiterate the point made previously that it was important to ensure the scheme could be strictly limited to those who met the necessary criteria.  Once the decision to have a scheme was made, the terms and conditions that emerged had to reflect the views of all stakeholders, national legislation and any appropriate EU rules.  The conditions were objective and difficult to meet.  They were intended to ensure that only those who met the criteria in full would be successful, that only the immediate family could benefit from any capacity awarded, that the benefit of capacity for the scheme was to allow the family to return to finishing and that the capacity awarded could not be sold or turned into a monetary amount, as can happen in other schemes.</P>
        <P>The scheme was focused on those who had been in the fishing industry and wanted to continue a family tradition of fishing and where the grant of capacity would enable the applicant or an immediate relation to return to fishing. The advertising was successful and the scheme, despite its tight restrictions, was well responded to.  Some 68 applications were made, of which six were successful.   The scheme was widely advertised in the major fishing manuals, including <i>The Marine Times</i>, <i>Irish Skipper</i> and <i>Fishing News</i>.  The 62 unsuccessful applications failed to meet one or more of the qualifying conditions.  I reiterate the point that the scheme did not provide for the purchase of a replacement fishing vessel.</P>
        <P>I noted when re-reading the report during the past few days, in order that I would be fully briefed for this debate, that in November 2004 the son of the owner who had been lost at sea with his vessel had complained to the Ombudsman on two grounds.  His family had not been made aware of the scheme&rsquo;s existence and their circumstances were such that they ought to have qualified under the scheme in the first instance.  It is a fundamental legal rule that ignorance of the law is no defence.  Sadly, this same principle applies to the scheme.  Following <Col N="1015"/>exhaustive examination and correspondence between the various parties, the Ombudsman found in her first report for the complainant.  This appears to be at odds with the view of the Department of Agricultur, Fisheries and Food.  The Ombudsman concluded that the particular family did not meet at least two of the conditions of the scheme and that advertisement of the scheme was not adequate, despite it having been advertised in the three major fishing publications in Ireland, which seems odd.  Also, the fishermen&rsquo;s representative organisations were notified of its existence and had communicated the information to the 16 known cases, which appears to be the most appropriate approach in the circumstances.</P>
        <P>As public representatives &mdash; I am a new public representative &mdash; we are aware of the considerations which must be met when we examine various schemes.  The Ombudsman has expressly acknowledged that she as found no evidence to suggest the scheme, once launched, was not applied fairly and equally.  The compensation figure of almost &euro;250,000 recommended by the Ombudsman was, as pointed out by the Minister of State, arrived at using the rates used in the 2008 decommissioning scheme, which is a totally different and separate scheme.  It seems odd that such a scheme would be used to calculate this figure.</P>
        <P>Deadlines are a fundamental feature of most schemes and need to be strictly enforced and adhered to.  Transparency is the key. That is what we all want to see.  No one wants to see schemes used as political footballs.  When criteria and deadlines are put in place, they must be adhered to and applied.</P>
        <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his Ministry.  I have no doubt he will make a significant input to it.</P>
        <P>I have been involved with this legislation since it was presented as a Bill and have seen it changed time and again.  My interest in the issue is not driven by the actual events as much as by the way we are processing the matter.  The Government amendment is the most ridiculous I have seen in a long time.  Every week in this and the other House we refer matters to committees.  It is part of what we do.  Instead of having a matter dealt with in plenary session of the Houses it is more efficient to have it dealt with by a committee.  We are now acknowledging that the further consideration of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s special report by an Oireachtas committee is a matter for that committee.  It may well be, but that is no reason we cannot refer it to a committee.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that it is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas and their committees to order their business, but we send them stuff every week.  Nothing has more of a precedent than what is being proposed.</P>
        <P>I will not get involved in the politics of the matter.  When it was last debated in the Chamber, there was, equally, no mention of politics.  It is not an issue for me whether someone did right or wrong.  For me, the issue is that a process has been put in place to solve these issues.  In this case, the process finished with the Ombudsman.  It is interesting to look at how these things happen.  Someone who runs into a difficulty with a Department appeals the Department&rsquo;s decision and when the person fails to receive satisfaction, the matter may be referred to the Ombudsman.  In the case we are dealing with the Ombudsman came to a conclusion and made a recommendation to a Department.  The Department concerned decided not to implement the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>
        <P>Certain issues then arose and they involve a former Minister, with whom I have discussed the matter on a number of occasions.  If it is found that a mistake was made in a Department, <Col N="1016"/>that is not, necessarily, a reflection on anyone.  Mistakes can be made.  The points made by Senators on the Government side are not an issue for me.  I know there are deadlines and that they must be kept.  If I were managing a scheme, I would be very strict in that regard and slow to extend a deadline.  Someone else might take a different view and that someone might be the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>Closure is not possible in this regard.  What happens when a Department refuses to implement an Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendation?  Having considered the reasons for its refusal and not accepted them, the Ombudsman can refer the matter to the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  That is included in the legislation and very clear.  However, what happens next?  The answer is nothing.  There is a vacuum in the legislation.  There is a legislative error, for which we must take responsibility.  We may insist that an Ombudsman&rsquo;s report must always be implemented but I would not be keen on that course.  My own view is that we should have a system under which the D&aacute;il, the Seanad or a joint committee would have the power to bring a matter to finality and closure.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment is an attempt to stop debate on the issue.  That cannot be right.  I am happy to have cited the letter from Deputy Sargent who has written to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to say he considers it would be useful to invite the Ombudsman to make a presentation to the joint committee.  That is a significant step forward.  I ask the Government to listen to this suggestion.  Rather than put the matter to a vote tonight and create widespread embarrassment, let the matter go before the joint committee to be dealt with in a non-partisan way.  If people play political football with the matter, it is as clear as day what the result will be.  I do not want this to be used to have a go at the former Minister.  He may be right or he may be wrong.  He may or may not have made a mistake.  This is above and beyond that.  The issue is how we deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>This is not the first time such a thing has happened.  To my limited knowledge, it happened at least twice before because I was involved on two occasions.  One case was dealt with by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  That case was dealt with twice.  The previous Ombudsman outlined his views on the case.  Therefore, what is proposed in this respect has happened previously.  A precedent is not being established in terms of what is sought.  The last time what is sought happened was at the invitation of the committee concerned.  There is no reason that could not happen in this case.</P>
        <P>The last time what is proposed happened, the committee concerned examined the matter.  The matter in question is not important in this context.  It related to a person in an area close to the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency across the border in south Kilkenny.  The person had an issue with the Revenue Commissioners.  Having examined the case, the committee, unanimously as I recall, came to the conclusion that the then Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations should be implemented.  The committee called in officials of the Revenue Commissioners and told them that they wanted them to implement the recommendations.  They listened to the committee but they did not do that.  It is daft that this could happen.  I am not saying that we as public representatives should be able to call the shots in all situations.  That type of thing happens but we should have a way to bring closure to a situation such as this.  It is not a matter of blocking something.  We are not creating a precedent.  We have the view of the Green Party member of the committee, we understand the legislation concerned and, effectively, what is being attempted here is to stop this issue proceeding at this point.  Why should that be done?  If this is an issue that needs to be brought to a conclusion, we should bring it to whatever is the appropriate conclusion and let that be the end of the matter.</P>
        <P>Even if this matter is passed to the joint committee and it decides to implement the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendation, the matters will be sent back to the Department.  The joint <Col N="1017"/>committee does not have power to insist that the Department implements the committee&rsquo;s recommendation.  If the result were to be the same in this case, that would be the third time that committees of Parliament would have dealt with matters, come to the same conclusion on them as the Ombudsman and the recommendations in the cases were not implemented, or if the committee were to come to the conclusion that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendation was not to be implemented and it disagreed with the Ombudsman, the situation would still be unfinished.  We need to examine this area.  I ask those on the Government side to recognise that a former Leader of the Green Party, Deputy Trevor Sargent, indicated clearly that it is his view that it would be helpful and useful for the Ombudsman to appear before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Why can the Government not accept that proposal and let that be the end of the matter?  It should accept this motion and bring this matter to a conclusion.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will note that I have not gone into the detail of the issue as I do not want to get involved in the case.  I have read about it and have views on it.  However, I specifically want to point out a weakness in the procedure in the legislation and to highlight that we have unfinished business.  A citizen can go through all the hoops required under legislation and we can still not bring the matter concerned to finality.</P>
        <P>People will never be completely happy with the outcome of matters that are dealt with.  I am not trying to talk somebody into agreeing or disagreeing with the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman is well able to look after her own argumentation and she will put her case to the joint committee and give both sides of the argument, as she would always do, and then the committee can come to a conclusion.  All I ask my colleagues on both sides of the House is note that this not about putting a Minister in the dock.  That is not what this should be about as far as we are concerned.  This motion is about examining a procedure and the Ombudsman&rsquo;s views on the matter, how she weighed it up and for a committee to come to the conclusion to agree or disagree with that.  It does not mean she is right nor does it mean she is wrong.  It does not necessarily mean the Minister is guilty of some appalling crime if the Ombudsman finds differently.  We should take the Minister out of the process, deal with the matter and bring it to a conclusion.  I would prefer if it were dealt with in a committee than in either of the Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank those Senators who have spoken so far for their contributions and I understand more Senators will contribute.  I thank the Senators who gave me their best wishes on what is my first occasion to address the Seanad.  I look forward to a long working relationship with Members on all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>On 14 December last the Ombudsman submitted a special report to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in accordance with section 6(5) and 6(7) of the Ombudsman Act 1980.  The Ombudsman took this action because the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food disagreed with the findings and recommendations she made arising from her investigation of a complaint from an unsuccessful applicant under the lost at sea scheme of 2001.  The 1980 Act does not set out a procedure to be adopted by the Oireachtas in dealing with this matter and therefore we are all in uncharted territory in that regard.  The one previous instance in which an Ombudsman made a special report to the Oireachtas was a completely different type of case which affected a particular group of taxpayers.</P>
        <P>I echo my predecessor, now the Minister for Defence, Deputy Tony Killeen, in placing on record my respect for the Ombudsman and the work done by her office.  It is clear that she and her team have carried out a detailed and forensic examination of the complaint in question and although I disagree with her findings, I compliment her and her team on the time and effort that has been put into compiling this report.  I also place on record my deepest sympathy <Col N="1018"/>for the family in question and the very many families bereaved in this way, some of them among the other applicants under the scheme.  My own county of Wexford, which also has a strong fishing tradition, has seen many such sad events, even in recent years.</P>
        <P>The background to the lost at sea scheme has been set out already in this House in some detail by my predecessor and therefore I will refer only briefly to the conditions of the scheme, the context in which it was promulgated and the outcomes of the applications received.  I will then explain the reason the Department does not agree with the Ombudsman&rsquo;s findings and her recommendation that monetary compensation be paid in this case.  The scheme was initiated within the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  Responsibility subsequently moved to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in 2002.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food only assumed responsibility for sea fisheries related matters in October 2007.</P>
        <P>The lost at sea scheme was a limited scheme introduced in June 2001, with a closing date of 31 December 2001, whose objective was to enable qualifying applicants who were otherwise unable to do so for financial or related reasons to continue a family tradition of sea fishing.  This scheme was targeted at people who had been and wanted to continue fishing.  It was a bounded, time-limited scheme under which replacement capacity, that is, gross tonnes and kilowatts, that would otherwise have had to be bought on the tonnage market was provided free of charge to qualifying applicants.  The eligible applicants were those who had lost a fishing vessel between 1980 and the establishment of the fishing boat register in 1990 but who had been unable to replace the fishing vessel for verified financial reasons.  The scheme was intended to assist families in introducing a replacement for the lost vessel that would be owned and skippered by the applicant or by an immediate relation of the applicant.  The objective of the scheme was to allow fishermen or their immediate family to get back fishing.  It was not introduced to provide a means whereby a family who tragically lost family members at sea could obtain payment from the State for this loss.</P>
        <P>For the information of the House, &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; is a term used to describe the gross tonnes, GT, a measure of volume, and kilowatts, kWs, of power of a fishing vessel.  The total capacity of the Irish fishing fleet is limited to 88,700 gross tonnes and 244,834 kilowatts under EU Regulation 1438/2003.</P>
        <P>When the new sea fishing boat register was introduced in 1990, all vessels registered at the time were awarded the capacity of their vessels effectively free of charge.  However, any vessel that had previously sunk or had otherwise been destroyed clearly could not be registered.  Any such owner seeking to return to fishing would have had to buy a replacement vessel and the necessary capacity, which over time became a valuable commodity because the overall capacity of the Irish fleet was capped under EU fleet management rules to which I have already referred.  While the Department had no role in the tonnage market that had developed, there were indications that capacity was changing hands for up to &pound;4,000 per gross tonne at the time the scheme was introduced.</P>
        <P>Records in the Department and made available to the Ombudsman show a range of contacts, meetings and correspondence going back to March 1999 between interested parties on this issue.  These contacts included public representatives, individual vessel owners, fishermen&rsquo;s representatives and producer organisations.  It was being argued that there were a number of cases where the cost of purchasing replacement capacity was a factor in preventing families from getting back into fishing after losing a vessel.  The records also show that there was both support for and opposition to such a scheme from within the industry and that officials from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources advised on the merits or otherwise of such a scheme and some of its conditions.  Opinion was divided within the fishing industry.  From the adminis<Col N="1019"/>trative perspective it was important to ensure any such scheme could be strictly limited to those who met the criteria of the scheme.  Once the decision to have a scheme was made, the terms and conditions of the scheme that emerged from this process would necessarily have reflected the views of all the stakeholders as well as public policy considerations and EU and national legal requirements at the time.</P>
        <P>The scheme, as published, included among its conditions that:</P>
        <P LI="1">The boat in question is shown, by reference to log sheet returns or other appropriate records, to have been in active and continuous use for a considerable period of years by the person concerned for sea fishing of a category now covered by the replacement policy rules, until its loss at sea.  Applications under the scheme must be received by 31 December 2001.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These conditions were intended to ensure only those who met the criteria in full were successful, that only the immediate family could benefit from any capacity awarded and that the benefit of capacity for the scheme was to allow the family to return to fishing and that the capacity awarded could not be sold or turned into a monetary amount.</P>
        <P>The scheme was launched in June 2001 with a closing date of 31 December 2001.  The Department had knowledge of 16 cases at the time where fishing vessels had been lost at sea during the relevant period and the owners of those vessels received written notifications of the new scheme and were invited to apply.  Two of these cases were ultimately successful.  The scheme was intended for those who had been in the fishing industry, wanted to continue a family tradition of fishing and where the grant of replacement capacity for their lost vessel would enable the applicant or an immediate relation to return to fishing.</P>
        <P>The advertising was quite successful and the scheme, despite its tight restrictions, was well responded to.  There were 68 applications by the closing date, of which six were successful in meeting all of the conditions of the scheme and were awarded replacement capacity.</P>
        <P><?oasys _dc18- ?>The scheme was aimed at people and families who had a tradition in fishing, had been actively fishing and wanted, through the scheme, to return to fishing.  Given the objective of the scheme, it was advertised widely in the major fishing trade papers in Ireland, including the<i> Marine Times</i>, <i>The Irish Skipper </i>and the<i> Fishing News</i>, and the various fishing representative groups, including all of the producer organisations, were asked to assist in publicising the scheme.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>The scheme was launched in June 2001, ran for six months and closed on 31 December 2001.  A number of the 62 unsuccessful applications failed to meet more than one of the qualifying conditions.  I emphasise that the scheme did not provide for the purchase of a replacement fishing vessel itself.  The replacement capacity awarded under the strict terms of the scheme could not be sold on or otherwise traded or realised as a financial asset in the tonnage market.</P>
        <P>The complaint that is the subject of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s special report was made by one additional applicant whose application under the scheme was received in January 2003, more than a year after the closing date.  The application, received on 7 January 2003, was refused on the basis of being more than a year outside the closing date of 31 December 2001 and also that the lost vessel was not in active continuous service prior to its loss.  For the purpose of the administration of the scheme, this was deemed to be two years minimum.</P>
        <P>In November 2004 the son of the owner, who had been lost with the vessel, made a complaint to the Ombudsman that the decision to refuse his family&rsquo;s application was unfair on the grounds that his family had not been made aware that the scheme was in place and that their circumstances were such that they should have qualified under the scheme in the first instance.</P>
        <P>After extensive examination and correspondence between the various parties, the Ombudsman found for the complainant in her first draft report and decided to award substantial monet<Col N="1020"/>ary compensation to the family.  The Ombudsman concluded that the particular family did not meet at least two of the conditions of the scheme and that it had been adversely affected by the failure of their application.  The Ombudsman found that the advertising of the scheme was not adequate and was a factor in the lateness of the application from the complainants.  The Department was of the view at the time that given the close knit nature of the fishing community, placing an advertisement in the three major fishing publications in Ireland, notifying the fishermen&rsquo;s representative organisations and writing to 16 known individual cases was appropriate in the circumstances.  The scheme was targeted at people who wanted to continue a family tradition of fishing and would continue that tradition themselves or through an immediate relative if successful under the scheme.  There is no certainty that an advertisement in the national newspapers, which would have been much less targeted than publicity in the fishing communities, would have been a better way of reaching the target audience.</P>
        <P>The scheme was aimed at people with a family tradition in fishing, who had been active in fishing and who expressly wanted to return to fishing.  Targeted advertising and communication channels most commonly used by the fishing industry and fishing communities were, therefore, the most appropriate way to publicise the scheme.</P>
        <P>I am convinced, as is the Department, that this scheme, once decided on, was properly and fairly administered by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which had responsibility for the scheme at the time.  The Ombudsman has expressly acknowledged that she found no evidence to suggest that, once the scheme was launched, that it was not applied equitably.</P>
        <P>In this case, monetary compensation is not warranted.  In the first instance, the lost at sea scheme did not envisage any monetary awards.  The replacement capacity awarded to the successful applicants could not be traded, sold on or otherwise disposed of for financial gain.  On the contrary, the successful applicants had to provide a replacement vessel from their own resources as well as pay for its running costs in order to be able to make use of the capacity awarded.  In the case of the family in question, no replacement vessel had been purchased and no immediate family member had continued in fishing in the 20-year period between the accident and the inception of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Given that the scheme was intended to allow families to continue a family tradition of sea fishing, it is difficult to see how it can be sustained that the family was disadvantaged by the failure of their application 20 years later.  Indeed, after the sinking the family were seen, perhaps understandably, to have left the fishing industry for the subsequent 20 years.  In the exchange of correspondence, the Ombudsman contends that while the family had received a substantial insurance payout this was not relevant to her investigation or to the scheme.</P>
        <P>The compensation figure of &euro;245,570 recommended by the Ombudsman was arrived at by using the methodology and rates used in the 2008 decommissioning scheme, a completely separate and unrelated scheme.  At the Ombudsman&rsquo;s request, the Department provided calculations on the basis of those rates and the tonnage of the lost vessel on the understanding that this was a starting point in her consideration of an appropriate amount of compensation.  The Ombudsman cites the average payments to the successful applicants under that scheme as being comparable.  It seems to me that the situations are in no way comparable.  In the case of the decommissioning scheme, the vessel owners had the expense of purchasing a vessel and maintaining it over a period of years.  Successful applicants under the decommissioning scheme were paid to voluntarily give up a working active vessel and its capacity, to pay to have it dismantled and, indeed, to lose its future stream of income and the rates payable were intended to incentivise this.  Under the lost at sea scheme successful applicants had to provide a replacement vessel from their own resources but would not have also had to purchase replacement tonnage for it.</P><Col N="1021"/>
        <P>The Department remains concerned that the recommendation in regard to this specific case could give rise to major financial liabilities arising from claims from others who were unsuccessful applicants under the scheme.  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s special report asserts that the recommendation relates to this case only, that her analysis, conclusions and findings flow from the particular circumstances of this case alone and, therefore, have no implications for other unsuccessful applicants.  This assertion appears neither logical nor consistent on the consideration of the full facts of the case and the legal advice available to me.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman&rsquo;s finding was that the design of the scheme itself and the manner in which it was advertised were &ldquo;contrary to fair and sound administration&rdquo; and that this family had been treated unfairly as a consequence.  This assertion is not supported by the facts.  The scheme as applied in this case was the same scheme as that applied equitably, as the Ombudsman has acknowledged, to all the other applications received.  The considered legal advice obtained by the Department contends that it is inevitable that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendation in regard to monetary payment may result in other unsuccessful applications for this scheme looking for the same consideration.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, some of the successful applicants for the scheme, who could not take up the capacity awarded because of the strict conditions, might seek to use the precedent created by any change in the conditions of the scheme, which would happen if the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations were acceded to.  In addition, those who contacted the Department in the year after the scheme had closed or who might have thought of applying in that period, but did not do so for whatever reason, would also seek to build a case on the basis of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>
        <P>At this stage, it is impossible to estimate precisely the financial outlay or potential liability that might be involved but there is no doubt that it is likely to be substantial and have a serious financial impact at this time.  There are also, perhaps more importantly, implications for the operation of other administrative schemes across Government that have application deadlines.  Deadlines are a fundamental feature of most schemes across the public service and are strictly enforced and adhered to generally in accepting or rejecting applications.  Totally discounting the deadline in this scheme and accepting the validity of an application that was more than a year late, as the Ombudsman recommends, could have very wide and probably incalculable financial and other implications for public administration in Ireland.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Since the conclusion of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s investigation in November 2008, the Department has been engaged in correspondence with the Ombudsman in regard to her findings in this case and her proposal to award financial compensation.  The Ombudsman has acknowledged that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is free in law to disagree with her findings and to refuse to implement her recommendations.  Notwithstanding this, she decided to submit a special report to the Oireachtas on 14 December last.  In submitting her special report, the Ombudsman has requested that the Houses consider her report and take whatever action they deem appropriate.  The Ombudsman Acts are silent on a next step or a specific role for the Oireachtas in such cases.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware that the special report was debated in the D&aacute;il on 3 February last and in this House on 18 February and that no recommendations were made for further action by the Oireachtas in the matter.  It was suggested in the Seanad that the Ombudsman Acts should be revisited with a view to addressing the apparent lacuna in respect of the resolution of disagreements between the Ombudsman and any other party.  Senators will also be aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food today decided to invite the Ombudsman to appear before it to discuss her special report.  The Department and I fully <Col N="1022"/>respect that it is a matter for Oireachtas committees to order their business and decide what issues they examine and how and when they do so.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that the complainants in this case did not apply for the scheme within the timeframe and were more than one year late in submitting an application.  The family did not meet some of the criteria of the scheme.  The Department maintains its position that the scheme was administered with scrupulous fairness in that each applicant was treated fairly under the scheme within specific terms, rules and conditions.  The Ombudsman acknowledges there is no evidence that the scheme was not applied equitably.  It was advertised in a targeted way to the target audience, namely, those with a family tradition of fishing who would return to fishing if successful under the scheme.</P>
        <P>I have the highest regard for the Ombudsman, her office and team.  The issue investigated and reported on by the Ombudsman is difficult and has taken considerable time and effort by her office and the Department.  There are far-reaching implications for this scheme and other such administrative schemes.  I am convinced the Department&rsquo;s position is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of this case.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Norris.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, and congratulate him again on his appointment as Minister of State with the responsibility for the marine.  Last Wednesday, when he and I appeared on &ldquo;The Late Debate&rdquo; with Rachael English, I told him his brief is significant and offers considerable potential to re-boot the rural economy if we review the manner in which we do our business in marine matters.  The Minister of State and I both come from marine constituencies and I look forward to interacting with him and his Department.  One of the first issues on his agenda will be imports but that is a topic for another debate.  I wish him well in his new role.</P>
        <P>I propose to focus on the mechanics and politics of the issue raised in the motion rather than examining it in forensic detail.  I welcome the decision by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to issue an invitation to the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly &mdash; the titles are a contradiction in terms &mdash; to attend a meeting of the joint committee to discuss her special report.  The invitation is important from the point of a view of parliamentary democracy and the relevance of the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The joint committee must have a full and frank discussion with an exchange of views and a question and answer session.  It would also be a worthwhile exercise if the meeting discussed the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recent comments on how the Oireachtas conducts its business and the relevance of both Houses.  While the decision to extend the invitation to the Ombudsman is timely, some of the grandstanding we have had on this issue could have been avoided if it had been issued sooner.</P>
        <P>The manner in which the Oireachtas conducts its business and the need to reform D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann have been the subject of much recent debate.  The Private Members&rsquo; motion tabled by the Independent Members on the case of Mr. D&oacute;nal de R&oacute;iste recently was a fine example of the good work done by this House.  The motion resulted in a some movement on the case after many years.  This demonstrated that the Seanad can achieve results, although I accept the matter has not reached a conclusion.</P>
        <P>I note the former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Frank Fahey, joins us in the Visitors Gallery.  Clearly, he has a strong interest in the matter.  Much has been said about the issue before the House and I do not propose to dwell on the politics involved.  Irrespective of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s views on the manner in which the scheme in question was initiated and operated and its rights and wrongs, it is imperative she come to the House to discuss her report on the scheme in question.  It says a great deal about the parliamentary <Col N="1023"/>system that the Ombudsman has intervened only twice in 25 years and the only other issue on which she intervened, a revenue matter, was kicked to touch in a committee.</P>
        <P>It is important that the House discuss the role of external agencies in Oireachtas business.  For instance, I recently called on the Attorney General to come to the House to provide information to which the Taoiseach referred when an issue was raised with him in the other House.  On other occasions, I have asked that we repeat the worthwhile exercise of having various MEPs come to the House.  We can avail of the expertise of other organs of the State in the context of reform of the Houses.  We could, for instance, invite officeholders such as the Ombudsman to appear before the Seanad on a frequent basis to engage in full and frank exchanges of views on various issues.</P>
        <P>This is a worthwhile motion, although this morning&rsquo;s decision by the joint committee to issue an invitation to the Ombudsman probably takes some of the heat out of it.  I look forward to interaction with the Ombudsman when we discuss this matter in the joint committee.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick.  He is a splendid man, as I know only too well from our membership of the Operation Transformation team of fat politicians which wiped the floor with the fat housewives and taxi drivers.  That was one of the few good, positive political stories to emerge in the past decade.  I compliment the Minister of State on his clear and disciplined approach to the entire project.  Of course, he had the expert and, I am sure, invaluable advice of his spouse, although I do not imagine he required her expert advice to produce his speech, the delivery of which was clear and nicely analytical.  I also appreciated the respect with which the Minister of State treated the House.</P>
        <P>This is an interesting development and I took the trouble, unusually, of placing my name on the Order Paper in support of the Fine Gael Party motion.  I did so for a variety of reasons and not, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, to pre-judge the case because that would be inappropriate.  The Senator made a fair judgment and assessment of the entire issue.  The primary reason I lent my support to the motion was that I am concerned we should establish a body such as the Office of the Ombudsman and then turn our face against the advice that emerges from it, which appears to have been the case.</P>
        <P>Despite the pleasant language and effusive comments paid in the motion and by the Minister of State to the Office of the Ombudsman and this particular manifestation or incarnation of the Ombudsman, it is clear the implication of everything the Minister of State said is that a patently absurd decision was reached by the Ombudsman.  Clear grounds are laid out that the scheme was deliberately limited in terms of time, the type of application required, tonnage and the requirement to produce records and the vessel&rsquo;s log to show it had been continuously active for a period of at least two years.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State noted that the compensation figure of &euro;245,570 recommended by the Ombudsman &ldquo;was arrived at by using the methodology and rates used in the 2008 decommissioning scheme, a completely separate and unrelated scheme&rdquo;.  It appears something is not quite spelled out in this sentence, namely, that this is an attempt to get around the problem and make an application which is a parallel of the 2008 decommissioning scheme, in other words, of trying to operate a method that would trigger exactly the same thing.</P>
      
        <P>The implication seems to be that they are using a late application for lost at sea scheme compensation as a way of getting into the decommissioning scheme.  I am not in a position to judge, but I can say it is very tragic that five people, two of them members of the same family, were lost at sea 20 years ago.  It is a deeply distressing case.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has made it clear, presumably on the basis of advice from the Department of Finance, that there is a concern the floodgates might open and compensation might <Col N="1024"/>raise its ugly head all over the country.  That suggestion was underlined when it was mentioned &mdash; the Minister of State neatly slipped it into the script &mdash; that insurance compensation of a significant nature had already been arrived at.  We can put all these things to one side and focus on the need to make a balanced judgment.  I am concerned with the Ombudsman&rsquo;s judgment which made significant findings with regard to the Department&rsquo;s notification and publication of the arrangements for the scheme.</P> </Speaker>

	<P>I will end by noting the Minister of State&rsquo;s concern about the matter and wishing that his party colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Woods, had been as careful about the public purse when the subject of compensation was opened up in respect of cases of institutional abuse.  I wish there had been such prudence in that instance.  Many are concerned not only because we do not have any control over this recommendation of the Ombudsman and cannot enforce it, but also because there was a similar case previously regarding the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>A few weeks ago I entered into a debate on this matter outside the House for a number of reasons.  When I was a Member of the other House and an Opposition spokesman on this area, I warmly welcomed the previous Government&rsquo;s decision to appoint Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly to the position of Ombudsman.  I was pleased when her term in office was extended.  It needs to be acknowledged that she has done excellent work in the Office of the Ombudsman.  However, I suggest a gap in the legislation continues to prevent her from being as effective as she could be.  I would like the promised legislation to strengthen the office to be introduced as quickly as possible.  Perhaps such a Bill could deal with some of the issues that have arisen in this case.</P>
        <P>While the lost at sea issue needs to be examined in greater detail, I would like to focus less on that issue and more on the manner in which the Ombudsman, as an officer of the State, interacts with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have had a useful debate on that aspect of the matter.  It has been noted that this is just the second time the Office of the Ombudsman has tabled a report for special consideration by the Oireachtas.  We need to put in place particular procedures and protocols for dealing with such reports.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with Senator Twomey that an attempt has been made to obscure or deny debate.  The matter has been discussed in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  When the Ombudsman tables a report in this specific way, as she is entitled to do under the legislation, there should be a means of enabling her to interact with the debates on it in the Oireachtas.  It would seem ideal to allow such a debate to take place at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and <Col N="1025"/>Food which is responsible for marine matters.  I am glad that consideration is being given to such an approach.  We should allow such interaction to occur.  The Ombudsman should make a contribution in response to the debates that have take place in the two Houses.  The appointed members of the joint committee of both Houses should then react to her thoughts.  To agree the motion proposed by Senator Bradford would be to prejudge the response of the joint committee.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Although there is more logic and sense in the Government amendment than in the Fine Gael motion, I am not without sympathy for the Byrne family whose specific case deserves to be examined.  The vessel on which the father of the complainant to the Ombudsman lost his life went down in a stretch of water between Burtonport and Arranmore Island.  As I have family connections with the island &mdash; my father came from there &mdash; I have travelled that stretch of water many times.  I understand the harsh realities of the lives of fishermen in that part of the world.  I accept that we lack mechanisms to recognise their difficulties and make sure they are compensated properly at times such as this.  We need to discuss this wider issue.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the best approach is for the Ombudsman to appear at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the short term.  That would enable her to respond to the D&aacute;il and Seanad debates.  We could then see how the issue can be progressed from there.  Such an approach should have been taken before now and I am confident it would result in a proper re-examination of the issue.  The demand in the Fine Gael motion for a &ldquo;thorough investigation&rdquo; to be arranged is superfluous.  I am confident the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food can sufficiently exercise its role in that regard.  We should not second-guess the roles of our appointed committees in this way.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman should be given specific powers when the House gets a chance to consider the amending legislation that has been promised.  As an important independent officer of the State, the Ombudsman should have the right to ask to attend Oireachtas committee meetings to discuss issues of relevance to her office.  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s role is as a representative of citizens in the operation of administration.</P>
        <P>I accept what the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, has said about the flaws in the lost at sea scheme and I should have joined other Senators in welcoming him to the House.  I know from my first-hand experience that his family, community and constituents have taken pride in his appointment as Minister of State.  I have a great deal of confidence in his ability to rise to his task.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has commented on the manner in which this affair has been responded to so far.  Even if the application was late, there was an inconsistency of approach.  Not only were advertisements placed in the marine press, but direct contact was also made with a number of people who were known to be affected by the issue.  When the Ombudsman makes her presentation to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I would like her to address this aspect of the matter.  I do not consider the scheme to have been organised in a particular way.  This administrative inconsistency deserves to be explored further by the committee. In giving way to my party colleague, I welcome the fact that the committee decided today to examine the issue in a wider sense and to allow the Ombudsman to contribute to that process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, who is a proud New Ross man.  He is very welcome.  </P>
        <P>I concur with Senator Boyle&rsquo;s assessment of the matter.  The relationship between the Ombudsman and the Houses of the Oireachtas is the key issue.  The section of the relevant Act setting out how the Oireachtas should deal with the Ombudsman&rsquo;s reports seems to be slightly vague.  Ms O&rsquo;Reilly has described the option of sending reports to the Oireachtas as a &ldquo;nuclear&rdquo; one.  The manner in which such reports should be dealt with when they are sent to <Col N="1026"/>the Oireachtas appears to be somewhat unclear.  It is clear that the Ombudsman &mdash; the same person will not have that role all the time &mdash; should have an opportunity to bring his or her own views to the Houses of the Oireachtas, for example, at committee level.  When matters of this nature are debated in the Seanad, it would be welcome if the Ombudsman had an opportunity to put his or her case before us.  That would have been extremely helpful, particularly if we had an opportunity to put questions and receive answers.</P>
        <P>The role of the Ombudsman is very important.  I have used the Office of the Ombudsman on a number of occasions as a public representative and I am sure many public representatives have suggested to constituents to refer matters to the Ombudsman, particularly Opposition Members.  I would like the Minister of State to consider making the Ombudsman a constitutional officer because that would help underpin the integrity of the office.  This could be done at a time when other referenda are happening, but it should certainly be considered.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity granted to the Ombudsman to address the Houses through the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I hope that happens as quickly as possible and for the sake of the Byrne family, this matter needs to be brought to a resolution at that stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his new appointment and wish him success.  </P>
        <P>The Ombudsman states the following at the beginning of her report:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Office of the Ombudsman relies on the authority which comes from its independence, impartiality and confidence to gain fair play for people who have been wronged by public bodies.  As Ombudsman, I do not make binding decisions.  The Department is free in law to reject my recommendations.  My only recourse, when I consider that a public body&rsquo;s response to a recommendation is unsatisfactory, is to make a special report to each House of the Oireachtas under the Ombudsman Act.  This is such a report.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman has asked us to consider the report.  Since she gave the report to the Department, she has obviously made a number of comments on how the report is being dealt with.  That is the focus of the Fine Gael motion.  It has been a tortuous process to get to the point where Deputy Sargent has written to the committee today and the committee, probably prompted by this motion, has decided to invite the Ombudsman to appear before it.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman also said:</P>
        <P LI="1">by preventing the Oireachtas from dealing with the report, the Government parties have brought about a situation in which the Government has been able to act as a judge in its own case.  The saga began with maladministration and has ended, to date at least, with poor governance.</P>
        <P>She states this may be about loyalty and goes on to make some comments about this.  She also asks how the role of the Ombudsman fits into the wider arrangements for the Government and how the Government should act in supporting her in fulfilling her statutory role.  She states it is a bit odd to be raising those questions 30 years after the passing of the Ombudsman Act 1980 and 26 years after the setting up of the Office of the Ombudsman.  She points out that this type of situation has only arisen once before; we made reference to this and the fact that a solution was found in that case.  She states no solution has been found to how she believes the report should be dealt with.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman goes on to state that one of the big criticisms about governance has been the lack of regulation.  She quotes the Financial Regulator and the work that was not done, of which we are all very conscious now.  She points out that she is trying to do her work and be <Col N="1027"/>accountable, yet the way the report has been dealt with goes against what everyone has been saying about the need for oversight, governance and respect for the independent monitoring of the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>Whatever about the detail or the recommendations of the report, the way it has been dealt with by the Government and the way the Ombudsman has been treated is not good enough in a modern democracy.  While the Minister of State may defend the detail of the report and the Department&rsquo;s current view, that is not really the point.  The point of the motion is to examine how the report has been dealt with by the Government since it was published, as well as the reluctance to put it before the committee for investigation by that committee.  I would welcome the Minister of State outlining before the committee what he outlined today.  Equally, the Ombudsman should have the opportunity to present her findings in the way she has done in the report, following which there should be a discussion on it.  That is the key point of our motion.  We have not had that to date, and I hope we get an opportunity for it now.</P>
        <P>I ask the Government to support the motion.  The committee has indicated it will have this hearing; therefore, what we are saying looks like being accepted and the decent thing to do would be to accept the motion, rather than oppose it on spurious grounds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is one of the most serious issues that the Oireachtas has had to deal with.  We have a scheme which was designed in a flawed manner by a former Minister, Deputy Fahey.  The finding of the Ombudsman was that the lost at sea scheme was designed in a way that was contrary to fair and sound administration.  It is quite a damning report, but she does not make a political finding.  She deals with the compliant that was made by the Byrne family, but the matter was not politicised in her report.  That is why I do not understand why the Government has been so reluctant to deal with this specific case and the specific issue addressed by the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>There has been a determination to avoid discussion of this matter even at an Oireachtas committee and to have the Ombudsman present her report.  That is the purpose of the motion.  The matter has to be examined in detail by an Oireachtas committee.  There are fundamental questions that need to be answered, and the former Minister has serious questions to answer.  Bertie Ahern&rsquo;s autobiography refers specifically to the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, and the lost at sea scheme.  It was flawed and it was foisted on a Department that was very reluctant to introduce the scheme, but it was invariably brought into line.  The scheme was introduced to facilitate specific people and criteria were adopted to suit specific people.  The Ombudsman produced documentary evidence which showed personal writing such as &ldquo;I want to licence these boats if we can do this&rdquo;.  There are references to ring-fencing the scheme and confining it to certain individuals.</P>
        <P>The finding of the Ombudsman was that this was maladministration.  The Ombudsman Act 1980 states that the appointment of a person to be the Ombudsman shall be made by the President upon resolution passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann recommending the appointment of the person.  The very legislation shows the importance of this office and we should recognise the independence of the office.  This matter should be discussed by the committee, and I hope the recommendations of the Ombudsman will be followed and that the modicum of compensation which she has recommended to the Byrne family is adhered to.</P>
        <P>The importance of these Houses to show respect for the Office of the Ombudsman has been highlighted recently in the national media by a former Senator, Maurice Hayes.  Having set up that office, he said that the least we can do is to respect it and the integrity of the office holder.  To date, we have shown disrespect to that office.  It is an important office to ensure there are safeguards in our democracy.  Just like a free press and independent courts, we have an Ombudsman and this is best practice in Europe.  The Oireachtas and the Government will be <Col N="1028"/>judged on how they deal with the recommendations of an excellent report by an excellent Ombudsman.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share time with Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, on his first visit to the Seanad since his appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries and forestry issues.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in his term of office.  He has certainly hit the ground running since his appointment one week ago.  I particularly welcome his undertaking, when meeting the new European Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, that his objective in the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy would be &ldquo;to protect the national fish quotas as a public resource to be used for the benefit of our family-owned fleet and to support our coastal communities.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I also congratulate Deputy Killeen on his appointment as Minister for Defence.  He was always very effective as a Minister of State, in which capacity he attended the House on many occasions.  He was always courteous and constructive and I am sure he will soon return to the House in his new capacity.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Ombudsman is an important statutory office which since its establishment has contributed significantly to our system of public administration.  In the vast majority of cases the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations are accepted by the relevant public bodies, which is as it should be.  That, in itself, is a measure of the esteem in which the office is held and the support for it, contrary to what the previous speaker said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the two Ministers of State, Deputies Killeen and Connick, said, it is clear that the Ombudsman has undertaken a detailed, forensic examination of the complaint made by Mr. Byrne.  She is to be commended for the time and effort put into compiling the report.  I extend my sympathy to the Byrne family on their great personal loss.  I did so also when the issue was discussed previously in the House.</P>
        <P>As the Ombudsman acknowledged in her special report, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is free in law to reject her recommendation.  The Department which assumed responsibility for fisheries in October 2007 believes there is no basis for proceeding to pay, as the scheme&rsquo;s conditions were not met.  It is also concerned that such a payment would create a precedent for its schemes and those of other Departments and Offices.  That is its right and its right to take that position is accepted by the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the particularly tragic circumstances surrounding the case, as public representatives, we cannot ignore the legitimate concerns of the Department, as expressed by the two Ministers, that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendation in this case could give rise to major financial liabilities arising from claims from other unsuccessful applicants under the lost at sea scheme.  Not only can we not ignore such concerns, but it would also be irresponsible of us to do so.  I share the Minister&rsquo;s concern that it is difficult to accept the Ombudsman&rsquo;s contention that her recommendation in this case has no implications for other unsuccessful candidates.</P>
        <P>It is clear that neither the Minister nor the Department has taken lightly the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendation in this case.  There was considerable engagement between the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office and the Department before the latter took the position it did.  Clearly and properly, the Department took considered legal advice which, as the Minister of State has pointed out, contends that &ldquo;it is inevitable that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendation in relation to monetary payment may result in other unsuccessful applications for this scheme looking for the same consideration&rdquo;.  We are all only too aware of the pressure on the public finances and there are areas of public policy for which we would all like to see additional funding.</P>
        <P>It has been said here that the Government blocked this, but the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that the matter could be debated in both Houses and also go before the relevant committee. <Col N="1029"/> However, it is up to us to decide and take that into consideration.  As Senator Bradford outlined in his recommendations, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, of which I am also a member, has agreed to reconsider the matter and an invitation has been issued to the Ombudsman to attend the committee to discuss it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Connick.  I know him from our time as urban councillors and recognise the service he gave to our organisation, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, as its president.  While his elevation to ministerial office is important to him, his family and constituency, it is also a great fillip for town councillors everywhere to see one of their own rising steadily up the ladder. </P>
        <P>There is an <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> aspect to this debate.  We had a full discussion on this issue about two weeks ago and there were also statements made in the Lower House.  On that occasion the Government offered to deal with it in committee but the Opposition rejected this.  It is rather ironic that that is what the Opposition motion before us is seeking.  The joint committee has now taken the initiative to invite the Ombudsman to meet it, which renders the motion somewhat foolish.</P>
        <P>The scheme was a positive attempt to deal with a situation in which bereaved fishing families found themselves.  I commend the Minister who introduced the scheme, Deputy Fahey, who was the subject of a snide remark by an Opposition Senator.  It is easy to take a shot and then run out the door, but I do not like this in any walk of life.  The former Minister did the right thing and there is absolutely no evidence or proof of any wrongdoing or departure from normal procedures in the way the scheme was handled.  Innuendo and hints to the contrary are absolute rubbish.  We had better talk plainly.</P>
        <P>I am sorry to say the first person to cast a slur on the scheme was a Kerryman, Mr. Joe Higgins, who is now an MEP.  He made outrageous remarks at the time in the D&aacute;il and has not had the courage or decency to withdraw them since.</P>
        <P>Who will be served by this debate?  My heart goes out to the Byrne family and any other bereaved family.  I know about the tremendous risks and dangers involved in sea fishing, but this debate will not turn back the clock.</P>
        <P>When introduced, the scheme was subject to conditions, like all other Government schemes.  The conditions included a deadline, as well as other elements.  In addition, the scheme was advertised.  I am not satisfied with the argument that it was not advertised properly because there was targeted advertising in trade journals.  Anyone who knows anything about farmers and fishermen will know that that is the right way to reach them because they quickly pick up on what is going on.  If there are grants going, they are the first to know about them, even before we know ourselves.  If people did not tick all the boxes, however, they did not qualify.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman is highly respected and criticising her is like criticising Mother Teresa of Calcutta or the Pope.</P>

	<P>Unlike the Pope, however, the Ombudsman is not infallible.  I am delighted she is to appear before the joint committee because I will be there to ask questions.  </P>
        <P>Did the Office of the Ombudsman really understand what it was doing in this case?  Did it differentiate between the lost at sea scheme and the decommissioning scheme?  The lost at sea scheme had nothing to do with money, even though Joe Higgins, MEP, tried to give the impression that it did.  No one was getting any money under that scheme, the aim of which was to replace lost tonnage.</P><Col N="1030"/>
        <P>Did the Ombudsman interface properly and adequately with the Department when she was preparing the report?  There is evidence to suggest she did not.  I would like to hear that issue being teased out also.</P>
        <P>I have the height of respect for the Ombudsman, but was she right to sensationalise the matter by making a speech to the media?  To a certain extent, she has is on dangerous ground in creating a possible rift between her role and that of the Oireachtas.  We are both trying to do our best for the country.  Her role is vital and respected, but so is ours.  That is where the real debate lies.</P>

        <P>I view this motion as non-political.  The speech I most enjoyed was Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s, not that many good points have not been made on both sides of the House.  In fact, I must admit I do not see a difference between the motion and the amendment.  I am also delighted that it has been decided today that the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will carry out its own investigation and report on the matter.  I look forward to the appearances of the Minister and the Ombudsman before that committee.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to attach blame to anyone, but a question is raised by all of this: how stands the Ombudsman?  We must be concerned about this because, as has been pointed out, the Office of the Ombudsman was set up and the Ombudsman appointed with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are obliged, therefore, to have much regard to the independence and integrity of the office.  I do not think anyone on either side would disagree with this.</P>
        <P>Like most other speakers, I have much sympathy for the Byrne family.  Their referral of the matter to the Office of the Ombudsman was their right, as the office is an essential part of our democratic system.  They did not do anything wrong.  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s office examined the case in the proper manner and made findings and we know what has happened since.  As has been pointed out, Deputy Sargent wrote an important letter in the meantime.  We must be careful in proceeding because of the implications for our political and democratic system.  As I said, the matter was properly referred and examined and recommendations were made.  What is at stake now is the integrity of the office.  The Ombudsman was concerned that the Byrne family had been treated unfairly and made such a finding in her special report.</P>
        <P>The major point is that the Office of the Ombudsman was constitutionally provided for and set up and the Ombudsman was appointed by both Houses to provide an independent, objective assessment.  That was done and I hope we will respect the office.  I also have considerable regard for the recent comments of the first ombudsman in the North, Dr. Maurice Hayes, who served with us as a Senator for two terms.  I will finish on that point because he laid it out well.  I hope the committee will deal properly with the matter and I have no doubt it will do so.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Coghlan for sharing his time with me and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, to the Seanad.  His recent elevation to ministerial office is a matter of great pride for many in my area and his.  I was proud to be the first man from Rosbercon in the Oireachtas, but Deputy Connick beat me to the D&aacute;il and the position of Minister of State.  There is only one position to which I could hope to beat him at this stage.  However, I wish him success in his position.  I note that he mentioned his own county of Wexford, but I presume he meant his own constituency, since he lives in Kilkenny.</P>

        <P>I lend my support to the Fine Gael motion which serves as an indicator of the value of Seanad &Eacute;ireann because I do not believe the committee would have accepted the proposal that it discuss the lost at sea report if this motion had not been put before the Seanad this evening.  I do not see the purpose of the amendment; the objective of the motion was to have the report discussed by an Oireachtas committee and now it will be.  The amendment leaves open the option for the issue to be discussed in committee.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Ombudsman is an important one.  Senators on all sides have said they have recommended to those in their areas that they make use of it, as I have done in the past.  The Ombudsman has made a serious criticism of the way in which we do our business in the Houses of the Oireachtas and there is a degree of truth in what she says.  This issue fell down purely on party political grounds in the debate in the other House.  It is right and proper that the Ombudsman and the public who have such faith in her position would expect consideration of her report by an Oireachtas committee.  As that has now been decided upon, I do not see the purpose in our having a division on the issue.  The objective will be fulfilled in any case.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the mention of the Byrne family by a number of contributors.  They are the people at the heart of the report.  I will not get involved in a discussion on the merits of the conclusions made by the Ombudsman in her report.  That will be decided by the committee.  However, for that family, it is a matter of life and death and they are entitled to every process that can be carried out on their behalf.  They went to the Ombudsman in good faith and she decided that they had a case.  She pursued the only avenue she could which was to lay the report which I have read before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  She considered, as do the family, that the report had not been given due consideration by the Oireachtas.  That is the purpose of the motion before the House.  The desired result has already, in effect, been achieved, in that the committee has agreed to discuss the report.  Therefore, we should not have a division on the matter at this stage.  Let us leave aside, for once, petty party political squabbling and agree that the report will be examined by the committee in order that this family who have suffered enough will receive a fair hearing of their understandable grievances.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis as an ard&uacute; c&eacute;ime a fuair s&eacute; ar na mallaibh.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food agreed this morning to invite the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, to a meeting to discuss the report on the lost at sea scheme.  I hope this will be the start of an overall investigation of the scheme, as is called for in the motion before the House.  I support the motion which is different from the amendment tabled by the Government in that it calls for a full investigation of the findings made in the report.  I am glad to be one of the signatories to the motion, with my Fine Gael colleagues and Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report describes the lost at sea scheme as &ldquo;seriously deficient and flawed&rdquo;.  It is clearly an accurate summary of what took place.  The Ombudsman has found that the Byrne family who are from my own county were treated unfairly in their claim for compensation following the loss of two members of the family and three crewmen when their boat sank in 1981.  The family were excluded from the scheme because they applied one year after the period for the submission of applications had closed, but they argued that the scheme should have been publicised more widely, as we have heard, and that they were unaware of it, as were others who might have been eligible.  The reason given for the failure of the Department to notify the family was that the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources <Col N="1032"/>claimed to have no record of the tragic incident that led to the loss of the vessel and those on board.  It seems strange the Department responsible for overseeing the fishing sector which is so meticulous in other areas related to fishing vessels and fishing regulations was not aware of it and had not officially recorded it.</P>
        <P>Although it failed to advertise the scheme more widely and inform the Byrne family, the Department had written to others who had applied in order to inform them of its existence.  We know it was the former Minister who has now left the Chamber who did this.  On what basis was it decided to contact these individuals and not others?  There are also serious issues to be addressed regarding those who were deemed eligible, the criteria employed and the level of compensation awarded to some but not others.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman agreed with the Byrne family in its complaints regarding all of these issues and also concluded that, because of the way in which it had been designed, it had been applied inequitably.  On that basis, she recommended that the family be compensated and a figure of just under &euro;250,000 was calculated as an appropriate amount.  However, this was rejected by the Department, even though it was officials within it who had arrived at the compensation figure.  The attitude of departmental officials probably reflected their own scepticism about the lost at sea scheme.  When the scheme was proposed, there was opposition to it from within the Department on the basis of concerns about allocating quota, but the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, overruled these objections.  The manner in which the scheme was operated only heightened that concern.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman also referred to the fact that two constituents of the former Minister, Deputy Fahey, had originally suggested the establishment of the scheme.  The two people in question were granted compensatory tonnage worth &euro;2 million under the scheme, out of a total of just &euro;2.8 million awarded to the six successful applicants.  There is also evidence that the two people concerned were accepted, despite the fact that the Department had ruled that they were ineligible because their vessels had been registered before 1990.  The Minister made much of the fact that the Byrnes did not suit the criteria in that regard, but it is clear that neither did the two constituents of the former Minister.  Others in the same position were rejected.  The criteria were then altered, apparently, to facilitate the former Minister&rsquo;s two constituents.  That alone substantiates the Ombudsman&rsquo;s conclusion that the scheme had not been administered equitably.</P>
        <P>Of the 67 applicants who applied between June 2001 and the closing date for the scheme of December 31, only six were accepted.  Some &euro;2.8 million was paid out to the six successful applicants and the two people to whom I have referred, the then Minister&rsquo;s constituents, received 75% or &euro;2.1 million of the total value of the replacement tonnage.  It was later discovered that, although the scheme did not close until 31 December 2001, the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, had written to his two constituents in October congratulating them on being successful.  They were among the six, of the 67 applicants, who were successful.  However, it was found that one of the persons to whom the Minister had written did not actually qualify, according to the original criteria, but he appealed and was accepted in 2003, with one of the reasons cited for the award being the fact that the then Minister&rsquo;s letter of congratulations had created a reasonable expectation that he would receive compensation.  This constituent was notified of the scheme, ineligible under the criteria and refused an award but then appealed and was granted an award because of the then Minister&rsquo;s letter in 2003.  This application, appeal and award were all made after the date the Byrne family had applied.  In the context of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on the Byrne family&rsquo;s application, it should be noted that it was being processed before the decision in the aforementioned case, yet it was still turned down.  Even on that basis, the Byrnes were treated unfairly.</P><Col N="1033"/>
        <P>These issues have raised serious concerns which have been referred to in a number of press reports.  They were also mentioned in the Lower House by Deputy Sargent in June 2006.  I was, therefore, interested to hear what the Green Party Senators had to say.  During the course of an extensive survey of Deputy Fahey&rsquo;s property holdings, Deputy Sargent specifically mentioned the fact that two of the then Minister&rsquo;s constituents had received such a large share of the compensation paid under the lost at sea scheme and went on to call on the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to sack Deputy Fahey.  How things have changed.  The claim regarding the two individuals was reported in a piece in <i>Ireland on Sunday</i>  two weeks later in which it was also claimed that the two people concerned had suggested setting up the scheme in the first place and that the criteria governing applications were changed in order to facilitate one of them.  All of this has been confirmed in an investigation of the documents relating to the scheme and the processing of applications.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report and all the other reports surrounding the scheme, including those to which I have referred, that a full investigation needs to be carried out into all aspects of the way in which the lost at sea scheme was operated.  That is why it is necessary that it be referred to and fully discussed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I welcome this morning&rsquo;s decision by the committee to invite the Ombudsman and hope it will be the start of a more intensive investigation.  The whole issue must be investigated.  The investigation should focus on the issue as it relates to the Byrne family, a family which suffered a tragedy at sea and which was unfairly treated by the Government.  They deserve, as suggested in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, to be compensated for the way in which the Government treated their application.  I hope the report and subsequent debate will lead to the family finally being treated in the way the Ombudsman ruled.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is no doubt the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report is damning, not only with regard to how the lost at sea scheme was operated, but also with regard to the former Minister, Deputy Fahey.  One item that jumped out at me when reading it was the handwritten note the former Minister sent to his departmental officials with regard to the parameters on which the scheme would be drafted which stated: &ldquo;I want to see how we can ringfence the six to eight genuine cases.&rdquo;  As we know, awards were granted in six cases and 75% of the amount granted went to two of the then Minister&rsquo;s constituents.  How the hell did the then Minister know at the time, before the scheme was even drafted, that there would be six to eight cases when many more people had lost their lives and boats at sea?  If the Byrne family were not in my constituency but in that of the former Minister and they had the same access other individuals had, there is no doubt the scheme would have been drafted to ensure they received compensation.  It was drafted to suit a certain number of people.</P>

	<P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate, including the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, whom I wish well following his appointment.  </P>
        <P>It is important to reflect on the wording of the motion which has been designed to ensure the report would be fully and thoroughly investigated by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Most of what we have heard in the debate is, in a sense, a throwback to the debate held on 18 February when we had a series of statements outlining our views on what was contained in the report.  What Fine Gael and the co-signatories to the motion want to ensure is that the Ombudsman, all those affected and implicated &mdash; policymakers, politicians and affected families &mdash; will have an opportunity to come before the joint committee to present their case, take questions and respond to queries.  That is the least that is required.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Government appears to have conceded that the Ombudsman should come before the joint committee, but we need to go further and ensure the committee will investigate the report, ask questions and advance the process.  We in this House are not judges or jurors.  However, there are questions yet to be asked, angles to be pursued and issues <Col N="1034"/>to be teased out.  The report must be examined in an open and transparent fashion by the committee.  We require a thorough investigation.  There has been some progress.  Political pressure applied by the Opposition parties and more recently the Green Party has obviously triggered a Government response.  The white flag has been raised and, at a minimum, the Ombudsman will now be allowed to come before the committee.  That meeting must be more than a vehicle for a hearing with the Ombudsman.  The committee must be allowed to investigate the matter fully, question all those involved and hear their submissions and advance the case.</P>
        <P>I thank all those who have contributed to the debate.  The backdrop to the report is tragic.  All those involved require closure and, most of all, justice which the affected families consider they have not received and which they demand.  We have a role to play in that regard.  The next step is a full, open and thorough investigation by the joint committee.  I look forward to it being allowed.  Again, I thank my colleagues for allowing this debate to be held today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for providing me with an opportunity to discuss this matter.  There is much discussion about political reform and it struck me that there is no way there will be any political reform until we have the establishment of an independent electoral commission.  It is a vital hook on which we will set about establishing a new system of running elections.  This point struck me while studying the renewed programme for Government.  As a result, I was keen to have the Minister appear in the House to talk about progress and what is happening and how matters are moving along because everyone is anxious to see change.  While with goodwill, there may be two years until the next general election, it would be good to expect a degree of change by then.  All Members agree on the necessity to make a lot of changes to our electoral system because they seek the participation of more young people or women or because of matters relating to boundaries, how they are <Col N="1036"/>established and so on.  However, it is vitally important that an independent electoral commission be established that will look after this matter.</P>
        <P>The most important function of such a commission will be to establish an accurate register.  Although one constantly hears that voter participation is falling, it has been pointed out on numerous occasions that the problem is with the accuracy of the register.  When one depends completely on the register for one&rsquo;s turnout figures, they look bad.  However, to take a personal example, I was on the register in three places for the last election even though I am a responsible type of citizen who seeks to be removed from the register where it is duplicated.  Therefore, I am sure the register is full of people who are not so active or interested in this issue as am I.</P>
        <P>This is one of the major functions an independent electoral commission will be required to do.  All Members are aware that local authorities, which are responsible for looking after the electoral register at present, all have different standards.  Even though they are requested to operate similar types of systems, they do not.  Consequently, it is time to establish an independent body and I am glad such a proposal is included in the programme for Government.  However, I note that on page 32 of the renewed programme, which relates to this issue, it is stated that within 12 months, the electoral commission will be established and will propose reforms to the electoral system.  I am trying to ascertain whether the aforementioned 12 months is from the date of publication of the renewed programme for Government in October 2009 or whether it means within 12 months of the commission&rsquo;s establishment.  I am keen to find out the current position.</P>
        <P>As someone who is interested in politics and democracy, I often have gone on election monitoring and observing missions.  When one does so, one is well trained as to what questions one can or cannot ask and the subject of independent electoral commissions is always raised.  In particular, I have gone on missions to places in Africa and to eastern European countries, all of which have established independent electoral commissions.  I believe it is quite embarrassing that Ireland does not.  An independent function for the running of Irish elections must be established.  As soon as the last boundary commission report was published, I believe the present Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, who may not have held that office at the time, expressed his annoyance that the proposed changes transgressed the county boundary of County Offaly.  Similarly, I recall there was uproar in County Limerick because half of a Limerick constituency has been moved into Kerry.</P>

	<P>The boundary commission broke one of its own rules of establishment, namely, that where possible it should not break a county boundary.  Unfortunately however, as soon as such proposals enter the political sphere for Members to discuss, it appears as though they only do so from the perspective of political self-interest.  Consequently, Members were reluctant to take on the responsibility of proposing that the commission should repeat the exercise because it had broken the county boundaries.  Moreover, all Members are aware that the integrity of the county boundary is somewhat sacrosanct.  This demonstrates to me the need for an independent electoral commission to establish itself in order that elections are run accurately, fairly and independently.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and thank Senator O&rsquo;Malley for raising this important issue.  I understand there was a good debate on the establishment of an independent electoral commission in the House two years ago.  Since then, to assist in consideration of the issues involved, the Minister commissioned a report by an <Col N="1037"/>expert group from UCD.  He published that preliminary study for comment just 12 months ago.  The response to the consultation was somewhat disappointing.  While the formal closing date for written submissions has passed, the Minister still welcomes and will consider any views and observations that are put forward.</P>
        <P>The key findings of the UCD report are that the proposed electoral commission should be responsible for maintaining the register of political parties and for the electoral register.  The report also recommends that the functions carried out at present by the Constituency Commission for D&aacute;il and European elections be transferred to the electoral commission.  The study notes that current Irish arrangements for the administration of nominations, polling schemes, the polling process and the counting of votes have several distinct advantages.  It recommends that the devolved character of the process is the key to its success and should not be tampered with.  One could therefore, even with the establishment of an electoral commission, still be in a position in which electoral administration was the responsibility of a number of bodies.  The report recommends that, pending the outcome of a review of the law relating to the regulation of party and election funding, a single body should combine the functions currently performed by the Standards in Public Office Commission and by the registrar of political parties.  The report notes that the electoral commission would be independent in the performance of its functions but that any such provision should not preclude an appropriate degree of accountability on the part of the electoral commission to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and to the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The report considers that the following <i>ex officio</i> membership would be most appropriate for an electoral commission, namely, a chairperson who shall be a judge or a former judge of the Supreme or High Courts and as ordinary members, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the Clerk of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The establishment of an independent electoral commission is not an insignificant move.  The UCD study recommends that an electoral commission should be established through the enactment of an electoral commission Act.  Such an Act would amend and consolidate the law in this area, bringing together in one Act the law relating to referendums and elections.  This will be a major task.  The renewed programme for Government of October 2009 has further clarified the Government&rsquo;s intentions and ambitions in respect of what an electoral commission would do.  I will not repeat the detail here as Members undoubtedly are all well familiar with it.  When looking ahead, one must be mindful of the importance of effectiveness and value for money in delivering on structural or organisational change such as the establishment of an electoral commission.  It will not simply be a matter of pulling together a few existing bodies.  If an electoral commission is to achieve the objectives set out in the programme for Government, it must be adequately resourced and supported by all stakeholders.  Having that support and achieving consensus for change might be the Government&rsquo;s biggest challenge in this work.  In the meantime I remind the House that the Minister is advancing reform on a number of fronts.  This includes the introduction in 2009 of a spending and donations regime for local elections, a decision by the Government to cease once and for all the electronic voting project, as well as the publication of legislation for the election of a mayor for Dublin, which is a most significant reform initiative.</P>

It appears as though much work has been done on this issue as the Minister of State indicated that thought has been given to the possible membership of such a commission.  I ask the Minister of State to inform the Minister that I am keen to find out a date on which it might be started.  I thank the Minister of State.</P>

	<P>I apologise to the Minister of State for the mix-up last week and thank her.</P>
        <P>At present, while nurses are retiring in abundance due to pension incentives and having achieved full years of service, they are not being replaced.  For example, in Longford-Westmeath hospital, of the 11 nurses who are retiring this year, two are doing so on grounds of ill-health while the rest are leaving simply because they are coming to their natural retiring age.  Although budgets are inadequate in all hospitals, a ban now is in place on the use of agency nurses.  It had been the case that when a nurse retired, the money would follow and an agency nurse could be used to fill the breach.  However, this no longer is the case.  Only minimal overtime is being approved.  How can patient care not be compromised if nurses are not being replaced?  Most hospitals were short-staffed to begin with and matters are steadily worsening.  I ask that the Government revisit the moratorium on the recruitment of nurses because there will be casualties and people will die.  Staff morale is at an all-time low.  I have spoken to nurses in urban and rural areas.</P>
        <P>A number of weeks ago, I raised the issue of a service in Mullingar.  Owing to the industrial action, the Minister of State could not get a response, which is in itself a dismal response.  The matter pertains to the same issue in that there are 245 service users in St. Mary&rsquo;s day care centre in Mullingar.  Due to the retirement of a staff nurse, there are serious concerns about whether the service will continue.</P>
        <P>A fantastic new building attached to St. Vincent&rsquo;s care centre for the elderly in Athlone, the Athlone hospice, was built through local fund-raising and money from the lotto.  It is a beautiful, state-of-the-art centre.  I warmly welcome the commitment by the Minister, through Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, that the hospice will open, but I am concerned it will be consequential on events in the day care centre and Loughloe House, a centre for the elderly.  I was told today that the number of beds at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Athlone, is to reduce to 30 and that the nurses have been offered positions elsewhere in the county.  Closing community beds for the elderly is not a good move.  We need to keep them open.  Some 15 nurses will be required to open the hospice unit in Athlone.</P>
        <P>I have serious concerns.  Mullingar hospital is in the same situation in that nurses are not being replaced.  The population is growing and the same number of people are getting sick.  I ask that this matter be revisited.  Managers are being appointed in the HSE, so it is crazy not to look after the front-line staff doing the work.  I am not saying that managers do not work, but surely the people caring for the sick are the most important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator McFadden for raising this issue and for giving me an opportunity to clarify the position in respect of the operation of the moratorium in the health services.  To implement savings measures in terms of public service numbers, the Government decided that, with effect from 27 March 2009 to the end of 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  The decision applies to all grades of permanent and temporary staff, including nurses, notwithstanding a number of specific exemptions, some of which I will highlight.</P>
        <P>Employment control frameworks have been used for a number of years in the health sector to give effect to Government policies on the numbers employed therein.  The 2009 framework gave effect to the Government decision on the moratorium on recruitment, promotion or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  A HSE circular issued to give effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for those services.</P><Col N="1039"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision was modulated to ensure key services were maintained in so far as possible in the health services, especially in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.  The 2009 framework specifically exempted a number of front-line grades in the health sector from the moratorium.  The focus on these key grades was in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas for which significant funding had already been provided.  The overall result was to assist in the re-orientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.  This would mean re-organising and restructuring work to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.</P>
        <P>The redeployment and reassignment of staff will be an essential part of this process.  The draft agreement reached in recent days between public sector unions and management will play an important role in this regard.  The draft agreement provides for greater flexibility, an extended working day and redeployment of health sector staff.  This will have a positive impact on the provision of health services and will allow for the transformation agenda to continue.</P>
        <P>The 2009 employment control framework also provided for a process whereby a limited number of exceptions to the moratorium were approved by the Department of Health and Children with the consent of the Department of Finance.  The exceptions approved included a number of nursing posts, for example, 23 mental health nurse posts at the Central Mental Hospital and 36 mental health nurse posts at St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital, Lucan.  These exceptions were approved on the basis of the two hospitals making better use of their staffing resources, leading to overall efficiencies in the delivery of services.</P>
        <P>A 2010 employment control framework is being finalised between the Departments of Health and Children and Finance.  Although this framework is not yet finalised, I expect that, in 2010, it will again provide the Department and the HSE with the ability to deal with critical exceptions to the moratorium as long as the overall reduction in health employment numbers, as agreed by the Government, are met.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, for taking my Adjournment matter on the important issue of sexual assaults.  The matter of child abuse has been central to recent discussions across the country and I recognise that the Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, made an announcement yesterday.  I tabled this Adjournment matter for yesterday, but it was only accepted today.  I will be interested in the reply.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight the good work being done by the north-west sexual assault services group, an informal partnership of representatives of organisations, including both police services, from across the north west that are involved in planning or providing services for people following sexual assaults.  In June 2009, it held a workshop to consider what a cross-Border model of services should look like.  It wanted to show just how joined-up cross-Border working could deliver, particularly in the areas of psychological, clinical and forensic and legal PSNI-Garda services.  It did this in the context of how the needs of the people of the north west could best be met and linked into the plans for the new regional centre in County Antrim.</P>
        <P>The majority of rape and sexual assault cases are perpetrated by someone known to the victim.  Almost one in five Irish women has admitted to having experienced domestic violence <Col N="1040"/>by a current or former intimate partner or spouse, a percentage of which is sexual violence.  Often, the child as well as the adult can be the victim in these assaults.  It is likely that we all know someone who has suffered and might feel that he or she cannot speak about the abuse.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that sexual violence and abuse are among the most damaging crimes and they impact in a traumatic manner on the physical, mental and sexual health of the victims for many years afterwards.  To minimise the long-term effects of abuse, we need an integrated approach to services across departmental lines as well as in a borderless manner in the north west.  We need to support the provision of experienced staff who will be available in appropriate locations and the maximising of resources through a co-ordination of services.</P>
        <P>Recently, a Garda station in Buncrana was informally opened.  Like many of the newer Garda stations, such as that in Letterkenny, it has its own sexual assault unit as a core part of the physical infrastructure.  It is vital that dedicated personnel be identified and given responsibility specifically for the remit of sexual assaults.  They must build relationships with groups on the ground, of which there are many.  By having consistency and a development of trust, there is the greatest opportunity to be able to share experience and drive the optimum response from all sectors involved.</P>
        <P>There is the argument that many people do not report at all.  As such, it might not be realistic statistically to have personnel exclusively dedicated to sexual assaults in small areas.  When there is a case of a sexual assault, however, it is important that an identified officer would be on hand to offer a professional and experienced handling of the situation.</P>
        <P>We must also explore ways to enable and facilitate people to speak out about what has happened to them.  We are now hearing of victims of sexual assaults carried out decades ago.  Their pain remains raw and their need for healing in a real and deep sense is as vital now as when the acts were perpetrated.  For many of them, their lives could have been different if they had felt able to deal with their attackers and expose them much earlier.  This is a key issue.</P>
        <P>In discussing this matter, I hope to call for a focus on tackling the issue of sexual and domestic violence in Border areas.  As a representative of a cross-Border area, I know that it is imperative that we tackle the issue of cross-Border sex attacks and assaults against women.  The Border can be and historically has been played.  An all-island sex offenders register must be a top priority.  Too often, alas, I meet a girl who has had a relationship with someone from a few miles up the road, often from over the Border, and who only found out too late that he had been sexually assaulting a child in the house when he was visiting.  The information exchange of who poses a danger to women or children is obviously vital.  The Border is not a physical wall.  In our area it is not a psychological wall, but the fact that there are two jurisdictions can provide a protective wall.  By maximising co-operation we minimise the potential for abusers to act with impunity.  It is imperative that we have a cross-Border network to allow the Garda and the PSNI to work together to ensure those who commit these attacks will be brought to justice and to close the loophole that allows offenders to move from one jurisdiction to another with the intention of evading prosecution.  We must look at how offenders are getting away with committing these heinous crimes and establish a system that will see them punished.  We need to support our newly qualified health workers who have specialised in this area.</P>
        <P>In the Republic of Ireland the national women&rsquo;s strategy 2007-16 proposes actions to combat violence against women through improved services for victims, together with effective prevention measures and prosecution.  In the North the Tackling Violence at Home strategy included a commitment for public sector and voluntary and community sector employers to implement policies within their organisations by 2007.  The Domestic Violence Act 1996 is the governing legislation in the Republic of Ireland.  In the North the issue of domestic violence is covered by the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004.  We need to maximise the potential of <Col N="1041"/>these laws to bring to an end domestic violence and also to reduce the potential for cross-Border sexual assaults to occur, keeping the victim foremost in our minds and actions.</P>
        <P>Sexual violence is a crime not only against women&rsquo;s or men&rsquo;s bodies, but also against their freedom, independence and autonomy.  I commend those working to support survivors of abuse but ask what we, as a Government and society, can do to assist them more.  I hope that following yesterday&rsquo;s announcement there will be a specific measure for the north west to give regional expression to the work being done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, I thank the Senator for raising the important issue of the development and co-ordination of cross-Border sexual assault services.  The Government takes the problem of sexual violence very seriously.  Heinous crimes are involved, with serious consequences for victims.  Owing to their hidden nature and the frequent reluctance of victims to report them, they are crimes which can be difficult to tackle.</P>
        <P>It is vitally important to provide effective services for victims of sexual assaults.  The Department of Health and Children, through the Health Service Executive, is very much involved in the provision of such services.  There are six sexual assault treatment units located around the country, all of which strive to provide a 24-hour service, seven days a week.  The units are located at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital in Cork, Waterford Regional Hospital, the Midlands Hospital in Mullingar, as well as in Galway and Letterkenny.  Alternative ring-fenced accommodation has been sourced for the units in Mullingar and Letterkenny to place them in a better position to provide care around the clock and to remove certain infrastructural constraints which have limited their ability to offer a 24-hour service seven days a week.</P>
        <P>In its 2009 policy on domestic and sexual violence the HSE outlined actions to provide for the standardisation of sexual assault services.  Important progress has been made in this regard.  In early 2009 the first group of clinical nurse-midwife specialists completed the academic component of the Higher Diploma in Nursing by passing the sexual assault forensic nursing examination in the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland.  These specially trained nurses are now providing holistic care for the victims of sexual assault in the sexual assault treatment units.  As well as undertaking a clinical and forensic examination of male and female victims whose cases will proceed through the criminal justice system, these nurses also provide care for persons who choose not to report an incident to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling sexual violence was reflected in the establishment in June 2007 of Cosc, the national office for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Cosc is a national executive office within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a whole of government remit to co-ordinate the work of the many organisations involved in addressing sexual violence.  The organisations include Departments and State agencies.  The non-governmental organisations working in this area deserve special mention for their commitment to service provision for sexual violence victims for many years.</P>
        <P>The recent publication of the national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence for the five-year period from 2010 to 2014 is a particularly important milestone.  The national strategy sets out detailed actions to strengthen measures to assist victims of sexual violence, while at the same time strengthening measures to deal with the perpetrators of such violence.</P>
        <P>In the context of work on the preparation of the national strategy, officials from Cosc met their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in June last year.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss matters of common concern, including opportunities for cross-Border working, the development of policy and awareness-raising, and the challenges still faced in tackling domestic <Col N="1042"/>and sexual violence.  There has been informal and positive contact between the parties since the meeting and it is intended to continue this co-operation.  One of the specific actions mentioned in the recently launched national strategy is exploring areas of work to identify those suitable for cross-Border co-operation in addressing domestic and sexual violence. This will strengthen the opportunities to engage in cross-Border work and improve collaboration to achieve one of the strategy&rsquo;s goals, namely, to deliver an effective and consistent service to those affected by domestic and sexual violence.  The process of identifying areas of work suitable for cross-Border co-operation, including consulting interested parties, will be completed later this year.  Specific projects will then be considered, in conjunction with our Northern Ireland counterparts.  More broadly and in line with Government policy the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform continues to engage with the authorities in Northern Ireland with a view to providing integrated and seamless co-operation across a number of policy areas relating to sexual violence.</P>
        <P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other persons from sexual violence perpetrators.  The Act requires persons convicted of a range of sexual offences to notify the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their address.  These requirements also extend to any offenders convicted abroad, including in Northern Ireland, of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State.  The Minister is reviewing the operation of the 2001 Act and expects to be in a position to seek Government approval later this year for a series of amendments to it.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service for Northern Ireland maintain close contact and exchange intelligence on convicted sex offenders.  A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Irish and British Governments in 2006 on the sharing of information on sex offenders between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, as well as other British police forces.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI subsequently signed an agreement on the sharing of personal data in relation to the investigation of sexual offences and the monitoring of sex offenders.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Probation Service works in close collaboration with the Probation Board for Northern Ireland to ensure effective communication is maintained regarding sex offenders who move between the two jurisdictions.  Protocols to this effect have been in place since 2006 and are being reviewed.</P>
        <P>In summary, the Government is committed to tackling the problem of sexual violence in meeting the needs of victims and dealing with perpetrators.  This includes building cross-Border development and co-operation, as appropriate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wonderful to see the work being done acknowledged.  The consultation process with interested parties will be completed later this year.  Do the interested parties consist only of the PSNI and the Garda, or will all other interested parties be included?  It is important that local groups working in this area are consulted.  If we are to do this exercise only once, I would like to think we will do it properly.  I hope the Department will keep me briefed on this ongoing issue.</P>
