	<P>I have received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to set out the current position on the proposed new A5 road from Dublin to Donegal, including the timeframe associated with the project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport to make a statement on her plans to reopen the sports capital programme in 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ciaran Cannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline progress on the development of phase 2 of the Loughrea regional water supply scheme, bearing in mind that Galway County Council has indicated it is now ready to produce contract documents for the project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Value-Added Tax Consolidation Bill 2010, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, motion re reports on macroeconomic and fiscal policy, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1; and No. 3, motion re fifth report of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security entitled, Second Report on Climate Change Law, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 and conclude within two hours, on which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon to reply ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take comments from leaders or spokespersons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extremely disturbing to see the Government using taxpayer&rsquo;s money to try to block the democratic right of citizens to vote.  I cannot believe that, after Senator Doherty won his case, it will now use more public money in a last ditch effort to stop people using their votes.  This is extraordinary.  I cannot believe I am seeing this following a judgment by the High Court or that the Government is intent on leaving three D&aacute;il seats empty and continuing to deny people in the constituencies of Waterford, Dublin South and Donegal North-East the right to vote.  This is what dictatorships all over the world do &mdash; they use mechanisms to stop people voting and giving them the right to vote.  This is extraordinarily serious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Who on the Government side will cry halt?  I ask the Green Party that question.  What we are seeing is extraordinary; it is about denying people the right to vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a constitutional point to be determined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We criticise regimes when they do this.  It is extraordinary that the Government is to move one writ but, it appears, not the others.  As Deagl&aacute;n de Br&eacute;ad&uacute;n rightly observes in <i>The Irish Times</i> today: &ldquo;It has taken the High Court to spell out the Coalition&rsquo;s constitutional duty and emphasise that the citizen is supreme&rdquo;.  </P>
        <P>It is time to realise the international bond markets are not impressed by this behaviour either.  We heard this morning the interview with the analyst who said broader factors were impacting on the bond markets, quite apart from the fiscal and economic policy that will be followed in the next few weeks.  These factors are influencing our reputation as a democracy internationally and at home.  It is time, therefore, the Government realised the seriousness of what is being done and how it is behaving.  Somebody must cry halt.  Last night in the House the Government&rsquo;s position was defeated and the Minister&rsquo;s view rejected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>As was Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the Leader intend to respect the motion passed in the House and the Independent Senators who initiated it?  When will the Minister respond?  The Government amendment to the motion was defeated.  Will the Leader inform the House about the intention of the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald has raised an important point, but I do not fully agree with her.  Since the Government has decided to proceed with the by-election, it could not be said justifiably that appealing the decision to the Supreme Court is an attempt to stop people from voting.  That is just a logical position.  However, the Senator&rsquo;s earlier points were absolutely correct.  An issue needs to be addressed and determined in this regard.  I consider what is occurring as an extraordinary use of taxpayer&rsquo;s money and I am concerned about the separation of powers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not coming down on one side or the other, but I am worried about crossing that border.  Senator Fitzgerald is correct that it is long past the time when the by-election should have taken place.</P>
        <P>The Government acted with alarming alacrity in response to the decision of the High Court yesterday.  On the basis of the importance of the Houses of Parliament regulating their own <Col N="485"/>affairs, it took a decision last night of which I approve.  Similarly, this House took a decision last night.  It may not be completely in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy, but the Seanad is a House of the Oireachtas and its decision was made democratically.  The motion asks the Government to extend immediately the right to vote to graduates of all universities from 1 January.  I ask the Leader to do what he believes is right in this regard.  Will he now put it to the Government that it should give effect to the will of the Seanad?  Will he obtain for us a formal response from the Government?  The speech made yesterday by the Government cost it the vote last night.  It was mocking and disgraceful.  That is the reality; I do not want to move further into the debate.</P>
        <P>The Green Party should note that there is now an open goal.  Action on the decision taken can be conceded at no cost to the other side of the House.  This should be done to show we believe in what we say.  Given that we regulate our own affairs under Article 15.10 of the Constitution, we must realise that if it is acceptable to go to the Supreme Court, it is also acceptable to put in place what we have decided on.</P>
        <P>We should consider positive developments.  Having listened to the analysts, I do not know what we can read into the figures for two good months in which the level of unemployment has dropped other than to say I am delighted with this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what we can make of the fact that this is the most attractive country for foreign direct investment, but I am delighted about this also.  I am also delighted that the value of our exports in the third quarter of the year is the highest it has ever been.  These are important points.</P>
        <P>There are steps that can be taken.  Why will the Government not take a decision on the metro north project?  Every analysis shows that the investment will be repaid on the double and create 6,000 jobs at no immediate cost to the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not mind Senators disagreeing with me on this, but they should listen to what I have to say first.</P>
        <P>Siemens Ireland which has been based in this country since it gained independence and which built the Ardnacrusha power generating station offered to put in place for free water meters in every home.  This would create jobs and a new conduit for the Government.  We should take advantage of this and move quickly on these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>How anybody could disagree with Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s contention that it is reprehensible for the Government to force people to go to court to have their basic democratic right to representation vindicated beats me.  If the Government wants to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, that is a matter for it, but it should not be done to block the other by-elections from being held.  They should not be made contingent on the Government going to the Supreme Court.  If there is an issue to be resolved by the Supreme Court, let it do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue in this case is not the separation of powers but the right of citizens to representation.  Senator Fitzgerald is absolutely correct that it is extraordinary that people must go to the High Court.  Members constantly argue in the House that the power of the courts is too great, but citizens are being forced to go to the courts to have their right to <Col N="486"/>representation vindicated.  That is extraordinary.  One could not reasonably disagree with a single point Senator Fitzgerald made in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to the debate that took place last night which is relevant as the House looks to its future, the question of reform of the Seanad, as opposed to its abolition, has been debated here and in the media.  After the debate last night, there is no question but that the reform option is rapidly running out of road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>If anything, the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech last night confirmed this as the view of the Government.  It is clear on the basis of the outcome of the vote last night &mdash; the Leader must face up to this &mdash; that the Government and the Leader have lost the confidence of this House on the reform agenda.  The Leader lost the vote on this important question.  I asked him last week on the Order of Business to indicate one thing he had done in the course of the life of this Seanad to reform the procedures used.  He told me he had introduced a procedure, whereby Ministers answered questions.  He did not introduce it as it has been included in Standing Orders for many years.  The fact is that he has achieved nothing in terms of procedural reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is unfair and untrue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will have another chance in a few minutes to tell us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will reply later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>He can think of something else he has done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is unfair and untrue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact is he has done absolutely nothing.  We on this side of the House have made proposals to liberalise the way we debate the economy but no action has been taken.  We asked for a petition system to be introduced, but nothing has been done in this regard.  The Leader has no interest in reform of the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is unfair and untrue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in saying we should have reform when the Leader is doing nothing about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>He has lost the confidence of the House because he lost the vote last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision yesterday by the High Court demanded a response and I am glad the Cabinet took the opportunity to make an appropriate one.  There is no pride in denying the people of Donegal South-West a by-election for 18 months.  I am on record as having said that period was too long.  It exceeds the previous record set in 1994 after a Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party Government had refused to hold by-elections in Mayo West and Dublin South Central for 15 months.  There is a need for a collective understanding, from the Supreme Court&rsquo;s perspective and in terms of legislation, in defining when by-elections should be held. <Col N="487"/> That is the wider point at issue that needs to be tested in the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court case is not an attempt to delay the holding of the other three by-elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>If not, the Government should name the dates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be no interruptions.  Senators are not entitled to interrupt other speakers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The three by-elections will be held by the end of March.  It has always been the intention of the Government to hold them together, with a wider electoral contest, to save as much money as possible.  The wider electoral contest will either be the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights or the election of a mayor of Dublin.  That remains the policy position and it will be acted upon.  I am trying to provide clarity as I know certain Members have a particular interest in the matter.  As a matter of course, the Government always goes to the Supreme Court on losing a High Court action where an issue of constitutionality is affected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not always do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>There are plenty of cases in which it has not done so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are to be no interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will point to very obvious examples where this has caused tremendous heartache for people.  I refer to education-related cases such as the O&rsquo;Donoghue case and the Sinnott case and health-related cases such as those involving those who had contracted hepatitis C.  These cases were taken by other Governments of other compositions.  It is an established practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the House should not be misinformed.  There are plenty of instances in which the State has not appealed a High Court decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will have her opportunity to speak.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>May I make a second point?  With regard to the vote last night, the views of this House need to be respected and responded to.  This needs to be done as quickly as possible.  I will play whatever role I can as a Member on the Government side in bringing the matter before the House as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, President of the High Court, delivered a very fine and considered judgment yesterday.  However, he did not deal with the separation of powers issue.  I understand and respect the views of the Attorney General, Mr. Paul Gallagher, on that matter.  As other Members on this side of the House have stated, it is a separate issue from that relating to the inordinate delay in holding the outstanding by-elections.  The two issues must be separated and that relating to the separation of powers must be parked.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take Senator Boyle&rsquo;s point.  Perhaps there is a need to decide, in a political context, what should be the normal period to be observed before by-elections are held.  Should it be three months, six months or should some other timeframe apply?  That matter should be resolved in order that disputes and political bickering will not arise, especially during periods of financial and economic crisis such as that which we are enduring.</P>
        <P>Whatever about his past record &mdash; Members on the opposite side of the House may differ with us in this regard &mdash; John Bruton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish again to raise the issue of the State raising funds through the sale of national solidarity bonds in the hope that we might get another opportunity to debate it.  The conditions attaching to these bonds are quite restrictive.  In that context, I ask the Minister for Finance and his Department &mdash; this matter was raised with the Minister at our special meeting with him yesterday &mdash; that the terms and interest rate relating to these bonds be improved and that the term of investment be reduced to a minimum of three years rather than five.  There is some &euro;100 billion in savings in the State, which is currently obtaining &euro;250 million from the national solidarity bond initiative.  That initiative was first put forward in this House.  Deputies and Senators should promote national solidarity bonds by making application forms available at their clinics and by distributing as much information as possible in respect of these bonds.  In addition, the national solidarity bond scheme should be extended to the Irish abroad, as happened on previous occasions.  Given that some 40 million people in the United States of America claim direct links with Ireland, there would be great potential for selling these bonds abroad.</P>
        <P>I request that the Minister for Social Protection advertise the fact that the thousands of Irish people who worked in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s are &mdash; in light of the national insurance contributions they paid &mdash; entitled to pensions from that jurisdiction.  I have brought this matter to the attention of people and have received a response.  I am aware of a number of individuals who applied for and have been given quite generous by the United Kingdom authorities.  We provided very good pensions to those in Britain who had pre-1953 contributions in this jurisdiction, and rightly so.  This matter should be highlighted to the widest possible extent and the Minister for Social Protection should place advertisements relating to it in all local newspapers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek a debate on education, not just in light of yesterday&rsquo;s events &mdash; some aspects of which were deplorable &mdash; but also that at least &euro;26 million in the building fund for schools remains unspent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is actually &euro;300 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for getting the figure wrong.  This means that there is &euro;300 million left to be spent with only eight weeks remaining in the current year.  I visited the community school in Kinsale, County Cork, earlier in the week where I met the headmaster and his students.  It is a remarkable and splendid school but conditions there are cramped.  The school is on the list for an additional building.  Why are schools such as this, which have fine staff and splendid students, not having their needs addressed, particularly at a time when &euro;300 million in funding is going to disappear back into the Department of Finance?  What is happening represents a real dereliction of duty.  One of the reasons provided in respect of why &euro;300 million still remains in the fund to which I refer is that building costs have dropped.  Members on all sides of the House have highlighted the latter fact on numerous occasions and stated that, for this reason, there should be an intensive building programme which would lead to the creation of further employment.</P>

	<P>I also wish to raise the matter of copyright in the music industry.  I have been in contact with the editor of <i>Hot Press</i> magazine and Mr. Paul McGuinness and I indicated that I was interested in pursuing this issue in a serious fashion.  I received misleading information to the effect that the Leader was going to raise this matter yesterday.  I checked the position and discovered that this was not true.  I have now received a letter inquiring whether I am genuinely interested in the matter because the Leader is going to raise the matter today.  I did not receive any indication that this was going to happen.  Will the Leader clarify the position in respect of this matter?  It is very difficult for people such as me who try to take the work of the Seanad seriously and who try to pursue issues such as music copyright which have a major impact on the music industry and artists.  It is very frustrating if the impression is given that matters are being raised when, apparently, action is not being taken.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In addition, the amount taken in through corporation tax has increased significantly.  It does not follow that jobs are created first and then businesses profit.  It is the other way around.  Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement is a good indicator that there will be further increases in employment in the future.  The quantitative easing taking place in the United States is another positive factor.  I am saddened, however, by the fact that commentators appear to be seeking every reason other than those of a positive nature for the drop in unemployment.  This is indicative of how some elements in the media view the way the economy is being run.  I am of the view that it is being run prudently and that matters are more positive in nature than the elements to which I refer suggest.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Opposition on winning the vote on Private Members&rsquo; business yesterday.  It is some achievement to win a vote against the Government.  I question how realistic it would be to have 23 people elected separately.  The quota required would be in the order of 50,000 and some individuals might attract 70,000 votes.  How could we expect those elected on foot of receiving 70,000 votes to be informed by a Minister for Finance, who may only have garnered between 10,000 to 12,000 votes in a general election, that they cannot deal with financial matters?  If people want to change the way the Seanad operates, they must be realistic.  Some of the ideas put forward were fairly hare-brained in nature.  It was suggested, for example, that the Seanad election could be held on the same day as a general election.  How could candidates from the various panels canvass Deputies and councillors in the middle of a general election campaign?  If people want good Seanad reform, they should consider the allocation of extra responsibility rather than changing a system which does not necessarily need to be changed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to comment on the protest involving students which took place yesterday, the events that occurred outside the Department of Finance and the comments that have been make in respect of the latter.  It has been frequently stated in this House that <Col N="491"/>the future of the country depends on the attitude and skills of young people.  I witnessed at first hand objects being thrown at the front gates of Leinster House and I saw many hundreds of people galvanising themselves very strongly and, in some cases, violently.  Yesterday, a certain part of a peaceful protest was taken over by those who have no priority other than to do damage and cause disruption.  These individuals do not have an interest in the legitimate issue that was the subject of the protest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What happened yesterday was just another manifestation of the aching despair that is going through the marrow of the country.  In that context, I refer to the comments that were made earlier on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and, more significantly, the BBC by someone who appears to be a respected analyst.  If she is not so respected, she certainly represents an organisation to which people listen. She said she could not see any way Ireland could avoid accessing the European rescue fund.</P>

Another organisation which is listened to said it does not believe our sovereignty will be intact by the middle of next year.  That is not acceptable to the country and it should not be acceptable to any political party in the State that a comment like that can be made.  The message must go out that not only will the Government take any steps that are necessary to ensure that does not happen but any future Government, regardless of its composition, will do the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday was quite a significant day in more ways than one.  I wanted to pick up on the comments made by Senator Coghlan and complement the former Taoiseach, John Bruton, on his comments which were very much in line with those of Senator Donohoe, in that a very positive message is being sent out, particularly to the bondholders, that it is hands off Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was also significant that at the IBEC conference at which John Bruton and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, spoke the message which came across from all of the participants, not from the political class but from those who are driving the economy and creating jobs, was that there was far too much negativity in the media about the current state of the economy which was feeding into the type of reaction to which Senator Donohoe and others referred.</P>
        <P>In that context, I ask the Leader to convey good wishes to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on the fact that the figures which were published yesterday showed that for the second month running there was a decrease in the live register and that the percentage of those unemployed had fallen by the highest rate since 1996.  I want to debunk the mantra, which has now become constant among those who have criticised the Government&rsquo;s economic and job policies, that there are 100,000 people emigrating from this country.  I want to blow that myth out of the water.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current CSO figures which I have show that the pattern of emigration has remained constant in the past five years and the net number to April 2010 of Irish nationals who have left this country is 27,000.  The remainder of the 65,000 who have left the country are non-nationals many of whom are, I presume, returning home.  To put the figure of 27,000 in context at the time of the boom in 2006 the net outflow of Irish nationals was 15,000.  Let us get real about this.  This is another aspect of the debate which is centring on Ireland&rsquo;s economic fortunes.  If one is going to criticise Government policy, one should at least get one&rsquo;s figures right and not scare the hell out of people in the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I add my voice to the others which have called for a debate on the consequences of the High Court decision and the issue of the right to vote and the represen<Col N="492"/>tation of people.  I take issue with what Senator Boyle said because he appeared to support the principle confirmed by Mr. Justice Kearns in the High Court, yet he justified the State&rsquo;s decision to appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis that it was in accordance with the precedence.  It is not.  There are plenty of precedents where the State decided not to appeal a decision it has lost in the High Court to the Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>The problem for us on a broader political level is that the continued uncertainty, even over the date of the by-election in Donegal South-West, because the Government has not given us the date, is contributing to the failure.  I would be grateful if the Leader could clarify the date.  The Government said it would be held before the end of November.</P>

The budget is currently set for 7 December but there is now a question mark against whether it can be brought forward.  The uncertainty is contributing to the slowness and lack of any economic recovery because people are fearful and need more clarity and certainty.</P>
        <P>On the issue of Seanad reform, as we all know the Government lost the vote last night in this House.  We on this side of the House have been calling for Seanad reform for many years.  The University Senators are unanimous in their endorsement of the need for reform.  We now need to see action from the Government on reform.  One of the key promises made by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, when he was elected was that he would ensure reform of the Seanad.  We still have not seen it and we do not need any more empty debates, rather, we need real action to fulfil the mandate the Government now has, having lost the vote yesterday in the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Se&aacute;n Lemass, on 21 March 1928 in the D&aacute;il said Fianna F&aacute;il was a slightly constitutional party and once again the party lives up to its slightly constitutional reputation.  On the one hand, it states it had a constitutional imperative to introduce a law on blasphemy which nobody wanted, yet at the same time it could subvert the Constitution and the democratic process by refusing to hold by-elections which everybody wanted.  The Green Party has been complicit in this as it voted down two motions on moving writs for the by-elections, notwithstanding its PR stunt yesterday in jumping the gun and calling for an immediate by-election in Donegal South-West.</P>
        <P>In one respect I welcome the appeal to the Supreme Court because it would give a definitive constitutional decision and direction on this point.  Without a Supreme Court decision the Government simply will not get the message that it cannot, beyond a reasonable period of time, refuse to hold by-elections.  In its recent report the Joint Committee on the Constitution suggested unanimously that a six month period should be enshrined for holding by-elections.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to another constitutional matter which is before the courts and which has been decided, namely, the NAMA case.  The courts interpret the law and will not pass judgment on the merits of the NAMA Act.  However, I question whether Members of this House and the Lower House fully realised when they proposed and supported the NAMA Act that they were signing up to a Soviet Union-style expropriation of profitable business enterprises for reasons of State.  The European Commission did not sign up to that either in its decision.  It is a matter of public interest and EU law, and my motivation in raising the matter is because it is a matter of public interest.</P>

	<P>Senators Mooney and Donohoe reminded us of the positive attitude we should be taking and Senator O&rsquo;Toole also reminded us of the good news on the employment and export figures and the fact we are the best and most attractive country for foreign direct investment.  I mention this because we cannot say these things often enough.  We hear enough negativity and we can do something about it.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned Siemens Ireland and the offer of something like &euro;1 billion which would achieve a huge amount of savings in terms of water rates.</P>
        <P>Last night&rsquo;s debate and decision were eventful.  I am anxious to know from the Leader what will happen about it.  Is it the case that we will nod our heads, say it is interesting and not do anything about it?  We cannot do that.  If one is to show respect for this House one has to take into account that there was a vote last night which went in a particular way.  It cannot be ignored and something should happen because the Seanad is in danger of being ignored on many other occasions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Saturday the mass of remembrance and thanksgiving for those who are involved in organ transplants to will take place in Corpus Christi in Dublin.  I mention it because the figures published today by the British Medical Association, BMA, show Britain has had an increase in organ donation last year of 5%.  It is ahead of us in the number of organ donations and transplants it has.  We are in 15th place, compared to Norway which is first and Portugal which is second because they have taken steps to encourage organ donation. The chief executive of the Irish Kidney Association pointed out that Norway is a wealthier country in Ireland and has the resources to have transplants, but Portugal is not.  We had a debate two years and two months ago.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, said she wanted time to consult before she introduced presumed consent and we have not had word back.  Now is the time for the Leader to check with the Minister to find out what is happening.  If she says we will not have presumed consent which the BMA is looking for in Britain at least we should know.  We had the debate and it seemed to get very good attention but let us make sure the Seanad is not ignored again.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to call on the Minister, Deputy Harney, to come to the Chamber to give us an update on the effectiveness of her recently introduced cancer excellence scheme.  Any fair-minded person, upon hearing of this scheme two years ago, would have argued that it was the right way to go, but only on the basis that they would receive excellent care when they got there.  The experience in Galway is quite the opposite.  Between the two main hospitals in Galway, there are 140 beds closed.  Any one of us who has had a near relative or friend going through the chemotherapy process knows what a harrowing experience it is.  It renders the person very fragile, both emotionally and physically.  It is disgraceful to have appointments being made for chemotherapy care and to have patients arriving at the hospital, assuming they will undergo chemotherapy and being turned away.  That is what is happening at present in Galway in this centre of excellence.</P>
        <P>On local radio in Galway last week we heard the harrowing account of a man bringing his wife on two occasions to the so-called centre of excellence only to have her turned away and not receive her chemotherapy treatment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I, too, welcome the fall in the live register figures.  It is a positive news story this morning.  Having spoken to some employers in recent weeks, they are determined to get the heads down, plough on and get out of this recession as quickly as possible, despite all the factors against them.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed to hear this morning of more than &euro;300 million of the capital budget of the Department of Education and Skills not being used.  There are so many projects on the list that need to be built right now &mdash; the Loreto school in Wexford is one that springs to mind &mdash; that we should move immediately to building those projects as soon as possible.  When we look at the way schools projects are dealt with by the Department of Education and Skills, and even planning projects within the Department of Health and Children, it beggars belief that it takes years for an ordinary school with four walls to move from one stage in the planning department to another.  I cannot understand why that takes so long.  In the private sector it does not take nearly as long.  Why have we so many people employed to do these things if they cannot even be done in a speedy or even an average normal fashion?  If a person was building a house, a hotel or whatever, it would not take even a quarter as long.  The matter needs to be debated and I would ask the Leader to hold such a debate soon.</P>
        <P>The debate on Seanad reform last night was embarrassing for Members on the Government side of the House because we too believe in Seanad reform.

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>If, as the political pundits seem to agree, there will be a change of Government at the next general election which may be soon, then I hope the new Government, represented by the Opposition parties here, will remember the old principle of clawback in the media, that whatever they give they take back with interest.  Nothing will change for the new Government in terms of bad press coverage, public pressure, street demonstrations, etc.  If anything, it will be much worse.  That being so, the Opposition parties should exercise a little discretion on good news.  I agree with Senators Mooney and Quinn that the negativity needs to end.</P>
        <P>On the general situation that will face the new Government and in its interests, I ask the following questions.  What disciplinary action has the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills taken against the civil servants who failed to spend the money they were given and which failure has been to the detriment of the building industry and of the children?  The answer is that nothing will be done about any of them.  That will go on until the Department of Education and Skills, like all of the other Departments, is privatised apart from a small hard core of public servants for discretion and confidentiality purposes.  Ten or 20 would be adequate.  If that was a private sector firm, heads would be rolling this morning.</P>
        <P>I want to ask the Minister for Justice and Law Reform whether he will look again at the situation whereby every public march in recent years, from Love Ulster to the May Day demonstration and the demonstrations yesterday, has been hijacked by the same group of people &mdash; local thugs from around town, persons wearing Celtic jerseys, &Eacute;irig&iacute; and a motley collection of Socialist Workers Party persons.  It is not good enough that young garda&iacute; and the man who is outside the gates of Leinster House with his candles, which were broken yesterday, should be injured and hurt for the sake of exercising some vague constitutional provision to march.  Why not march into the Phoenix Park and give people a place to march to?  Like the constitutional right in America to bear arms, it is a constitutional right that needs revisiting, especially in current times.  Lastly, I ask the Minister for Finance to stop terrorising old age pensioners and others and just make a few hard cuts in the kind of people who failed to spend the money in the Department of Education and Skills yesterday.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Harris in condemning the thuggish behaviour of a small few yesterday who were supposedly protesting in the name of a legitimate cause.  It is not good enough that young garda&iacute; and members of the security forces must endure that type of loutish behaviour.  I am all in favour of people having the right to protest, but it is about time that the people who are on our streets supposedly protesting took responsibility for their actions and that these people are held to account.</P>
        <P>I also join Senator Harris in asking the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills to come into the House to explain why the &euro;300 million has not been spent in the Department&rsquo;s budget.  It is far too simplistic to blame civil servants for it not being spent.  Has the Leader any concept of &euro;300 million?  It is almost one third of &euro;1 billion.  Look at the number of jobs in the construction industry it could create for idle qualified trades people and builders.  More importantly, at another level, look at what one third of &euro;1 billion could do to help us in the smart economy by educating young people in less crowded classrooms and in decent facilities.  It is not acceptable that the money is not spent.  It is not acceptable merely to blame the civil servant.  Where is the political master, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan, who is deputy head and the second person in charge of the Government?  That shows that we need reform of how we do business by reforming the public service and by creating efficiencies.  It is the deputy leader of the Government, the T&aacute;naiste, who is responsible for the Department.  Can she come to the House to explain why the money is not spent?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yesterday I made the point that I believed there were people on the sidelines waiting to exploit the anger and emotion felt during the current economic crisis.  I do not believe these people genuinely want any solution to the problem.  What we saw yesterday mirrored exactly the point that I was making.  I suggested that we should look closely at what is happening in Greece where we saw it as peaceful protest initially, then becoming violent and eventually becoming exceptionally extreme.  People will be listening closely to every word we utter in this House, in the D&aacute;il and in public as well.  I do not believe we have reached as yet the ultimate of this type of protest.  I agree fully that the majority of those protesting yesterday were good, decent young people who were exercising a democratic right, but Senator Harris has put his finger on it.  All the various protests which have taken place in this city and other parts of the country have invariably been hijacked.  Yesterday, I walked right through the crowd and could see the two elements there, but what I also saw were the young garda&iacute; outside who were never exposed to this type of extreme violence previously.  It is vital for us not only to condemn what has happened but to analyse and make quite clear that it makes no contribution whatever to a resolution.</P>
        <P>We also should be careful.  I praised Fine Gael yesterday morning and I will do so again this morning.  The balance that I hear from that part of the Opposition to my way of thinking is being influenced by the knowledge that there is a greater danger to our democracy awaiting us, not just the IMF.  I genuinely hope we all take time to realise what is that danger.</P>

	<P>I want to make a point on the decision made by the Government last night to appeal to the Supreme Court the judgment secured in the High Court on behalf of the people of Donegal South-West.  I do not agree with statements today made by the Labour Party and by other Opposition parties on local radio stations that there was no choice for the Government but to appeal it to the Supreme Court.  It is clear that the issues at hand were dealt with fairly and squarely by the President of the High Court.  Precedents such as the McKenna judgment mean the courts have a right to step in when the rights and entitlements of citizens are being denied by the Executive.  That was the finding of the President of the High Court yesterday, that my rights and the rights of 71,000 people under the Irish Constitution were being denied by the Executive.  The Supreme Court stated in the McKenna case that the <Col N="496"/>courts have the right to step in when the Executive denies the constitutional rights of the citizen, and that they then, and only then, should interfere with the running of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a disgrace that the appeal will be launched.  It is clear there is only one reason the Government is doing so, which is to frustrate the attempts of my party or any other citizen to take a legal challenge on the Waterford and Dublin South by-elections in particular.</P>
        <P>It is interesting the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, referred in his findings to the 90-day recommendation that came from the Oireachtas Constitution Review Group.  There is now serious scope for people to seek recourse to the courts with regard to forcing both by-elections, given that the Government does not intend to hold those by-elections until mid to late April, which will mean the seats will have been vacant for more than a year.  It is doubly a disgrace that the Government decided on the same day on which people woke up to learn &euro;6 billion of cuts would be inflicted on them to spend hundreds of thousands of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money defending the case.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, we spoke about Seanad reform and I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole on tabling the motion.  I did not necessarily agree with everything that was stated, but with regard to what we can do I appeal to the Leader to restore some confidence in the Seanad &mdash; if it can be restored &mdash; by convening an all-party meeting immediately with the purpose of introducing a Bill to allow for the automatic filling of vacancies in by-elections within 90 or 180 days.  Let us discuss it together.  Let the Seanad state we respect the courts.  Everyone states they agree the filling of casual vacancies should not be left to the Government, depending on how popular or unpopular it is.  It is something positive we could do and the public would welcome the Seanad taking that initiative.  I ask the Leader to do so today.</P>

	<P>A total of 84% of the age cohort from 65 to 74, and a total of 89% of those aged 75 and older, rely on social transfers including the State pension to protect them from the risk of poverty.  Any cut to the State contributory pension, for which people have already paid through their PRSI contributions will be resisted by older people.  Older people have already taken a 2% effective cut because of the elimination of the Christmas bonus last year.  They pay carbon costs and increased dental costs.  If there is any change in the State contributory pension and if protests are held outside the door I will be there with the older people.  It is my responsibility.  I am spokesperson on older people and yesterday I spoke at our policy group meeting with the Minister for Finance and I will do so again with the Taoiseach this morning.  They will be absolutely out of their minds if they touch the pension.</P>

This recession has been going on for a long time, and at the time, it was a local response to a national crisis.  In the past two days, I have been contacted by Oman with 100 teaching jobs on offer and those involved want to attract only Irish teachers.  This is good news because they are stating they believe in Irish teachers and our education system.  The message from the OECD is that education is the driver of growth.  I regret to state those jobs are not in this country but it is still a vote of confidence in our education system.</P>

	<P>We have had some interesting debates in recent weeks on economic matters, the budgetary situation, the Croke Park agreement and related matters.  In view of the fact that today we are advised the Government will pronounce its judgment on the level of fiscal adjustment to be provided for in December&rsquo;s budget, it is very important that the House reverts next week to a debate on economic matters.  If, as we are advised, a sum of &euro;5 billion will be withdrawn from circulation, there is a duty on us all of us to debate this figure and the options, and to highlight areas where money could be saved or better spent.  We all have a duty in this regard.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>What has really frightened me in recent days are newspaper headlines concerning the forthcoming budget and the fact that it now appears the future of the Government is dependent on a number of Independent Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is quite scary that Independent and maverick Deputies of all shapes and sizes can dictate the economic <Col N="498"/>agenda of Government and the economic future of the country.  This is why, even at this very late stage of the game, it should be very much part of the Government&rsquo;s agenda to debate very frankly with the Opposition parties the economic choices available and see whether some degree of consensus can be found.  There is much good will on this side of the House and on the part of my party to try to work with the Government, if it offers some degree of economic leadership.  I am frightened, however, at the prospect of a number of Independent Deputies, for whom their constituency and not the country is everything, will dictate what happens and what does not happen in December&rsquo;s budget.  Let us play our part next week by reverting to an economic debate.  At least we can debate the principles and see whether some degree of progress can be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss the &euro;330 million left in her Department&rsquo;s capital fund for building projects, given that there are only two months in which to spend it.  I agree with Senator Harris that no heads will roll and that this is immoral.  A school in my parish has eight prefabs which means children are being taught in substandard accommodation.  The design team was appointed four years&rsquo; ago and I fail to understand the reason the school has not been helped.  I am sure there are hundreds of other schools in the same situation.  It was suggested on radio this morning that perhaps a slush fund was being created for use in a general election.  I ask the Leader to deal with that suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Harris exhorted us to do our best to dispel the negativity.  There are two sources of negativity that need condemnation by the House.  Ms Megan Greene from the Economist Intelligence Unit suggested Ireland was destined&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator not to name persons outside the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise.  She suggested Ireland was destined to take the same road as Greece and become dependent on an international bailout.  This view is not sustainable and is a slanderous attack on the country.  In fact, her argument did not stand up to critical questioning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  It is based on a negative frame of mind rather than on fact and she was unable to substantiate it.  This is worthy of mention.</P>
        <P>I refer to the negative reaction to the protest by students.  With Senator Healy Eames, our education spokesperson, I saw the entire protest on the Merrion Street side of Leinster House.  Thousands of students had gathered, but there was no violence.  There was a very pleasant, good humoured and constructive atmosphere.  The few who hijacked the protest near the Shelbourne Hotel belonged to a distinct group.  They included many middle-aged adults.  Their photographs are being shown all over the world today and it is bad publicity for the country.  It is important, therefore, that we dispel such negativity.  The vast majority of the students involved in the protest were excellent.  The one thing they will want to hear today following all the bad publicity is an assurance from the Leader and all Members of the Seanad that something will be done about job creation in the budget.  It is not enough to talk about fiscal correction only.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to consider the immediate introduction of a national insulation scheme to boost the construction industry, generate taxation revenue, bring an end to fuel poverty and affect the importation of fossil fuels, a point I will develop later.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, Coghlan, Mooney, Bacik, Regan, Doherty and Healy Eames all gave their opinions on the High Court&rsquo;s decision on the holding of the Donegal South-West by-election.  I suggest we have a debate on the filling <Col N="499"/>of vacancies in general which would encompass a debate on the European list system under which a vacancy can be filled the following day.  We should include all of the options for consideration in such a debate.  I will discuss this at the leaders&rsquo; meeting on Tuesday.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Hanafin, Quinn and McDonald asked about Seanad reform and the outcome of the debate last night on the Private Members&rsquo; motion.  We now know that the Minister intends to publish the White Paper and I will have no difficulty in discussing his proposals as soon as the White Paper is available.  All groups and parties have made submissions to the Minister and the Department and we await their response.  No one is holding up the process.  I am and always have been in favour of Seanad reform, but the decision rests with the Department.</P>
        <P>The Cathaoirleach and Members are bound by Standing Orders.  Senator Alex White is also a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which controls Standing Orders.  I will be as efficient as I can be in responding to all requests made by colleagues on both sides of the House on the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Hanafin, Mooney, Quinn and McDonald asked about providing information for the House on positive announcements with regard to corporation tax and the monthly unemployment figures which are good for a second month.  The way the economy has to be addressed has changed completely.  The construction industry was a massive contributor but is now practically non-existent.  Everyone has to look for alternative ways of earning income and generating wealth.  That Ireland is seen as the most attractive destination for foreign direct investment is a fantastic vote of confidence in this and previous Governments, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>I suggest the proposal made by Siemens be discussed at the leaders&rsquo; meeting next Tuesday to see how it can be progressed.  It is an incredible offer to the State.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden asked about the national solidarity bond to raise funds from our own people.  I will convey his strong views on the issue and that of pensions to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris, McDonald, Harris, Buttimer, Healy Eames and McFadden asked about the sum of &euro;300 million saved owing to the competitive nature of tendering and the value for money obtained by the Department of Education and Science.  It is good news that such savings have been made by the Minister and officials.  They have obtained value for money and made savings to the tune of savings of &euro;300 million, which must be commended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure all Members will agree we must consider how we can reinvest the money in the education portfolio next year.  </P>
        <P>Senator Norris asked about copyright in the music industry and intellectual copyright in general.  I have decided to arrange an all-day debate on this topic next Thursday.  It is a very serious matter, on which guarantees need to be given, as Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation is at stake.</P>
        <P>Senators Donohoe, Harris, Buttimer, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Mooney asked about the students who came to Leinster House yesterday in vast numbers to make their views known in no uncertain terms.  Others have referred to them as good decent young people.  However, the scenes outside the gates cannot be allowed to be repeated.  Young garda&iacute; put their lives at risk to protect this institution.  Violence cannot be condoned.  I will fully support anyone who wishes to make his or her views known in a march or demonstration.  However, it has to be peaceful.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="500"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Mooney, Harris and others referred to negativity in the media.  I welcome the fact that in the past few weeks it appears the national broadcaster is demonstrating balance.  This House criticised it previously.  As we all have, I have been listening to the national broadcaster on my way to and from Leinster House.  Balance is returning to the media and there is a sense of responsibility, which I welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn referred to organ donations and transplants.  As I said previously, we debated this issue two years ago and I have no difficulty doing whatever we can to promote this.  It makes common sense. I will have no difficulty in providing time for a debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cannon referred to cancer patients in Galway.  What he said was alarming, to say the least.  I will contact the Minister&rsquo;s office after the Order of Business because we were given assurances in regard to these centres of excellence.  Regardless of the recession and the downturn, these centres of excellence must not be affected.  Word should be sent to the HSE that this House will accept nothing but 100% support.  A poor person with cancer sending her husband to see if there was a bed available in order that she could get chemotherapy was unacceptable and disgraceful.  I will see what I can do.  If we need to debate this issue in the House next week, I will set aside time to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mary White has stated that 84% of our elderly people rely on the State pension.  As we all know, more than 500,000 people are over the age of 65.  I support Senator Mary White in terms of anything we can do to make Government realise 84% is a serious percentage.  We support most of what Senator Mary White said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Bradford and O&rsquo;Reilly called for a debate on finance.  We have had many debates since we returned after the recess and I will have no difficulty in providing time in the coming weeks to discuss the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s announcement later today.</P>
        <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P el="0" Just="Left">I thank the Oireachtas joint committee for tabling this motion and acknowledge its valuable contribution to the ongoing national debate on climate change.</P>
        <P>The committee&rsquo;s second report on climate change law is timely and welcome.  I appreciate the considerable amount of work that went into producing the report and the importance of having a cross-party perspective to influence and inform the development of future policy and legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The all-party basis on which the report been drawn up is particularly valuable in encouraging and building public support for strong climate change legislation.  The urgency of mobilising an effective global response to climate change demands consensus at all levels, from local level to <Col N="502"/>wider international level.  As Members know, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and I have continually emphasised the importance of cross-party agreement on the climate change agenda.</P>
        <P>Primary legislation is a hugely significant step in terms of underpinning our commitment and determination and cross-party consensus on key elements of the legislation will serve to reinforce that signal for stakeholders and observers.  In seeking to keep a sharp focus on the climate change in Ireland, we must aim to keep it above political point-scoring and tactics and I am happy to respond to the motion on that basis.</P>
        <P>The global economic crisis has shaken the foundations of the world as we have known it.  Things we have taken for granted in the past are now being called into question in a fundamental way.  In the place of what we now know was over-confidence about our future is a clear realisation that we face a number of unprecedented challenges which will have a major bearing on our well-being, our prosperity and our responsibility to future generations.  At the top of the list is climate change where the challenge is heightened by the failure to reach agreement on a new climate treaty at the UN climate conference in Copenhagen last December.</P>
        <P>At a recent lecture at Harvard University, Connie Hedegaard, the European Commissioner for Climate Action, issued a clear reminder of the massive human, economic and environmental costs the world faces from climate change.  Referring to the deadly floods in central Europe, floods and mudslides in Mexico and China, the record-breaking heat wave in Russia and then the catastrophic monsoon flooding in Pakistan, the Commissioner expressed a view, which I share, that these extreme weather events either reflect climate change at work today or are a foretaste of it.</P>
        <P>Jumping out at us from the economic and environmental circumstances in which we find ourselves are some very clear messages.  Principal among these is the finite and incredibly fragile nature of our planet&rsquo;s resources. Failure to refocus and reinvent ourselves in response to these messages is simply not an option.</P>
        <P>The extent to which the economic crisis is dominating our attention inevitably means that it would be all too easy to overlook or defer other priorities.  Climate change is the greatest threat we face and urgent and decisive action is required if we are to avert its worst impacts.  We cannot afford to overlook or defer our response to climate change.</P>
        <P>What is the way forward?  The answer lies in global transition &mdash; a significant global step change, setting the world on a new low carbon path that will prove economically and environmentally sustainable in the long-term.  That is the real challenge on the international agenda and the context in which we must develop our own response to climate change.</P>
        <P>Therefore, in dealing with the economic downturn, we must not fail to look beyond it.  If global transition is inevitable, and I believe it is inevitable, we must plan now to ensure that our return to economic growth is environmentally sustainable in terms of carbon intensity, resource efficiency and climate resilience.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is the outlook of a responsible and successful society and is the approach the majority of Irish people will support.  The challenge for the Government and governments everywhere is to achieve the balance necessary to drive our economies forward, protecting jobs while fostering innovation, all the while moving on a new low carbon trajectory.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The climate change Bill, which the Government will bring forward shortly, will provide the foundations for transition to a low carbon, resource-efficient, environmentally sustainable and climate resilient society.  This approach is consistent with the direction in which EU policy is expected to develop under the 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the anticipated EU roadmap for 2050 which the European Commission is expected to bring <Col N="503"/>forward early next year.  Equally important is the fact that effective transition is consistent with and complementary to our own pursuit of world leader status for Ireland in the green tech sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since taking office, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has given substantial time to the preparation of the heads of the Bill.  Finalising the outline of the Bill has taken somewhat longer than expected but it is a matter of the utmost importance that we get the structure and proposed provisions right.  Our approach must be balanced yet effective; ambitious yet realistic.  In finalising the outline of the Bill, we will have regard to the joint committee&rsquo;s report and I look forward to engaging with the committee on the proposed provisions when details of the Bill are published shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Green Party in government is determined to ensure the legislation enacted will not just enshrine the policies and principles to reflect the core national objective of playing a real and progressive role in the global fight against climate change but will also act as a driver towards achieving a more sustainable future across all sectors of society in Ireland.  In many respects the heads of the Bill we are developing have similar provisions to those contained in the report prepared by the Oireachtas joint committee.  Both approaches provide for a climate change strategy, a national adaptation plan and the setting of key emission reduction targets.  However, while carbon accounting is a prominent feature of the joint committee&rsquo;s approach, transition underpinned by integration will be the underlying principle of the Bill the Government is developing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to make it clear that I am not dismissing the importance of targets.  They are important indicators of our progress; we cannot lose sight of the big picture &mdash; the long-term vision of where we want to be.  It is a significant and necessary change in our approach to climate change policy.  Transition is so fundamental that we need a clear and strong focus on the ultimate objective &mdash; a future that is economically and environmentally sustainable &mdash; if we are to map out a progressive and successful journey.  Transition is not a political option or a politically motivated philosophy; it is a pragmatic and positive approach to ensuring the safety of the planet and the well-being of its peoples.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important also that we match the legislation with real efforts in other complementary legislation and regulation.  I am proud that during the past three and a half years the Government has taken significant strides in the direction towards achieving a low carbon economy.  We brought in a radical step-change in the national building regulations, which provided for a 40% reduction in energy use in the building sector in all new build developments.  That took place within six months of the Green Party forming part of the Government.  We are set to bring about another 60% improvement in energy performance based on levels in 2005 by the end of this year and we look forward to the end of 2013 by which time the regulations introduced will have provided for zero carbon housing.  That is another radical step.  It is a dramatic step-change from the kind of construction that took place during the Celtic tiger years.</P>
        <P>I know from my experience as an architect and a town planner that we can build zero carbon housing today and many firms and individuals are doing it.  I do not see any reason we cannot enshrine that in law.  That is a practical example of what can be done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday, together with the Railway Procurement Agency and representatives of the Luas contractors, I launched a carbon calculator.  It will enable people taking light rail journeys to check the low carbon nature of them.  The carbon cost of a journey by light rail is approximately one fifth of what it would be to travel by car.  Things like that make a difference.  I appreciate that the Luas is a Dublin phenomenon but we have to ensure that the public transport network nationwide is integrated and that all players can contribute to making available low carbon transport regardless of where one lives in the State.</P><Col N="504"/>
        <P>The legislative proposal under development should go beyond ensuring compliance with our EU and wider international commitments.  In providing a legislative underpinning for proactive transition, it will present the Irish people as an informed and progressive society pursuing a smart economy in the truest sense of the term &mdash; an economy that is highly productive, competitive, resource efficient and environmentally sustainable.  It is my firm intention that our proposed Bill will be both innovative and inspirational, and I look forward to a frank and honest public debate involving all stakeholders when further details of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions are announced in due course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I spoke about the construction sector and planning.  We have brought in significant new planning legislation that will concentrate future development in the right places but significant progress has also been made in the energy supply sector.  Ireland has reached a target of 15% for renewal energy this year, which is the second highest in Europe.  That is a remarkable achievement and it has been reached in a few short years, yet our targets are much higher.  We want to achieve a target of 40% for renewable energy by 2020.  That can be done.  Firms in this sector exist and Irish companies are developing the switch gear, turbines and the necessary work to reinforce the grid nationally to make this a reality.  However, it cannot happen in isolation.  We need to have strong interconnnectors to export Irish renewable electricity to the world but that structure is also in place with the work under way on the east-west interconnector.  We are moving ahead in the energy sector, which is as important as the headline legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the wider international level the immediate priority for the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is to pursue a programme of work that will ensure real and substantive progress at the 16th Conference of the Parties, which will get under way next month in Mexico. I would like to see a high level of ambition for the Cancun conference, a level much closer to the level of ambition that the EU set for the Copenhagen conference.  However, I recognise the need for compromise in order to recover from the disappointment of the Copenhagen conference and to take a substantial step forward.</P>
        
        <P>EU willingness to accept a stepwise approach and EU openness to considering a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol reflect a genuine effort to understand and accommodate the positions of other parties.  I was privileged to represent Ireland at the EU environment committee in Luxembourg a few weeks ago and I was heartened by the discussion at it; 27 member states agreed that we need a second Kyoto Protocol period as a fall-back if we do not get that global agreement in place by the end of the year, which seems unlikely.  It is important that all parties make a genuine effort to understand and accommodate the EU position, particularly on the need for environmental ambition and integrity, consistent with achieving the ultimate objective of the framework convention on climate change.</P>
        <P>I am determined that Ireland, within the EU, will continue to play its full part in the international climate change process and provide tangible leadership in preparing to meet the increased level of mitigation that a new global agreement will require.  Progress on our own transition agenda will be key to our preparedness to contribute to the global mitigation effort and to the leadership for which the EU is acknowledged in the international process under the framework convention.  The European Union can hold its head high.  It had led internationally in efforts to tackle climate change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also proud of the work that has been achieved in Ireland.  My party produced the first climate change Bill put before the Oireachtas five years ago.  We followed it up with a Civic Forum on Climate Change a year or two later.  We have since seen good work conducted by Senator Bacik in publishing legislation.  We have also seen some significant developments at <Col N="505"/>the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security where a framework for a Bill and the heads of the Bill have been prepared.  All that contributes to the efforts in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensuring we have legislation that is robust, inclusive and that points the way forward in helping Ireland in its transition to being a low carbon economy.</P>
        <P>The majority of the new jobs being created are in the low carbon sector.  Real jobs are being created in the low carbon economy, whether in power energy, water services or in the new media industry and they are a huge boon to Ireland&rsquo;s economy at a very difficult time.  I have no doubt that the future is a low carbon one and that the legislation the Government is preparing will make a significant contribution to setting Ireland on that path.</P>
        <P>I thank the Members of the Seanad for allowing me to speak and I look forward to the discussion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, and hope we will have a fruitful discussion on this important area.</P>
        <P>Climate change is proving to be one of the most defining issues of the 21st century.  The Stern report, which was instrumental in bringing about the United Kingdom&rsquo;s climate change legislation, strongly advised that the cost of inaction in terms of addressing climate change would be far greater than the cost of taking action now.</P>
        <P>Since the Industrial Revolution in the mid-18th century, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere has increased at a very significant rate and the effect of human activity since 1750 has been one of global warming.  In the past 100 years the average global temperature has increased by 0.74&deg; Celsius and 11 of the past 12 years rank among the warmest since 1850.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We have seen the effects of global warming in Ireland.  Since 1980 the average temperature here has increased by 0.42&deg; Celsius per decade.  The number of days of frost has also significantly decreased, with the greatest decreases recorded at Clones and Shannon weather stations.  We are also more than aware that rainfall levels have increased at an extraordinary rate.  We need only think back to the devastation caused by heavy rainfall in the west and south last year when homes and livelihoods were washed away by torrential flooding.  The human cost of global warming is clear and the prospect of such severe weather events becoming a recurring reality appears ever more likely.</P>
        <P>The impact of global warming on Ireland is long-ranging.  Agriculture will be affected as livestock feed changes from grass to maize, the humble potato becomes virtually unviable and the need for irrigation increases in the east of the country.  In terms of water supply an increase in winter flooding will place significant pressure on water supply infrastructure during dry summers.  A tragic point to note is the possible extinction of many native and iconic species of bird, such as the curlew and long-eared owl, both of which are synonymous with our heritage and culture.  It is imperative that these species are protected.</P>
        <P>The climate change law will be paramount in helping Ireland to position itself as a low carbon society and will facilitate it in meeting its European Union and international commitments.  Section 4 of the Climate Change Bill 2010 produced by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security states: &ldquo;It is the duty of the Taoiseach to ensure that the State&rsquo;s net carbon account for the year 2050 is at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline.&rdquo;  It is imperative that we achieve the target set out in the section, particularly given that Ireland depends on fossil fuels to meet more than 90% of its energy needs.  Such dependence has many disadvantages, especially in terms of security of supply with finite fossil fuel resources diminishing daily and the geopolitical concerns surrounding the countries that supply us with oil.  These factors are <Col N="506"/>fast becoming a reality and need to be given due consideration when we discuss the future of Ireland&rsquo;s energy needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s emission reduction targets need to be tougher.  Adoption of the climate change Bill would ensure the Oireachtas agrees tougher targets.  These are set out in section 5(2) which states: &ldquo;The Taoiseach may, having had regard to scientific evidence, technological developments and national energy policy, establish more stringent targets than the targets established by the European Union&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Ireland is more than well positioned to reduce its carbon emissions and become a pioneer in renewable energy.  New scientific developments that further the case for climate change are emerging daily.  It is the responsibility of national leaders to pay attention to these developments and recommendations.  Making the Taoiseach ultimately accountable for meeting climate change targets would have two distinct advantages.  First, given that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s authority extends across Departments, this would encourage cross-party involvement which has numerous benefits.  Second, the engagement of the Oireachtas in the project means there is a certain level of accountability at parliamentary level.</P>
        <P>The Irish corporate leaders group on climate change argues that climate change legislation needs to be enacted before the end of the year to ensure certainty for business.  According to the group, the Government&rsquo;s recent announcement that emissions will be reduced by 3% per annum between now and 2020 is too vague to provide any decent level of certainty.  In its view, the Bill should include legally binding, five year targets and set out clearly how a balance will be struck between cutting emissions in the household and purchasing overseas credits.</P>
        <P>Promoting energy efficiency has distinct benefits.  While the environmental benefits of energy efficiency are frequently and correctly spoken about, energy efficiency also presents opportunities and benefits for society as a whole.  Part 5 of the Bill deals with incentives and grant support to schemes that would provide financial assistance to individuals and assist Ireland meet its carbon emission targets.</P>
        <P>I spoke on the Order of Business about an important issue on which immediate action should be taken.  I refer to the need to introduce a programme of nationwide insulation schemes, particularly for low income households.  Such a programme has the potential to reduce carbon emissions and cut the cost of living for householders.  In light of these twin benefits, the merits of introducing such a scheme are a no-brainer, particularly when one considers the high cost of home heating bills for many individuals, particularly low income households.  In the current economic climate we must embrace these types of incentives and examine various means of reducing the cost of home heating and energy related bills.  The scheme I propose would deliver a tax return to the Exchequer, the State would benefit from cheaper tender costs in the procurement process and the construction industry would benefit.  It is essential, therefore, that a national scheme is introduced in the short term.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the proposed legislation would establish a new body known as the office of climate change and renewable energy which would perform all the functions outlined in the Bill.  This is a most welcome development as it would result in the establishment of a separate body able to advise on national policy and climate change and support negotiations at European and international level.  In so doing, it would give to the various elements of the proposed Bill the support they deserve.  I am heartened, therefore, to learn from the Minister of State that the joint committee&rsquo;s Bill will essentially be adopted by the Government.  It would be bizarre if that were not the case given the all-party support given to the legislation in the joint<?oasys _jy ?>committee.</P><Col N="507"/>
        <P Just="Left">Section 14(2) states the office of climate change and renewable energy &ldquo;shall co-ordinate and support in particular initiatives which promote the accelerated deployment of electric vehicles, energy efficiency, renewable resources including wind, tidal, solar, ocean, biomass and biofuel energy&rdquo;.  Gaeltacht Energy in County Cavan is an excellent wind energy company which is in the national finals of the enterprise awards.  It has informed me that it has the potential to create several hundred permanent jobs and up to 2,000 temporary construction jobs.  To do so, it must secure access to the grid.  This requires a review of the current gateway system, under which projects that are ready for the grid are being held up by projects for which planning permission has not yet been secured.  This company has many good projects around the country that are worthy of consideration and is only one of many companies involved in wind energy production.  Ireland also needs to focus on bio-fuels, an area on which the House recently introduced legislation. I welcome the Climate Change Bill 2010, as I would welcome any legislation which not only benefits the environment but provides for significant gains for citizens.</P>
        
        <P>We must embrace a national insulation scheme and take a radical, proactive approach to securing access to the grid for wind energy projects.  We must also strengthen our efforts in the area of tidal energy.</P>
        <P>I am sceptical of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the railways.  For a long time, I have supported efforts to establish a rail link from Dublin to Navan and, subsequently, from Navan to Kingscourt along an existing rail line.  My colleague on the Government side, Deputy Martin Brady, who has family connections to the region, also supports this objective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All these proactive steps must be taken to do something to give expression to the principles, philosophy and terms of the Bill and the second report of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  Real action is needed from now on and that is my commendation to the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  While I have not prepared a lengthy speech, this subject is dear to my heart and if Members will pardon the pun, I will speak off the cuff on it.  I wish to raise a few matters relating to climate change because it has become a subject about which it is perceived that ordinary people cannot do much.  Climate change is perceived to be something that does not affect people at a local level, that has different phraseologies attached to it and that almost has a language of its own in which people talk about Copenhagen summits, the Kyoto Protocol and so on.  However, I believe that climate change must be brought down to a local level because while there are major question marks against what exactly is causing what and what affects what, there is no question but that considerable climate change is happening in Ireland.  Meteorologists clearly can demonstrate that there have been great changes in our climate and, consequently, it is not a debate as to whether climate change is happening but on what is its cause.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I often hear reference to the time of Galileo, when many people considered the Earth to be flat.  I wonder whether we are in a similar time, given that certain people are trying to deny that there is climate change when one can see how the seasons are changing or the manner in which flowers and plants are coming out earlier or later than was the case heretofore.  It is clear the climate is changing and the real question is what is causing it.  There appears to be an enormous body of evidence demonstrating that while in many cases climate change is caused by natural phenomena, it is sometimes tipped over the edge by human activity.  There are many aspects to human activity and in Ireland, methane emissions from cattle are a major factor.  Obviously carbon emissions are produced each time someone drives a car.  Carbon emissions arise from many different sources and there are many different types of greenhouse gases.  Although this area is quite complex in some ways, it is also quite simple in others, as the question is how does it affect one personally or one&rsquo;s children or the man on the street.</P><Col N="508"/>
        <P>I hear repeatedly that people in Ireland cannot really do anything about climate change because there are so many people in China and India that anything we might do would be irrelevant and would not matter because we are a mere drop in the ocean.  However, it does matter and one should consider what Frank Aiken did regarding nuclear non-proliferation.  Ireland is a country that, if it stands up to be counted, can show the way forward to other countries.  It can show that things can be done, it can innovate and can be the leader in many areas.  Members should consider the recent introduction of a smoking ban and a plastic bag tax.  In both cases, Ireland was a leader and many countries have followed suit.  Ireland can make a difference.  If we can get things right we can show the way to others and this is the reason it is so important because this is a global problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People tell me that the Green Party is useless because it is propping up the Government, presiding over an appalling economic situation and so on.  However, the Green Party has<?oasys _jy ?>always had a very long-term view on matters.  It is a highly relevant party both in Ireland and in pretty much every country in Europe.  It has a very important message, which is that the environment is absolutely crucial to our well-being.  I was delighted to hear Senator O&rsquo;Reilly refer to various wildlife, several species of bird and so on because when I was growing up as a young lad, such subjects were never discussed in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When I first raised such matters at city council level, people laughed at me and thought it was quite amusing.  I finished my term on the council recently but by that time, people had ceased to laugh and were making the very speeches that I had made at the outset, which I believe constitutes great progress.</P>
        <P>However, there are many aspects to climate change and I have in my possession a little cartoon which shows a world summit on climate change taking place.  One character turns to another and declares it all to be a big hoax, to which the other character responds by asking whether that meant they were going to make the world a better place for nothing.  Many issues relating to climate change pertain to good practice in how we live our lives and have huge benefits in other areas because cutting down on carbon emissions will make the world healthier.  For example, it means that people will not suffer from asthma to the same extent.  What is wrong with cutting down on pollution?  Why not do so as it is such an obvious thing to do?</P>
        <P>Members also should consider other relevant matters.  For example, there is an issue in respect of energy security and peak oil.  It is known that oil is running out and the only question is when.  In common with many other Members, I have lived through an oil crisis and it is known that the supply of fossil fuels will run out some day, although it is not known exactly when.  Many people advocate the nuclear option but it also has a limited, albeit unknown, lifespan which, depending on the person to whom one speaks, is estimated to be between 30 and 60 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, I wish to note some recent very good news in Ireland.  I believe there were three occasions on which more than 50% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy needs were met by renewable energy sources.  I acknowledge this does not happen all the time and believe the average figure is approximately 15% or 16%.  However, this proportion is climbing all the time and by 2020 or probably earlier, on some days &mdash; I emphasise some days &mdash; I believe that more than 100% of our energy needs could be met from renewable energy sources.  Ireland uses approximately 5 GW to 6 GW of electricity and I understand that planning for approximately another 15 GW is under way.  Consequently, on those days when conditions are absolutely perfect, there will be great oversupply of wind energy.  Although this will not be very often it will happen and this is the reason for building interconnectors and linking into the European grid.</P><Col N="509"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">Great progress has been made by the Government in recent years and I hope progress will continue as strongly in the future.  Moreover, Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions are falling and although some people ascribe this to the recession, Government policy is also contributing to this fall.  It is absolutely crucial that this proposed climate change Bill be passed.  Ireland has huge budgetary problems but climate change has not gone away and will not go away.  It is a problem that will continue to face us into the future.  Many people of my acquaintance who are experts in this regard are extremely fearful of climate change.  The difference between losing a bit of money from one&rsquo;s pocket and losing vast tracts of our cities or vast numbers of the planet&rsquo;s population is considerable.  Personally, I consider climate change to be a much more serious problem.  Some people who speak about climate change even suggest that it poses such a danger that it could wipe out the human race.  I do not know whether that is the case and do not believe that anyone does.  However, this threat must be taken seriously and cannot simply be put to one side because the country is in a financially difficult position.  On the contrary, this is an opportunity to get our house in order and to do things differently.  I am heartened by Fine Gael policy, such as the NewEra document.  I note Fianna F&aacute;il policy has also moved considerably and I am heartened by that as well.  Nevertheless, the Green Party has made an enormous contribution in this area and will continue to so do long into the future.  Climate change is more important than the economic crisis that we face but it is perceived to be a longer term issue.  However, if one considers what is called the green new deal, the good news is that both issues can be solved together.  The United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, has stated that the issues of climate change and economic downturn can be solved together.  Developing the green economy and doing things in a more sustainable fashion seem to be how many parties see the way forward.  However, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, for the huge amount of work he has put into this for many years.  It will be a huge lost opportunity if the climate change Bill is not brought before the House as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The joint committee has done fantastic work.  I have attended a number of meetings and know that members from all parties have made positive contributions.  This House has had several debates on the need for consensus; the Green Party has pushed the idea that consensus is vital in this area.  That is, largely, what we have.</P>
        <P>I commend schemes such as the green flag school scheme which brings the issue to the lowest level and asks schoolchildren what they can do to alleviate matters and live a better life.  The scheme is administered by An Taisce.  In Galway city, for example, every school has a green flag.  This brings a magnificent benefit to the education of young people.  Whatever else is cut in a forthcoming budget, this scheme should not be cut; it needs to be protected, as such a small amount of money brings a great benefit.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report and support the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is always a joy to hear him speak, whether from a script or even more so when he speaks off the cuff.  As he is present, I take the opportunity to comment on something Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly touched upon.  He referred to the curlew which is under huge threat.  Although it is very rare, it is, amazingly, on the list of birds that may be shot from this month.  One is allowed to shoot the curlew.  This is not allowed in Northern Ireland where shooting the curlew is out of the question.  A former Member of this House, Eamon de Buitl&eacute;ar, says this makes absolutely no sense.  I am taking the opportunity to touch on the matter because I know it is close to the Minister of State&rsquo;s heart.  There has been great success achieved in protecting the grey partridge in County Offaly.  Ten years ago there were fewer than 20 alive.  Because they are being protected, that number has now risen to 900 as a result of the success of the BirdWatch Ireland scheme.</P>
        <P>I also wish to touch on something to which Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in referred.  He said human activity might not bring the world to destruction but one need only go to Chile to see this is a <Col N="510"/>possibility.  I had the opportunity to travel there some years ago.  I did not get a chance to visit Easter Island, but I have read about it.  Anyone who does not think the world might be damaged, or brought to an end, by human activity need only read the story of Easter Island.  I advise Senators to look it up on the Internet.  It is fascinating and a reminder of what could happen.</P>
        <P>I picked up the report with great interest and have gone through it.  It seems like a worthwhile contribution to the debate on climate change, even though there is a similar Government version.  However, it could be argued that this report is more detailed than the Government plan and there are a few points I would like to raise.</P>
        <P>When  it comes to taxes to reduce  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, for instance, we must bear in mind that the economic downturn has reduced energy consumption significantly, a matter on which the Minister of State has touched.  They hit a worldwide peak in 2007.  Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions fell by nearly 8% last year, a massive amount, and the first time a fall has been reported in 20 years.  Owing to the effects of the economic downturn, all sectors of industry and commerce recorded a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions for the first time in two decades.  Therefore, should we rush into producing more climate change legislation?  Does the public simply associate the fall in emissions with a fall in economic growth?  There is that danger, on which we have touched today.</P>
        <P>The report sets a target for energy efficiency, but there is a lack of detail in it on how emissions would be cut.  The target of an 80% emissions reduction by 2050 is very ambitious, but is it realistic?  I would be inclined to agree with Richard Toll of the ESRI.  He has written that the 20% emissions reduction target by 2020 contained in the report cannot possibly be met without draconian measures such as a prolonged depression or a ban on cows.  Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in has also touched on this aspect.  A target of 30% would, of course, be even more difficult.</P>
        <P>The green movement sometimes brings forward figures that are out of touch with reality.  For instance, Mr. Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault-Nissan, one of the largest car makers in the world, and one of the keenest supporters of electric cars, appears to believe one in ten new cars in 2020 will be all-electric.  The goal for Ireland goes far beyond this.  We are saying one in ten cars &mdash; new and old &mdash; in 2020 should be all-electric.  As a business person, I would inclined to listen to the view of an expert like Mr. Ghosn on such matters before the multitude of Government reports produced every year.</P>
        <P>A professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado, Mr. Roger Pielke, has a new book entitled, <i>The Climate Fix: What Scientists and Politicians Won&rsquo;t Tell You About Global Warming</i>.  It is worth looking at.  I have not read all of it, but I have glanced through it.  In it he argues that we cannot decarbonise the globe without sacrificing economic growth until breakthrough technologies are available and that the speed of their development will be proportionate to the spend on research and development.  However, he does have a solution in which he favours spending much more money on innovation to produce renewable energy technologies that would be cheaper than fossil fuel technologies.  The money would come from a modest carbon tax which, given current low levels of energy innovation, should still be enough to make a difference.  The direct aim of this strategy would not be to produce a less bad climate but reaching the more measurable goal of bringing energy supplies to those in the developing world currently starved of them.  Mr. Pielke accepts that this would mean higher carbon dioxide concentrations worldwide and all that would entail and advocates reallocating climate efforts towards dealing with these impacts.  It is an interesting and much broader concept than the narrow concept of climate change we have in Ireland.  Look at the fact that China pumps out the same volume of emissions in one day than we do in one year.</P><Col N="511"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>We should also be much more mature and debate the issue of nuclear power which would help us massively to reduce emissions.  I know the Green Party would state it could not have anything to do with it.  However, the Green Party in Britain has changed its attitude.  It has swung right around and states it is now in favour of nuclear power.  It seems sensible if we are really committed to tackling climate change to consider this renewable source of energy.  Over 50 nuclear plants are under construction, of which more than 20 are in China.  It could be argued that it is taking the longer term view, based purely on engineering principles rather than the emotional rhetoric with which nuclear power is burdened.</P>
        <P>We are always holding up great examples of people who innovate or create jobs.  Look at, perhaps, the most famous innovator of all, Mr. Bill Gates.  He has emphasised that governments should focus on developing energy technologies such as nuclear power and next generation batteries.  To meet the 2050 deadline for cutting carbon emissions, he is promoting a nuclear power approach called terrapower to develop nuclear reactors that would run primarily on natural or depleted uranium rather than enriched uranium.  The reactors could be loaded up with such fuel and sealed for 30 to 60 years.  The money we spend on four years&rsquo; worth of carbon emissions credits is just shy of the &euro;1 billion it would take for Ireland to build a medium-sized nuclear power station.  Such investment may not make sense at present, but let us take a more rounded and longer term view.</P>
        <P>To help think through the economic impact of a carbon tax or similar measure, the Australian Government is consulting many of the country&rsquo;s top business people on the issue.  Why are we not looking at consulting similar persons here?  The Government wants to create jobs, but it cannot then make it harder for business people to create them by imposing even more harsh conditions on them, even if it is in the name of the environment.  I agree that the long-term aim of protecting the environment is essential.  I have mentioned how I was affected by the story of Easter Island, but it is extremely difficult to convince people of the merits of protecting the environment if the Government introduces measures which may cost them a job.  I am also concerned that the report recommends even more bureaucracy and the establishment of new institutions.  Countries like Germany manage climate change within existing institutions.  Given our situation of being lumbered with hundreds of quangos, I am somewhat concerned over the proposed establishment of an office of climate change and renewable energy and a climate change commission.  Can the multitude of well-qualified civil servants in the Department not fulfil this task, for example?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Do the report and the Government recommendations really matter as it could be legitimately argued that climate policy will be set not by us but by the European Commission?  As Ireland is an EU member state, we have to comply with specific emissions targets set by Brussels.  Is this legislation merely grandstanding by politicians to make us look good at conferences?  Should we stop pretending that Brussels does not set the agenda in this area?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must not step blindly into fixing climate change by imposing more taxes and conditions on businesses that stifle those very businesses.  We have seen a massive reduction in emissions in the past three years and should remember that economic growth is our priority.  I accept it is necessary to be a juggler and to keep all the balls in the air.  However, this debate gives us an opportunity to take it a little further along the road.  What I have heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, and Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in has been very useful and is a step in this direction.  I welcome the opportunity to debate the matter.  If we concentrate on it, taking into account the other challenges that face us, we can achieve what we are setting out to do.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue of climate change.  &ldquo;Climate change is not for me; it is for somebody else to look after&rdquo; seems to be the attitude <Col N="512"/>of some.  Pollution is a key issue and a widespread problem in this country.  It is caused particularly by dumping on land and at sea, and by other activities such as slurry spreading.  Dumping at sea is an issue at Dollymount Strand in my area.  Any evening one goes to the strand, there will be heaps of empty cartons and bottles washed up &mdash; Senator Quinn probably also observe this.  This material does not appear by accident and there is no doubt it is dumped from ships.  These issues must be tackled.</P>
        <P>The dumping of domestic waste along roadways is another issue.  Fines should be at least &euro;1,000 for anyone caught dumping because the current fines of approximately &euro;150 are too<?oasys _jy ?>low.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly addressed the issue of pollution.  I do quite a lot of fishing in Cavan and Monaghan.  As I have just said to Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, one rarely sees water hens, wild geese or ducks and the heron has disappeared completely.  I have reached the conclusion that pollution is one of the main causes of this.  It is a very important point.  As Senator Quinn said, mankind can destroy the ground it walks on as well as its environment.</P></Speaker>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Alexandra White.  We will resume the debate with Senator Brady, who has four minutes of his time remaining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate my point with regard to the insufficient level of attention being paid to pollution, especially that caused by dumping at sea, and the fact that pollution controls are not being properly enforced.  It is important we should focus on this issue, especially in the context of the damage being done to wildlife.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Senator Quinn referred to wind and other forms of alternative energy.  I do not believe there is sufficient interest in alternative energies because some people are of the view, for example, <Col N="513"/>that it is much too expensive to erect wind turbines, etc.  That is an aspect of the matter to which consideration must be given.</P>
        <P>Another issue which arises is transport.  Government agencies and Departments, for example, the ESB and other semi-State companies and the Department of Defence, etc., should take the lead in this area by ensuring they use electric buses and trucks and vehicles powered by natural gas.  There is no reason this could not happen.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to rail transport and cited the possible establishment of a link from Dublin to Navan and on to Kingscourt.  The latter would remove a major amount of traffic from the roads in the area and pollution levels would be reduced as a result.  The Senator also referred to wind energy and the possibility of using old water mills to generate power.  A great many resources of this type throughout the country remain unharnessed.  The possibility of harnessing these resources has not been investigated to a sufficient degree.  I am of the view they could be so harnessed and with very little trouble.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly informed me that on one occasion he and a colleague carried out a count of the number of mills in County Cavan and that this had proven to be a very useful exercise.  These mills also add something to communities, especially from the point of view of heritage.  Some of them are beautiful old buildings and a couple are located in the area from which I come.  It is terrible they have been allowed to fall into such a state of dilapidation.  Some use could be made of them, even if only from the point of view of encouraging tourism.</P>
        <P>Pollution, particularly that caused by those who spread slurry in an irresponsible manner, can also have a major effect on tourism.  I have no wish to mention particular areas in this regard.  As stated, however, I like to fish and I visit a particular lake to do so.  The stench in the vicinity of the lake to which I refer is affecting businesses, bed and breakfast establishments, etc.  The fines relating to pollution are too low.  We must put in place a deterrent which will make people think twice before they pollute, dump rubbish on beaches, etc.  For reckless slurry spreading and so forth, the minimum fine should be &euro;10,000.  For other offences, the fines that apply should be pitched at approximately &euro;1,000.  We must take the route I am advocating and if we do not do so, we will just be wasting our time.</P>
        <P>People must realise the seriousness of climate change and should not adopt an attitude to the effect that it is a problem with which someone else must deal.  I recall meeting the President of the Czech Republic who informed me that climate change was a load of rubbish and that people&rsquo;s rights were being infringed upon.  He further stated that people should be at liberty to do whatever they desired.  It is not about infringing on people&rsquo;s rights; it is about educating them in order that they will recognise that climate change must be tackled.  If we do not take action in respect of climate change, destruction will be wrought on both humankind and the planet.</P>

	<P>Its ring tone is creating quite a nice rhythm.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this matter.  We must take immediate steps to introduce legislation in respect of climate change.  It is three years since the Green Party came to power and had a commitment relating to climate change included in the original programme for Government.  That is far too long a period for action not to have been taken.  When the current Seanad was first convened three years ago, Senator Bacik introduced a Bill on climate change which remains on the Order Paper.  Unfortunately, the House has still to conclude its deliberations on that legislation.  Senator Bacik had hoped to contribute to this important <Col N="514"/>debate but owing to the unforeseen break in Seanad proceedings, she cannot be present because she has another engagement.  The Senator asked me to pass on her apologies.</P>
        <P>There is a need for immediate action in respect of climate change.  The recession may have slowed things down but time is not on our side.  We cannot afford to sit back while the recession rages because the threat posed by global warming will not go away.  In October, the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security published its Second Report on Climate Change Law, which sets out the statutory framework that will be required in this area and which has all-party support.  I commend my colleague, Deputy McManus, on her contribution, as rapporteur, to the work of the joint committee and to ensuring the report was published.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recognition given in the report to the role agriculture can play in providing bio-fuels and biomass crops.  Promoting green energy measures is one way of harnessing the natural resources at our disposal to help combat the effects of climate change and create much needed employment.  The potential benefits are far too large to ignore and if we act immediately and introduce favourable legislation to support the creation of a green economy, Ireland could become a world leader.  We all have a part to play in this regard.</P>
        <P>There is a high level of unemployment in County Meath which is in the commuter belt and has suffered more than most counties.  There are particularly high levels of unemployment among those aged under 25 years and we need to offer new ideas on how we can get them back to work.  The green economy offers one way of doing this.  I am working to increase awareness of how counties such as County Meath could benefit from the creation of jobs in the green sector and next Thursday night I will host a seminar in Ashbourne to examine the potential of the sector.  We will consider things like how local farmers could benefit from the green economy and how business people and the community at large could help to create jobs in wind energy projects, community wind farms and the production of biomass fuels.</P>
        <P>I was in Copenhagen last December during the climate change convention.  I attended one session to discuss how sheep farmers in north Wales had got together to form a co-operative to examine the possibility of establishing community wind farms.  They had managed to erect three wind turbines in the neighbourhood which provide electricity for 1,600 homes.  They are now planning on expanding the project to provide even more turbines to cater for up to 7,000 homes.  This shows that local people, acting as a community, can make things happen.</P>
        <P>At one of the sessions at my seminar next week participants will explore how local communities in places such as Ashbourne can come together to address their own energy needs in a way that helps the environment.  To help them in their efforts we need to introduce legislation to ensure there will be no barriers to allow farmers, businesses and communities succeed in their efforts.  The opportunity to create employment is one not to be missed as the jobs created are often at the higher end.  We have an abundance of natural resources which can help us to meet our energy requirements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no reason, given our favourable climate, that we cannot become a net exporter of green energy, resulting in even higher levels of economic activity and lower energy emissions, both of which are within the terms of the report of the joint committee.  The Minister of State will be aware that work on the interconnector between Ireland and the United Kingdom is under way.  The interconnector will cross my constituency of Meath and will help us in ensuring energy security and a sufficient supply will be available at all times of the day and night.</P>
        <P>With regard to the medium and long-term targets and the key measures needed to meet them, we have made very little progress in meeting the goals to which we signed up at Kyoto a number of years ago.  We need to reaffirm our commitment to achieving these goals and legally binding targets.  The British have introduced legislation to overcome this problem in a <Col N="515"/>very short timeframe.  They have a legally binding target of achieving an 80% reduction in carbon emissions within the next 40 years and I call for a similar target to be set here.</P>
        <P>Others have mentioned the transport sector which accounts for 20% of our emissions.  We, therefore, need to examine how we manage our transport infrastructure.  I welcome the recent opening of the Dublin to Dunboyne railway line.  We need to consider very carefully how we can further extend the service to places such as Dunshaughlin and Navan.  We also need to consider increasing the frequency and speed of the Dublin to Belfast rail service.  Engineers Ireland issued a report earlier this year in which it suggested the population along the east coast from Dublin to Belfast would double within the next 20 years.  To make sure we can cater for such an increase and grow economic activity, we need to have better transport links.  Public transport services are the answer.  Therefore, the Government needs to consider how we can increase the frequency and speed on the service mentioned.</P>
        <P>We also have to be careful about where we spend our money on transport infrastructure.  I am not convinced on the need for projects such as metro north because I have yet to see a cost benefit analysis.  I hear figures being bandied about this and the other House that suggest the ratio will be 2:1.  If that is true, it is not bad, but I would like to see some figures.  I do not buy the line from the Government that the figures are too sensitive to be given and that it will produce a redacted report.  We need to see the full figures.  Before we head down the road of spending vast amounts of money on the project, we need to be sure it is the best way of spending money.  It must not be seen as a Famine road project.  While we need to spend money on infrastructure and increase the public transport infrastructure in place, we need to spend money in a cost-effective way.  It may be the case there could be a guided bus system or improvements could be made to the quality bus network.  I am not sure, but I am sure that we have not yet seen a convincing case being made for the metro north project, something on which the Government has not moved forward.</P>
        <P>Setting legally binding targets would have the advantage of creating certainty for businesses.  Improvements to public transport infrastructure would help us to meet legally binding targets and mean businesses would have confidence to invest in equipment which is often expensive and will yield long-term benefits in terms of cost and protection of the environment, as demonstrated in the recent letter from the Irish corporate groups which pressed the Taoiseach to introduce climate change legislation.  The Bill needs to be brought forward as quickly as possible.  My party tabled an amendment to the Order of Business four weeks ago today to allow us to debate the introduction of climate change legislation.  On that date the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, the Deputy Leader, Senator Boyle, told us, &ldquo;The heads of the Bill have been largely agreed.  There is one area of disagreement which appears to relate to who is responsible for what.  I am confident this disagreement can be overcome in the next fortnight or so.  I am stating my personal frustration on this matter.&rdquo;  We are two weeks beyond his sell-by date.  Does the Minister of State have any words which might sooth or calm him in this regard in terms of the introduction of climate change legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>As I was, unfortunately, not able to be present for the entire debate, I had a good discussion during the vote in the D&aacute;il with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, who briefed me on what had happened here.  As a Green Party Deputy, tackling climate change is a key issue for me and my party.  I  thank Senators for their contributions, in particular the two Senators present, Senators Brady and Hannigan.  I welcome their input and the general recognition in the Houses of the Oireachtas of the critical responsibility to address climate change.  We all know that it is the greatest moral imperative of our time that we introduce a climate change Bill because the effects of such change have been devastating across <Col N="516"/>the world, in particular in low-lying countries.  It is important also that we recognise that Ireland has existing legal obligations in respect of greenhouse gas emissions.  The key purpose in enacting climate change legislation in Ireland would be to establish what I would call the architecture needed to achieve the objectives of binding EU and legal agreements.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of climate scientism.  John Kenneth Galbraith said, &ldquo;When faced with the choice of changing one&rsquo;s mind proofing, there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.&rdquo;  The reality is that the science is unequivocal.  However, complex truths which challenge the status quo and the perceived consensus wisdom are often vulnerable to symbolism.   However, even the most ardent sceptic cannot deny that business as usual is no longer an option for any of us and that future economic and employment opportunities will be delivered in low carbon, resource efficient green economies.  We are entering a new era in which energy prices are likely to increase significantly.  We also want to make sure the economy, our businesses, small towns, villages and communities are protected from the effects of climate change.  We can, therefore, positively embrace change and reap the economic, social and environmental benefits or let the major advances in transition pass us by.</P>
        <P>Addressing climate change and energy security are two sides of the same coin.  As we know, Ireland is one of the countries most dependent on fossil fuels.  As a consequence, the economy and our society are acutely vulnerable to energy price inflation.  The International Energy Agency has warned that by 2015, oil supply could face difficulties to keep abreast with increasing demand, leading to further increases in oil prices and potentially shifting the global economic recovery.  Domestically sourced energy such as renewable energy brings major benefits in terms of reduced reliance on those imports.  Ireland, due to geography and climate, has among the highest potential for renewables anywhere in the world and we need to boost that still further to develop these industries here at home.  I note the remarks of Senators in the debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Carbon prices are likely to remain low for the foreseeable future, acting as a disincentive for change and innovation.  Within this context, the requirement for strong, legally binding targets enshrined in primary legislation is clear.  A strong climate change strategy will act as a critical force for modernisation and a keen catalyst for transition to an energy secure, low carbon society.</P>
        <P>I say to Senator Hannigan that we are working hard to bring the Bill to the House, dotting the &ldquo;i&rdquo;s and crossing the &ldquo;t&rdquo;s, and ensuring it is fit for debate when it comes into the House.  I understand it is with the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>There is a widespread international consensus that the development of resource efficient and green technologies will be the major economic driver of the new century.  As countries worldwide seek to boost their economies in the economic crisis through stimulus packages, there is a clear pattern of investment being directed towards infrastructure for less polluting transport.  I note Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s remarks about the east coast transport corridor, but we also must not forget rural transport.  Rural transport is incredibly difficult.  As a rural Deputy and Minister, I know how difficult it is for people to leave the car at home and get public transport in rural areas.  I hope in the budget we can maintain support for rural transport.</P>
        <P>As countries worldwide seek to boost their economies in the economic crisis through stimulus packages, as I stated, we must ensure we cut down on those emissions.  With intelligent traffic management systems, low-carbon energy production, smart electricity grids, clean transport and energy related research and development, clear signs of transition towards a low-carbon economy are emerging across the world.  We must ensure we tap into that potential to create a considerable number of jobs in our country through public transport, retrofitting of houses, the green economy, the smart economy and the digital economy.</P><Col N="517"/>
        <P>The attractiveness index now cites the United States, especially those states with renewable portfolio standards, and China as the best investment opportunity for renewable energy, but we in this country have vast resources.  Whether it is deep geothermal heating, wind energy or wave energy, we must tap into that.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is doing his best to push that boat out as much as he can.</P>
        <P>Ireland has some unique geographic, climatic and human capital advantages on which to capitalise within this new global economic reality.  Global competitiveness is fierce, however, and China, India and the United States have moved rapidly from lagging positions to being the international forerunners and principal global players.  The United States is aiming to double its renewable energy generation by 2012.  In 2009, China topped the global league table for wind power.  Chinese and Indian wind turbines now appear in the top ten.  We are moving towards the manufacture in Ireland of concrete wind turbines rather than importing them from other countries, and I welcome that new initiative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The global green technology sector is expected to grow by at least 10% per annum in the medium to long term and in the context of securing national economic recovery, Ireland can ill afford to be left behind.  We, in government, and especially the Green Party, are pushing that forward to create those jobs to help us out of the economic tough times we are in.</P>
        <P>Numerous high level business interests have called for the urgent enactment of strong climate change legislation to provide the long-term certainty to business and industry to give them the confidence to enable them to make the long-term investment decisions necessary to capitalise on the new economic opportunities within the global transition to a low-carbon economy which is under way.  Within the prevailing stressed global economic environment, one of the key deterrents to making investments is the absence of regulatory certainty as to the future direction of public policy.  The introduction of strong climate change legislation will send a clear signal to the global investment and business community that the direction of public policy in Ireland is unambiguous and that Ireland is a prime location for long-term investment.  The certainty needed can only be provided through primary legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank everyone in the Seanad and address a remark to Senator Hannigan about his forthcoming meeting to encourage business.  I have been trying to make Carlow the first green energy town in Ireland for the past five years and have met numerous investors.  I travelled to the town of G&uuml;ssing in Austria, which the Senator should visit if he has not been there previously.  It is a prime example of a town which was down on its luck, with no employment at all and whose young people were leaving, coming back to full employment through biogas plants, bio-fuel plants and cutting edge technology.  I suggest he Google it on the web.  G&uuml;ssing in Austria is the most fantastic example of what can be done when one is down on one&rsquo;s luck.  I have been there and seen it for myself, and I am trying to move my home town of Carlow into that sphere where farmers, business people, investors and other local people can create jobs and where, importantly in this day and age, our young people can tap in to these cutting edge technologies.  In Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s part of the world, there is an IT college and good third level institutions.  We also have that in Carlow.  I want to ensure that all of us, not only Carlow but also the constituencies represented by Senators Hannigan and Brady, can tap in to this to ensure that with good climate change legislation we can bring good economic prospects.</P>
        <P>I thank everyone in the House who spoke.  I look forward to bringing forward comprehensive climate change legislation on behalf of my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe.  I believe we will have that legislation shortly.  This has not been a political points scoring debate.  It is important to have cross-party support for what I have said because it is the greatest moral imperative of our time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach as ucht cuidi&uacute; liom an r&uacute;n seo a chur &oacute;s comhair an T&iacute; agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, Deputy Mary White.  The motion before us is a simple and practical one regarding the sports capital programme.  Rather than entering into a long speech, I will pose a simple question.  Will there be a new sports capital programme and will it be inclusive of sports and the community and municipal swimming pool fund?</P>
        <P>Sports capital funding has been a lifeline for clubs and local communities.  Clubs are immersed in the community, as the Cathaoirleach knows well from his own background and the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White, will be aware from her involvement in sport.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Sports clubs and groups and community groups have benefited from the sports capital programme.  It has also brought a new lease of life to communities, both urban and rural.  The postponement of the funding of facilities in 2010 was understandable given the economic climate in which we are.  The programme has been closed for almost two years, as it was closed in 2008.  Times are different now in the building industry, as prices have become far more competitive and have reduced considerably.  Many people in the construction industry would be very well-qualified to assist local clubs, no matter how small or big, with projects.  I hope the Government will commit to embarking on a sports strategy programme through the provision of new facilities in a project of regeneration and renewal of community life in Ireland.  We have enough depression, people being down and bad news.  Today, we could have a good news story for sporting clubs and community groups if there was a commitment by the Government to recommence the sports capital funding programme.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>In 2008, the then Minister from Waterford, Martin Cullen, stated it would be postponed.  Has it been postponed for the duration of the Government, no matter how long it has left in power?  Will it be reopened?  Where does the money from the national lottery go at present?  It was created by Donal Creed in 1985 to assist in the funding of sport development projects.  Where does the money go?  As the Fine Gael spokesperson on sport, Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony, stated in the D&aacute;il, this would act as a stimulus for local communities and local businesses.  It would be a great tonic for sporting and community groups.  The stimulus approach is in operation in other jurisdictions and countries and we need to have it here.  We need to have it in our sporting organisations.  We have tremendous potential.  The improvement of facilities has been put on hold or suspended because there is no funding.  My club in Bishopstown had almost 700 people join the Cork county board draw last month; it was the only club in the country to increase its membership.  There is goodwill towards sporting clubs and if they get seed capital from the Government they will embark upon a project and commit to it.  My club is building a hurling alley and a fundraiser was held recently at which we raised thousands of euro.  There is money in the account but we need matching funds from the Government to finish it.</P>
        <P>I hope even though we are in an economically difficult time there will be a positive outcome to the recommencement of the sports grant.  I hope the Minister of State will look at it from the point of view of creating employment, generating VAT and tax returns for the Government, and creating great goodwill and hope among people and uplifting them.  I hope we will look at <Col N="519"/>this provision of extra facilities for young people and those in communities as a means of regeneration.  I look forward to the response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue; he knows how interested I am in sport.  Given the benefits associated with sporting activities, the Government regards expenditure on sport as important for the social and economic development of the country.  These benefits arise in a wide range of areas including health and wellbeing, social and cultural development, education, personal development, tourism and the economy.  It can also play a valuable role in tackling social exclusion and this is particularly true for young people.</P>
        <P>The sports capital programme, which is part funded from the proceeds of the national lottery, is the primary means of granting Government support for the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It would be no exaggeration to state the programme has been of benefit to communities the length and breadth of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the sports capital programme, the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport provides funding for voluntary, sports and community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.  More than 7,400 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to more than &euro;738 million.  The programme has, in the past ten years, transformed the sporting landscape with improvements in the quality and quantity of sports facilities in every part of the country.  The facilities funded range from the smallest clubs to national centres of sporting excellence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The aims and objectives of the programme are to foster an integrated and planned approach to the development of sports and physical recreation facilities throughout the country; to assist voluntary and community organisations to develop high quality, safe, well designed, accessible and sustainable facilities in appropriate locations to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities; and to encourage the multi-purpose use of local, regional and national sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme has supported the provision or improvement of landmark national and regional stadia such as Thomond Park and Semple Stadium.  Such facilities provide a platform for our most talented athletes to perform which, in turn, inspires new generations of young people to aspire to match the sporting prowess of their heroes.  They are also an important part of our tourism industry as they draw visitors domestically and from Britain, Europe and further afield, who come to follow their teams in action.  For example, since it opened in November 2008, Thomond Park has welcomed more than 640,000 spectators through its doors to sports and non-sports events.  The overall economic impact of events hosted at Thomond Park stadium in this period has been estimated to be approximately &euro;131 million for Limerick city and region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators will be aware of the many benefits that derive from the programme in their locality.  They have no doubt witnessed the value of the programme in assisting local sports clubs in meeting the needs of their areas and in targeting clubs in areas of social disadvantage.  By doing this, the Government is supporting the provision of facilities where there may be little prospect of such facilities being provided by the communities acting alone.  These facilities provide an opportunity for participation in sport which leads to healthier lifestyles and a reduced likelihood of younger people drifting into anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>It is a common misconception that the programme has been discontinued.  The programme is in fact very active with &euro;48 million provided by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport in 2010 to cover the payment of grants.  This funding will allow more than 1,000 payments to be made to sports clubs and community groups in every county.</P><Col N="520"/>
        <P>Given the current budgetary situation and the high level of outstanding commitments it was considered prudent to pause prior to announcing the next round of the programme and accordingly no date has been set for the next round of the programme.</P>

I appreciate that the Minister of State is not at the Department but given that she stated in her reply that it is a common misconception that the programme has been discontinued, where does the &euro;48 million go and why have the clubs been told by the Department that no sports capital funding is available?  How is it that Deputy Michael McGrath in a newsletter can state the sports capital programme grant is to be reopened when we have been told in the reply today that there are no plans to reopen it?

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Loughrea is a burgeoning and vibrant town and I am sure the Minister of State may have travelled through it on her way to <Col N="521"/>Galway.  It needs to have its water supply upgraded urgently.  Not alone is Loughrea, a burgeoning and growing town, supplied by that water supply but it also supplies a number of communities in its hinterland.  One such community is Kilrickle, which is situated on the old N6.  It is hard to believe that in 2010 this village has no clean reliable public water supply.  In 2004, Deputy Michael Kitt, a former Member of this House, asked when phase 2 of the Loughrea scheme would be developed, which in turn would supply Kilrickle.  He was told in reply that it was intended to commence construction in 2006 at a cost of more than &euro;35 million.  This did not happen.  The Government then produced a water services investment programme in 2007 in which it was indicated that the scheme would go to construction in 2009 but that did not happen either.  In compiling the water services investment programme the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government relies on the expertise and local knowledge of local authorities, rightly so.  Galway County Council prepared such an assessment of needs before the publication of the most recent water services investment programme.  Of the 11 schemes which the council believed should receive priority in County Galway, it listed the scheme in Loughrea at No. 5.  It also indicated that it would be in a position to begin delivering on the scheme in 2010 and that all of the information sought by the Department had been supplied by it.  It would be ready to go to tender on the project within a matter of weeks.  In identifying the scheme in Loughrea as a priority it pointed out that water for the domestic and commercial use of the population of Kilreekil would have to be transported by tanker during the dry season, having been unsuccessful in finding a suitable source of drinking water in the area.</P>
        <P>A briefing note prepared by Galway County Council management for Oireachtas Members in east Galway concluded that it had been an expectation of the residents of Kilreekil to receive a safe and secure supply of potable water, a basic requirement, for almost ten years.  The Loughrea regional water supply scheme has been designed and the required documents have been prepared to include this expectation.  While it is accepted that emerging priorities must be given precedence in the current climate, the meeting of such a basic requirement, coupled with the advancement of the contract, should be ample reason to include the contract in the current water services investment programme.  However, it has not been included.  Despite having been included in the programme for the past seven years, it has now been taken out.</P>
        <P>I refer to a letter to former Deputy Joe Callanan from the then Minister, Deputy Dick Roche, in October 2006 in which he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">I know this is a very important scheme locally, especially for the people of Kilreekil, and my Department will be asking Galway County Council to ensure that it is progressed on towards construction stage as quickly as possible.  I know you will be glad to learn there has been concrete progress.  My Department and I will do everything we can to solve the very pressing water supply problems in the area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In August 2006 the then Minister also wrote to Joe Callanan to say: &ldquo;This job is scheduled to commence in 2007 under my Department&rsquo;s water service investment programme&rdquo;.  In fact, just before the general election in 2007, the then Minister actually visited the village of Kilreekil when he spoke to homeowners and business owners and once again assured them that they would have a water supply very soon.  They still have no supply and now have no hope whatsoever of receiving one because the Government has chosen, for some very strange reason unknown to me and Galway County Council management, to remove the project completely from the water services investment programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  </P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to set out the current position on the Loughrea regional water supply scheme.  As he is aware, the water services investment prog<Col N="522"/>ramme 2010-12 provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Galway.  The Loughrea water treatment plant project is included in the new programme as a scheme to advance through planning.  The new programme prioritises projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth as envisaged in the Government&rsquo;s policy document, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &mdash; A Framework for Sustainable Economic Revival.  Galway County Council&rsquo;s proposals for upgrading the Loughrea water treatment plant are considered to reflect programme priorities as the supply is on the EPA&rsquo;s remedial action list and was, therefore, included in the programme.  However, the proposed extension of the network, envisaged as part of the Loughrea regional water supply scheme, was not included in the programme as it relates solely to the expansion of the existing supply.  The envisaged expansion would include the provision of the trunk main to serve Kilreekil.  Galway County Council submitted a revised preliminary report on the overall Loughrea regional water supply scheme to the Department in February.  As part of its ongoing assessment of the report, the Department also examined the council&rsquo;s most recent cost estimates, submitted in August, for its proposals to provide a water supply from Loughrea to Kilreekil.  The Department will issue its decision on the report, including the cost estimates, to the council very soon.  However, although upgrading the treatment plant is a prerequisite in providing a water supply for Kilreekil village, the council&rsquo;s proposals to connect Kilreekil with the Loughrea regional water supply scheme are not part of the project at this time.</P>
        <P>A review process has been included as one of a number of new measures in the water services investment programme 2010-12, under which the programme will be reviewed and updated annually to allow for any re-prioritisation required.  The format and timing of the review process has still to be decided by the Department, but it is anticipated that it will be conducted following one year of operation of the new programme.  Although Galway County Council has already requested the Department to consider the inclusion of the trunk main to Kilreekil element of the Loughrea regional water supply scheme in the programme, the council will need to reassess its Kilreekil proposals following the Department&rsquo;s assessment of its revised preliminary report on the entire scheme which is due to issue shortly.  In the light of this, the council can further consider the specific proposals to be submitted in the context of the review process next year.</P>
        <P>The Minister can assure the Senator that the Department will continue to work with Galway County Council to ensure matters relating to the Loughrea regional water supply scheme are advanced as far as practicable during the period of the new programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, we are not still not a whit down the road towards the provision of a water supply for either Loughrea or Kilreekil.  Is the Government not ashamed that it has given assurances over and over again to a community?  Such assurances were written by the Minister and given to representatives of the community in August 2006.  A scheme is required urgently but in 2010 the Government has decided to pull the rug completely from under the community by withdrawing the scheme from the water services investment programme.  There is nothing in the reply to assure me or the people of Loughrea and Kilreekil that the Government has any intention of restoring the scheme to the water services investment programme.</P>
