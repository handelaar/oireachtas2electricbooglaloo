      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the challenges facing the tourism sector, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 2.15 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for eight minutes, on which Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon to reply ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments and to take questions from party leaders or spokespersons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader give the House a commitment that he will hold a pre-budget debate on the state of the economy next week?  Will he indicate, in the light of the economic crisis the country is facing, whether the House will sit next Tuesday?  It is important that we recognise that politics is not continuing as usual.  As Members of this House, we must play our part by sitting next Tuesday and debating the state of the economy next week.  It is welcome that talks took place in Government Buildings yesterday and good that we have all agreed to the 3% figure which we will all strive to achieve.  The nation is holding its breath as it awaits the announcement of the budget in December.</P>
        <P>The people are angry, weary and fearful.  They want the Government to tell the truth about the exact state of the nation&rsquo;s finances.  What is the precise economic position?  Every step of the way the predictions of the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance have been wrong.  The people want honesty and the truth.  I challenge the Leader who represents the Government in this House to give us the answers.  If necessary, the Taoiseach should make a state of the nation address on RTE and tell us the way it is.  The people are hopeful and resourceful.  They want certainty and to be given confidence, but they are not getting these from the representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il, particularly those who sit at the Cabinet table.</P>
        <P>There is another and better way.  We need a recovery plan predicated on creating jobs and getting people back to work.  It should not just be about austerity mesures, slashing and burning.  Reform of the political system is also needed.  We need to change the way the Government does its business.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to arrange a debate on that matter next week also.  Those of us who are involved in the political system need to evaluate where we are at in order that we can provide leadership for the people.  Although Fine Gael does not have all of the answers, it has vision.  In the past 18 months we have developed policies on job creation, <Col N="164"/>reform of the health system, reform of our system of government and reform of the political system.</P>
        <P>The ESRI commentary published today, which I welcome, expresses doubt about whether the 3% target can be achieved.  Can the Government tell us how much will be cut?  What are the growth and unemployment projections?  Deputy Kenny was right to say we needed independent verification of the figures.  I hope this will happen.</P>
        <P>We can all agree that there are no easy options.  Not only do the people want honesty, they also want a Government with a mandate.  Sadly &mdash; for the Leader &mdash; the Government has lost its mandate.  It is time for a new Government to be given a new mandate to lead the country.  I hope this will happen before Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The perilous economic situation in which we find ourselves is the only story today.  It is the closest to a war situation I have ever seen in this country and we need to address it very clearly.  Like Ulysses, we are caught between a rock and a hard place.  If we turn one way, we will hit a rock and if we turn the other way, we will hit a whirlpool.  Very skilful management is needed.  We need a wily Ulysses.</P>
        <P>During yesterday&rsquo;s poorly attended debate which went completely unreported, I expressed concern that radical cutbacks might damage the prospects for economic growth.  That argument is supported by the horrifying figures published today.  It has been reported that we now need to cut &euro;15 billion, rather than &euro;7.5 billion.  Most economists have expressed serious doubts about whether this can be achieved and their views have been underscored by the ESRI report.  We need to bear this in mind.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need a general election as soon as possible, followed by a Government of national unity.  I was laughed at when I made a similar suggestion a year ago, but the situation is now so serious that we must be prepared to sacrifice personal ambition and party objectives in the interests of the country.  We need a unified government, supported by a country that is united behind it and a media that supports the measures considered necessary.  This is not a time for personal ambition, although advocating this will undoubtedly complicate my political ambitions, as Members of the House will know.  Parties leaders must also sacrifice their ambitions for themselves and their parties.  We have talent in this country and whoever wins the next general election &mdash; I call for it to be held as soon as possible &mdash; should be in a position to select from the talent available in all of the parties the best team to lead the country out of the mess in which it find itself.  We also ought to be able to call on the expertise of people such as Mr. Peter Mathews, Dr. Constantin Gurdgiev and Professor Brian Lucey who have not been listened to, although their predictions have been accurate.  Their figures, rather than those of the Government, have been accurate and, regrettably, are very damning.  A Government of national unity should be able to avail of the resources of a panel of experts to guide us independently out of this mess.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remind the House &mdash; the Leader has spoken passionately about this issue on many occasions &mdash; that we are moving towards the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising when a group of courageous and visionary individuals took action which, ultimately, led to a completely independent country.  If we are not very careful, however, by 2016 that independence will have been sacrificed.  It is already well on the way to being sacrificed.  Mr. Brendan Keenan, a very distinguished economics commentator, writes in today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Independent </i>that our foolishness has removed our national sovereignty, both morally and legally.  In the light of the Merkel and Sarkozy agreement, in particular, we will face a situation where our sovereignty may well be removed.  My final point, a very significant one, is that if that agreement goes through, we may face another referendum on the situation in the European Union.  It is vital, <Col N="165"/>therefore, that we have a unified Government in order that that referendum could be carried.  However, we have one political card in this political game which is that we could withhold our vote of agreement on condition that there would be realistic targets and that we would receive assistance from the European Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is time the people, politicians and all of the political parties faced up to the serious economic situation in which we find ourselves, which I believe they are doing.  However, it is not time for us to consider the suppression of dissent or debate and I know Senator Norris did not suggest this.  This is still a democracy and we have different ideas, opinions and views on how the problems of the country could be solved.  In a democracy and, in particular, Parliament we are entitled to and bound to have these issues debated, contested and, if necessary, be in conflict in regard to them.  They should be resolved and we should move forward.  The best and the only way for a democracy to do this is by having a general election.  That is when we will close the doors for four weeks, go outside and say to the people how we believe matters should proceed and what we believe the Government should do in the future.  That is what all parties should do.  The people should get to decide.  Let us not lose sight of the fact that this is still a democracy.  It is not time for us to panic, advocate some kind of <i>faux</i> consensus, put all our differences aside or imagine there is none.  There are and we should not be afraid to say so.  If anything, the problem in the past ten years has been that we have not had enough debate about the differences between us.  We have not debated these issues enough.</P>
        <P>I refer to a suggestion Senator MacSharry made yesterday about having a series of debates on tax, health, education and social welfare issues.  I would have no difficulty with this, but let us be honest about what would happen in such debates.  The procedure is that a Minister comes to the House and makes the first speech.  If that happens between now and the announcement of the budget, the Minister for Finance will not tell us what taxation measures will be included in the budget because he will not be able to do so.  That is not even a criticism of the Government because the Minister would have to wait until the budget was announced.  Ministers will not tell us what social measures will be included or whether there will be cuts in health and education services because that is the way government works.</P>
        <P>It is ridiculous to say the Opposition parties should state what they would do.  We should think about this and be honest with each other.  It will not be a real debate unless we remove the shackles from the procedures used in this House and say we do not require a debate to be kick-started by a Minister who will not say anything in the lead-up to the budget.  We need to remove the shackles if we are to have the debate required in order that we can genuinely contest the issues involved.  By all means, let us do so.  However, we must think about the procedures used.  One should not imagine that in calling for four debates and when the Leader says it is a very good idea, it will make any difference.</P>
        <P>On Seanad reform, the Leader should not tell me about the Minister coming back with a proposal because I know all about it.  Will he tell the House about one measure he has introduced in the past three and a half years to reform the procedures of the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The issuing of the ESRI report has confused the issue of what the Government must do and what the political system must address in dealing with the budgetary crisis.  It has given the impression that somehow we can delay the inevitable.  What has been suggested in the report is akin to saying that if one has a 15 year mortgage, one can turn it into a 25 year one and that one would pay less every month, but at the end of the day one would pay more.  We do not have choices in the matter; neither would a Government comprising other political parties elected after a general election nor a national Government.  Meeting the target of 3% by 2014 has been agreed with the European Commission and by the two main Opposition party leaders who met my party leader and the Taoiseach yesterday.  We are obliged <Col N="166"/>to attempt to meet that deadline and it must be done by reducing expenditure and introducing new and different taxes.  There is no other analysis and there are no easier ways to do it.  Everything done by whatever politician in whatever political party in whatever form of government will result in these decisions and massive unpopularity but I hope in the betterment of the country.  Until everyone understands these essential truths, debates in this House essentially will be meaningless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to pick up on what Senator Boyle said about the ESRI report which has introduced into our discussion something that is misleading.  A headline in one of our main newspapers indicates that the EU target could spell disaster.  Let us be clear that we are not looking and do not need to reduce our borrowing commitments because of our membership of the European Union or a target set in Brussels.  The reason we must reduce them is we cannot afford to borrow on the money markets at a rate that is unaffordable and that there is still a &euro;20 billion gap between what we take in and what goes out, not our membership of the European Union or a target percentage is being imposed on us.  To pretend otherwise is to divert energy away from where we should focus it, that is, dealing with the crisis.</P>
        <P>A tradition is developing of reducing the value of engagement between political leaders.  I emphasise the significance of what happened yesterday.  The leaders of the main Opposition parties went to Government Buildings, received information indicating a significant further deterioration of the budgetary figures, and still committed us to meeting a 3% target by 2014.  That is a substantial commitment made on behalf of my party which will aim to lead the next Government to make the progress that needs to be made to stabilise the country&rsquo;s finances.  Senator Norris was right to say the country was in the middle of a war, but he quoted a columnist who said we had lost our sovereignty.  Let us not have such a discussion.  We are still in a place where we can make decisions on how we can raise and spend money.  While we still have that capacity, let us be proud of and make use of our sovereignty and not wish it away.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Boyle&rsquo;s and Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s excellent assessment of the situation in which we find ourselves.  I ask the Leader of the House for an early debate on the role of the National Roads Authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in, and their negative approach to, job retention and creation.  This may be microeconomics but it is important from a rural point of view.  For example, Brendan and Derek Allen of Castlemine Farm, Fourmilehouse, Roscommon, a traditional farm and artisan food operation, were granted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>No interruptions, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The chief executive of one of the NRA, who earns &euro;250,000 a year, went out of his way to object and was granted an appeal, and this company employing four people in Fourmilehouse in Roscommon was refused permission for retention by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is very unfair and I ask the Ministers to intervene in this situation.</P>
        <P>This is a critical situation.  We need jobs in rural areas.  These young men set up this small company producing food in an area and they are trying to attract attention.  How can they bring people to their area if they do not have signs?  An Bord Plean&aacute;la&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">From the particular to the general, the ESRI report is unhelpful and its analysis is flawed.  We are not in a situation where we are dealing with pure economics.  We are dealing with political economy, which is what economics is about, and there are political and economic constraints on this country. On the political side, we have entered into commitments in the European Union in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact and we also have political agreement among all political parties in respect of the target of a 3% budget deficit by 2014.  That is very important.  On the economic front, we read today the analysis of the former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, of the importance of export-led growth, which was the basis of the Celtic tiger and to which we need to return.</P><Col N="168"/>
        <P Just="Left">The property market is stifled by NAMA and investment and consumption are constrained by uncertainty.  Uncertainty is most damaging to economic growth.  There is certainty now as to where we want to get to in 2014 and it is important we end the uncertainty by sticking with that policy and going for the necessary cutbacks and control on the public finances.  That means we must look at an bord snip nua and the Croke Park agreement, and all bets are off in respect of many of the sacred cows we have adopted in this country.  We must get the public finances in order.  In that regard, it is important we do not enter into denial once again.  We must make hard decisions and we must pursue the necessary control of the public finances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the positive comments of some of the Opposition Senators.  What happened yesterday in terms of consensus was unprecedented and I would very much welcome further debates on the economy.  We will be having them<?oasys _jy ?>regardless.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the boom period there was a danger of overemphasising the positive &mdash; perhaps in that sense we talked ourselves into a bit of a black hole &mdash; but there is a danger now of overstating the negative in the economy.  I want to refer to some of the more positive statistics that are before us if we look at them.  Any debate on the economy should give hope and should have a light at the end of the tunnel.  According to current statistics, we live in a country where exports are up, imports are down, manufacturing and industrial production levels are increasing massively, agricultural output is increasing massively, houses are considerably more affordable, inflation is pretty much under control, interest rates are at historic lows, consumer sentiment is rising, road deaths are very much down and transport infrastructure has improved immeasurably.  It is a country which is now ranked 13th in the world in terms of broadband infrastructure, up from 17th.  That is very positive.  It is a country which, by 2020, could be a net exporter of wind energy on some days of the year.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government has increased our wind energy capacity in the past three years from 7% to more than 15%.  That is fact and the Opposition should check out those facts.  There are many positive aspects in this economy.  It is wrong to have debates where we switch off the light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
        <P>We need to look at stimulus packages.  When we are dealing with the public finances, we are very much dealing with the issues of cuts and new taxes, but we are not dealing with the issues of new hope and new stimulus.  Both sides of the balance sheet should be looked at.  Senators who talk themselves into a black hole or who are in danger of doing so are adopting the wrong approach.  I look forward to the continuing debates on the economy.  Let us look at the positive as well as the negative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise my serious concern about the &euro;15 billion in cuts that we must make.  I understand that we are in challenging times, however what worries me is that front-line services, such as local hospitals, will be cut.  I would ask that the Croke Park agreement be renegotiated and that we would have a serious debate about that in this House and make ourselves relevant.</P>
        <P>I read an interesting article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> about the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The question was who should have resigned &mdash; the Minister for Health and Children or Mr. Philip Lynch.  It seems, having read that article, that Mr. Lynch is an extraordinary entrepreneur &mdash; I apologise for using his name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a wonderful person who never sought the limelight or employed public relations people to spin on his behalf.  He worked in a voluntary capacity and gave many hours of his time.  I question why he resigned.  The way all this has happened seems clandestine and underhanded and I would like a proper, transparent explanation.</P>
        <P>A 16-floor hospital in the middle of the city where there is barely enough car parking for the staff, never mind for families visiting, seems wrong.  There is a critical time when a child is ill and, if one is stuck in traffic and the hospital is inaccessible, it is in the wrong place.  We need to discuss it further.  This House is also the forum in which we should do that.  Let us discuss the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  Have it in the midlands, the proper place for it.</P>

       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join others in welcoming the meeting that took place yesterday.  It achieved a great deal in reaffirming all parties&rsquo; commitment to the 3% deficit by 2014, and that was very positive.  I fully agree with Senator Alex White that it is important there be difference as we consider the tangibles that will get us in that direction, on which we are all agreed, of 3%.  Of course it is important that there is difference because otherwise it is just public administration.  If I have a suggestion on a taxation measure, it is important that people criticise it and tease it out.  That is what I would like to see in the debates that take place.  If Ministers are coming to the House next week to consider what we think should be in the budget, I do not want to hear what the Minister wants in the budget, rather what the Members of this House suggest should be in the budget.  That is what politics is about and why we have our positions &mdash; to add, on behalf of the people, our tuppence worth to what should be in the budget.</P>
     
        <P>I welcome the publication of the ESRI report, which has many good things in it and will focus minds.  As Senator Regan correctly noted, there are no longer any sacred cows.  We now have official recognition from the ESRI that we may have to adjust aspects of the Croke Park agreement as we contemplate the measures that will take us on our journey.  I also agree with the Senator that aspects of the report are unhelpful.  It is not helpful, for instance, to announce before we begin, as it were, that the target is the wrong one.  Let us first see how we go towards meeting it.</P>
        <P>If, as we approach 2014, the target of 3% is too far off, it may be possible, as the Minister for Finance stated last night, to extend the deadline.  I share the view expressed by Dan O&rsquo;Brien in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that it would be preferable to take such a step &ldquo;when the deficit is lower, the banking system sounder, the bond market calmer, the euro construct stabler and the world economy stronger&rdquo;.  It would be foolish in the extreme &mdash; Dan O&rsquo;Brien uses the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; &mdash; to announce at this stage that we will not adhere to the target to the fullest extent possible.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange four debates next week on taxation, health, education and social welfare, respectively.  The purpose of these debates should not be to listen to the relevant Ministers prescribe tonics for the budget but to enable Senators from all sides to make suggestions on where savings can be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to the debates requested by Senator MacSharry.  We should add a fifth pillar to the four issues he has proposed for debate, namely, discussion of growth options and job opportunities.  While cuts are one part of the measures that must be taken, we must also focus on incentives, growth and hope.  The House will shortly debate tourism, one of the sectors in which progress could be made.  Agriculture is another such sector.  I ask the Leader to provide time to discuss positive aspects of the economy.</P><Col N="170"/>
        <P>On the broader question, on which most of our colleagues are commenting and reflecting, the brutal reality is that if, on a specific date next year, the Government does not have the capacity to borrow up to &euro;20 billion, old age pensions will not be paid, nurses will be sent home from hospital wards, teachers will lose their jobs and the country will shut down.  Will we have the capacity in the next two or three months to secure loans of approximately &euro;20 billion from the international banks?  It is essential that we attempt to reach the borrowing targets we have agreed with the European Commission.  If we do not set the 3% figure in stone, we will not have international credibility and will be unable to borrow money to keep the country ticking<?oasys _jy ?>over.</P>
        <P>I admit the choices facing us are dreadful.  To describe our position as a Hobson&rsquo;s choice is to understate the scale of the problem.  Senator Norris was correct when he reflected on 1916.  If we do not get our economic house in order by 2016, this country will no longer be an independent republic but a province of the International Monetary Fund.</P>
        <P>Debates in the House will be useful.  I take on board Senator Alex White&rsquo;s comments but I am not interested in listening to the Minister next week.  I want to hear colleagues on all sides present their views and options because we have constructive, workable proposals to make.  The House has shown that it has a role to play and I hope it will build on that role next week.  I ask the Leader to arrange the four discussions requested by Senator MacSharry as well as a fifth debate on growth strategies for sectors of the economy from which employment and hope can spring.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESRI report is unhelpful.  I heard on a radio programme this morning a great deal of backtracking from its contents.  For instance, an acknowledgement was made that the political context is that we must reduce the public deficit to 3% by 2014.  It is of dubious merit to produce a set of hypotheses that were immediately regarded as unrealisable.  I wonder what effect the report would have had if the party leaders had not been involved in a lockdown yesterday to analyse the financial position.  If the meeting had not taken place, we could have been thrown into a great deal of turmoil today, if for no other reason than that the talks created a deal of stability, as Senator Regan pointed out.  The meeting needs to result in the restoration of some confidence.</P>
        <P>A great deal of the recovery will depend on global growth.  We need to start exporting again.  People often criticise the term &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo; but what we had in the period preceding 2007 was a stupid economy.  The smart economy is the export economy and the opportunities it creates for individuals and businesses.  Exports depend on global growth and to that extent Ireland is vulnerable.  Export figures will vary and it is difficult to provide the certainty we require but at least the cost of the banking crisis has been identified.  This is a significant advantage, horrendous as the final figure is.</P>
        <P>As Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in stated, while stimulus is necessary, it will not be provided on the basis of cash injections into the economy.  There are ways to stimulate some mobility in housing again.  We could, for instance, remove some of the impediments to mobility.  Rather than starting a building boom, I propose that we create some mobility.</P>
        <P>There are also ways to instil confidence.  I am aware of a person who recently purchased prize bonds to a value of &euro;2.5 million.  These types of decisions by individuals act as a drain on our economic prospects.  We need to unlock spending power again.  This will be done through providing certainty which will lead to confidence.  In that context, yesterday&rsquo;s meeting was a good start.  I hope the Minister for Finance and the party spokespersons on finance can build on it in the coming weeks.  I do not seek further rounds of talks among the party leaders.  The <Col N="171"/>finance spokespersons can play a vital role in continuing the analysis and arriving at some form of consensus.</P>

	<P>It is useful to hear the diverse views of Senators notwithstanding our differences.  Differences are the reason we are here.  This is a democracy and people elect us on the basis of the views we offer.  Now that we have the stark reality of the Government figures, even if unverified, and ESRI figures, there is an amazing convergence.</P>
        <P>In recent days, I have asked the Leader to arrange a debate on the conclusion of the talks between the party leaders.  It appears they will not meet again, although further consultations will take place between finance spokespersons and the Department of Finance, which is useful and helpful.  Perhaps we can now have an all-encompassing debate on the economy, especially as the other House will have such a debate next week.  The Leader should arrange this debate to allow us to further develop points of difference or convergence.  There is, I believe, significant convergence in the national interest on the commitment to achieve a target of 3% debt to GDP ratio by 2014.  Irrespective of whether it is achievable, we must stick to this objective.  Let us hear more from the different parties.  While it goes without saying that we will not be able to agree fully on the detail, we can develop the convergence that is obviously emerging.  This House serves a useful purpose and we should have this debate next week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have listened for years to Senators argue that social partnership sidelined the democratic input of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  While I recognise that social partnership played a pivotal role in the recovery from the dark economic days of the 1980s, in the past ten years it has contributed significantly to the current economic mess.  The social partners should take their share of the responsibility and play a part in finding solutions.  I concur fully with the comments of many Members today.  I welcome the all-party consensus on reducing the State&rsquo;s borrowing requirement to 3% of GDP by 2014.  This will be absolutely essential if we are to meet two objectives.  The first is to give confidence to the bond markets in order that we can borrow at much cheaper rates of interest than is possible at present.  The second aspect is that having a consensus and injecting stability into the position will help to restore consumer confidence, which will be a prerequisite to any economic growth.  I would like to think that much emphasis will be placed on that area.  I was highly impressed by Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in&rsquo;s positive research and the points he brought to the attention of the House.  A debate should be devoted to such positive aspects because people need to be reminded of them and this must be amplified.  The media have been highly negative and have not been constructive throughout this period.  I refer in particular to the national broadcaster, of which I am highly critical, that could have had a role to play.  This is unlike the position in neighbouring jurisdictions in which people get the bad news but it is balanced by positive developments within the economy, as well as by the sound steps that are being taken to restore the economic position.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate along the lines and on the four areas suggested by Senator MacSharry.  I also agree that job creation, as mentioned by Senator Bradford, should be one such topic and suggest that the Leader should include proposed measures to restore consumer confidence.  I seek a continuation of Members&rsquo; earlier debate on the Croke Park deal.  It is unconscionable to think we would be able to ring-fence 40% of expenditure without being obliged to address it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The focus of such a debate should be on where Ireland could end up, were one to begin to agree with certain commentators in respect of what the political parties have agreed to in principle.  When the State pays more than 5% to borrow money and when growth in the economy is not expected to exceed 3% over the next few years, we are in trouble.  As matters stand, the State is paying in excess of 6% on borrowed money and this simply is not sustainable.  The State will seek to borrow &euro;50 billion in the next four years and even if we manage to reach the 3% target by 2014, we still will be obliged to borrow every year to pay for public services, pensioners and social welfare recipients.  We need to demonstrate to the individuals who will loan the State billions of euro in the next couple of years that we have copped onto what has gone wrong with the country and that we are willing to put our shoulders to the wheel to sort it out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask those who believe the ESRI is correct to outline what they think would be the consequences, were the State to agree to the objective of stretching out the deficit reduction another few years.  We would lose credibility on the grounds that we were afraid to take on our own problems.  Such people also should comment on where that would lead us because if for any reason the State&rsquo;s cost of borrowing rose to 7% next year, that would constitute an unsustainable option for the country.  All Members acknowledge there will be massive suffering for everyone in the coming years.  It does not matter whether one is a social welfare recipient, a pensioner or a middle-class person.  Everyone will suffer because the economy has been badly mismanaged over recent years, the game is up and we must deal with it.  The debate must be based on this premise.  We must be mature about it because this is an awful position in which to be.</P>

It displays great patriotism and they deserve enormous credit.  Those who are in government should ask themselves whether, were the roles reversed, they would do the same.  Second, anyone who is in government should, at every public occasion &mdash; I presume the Leader will do so later &mdash; applaud that patriotism and acknowledge it as an outstanding display&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which must have international ramifications.</P>
        <P>The target of reducing the State&rsquo;s borrowings to 3% of GDP by 2014 is unavoidable to sustain our credibility for borrowing on the bond markets.  Therein lies the critical issue, in that if we are to borrow at realistic prices we do not have an option.  This is frightening and is an enormously difficult position in which to be but is unavoidable.  However, if we are to address this problem, it must be paralleled by specific efforts in respect of job creation.  People need hope and realisation in this regard.  Great potential exists in agriculture, food processing and in value-added product in food but there is much to be done in that regard.  Moreover, there also is enormous potential in tourism, which is an expanding sector internationally and there is much to be done.  In addition, Ireland also has great potential with regard to exporting green energy and we must continue to work towards that goal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Just as there was all-party agreement yesterday on the targets, which is an enormous advance, there should be all-party agreement and a common stated objective to protect front-line services.  The needy and the vulnerable need not suffer and that if they do it will be because the cuts were misplaced and were carried out from an incorrect basis, a wrong ethic and a wrong value system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESRI report throws down a challenge to Members and throws into sharp relief the importance of the decision taken by the party leaders yesterday.  I found the report from the ESRI and the presentation of it today to be contradictory and somewhat confusing.  I believe the challenge for all Members and for the party leaders is to spell out clearly to people the reason it is so important to stick to the key target of reducing the deficit to 3% by 2014.  A number of speakers in this House have highlighted that the country would not be able to continue.  We will not be able to continue paying for basic services unless we convince the international markets that we are serious in our intent.  This is the importance of yesterday&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>However, I make the point to Senator Boyle in particular and the Government in general that given the debate that took place in the House last week on the Croke Park agreement, it is incumbent on the Government to revert to Members and outline what it is doing to ensure its implementation.  Members were given no specifics last week by the Minister.  They need to know how the Government intends to speed up implementation of the Croke Park agreement, what savings are being achieved or can be made and the timeframe for them.  This is absolutely critical and there is a real onus on the Government to be honest about the Croke Park agreement, its implementation and the savings that together with the partners to the agreement it believes can be achieved.</P>
        <P>The disagreement between the ESRI and the Government with regard to the future also highlights the importance of the point on independent verification of figures that Deputy Kenny made yesterday and to which Senator Buttimer referred earlier.  This also is critical and should be pursued by the Government and by agreement in both Houses.  Finally, I support Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s suggestion on debates on a Department by Department basis, as the Seanad could play a useful role in this regard.  For example, Members could discuss tourism and the potential therein in detail.  As the infrastructure, hotels, access and airports are in place, Members should discuss job creation in that sector.  A debate on that subject in this House could prove to be extremely useful in the formulation leading up to the budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Were we to be really honest, we would accept that we have very little choice regarding the tough things that must be done in the next few years.  Moreover, I am afraid that it flows logically from this that much that will be said in these Houses will be superfluous.  While Members will be engaged in much conversation that is necessary at one level, at another level it will be quite superfluous because the same decisions must be taken anyway.  In the next couple of years we will face the test of whether we can get on with the business of improving the country, particularly in ways that do not involve major cost, and avoid getting caught in the headlights of the economic crisis.</P>
        <P>Despite our angst about animal welfare legislation in the past year, it would be terrible if we were to lose our nerve regarding the need to improve animal welfare legislation.  The primary animal welfare legislation in Ireland will be 100 years old next year.  The Protection of Animals Act 1911 is still the principal Act, but it was clearly written for a different era and it has many failings.  For example, it is difficult to believe, but true, that attending an animal fight is not unlawful.  One can dock the tail of a pup up to one month old without using an anaesthetic.  These provisions may not seem important in the context of the economic crisis, but they have to do with how we civilise ourselves and the culture we are seeking to achieve.  I would hate if Ministers and politicians felt paralysed to deal with such issues for fear they would be accused of trivialising matters.  These issues are important and need to be attended to.</P><Col N="174"/>
        <P>We also need to be very careful that we push against any notion that it might be acceptable to ask questions about the role of immigrants in our society.  We were very happy for people to come to the country and do the jobs we were not able to do.  There is some evidence that there are still jobs we are not willing to do.  This is evidenced by the presence of many fine immigrants, particularly in nursing and other professions.  We need to be very careful to lead from the front in the national debate on this issue in order that we do not see the emergence of negative attitudes at a time when that could happen because of the economic challenges faced by many.</P>

It is very important that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government comes into the House to tell us how he intends to arrange for the funding of local authorities, some of which, we are led to believe, are in serious difficulties.  The Leader should see to it that we have a question and answer session in every debate.  We had a number of debates on the economy recently, but we did not have a question and answer session, which would be beneficial.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposal for a debate on tourism.  We have the hotel infrastructure, but we would like to know what the proposals of the Department and Bord F&aacute;ilte are to increase numbers, as they have promised to do.  That would be a great start for the country.  Having question and answer sessions, particularly on tourism, agriculture and the funding of local authorities, would be a good way forward.</P>

It was an historic day on which we will look back and which future generations will say was a turning point when all parties accepted their responsibility to see what could be done in the national interest.  The all-day debate on the four budget action plan and the ESRI report will take place next Thursday.  The four issues of taxation, social welfare, health and education mentioned on the Order of Business will be the highlights of the debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White asked what changes I had made since my reappointment as Leader of the Seanad.  One was the inclusion of question and answer sessions in debates, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach correctly pointed out, with Ministers present on all occasions.  That is a serious advance on what used to happen in the House for the longest time.  The Minister will be here all day on Thursday to discuss the economy.  If the debate needs to be rolled over to the following week, there will no be difficulty in arranging this.  I do not have any difficulty in going from Department to Department to see what their future plans are.</P>
        <P>The priority must be job creation and growth in the economy.  We have been hearing on radio this morning and last evening about the ESRI report.  If we do not achieve an economic growth rate of 3.5%, we will not be able to reduce unemployment.  Everything relates to job creation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with what Senator Fitzgerald said about tourism, a matter on which Senator Burke has sought a debate on many occasions.  We will be discussing the issue all day.  I have allocated 12 minutes for spokespersons and eight minutes for all other speakers.  If more time is required and the debate needs to be rolled over, I will have no difficulty in arranging this.</P><Col N="175"/>
        <P>The tourism sector has huge potential in terms of job creation and growth.  Undertakings were given by successive Governments to allow family-run businesses, new businesses and multinationals with big brand names to promote Ireland abroad using their various marketing teams.  Various Departments gave certain undertakings at the time for which we now seem to be legislating retrospectively.  I have a vested interest in the sector, as my family is heavily involved in it.  If the strategies in place are continued, there will be massive unemployment in the sector.  On the one hand, the Government must balance the books, but, on the other, job protection and creation must be a priority.  I ask colleagues, as requested this morning, to make job creation the top priority in their contributions to the debate next week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tourism sector faces a serious challenge because of the changes made in the last three budgets.  One could almost say undertakings and guarantees were given to entice and encourage people to invest in the industry.  Now legislation has been brought forward which will seriously damage the sector.  Within six months we will all see the difficulties NAMA will face in relation to the number of hotels, restaurants and guesthouses on its books but with no one to buy them.  That is what will happen.  I will be making a contribution to today&rsquo;s debate and will mention the serious challenges facing the Minister for Finance, Deputies and Senators in trying to sustain the jobs in the tourism industry.  The 300,000 jobs in the industry are the future jobs of our boys and girls.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden called for a debate on the National Roads Authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I will have no difficulty in arranging such a debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator McFadden raised the issue of the children&rsquo;s hospital.  Everyone in Ireland wants to see work on the national children&rsquo;s hospital progressing.  We have been listening to a debate on this matter for 15 years.  The project is progressing and the hospital will be in place in 2015 or 2016.  That is what we all want to see.  There will be 1,000 car-parking spaces on site.  I wish everyone well involved well in their deliberations.</P>
        <P>Senator Paddy Burke called for a debate on the funding of local authorities.  This presents a huge challenge.  My own county of Westmeath faces a massive problem, as indicated in the publications yesterday.  I will have no difficulty in arranging a debate on this issue in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Tourism makes a vital contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  With the support of the Government, the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport and the tourism agencies, the tourism and hospitality sector has the resilience to overcome its current difficulties and make an important contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s economic renewal.  In 2009 the sector provided approximately 190,000 jobs, helped to generate almost &euro;4 billion in foreign revenue earnings and contributed an estimated &euro;1.2 billion in tax receipts.  While 2009 and 2010 have proved to be exceptionally challenging years, the tourism industry remains resilient and has responded to the global economic difficulties by offering exceptional value to its customers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s recently launched strategy and action plan for Irish trade, tourism and investment to 2015, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, was drawn up by representatives from the relevant key Departments and agencies, including my Department, Tourism Ireland and Culture Ireland.  The strategy contains targets for job creation, exports, tourist numbers and inward investment projects to 2015 and sets out how the Government and its agencies will achieve these priorities and targets.  The tourism related elements of the new strategy draw on the robust analysis carried out by the tourism renewal group in its report and framework for action published in autumn 2009.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the report of the tourism renewal group, my Department has been driving progress on the key measures in the framework for action, focusing initially on survival actions, in conjunction with the tourism agencies and other relevant Departments and bodies.  For example, building on the framework for action, the 2010 budget recognised tourism as a critical labour intensive sector and provided for a 3% increase to &euro;153 million in the overall tourism services budget.  This allowed us to maintain the real level of investment in overseas marketing, as well as to provide a significantly increased capital allocation for tourism product development.  The tourism sector was also included in several cross-cutting measures to support enterprises and jobs, including the employment subsidy scheme and the credit review system.</P>
        <P>I established the tourism renewal implementation group in July to oversee and drive actions on measures that support tourism development in Ireland, increase competitiveness and ensure the sector is set for recovery and growth.  The group has met twice under my chairmanship, on 6 and 20 September, and is scheduled to meet again on 27 October.  Its first progress report which summarises progress on measures in the framework for action has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  We have either implemented or are making good progress on four of the five survival actions recommended.  These include maintaining the overall level and value of investment in international and domestic tourism marketing, strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s tourism attractions and products, providing active support for tourism enterprises and focusing and co-ordinating public spending on tourism related investment.  As regards the nine recovery actions, the group notes good initial progress in the case of each of these actions.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s new strategy and action plan for Irish trade, tourism and investment recognises the absolute importance of access and transport for tourism, as well as for trade and investment.  The tourism renewal group reviewed the impact of the air travel tax, drawing on <Col N="177"/>analyses by the tourism agencies, the tourism industry and the airlines, and recommended that it be abolished.  I have discussed the tax in bilateral meetings with the airlines and listened to their concerns about it.  I met Mr. Christoph Mueller from Aer Lingus, Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary from Ryanair and P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;ide from Aer Arann.  The issue has also arisen in meetings with other bodies involved in the tourism industry and was discussed at the recent forum of tourism interests convened as part of the development of the Department&rsquo;s new statement of strategy.  In any consideration of the tax we must be conscious of what we could gain in return for the country and the tourism industry.  I have asked the airlines what they can offer in exchange for the removal of the tax such as protecting or adding routes.  I am discussing the air travel tax rather than the passenger taxes charged by Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports.  I have relayed the concerns raised with me to the Minister for Finance and will be discussing the matter with him further in the context of the forthcoming budget.  However, if the money does not come from an air travel tax, we will need to find it somewhere else.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the House is aware, we are experiencing the impact of an international recession of unsurpassed severity.  Every major economy, including our key source tourism markets, is suffering.  In our own case, the situation has been exacerbated by unhelpful exchange rate movements and the challenges in the domestic economy.  Tourism worldwide has seen a significant downturn in the past two years due to the global economic slowdown and loss of consumer confidence.  Figures for the first six months of the year show that while we welcomed over 2.6 million overseas visitors, this represented a reduction of just over 20% on corresponding 2009 levels.  Outbound trips from Great Britain were particularly affected, with the euro-sterling exchange rate making it extremely challenging to attract visitors to Ireland and eurozone destinations generally.  Furthermore, the exceptional weather conditions in the early part of the year and the closure of airports in April and May owing to the volcanic ash cloud meant that it was inevitable that a fall-off in the numbers travelling, particularly in north-west Europe, would be experienced in the first half of the year.</P>
        <P>On the positive side, the latest published monthly figures for June show a monthly fall of 5.7 % compared to the figures for June 2009.  This is a significant improvement on the year-on-year fall witnessed in the earlier months of the year.  Furthermore, the numbers of visitors from North America and other long haul destinations actually increased, by 1.4% and 4.1% respectively, in June compared to June 2009.  Visitors from these markets are particularly important for the tourism sector, as they tend to stay longer and spend more than visitors from our nearest markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Economic circumstances are making trading conditions difficult for most businesses.  These difficult conditions are exacerbated in the case of the hotel sector by the build-up of room overcapacity in recent years.  This is proving to be a complex problem to solve and, inevitably, it will require a market-led solution over time.  I had the opportunity last week to have a useful exchange of views with the chairman, chief executive and other senior executives of NAMA on how the agency&rsquo;s operations were likely to impact on the hotel and tourism sectors.  My engagement with NAMA was at an overall policy level and not related to a specific enterprise or borrower.  I encouraged NAMA to be strategic in its approach and welcomed its willingness to remain in contact with the Department and the tourism agencies at a general policy level as it worked its way through the management of its hotel-backed loans portfolio.  For its part, NAMA indicated it had completed the transfer of a number of tranches of loans, which included 35 Irish-based hotels, and had begun its engagement with borrowers in regard to business plans on a case by case basis.  NAMA expected that its portfolio of hotel-backed loans would increase further, but not as much as anticipated publicly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was pleased to be advised that NAMA has not, nor does it intend to, subsidise loss-making hotels and accepted the need for adjustment to the new market realities.  Indeed, NAMA has <Col N="178"/>already met the Irish Hotels Federation to allay any concerns that NAMA was acting in an uncompetitive manner or as a monopoly hotel player.  I am pleased to say NAMA is open to taking account of overall tourism policy considerations as its own strategy development evolves.</P>
        <P>The provision and management of finance to hotels, restaurants and other businesses is a complex issue.  For some time now, business interests, with other representative bodies, have been urging Government to help improve access to credit to SMEs.  In order to ensure that applications for credit get a fair hearing, the Government has put in place a credit review system, under the direction of Mr. John Trethowan, to ensure applications for bank credit by viable businesses, including tourism businesses, are assessed in a reasonable manner by the banks.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the difficulties that many hotels and restaurants are facing in meeting the cost of local authority charges and have written to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding these costs.  I have been told the local authorities have taken a number of steps to support local business and employment generally.  Local authorities have also implemented some reductions in their own cost base, with a view to reducing the need to increase charges on businesses and some local authorities have reduced their rates in recent times to support and stimulate employment in their areas.  However, many businesses, particularly those in the tourism industry, are still struggling to meet the cost of local authority charges.  I urge all public representatives to do everything in their power to ensure councils consider the needs of employers when setting their annual budgets, with a view to supporting jobs for local people.</P>
        <P>I have acknowledged on many occasions that we are currently in a very challenging period for Irish tourism.  Tourism worldwide has been deeply affected by global economic difficulties and loss of consumer confidence but the medium-term prospects for a global revival in tourism are very positive.  With regard to future targets the report, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, sees visitor numbers increasing to 8 million by 2015.  The strategy envisages 15,000 new jobs being generated directly in the tourism sector by this growth in numbers.  In terms of achieving these targets, the report recognises that, in the short to medium term, Ireland&rsquo;s best prospects from a tourism perspective are in the United States, Great Britain and the major European markets of Germany, France, Italy and Spain.  In the longer term, it highlights the Asia-Pacific region as one of the fastest growing outbound tourism markets, with China and India being the highest priorities for Ireland.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland was represented on the high level group which drafted the new strategy and it is envisaged that it will also be represented on the new Foreign Trade Council which is being established for the purpose of monitoring, reviewing and promoting implementation of the agreed targets as set out in the strategy.  In terms of prospects for 2011, Tourism Ireland is at present finalising its business plan for next year, for subsequent approval by the North-South Ministerial Council.  I understand that, drawing on the overall strategic objectives set out in Government policy, it will contain targets for returning to growth next year from all our significant overseas markets.  Activity being planned by Tourism Ireland includes leveraging the strength of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, targeting the Irish diaspora abroad and emphasising the great value now on offer in Ireland for visitors.</P>
        <P>New infrastructure, such as the recently opened convention centre in Dublin, will also be used to promote Ireland overseas as a first class professional conference and business tourism destination.  Events in 2011 such as the Solheim Cup at Killeen Castle, the start of the Tall Ships race series which will be hosted by Waterford, the UEFA cup final at the Aviva Stadium and the Irish craft year, as well as the Volvo ocean race which returns to Galway in 2012, can be used to attract significant positive publicity around the world.  They will provide valuable <Col N="179"/>opportunities to place Ireland in the international spotlight and showcase the many attractions we have to offer as a holiday destination.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the domestic front, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue its significant investment in tourism product and services and will also continue to support local festivals and events.  These, together with F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s highly successful holiday at home marketing campaign, are playing a key role in improving tourism revenues around the country as well as boosting employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The quality and value of the tourism product in Ireland has improved dramatically in the past few years.  Accommodation quality, particularly in the case of hotels, is among the highest in Europe.  There are many more things to see and do, and we have built on our internationally acknowledged natural assets and resources.  Visitors constantly express satisfaction rates of well over 90% for their stay here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the Government&rsquo;s infrastructure investment priorities 2010-16, significant funding will be invested in tourism-related infrastructure to promote Ireland as a high quality tourism destination and to maximise the economic contribution of the tourism sector.  This funding will be focused on completing the upgrading of major tourist attractions, developing a small number of key iconic attractions, improving infrastructure for recreational cycling, walking and water-based activities and heritage attractions.  Recent approvals under the tourism capital investment programme have included almost &euro;9 million in respect of the Waterford Viking Triangle, &euro;3 million in respect of Tralee Lee Valley and over &euro;7.5 million toward the development of New Ross Quay, the Dublin Writers Museum, the Irish National Heritage Park in Wexford, phase 2 of the Mayo Greenway and Meeting House Square in Temple Bar.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In acknowledgment of the difficulties faced by the tourism sector, the Government, through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is also investing over &euro;11 million in 2010 in the form of direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises nationally.  The key elements of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise development supports include a comprehensive &euro;3.6 million business support programme; a suite of management and skills development training programmes to tourism clients; measures to better develop, manage and promote tourism destinations; and strong e-business supports to underpin F&aacute;ilte Ireland and industry marketing activities, the delivery of enhanced visitor services and the availability of new on-line learning tools for industry clients.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to contribute and look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators, many of whom are directly involved in the tourism industry.  Any ideas they might have for helping the industry through this very difficult time would be very welcome.  I see this as a partnership between Government, the industry and all of the tourism agencies in an effort to ensure we position the tourism sector for recovery and growth as part of our wider plans for economic renewal.  From my dealings with the industry in recent months, I am confident it can rise to the challenge and will lift itself out of this difficult period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and thank her for her overview.  There is no doubt Ireland has some wonderful attractions and events, of which the Minister listed several, and we very much accept and appreciate all of that.  I am glad we are discussing tourism, which has much potential.  Sadly, however, we are in a queer street and the industry, as the Minister acknowledged, is in difficulty.</P>
        <P>We have had a wonderful hospitality trade down the years and we nurtured it well, a point I am very conscious of, coming from Killarney.  It is frightful that at present, while this does not apply as much in my area, many good hotels are going into NAMA.  To pick up on one of the Minister&rsquo;s points, NAMA has taken in 35 hotels and more will follow.  One of the reasons not many more will follow, however, is that many such hotels are deeply indebted to Bank of Scotland, which has withdrawn, and to Ulster Bank.  The number of hotels in difficulty through<Col N="180"/>out the country, unfortunately, is large, and while this was not masked intentionally by the Minister, who gave accurate information on NAMA, it is being masked by the financial institutions.  These hotels are being choked, which is very sad.</P>
        <P>We have been hit by the global recession, by exorbitant costs and, unfortunately, by the Government-introduced levy on tourists &mdash; the travel tax.  We also had the frightful situation earlier in the year caused by the sporadically erupting volcano which played hell with the trade.  I hope there will be no further eruptions of the volcano in question, especially as it was the cause of major disruption in the past year.</P>
        <P>Tourism is a very important industry and it requires support.  Those involved in tourism probably became carried away during the Celtic tiger era.  The advent of the financial crisis, however, has brought home to people the importance of the tourism industry.  Tourism is important for every town and village and it reaches into every part of the country.  Ireland has suffered more than most other countries, perhaps as a result of the additional factors which come into play here.  Tourism is dependent on a discretionary spend.  In a downturn, such a spend will always be the first thing to be affected.  As a result, even more difficulties are created.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to comment on the figures relating to tourism.  I was provided with a figure of 6.6 million in respect of the number of overseas visitors to this country in 2009.  I have been informed that, as a result of a staffing difficulty, the CSO is no longer publishing figures every month.  In compiling the figures relating to the number of overseas visitors, I understand it may have included everyone from here who, for example, travelled over to Britain and back.  Does the CSO have a method by means of which it can calculate the true figure for overseas visitors?  Have we been placed in a situation whereby the CSO, as a result of the difficulties to which I refer, will not be in a position to provide accurate statistics?</P>
        <P>The impact of the recession has been that since 2007, 1 million fewer visitors have come to this country.  The likely further decrease this year means that the overall drop since 2007 will be 1.5 million.  There was also a 20% drop in the number of bed nights last year.  In such circumstances, I am of the view that a recovery is at least three to five years away.  There are those who have stated that it might even take ten years to materialise.</P>
        <P>Despite the best efforts of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, it has proven difficult to retain business in our top markets.  I often wonder whether we are doing enough to attract business from our nearest neighbour.  Is it possible that we could be more focused in our efforts in the British market?  We should be able to attract even greater numbers of British tourists.</P>
        <P>We face a number of main challenges.  First among these is the fact that Ireland is an island nation.  As a result, affordable access is vital, particularly as 90% of our visitors arrive by air.  However, airport capacity has declined.  Competitiveness is a factor, especially in the context of labour and energy costs.  There is also the banking crisis and the impact of the work of NAMA on hotels.  A further challenge relates to the fragmentation of the tourism industry and the fact we rely on the UK, which is our largest market.  With regard to the latter, currency problems have been a major issue.  The budget cuts announced in Britain yesterday will, when they filter through, also affect tourism here.</P>
        <P>Cultural tourism is very important.  The Minister referred to Dublin being designated as a UNESCO city of literature.  Perhaps there is something more which could be done to foster this type of tourism.  On the activities side, we have done well in the areas of walking, hill walking and golfing holidays.  Again, it might be possible to do better and do more.  The Minister also referred to festivals and events and I am glad these will continue to be supported.  The forthcoming London Olympics may also afford us some opportunities.</P><Col N="181"/>
        <P>I am glad the Minister met representatives from the airlines.  These individuals publicly offered proposals in the recent past.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the position in this regard.  The travel tax is a major deterrent and one receives nothing but complaints in respect of it.</P>
        <P>Despite the downturn, continued investment in marketing is going to be important.  My party has proposed that we could cut the tax on employment by reducing the upper rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI by 20% and the lower rate by 50%.  On average, this would lead to a 3% cut in wage costs for employers.  We also support reducing local authority rates, where possible, freezing Government and local authority charges and reducing energy costs.</P>
        <P>In light of current circumstances, there is a need for a complete overhaul of the wage-setting system set up under the joint labour committees.  I hope Members will forgive me.  I think I am developing a cold and need a drink of water.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  There is one aspect of the hospitality sector which I fail to understand.  I intend no disrespect to them but I am informed that more than 6,000 non-nationals are employed in hotels and elsewhere in the tourism industry.  These people do not have the requisite training, do not possess the skills and do not represent the traditional brand of Irish hospitality.  As those who appear on the front line, sadly they do not give the correct impression.  Given that more than 450,000 people are unemployed, I do not understand how our work permit system can operate in such a way as to allow so many non-EU nationals to work in the hospitality sector.  Consideration must be given to this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to reduce administration costs and deal with the complexities relating to Irish visitor visas.  We must also roll out high capacity broadband to the regions, particularly as a lack of access to this facility is affecting some of those involved in tourism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Action must be taken in respect of the practices of predatory pricing and reckless trading in the hotel sector.  I appreciate what the Minister said in respect of NAMA hotels.  We are all aware, however, of instances where traditional, family owned hotels which are run by people who have been in business and who have given great value for many years are being put to the pin of their collars as a result of what some of their competitors appear to be doing.  I accept NAMA&rsquo;s statement to the Minister to the effect that it does not support the type of behaviour <Col N="182"/>to which I refer.  I must, however, ask the question as to how this is happening.  We are all aware that it is happening and Members will have received many messages in respect of it.</P>
        <P>In the Lower House, my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, raised the issue of the travel tax with the Minister.  He pointed out that in Holland, a similar tax costs three times more than it generates.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this matter.  I had understood that Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary put forward proposals which would have ensured that Revenue would not have been placed at a loss.</P>
        <P>We must take action in respect of the supports being given to hotels that are not viable.  The Minister does not have the answer in this regard and neither do I.  We are aware of what is happening to the family-run operations to which I have already referred.  I do not know if NAMA can do anything about what is taking place.  I referred to the activities of Bank of Scotland Ireland and Ulster Bank in this regard.  There may be a need to consult the Irish Banking Federation in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister has raised the issue of excessive local authority charges with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>
      
        <P>The Minister might provide further clarification in this respect.  There are some penal charges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The golf sector is very close to our hearts and we appreciate the success of the Irish Open in Killarney.  With respect, there is no better venue, although I would say that anyway.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Minister would acknowledge this.  There is infrastructure, capacity and accommodation in place, and the country has 411 golf courses; more could be done with golf tourism.  There is a latent demand for Ireland and the people who love the game all over the world must visit the destination.  It is particularly popular in Britain and America.</P>
        <P>The Irish Open must receive special consideration, as it is popular with the players, the European tour and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The Minister attended the event this year and she might give us an assurance that Killarney will be the host again next year.  That would be best for Ireland as the promotional value is significant.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach would appreciate these issues and in segmenting the golf product, he could give us advice.  There are different categories of courses.</P>
        <P>I will leave these comments with the Minister.  There are many other points I wish to deal with but we will catch up with them.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Mooney, the spokesperson for the Government side, for allowing me to speak first for eight minutes.  Senator Mooney will take 12 minutes.  I welcome the Minister to the House at a difficult time for the tourism industry.  When we look back on 2009 it will be seen as one of the most difficult years ever experienced in tourism.  Everybody was looking forward to the early part of 2010 but unfortunately, the volcanic ash cloud decimated the industry, including hotels, restaurants and guest houses.  We are thankful that the industry has picked up from June, with the Minister correctly pointing out that numbers of American visitors have picked up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This industry has significant job potential and employs up to 300,000 people; therefore the maintenance of employment and opportunities for new positions are absolutely crucial issues and the priority of the Government.  They are also a priority for every Member of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, regardless on which side of the Houses they sit.</P>
        <P>Opportunities which had presented themselves in financial matters for the industry have been seriously affected by the announcement from Bank of Scotland (Ireland) that it is to <Col N="183"/>withdraw from the Irish market.  I understand up to 40% of all the hotel accounts in Ireland are in that bank; I would guess that 80% of all new hotels built in Ireland from 2004 are Bank of Scotland (Ireland) customers.  This will leave significant challenges in the industry as businesses may have to change current and loan accounts for the long term.</P>
        <P>The ground rules at the Department of Finance were known to everybody, with the thresholds clear for investors in the industry who would employ significant numbers.  All the projections for businesses took into account the Government&rsquo;s policy at the time.  However, the Department of Finance has begun to row back thresholds; two years ago it was up to &euro;250,000 that could be repaid without being liable to tax but in the last budget an &euro;80,000 threshold was introduced.  Anybody who knows the business and is worth their salt knows a hotel bedroom could not be erected for less &euro;100,000 from 2004 to 2008.  Without fear of contradiction I contend that 90% of the hotels in Ireland built from 2004 to 2009 will not be in a position to make complete financial repayments within the next 50 years.  The Government has put in place retrospective legislation, which we always assumed would never happen.  It is decimating an industry with massive job potential.  I do not know if the Department of Finance realises the damage it is doing to the tourism industry and the undermining of the current Minister as she faces challenges.</P>
        <P>One advantage for the industry is that quality has substantially improved.  I thank the Minister for her kind remarks and acknowledgement in her major address to the Upper House on the tourism industry.  There is quality in the product available to attract people to our country.  The Government led by Charles Haughey and Ray MacSharry made tourism one of the three planks for recovery in our economy in 1987, and it was proven correct.  When families, multinationals or other investors place confidence in a destination because of the ground rules from the Government, the industry can only be decimated if those rules are changed.  There is no way most people will be able to pay the principal of loans because of what Department of Finance officials have done in the past two budgets.</P>
        <P>I know exactly what I am speaking about because I know many colleagues in the industry.  I know the industry well because my family is heavily involved with it.  Many people are in the position I describe and no further investment will take place in the next five or ten years because the Department of Finance has changed ground rules relevant to understandings and undertakings given by various Ministers for Finance to encourage people to invest in the sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need more tourists to come to our country.  I congratulate the Minister on meeting the chief executive of Aer Lingus and representatives from Ryanair.  Aer Lingus is the flagship carrier of the country and has been a successful company over the years.  Ryanair is the number one airline in Europe and Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary is one of the top business people in Ireland and is one of the greatest achievers and success stories in most of our lifetimes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan is from Kerry, which has the fantastic destination of Killarney, and I congratulate everybody associated with the Irish Open, including F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the 3 mobile phone company and the European tour for the wonderful event.  I congratulate the Minister, who was present to see it all happen and participate.  I did not believe the &euro;10 air tax was a barrier but people insist that it is; if so, we should have a trial of two years.  The bona fides of the proposal should be examined, as the Minister indicated, and I support her in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a shining example from Dallas and Hawaii in how to get people to come to Ireland.  When &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; came on our television screens, tourism to that destination increased fourfold.  When &ldquo;Hawaii Five-O&rdquo; came on television screens, tourism to America increased elevenfold the following year.  I note this because Ireland should have its own television channel on the Sky network.  It could be entitled Ireland Calling and everything happening in Ireland could be beamed out.  Tourists come mainly from the UK, Italy, France, Germany and Spain, and <Col N="184"/>the Sky system can be beamed to all these destinations.  We have all seen this when we are on holidays.  I know the power of television, as 70% of the penetration in the marketing world is through television, with 20% through radio and a fragmented 10% through the print media.  We should go for the masses.  All the footage is available.  For less than &euro;1 million we could have our own television channel beaming out from the UK to all the countries the Minister has outlined to the House which are crucial for people continuing to travel to Ireland.  I would not be surprised that if we started our own television channel we would have a 50% increase in tourism on the island of Ireland within two years.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister and look forward to working with her.  She is a breath of fresh air in terms of listening to proposals.  She has always given us an opportunity to make our proposals and work on them, and I look forward to working with her for the duration of her portfolio in the current Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  My wife and I own a rural pub in east Galway and have a role and interest in seeing tourism numbers increase in that neck of the woods.  As somebody involved in the industry I was hugely heartened to see the Minister appointed to the role.  She had an excellent track record in her previous ministries and approaches things with a can-do attitude which I am sure will come to bear in her tourism role in the near future.</P>
        <P>A contributor to the website <i>www.politics.ie</i> stated two days ago:</P>
        <P LI="1">I flew into Shannon yesterday evening and never saw the place so deserted.  All that was missing was tumbleweed.  At 6.30 p.m. all upstairs bars and shops were shut.  I could only see one other person on the whole floor, the garda on duty at the departure door and maybe 20 people downstairs including staff.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The concern voiced by the contributor is real.  It is reflected in the many calls I have received from people in the west who have passed through Shannon Airport in the past few months.  Shannon is dying on its feet.  From a peak in 2007 it has seen a 55% drop in passenger numbers.  At its height in 2008 Ryanair employed 300 staff at Shannon, had six aircraft based there and served 53 destinations throughout Europe.  Just two years later Ryanair has just one aircraft at Shannon Airport and now employs 45 people.  It will shortly close its route to Paris and, having closed that, will serve just six destinations in Europe from Shannon.</P>
        <P>We have moved from a time where 53 cities in Europe had direct access to the heart of the west, arguably our most valuable tourism asset, to a situation where there are now just six cities.  The argument the Minister made, namely, that the drop in numbers can be partly attributed to the global economic downturn, does not stack up.  Those who remember discussion of the travel tax which began in late 2008 will recall that it was the first time in ten years it was becoming more than apparent to everybody involved in tourism, including airlines, hotel owners and those who owned and operated attractions throughout the country, that a downturn was beginning to happen.  It was the first time in ten years that the numbers travelling through airports had begun to drop and the drop was perfectly apparent to everyone.  I cannot understand what sort of gathering of minds occurred in a room and which, having looked at the figures and an impending drop in tourism numbers and looking for ideas as to how we might halt that drop, developed only one idea, namely, to charge people &euro;10 more every time they set foot in the country.  That decision may have been made at a time when some still believed that our economic growth was set to continue.  It was made at a time when a &euro;10 travel tax was not that much of an imposition on travellers.</P><Col N="185"/>
        <P>We are now in a very different place.  When one logs on to the Ryanair website, as I did this morning, one will find that next March one can travel from Frankfurt to Killarney for &euro;42 return, one quarter of which comprises the &euro;10 travel tax.  If I am sitting in Frankfurt deciding whether to travel to Killarney, Rome, Oslo or Paris, the &euro;10 travel tax will have a very real effect on the decision I make.  Let us consider what is happening in the rest of Europe and the tourism figures in countries which do not have a &euro;10 travel tax.  Tourism numbers in Spain are up 2.9% in the past year, in Germany 7.3% France 3.3%, in Italy 6.3%, in Turkey 24%, in Portugal 5.1%, in Finland and in Morocco 15.3%.  There are two countries which have seen their numbers drop, the UK and Ireland.  What is the common thread?  The UK is imposing an &pound;11 travel tax and we are imposing a &euro;10 travel tax.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister spoke about speaking with Mr. Mueller and Mr. O&rsquo;Leary and asking them what they had to offer in return for dropping the tax.  It is a very valid question because we have to be certain that if we were to drop the tax there would be something for the State in return.  The only figures I can offer are those which Ryanair gave to me in the past number of days.  It told me that if the tax is abolished it can increase the numbers through Cork Airport by 800,000, in Dublin Airport by 4.5 million and in Shannon Airport by 600,000 between now and<?oasys _jy ?>2015.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Who is to know whether those figures are accurate?  I do not want to try to read the mind of the Minister but I have a funny feeling from listening to her words earlier that she is increasingly of the opinion that this is the approach to take.  Let us give Ryanair that opportunity in the next two years and call its bluff to see its bona fides, as Senator Cassidy described it, and see if it can produce those figures.  We do not have a lot to lose and despite what people say about Mr. O&rsquo; Leary there is a certain element of patriotism at the heart of everything he does.  Obviously, as a businessman the bottom line is where the buck stops with him but, if given the opportunity, Ryanair and Aer Lingus could produce the increases in passengers they described.</P>
        <P>I spoke about Shannon Airport.  We have to do something drastic and radical if we are to save it.  Imagine if the situation in Shannon applied to any other industry, where its manager is effectively its biggest competitor.  Shannon Airport is managed by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  It is like having the management of Dell managing Intel in Ireland.  It does not make any sense.  The approach the DAA seems to be taking is that it needs to legitimise and support the decision it has taken to build terminal 2 and in order for it to do that it needs to drive passenger numbers towards Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been a large drop in passenger numbers in Shannon and we will see a similar drop in Cork, and are already seeing similar drops in Killarney and other destinations.  Everything the DAA is doing has the aim of driving passengers towards Dublin and the new terminal, in particular.  Why can Shannon and Cork Airports not compete with Dublin Airport?  Competition has worked for this country in every sector in which it has been applied fairly, legitimately and with some sense of planning.  For example, in the telecoms sector one can now go to a shop and buy a phone &mdash; one operator is giving them away for free.  It would not have happened 20 years ago without the competition we have had in the telecoms sector.  Our electricity prices are constantly dropping because competition works.</P>
        <P>I worked with a charity that flew disabled children and their carers to Lourdes every Easter when 1,000 of us would descend upon the town.  My job was to get them there and back safely.  In doing so I worked hand in glove with the authorities at Tarbes airport, a reasonably sized airport just outside the town of Lourdes.  It is owned primarily by the Tarbes chamber of commerce and Tarbes is a city of approximately 60,000 people.  Why could we not examine the option of allowing Shannon Airport to be owned and operated by the joint chambers of commerce along the west coast and include Galway, Limerick and the other towns which have <Col N="186"/>active chambers of commerce which would have the resources and expertise to run Shannon Airport?  The airport needs to fulfil only one role &mdash; to be a conduit to get people in and out of what I argue is still our most valuable tourism offering, the west coast from County Kerry to County Donegal.  It does not need to make one cent in profit from one end of the year to the other; it simply needs to break even and not be a burden on the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Let us look at some imaginative ideas and innovation.  This is the thinking we need to get the tourism industry back on its feet, as we have a fantastic product.  Recently I attended the opening of a new section of road in Connemara which the NRA developed as a prototype and pilot scheme, as part of which a 3 m wide cycle route was built separately along the main national secondary route.  This could be replicated along the entire west coast where there are many country roads with little or no traffic.</P>
        <P>We have a fantastic offering and a sector which is now willing to do its best to improve the quality of that offering and reduce the cost to tourists.  However, the one outstanding problem is getting people in and out of the country cheaply and efficiently.  This is where the Minister has a major role to play and I wish her the very best in so doing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I also take the opportunity, as I have done on previous occasions on the Order of Business and during discussions on tourism, to state it was one of the most enlightened decisions by the Taoiseach to appoint Deputy Hanafin to this important position.  I did not, cannot and will never understand why certain elements of the media took it upon themselves to not only downgrade her position but also that of tourism, the country&rsquo;s second most important indigenous industry.  Mr. Redmond O&rsquo;Donoghue, chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, summed it up in his 2009 report.  He welcomed the new Minister and stated it was a very good sign for tourism that such an able and dynamic Minister had been assigned to this important portfolio.  He stated he took comfort from the fact that there seemed to be a growing awareness at national level of the importance of tourism to the economy.  I could not have put it better myself.  Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue stated the industry generated almost 200,000 jobs and &euro;5.3 billion in revenue and had perhaps been overlooked during the boom when the financial sector and other more glamorous industries in Ireland had grabbed all of the media&rsquo;s attention.  He suggests that if Ireland is to emerge from the deep recession in which we find ourselves, it will have to be an export-led recovery because most of that &euro;5.3 billion in revenue comes from abroad and tourism is a major part of Ireland&rsquo;s exporting infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to various statistics to highlight the current state of the tourism sector.  As others also referred to this issue, I will not go over that ground again.  I am sure all sides of the House will agree it is interesting that Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue states he believes tourism, particularly through our culture and events, will be central to the nation&rsquo;s psychological recovery and help to restore some of the confidence and positivity we have lost in recent years.  This is the challenge that faces the sector.  It is not only about maintaining and increasing jobs or increasing important Exchequer revenue; it is also about making us feel proud as a nation of what we have to offer and the developments in infrastructure, the hotel sector and various other aspects.  We should have continuing pride in these developments and not fear competition from other countries because we have in place some of the most modern infrastructure.  This has been borne out, not by the numbers of those coming to the country in the past year or two during the recession but by the numbers of those who have come who have expressed high levels of satisfaction with their Irish holiday.  The most recent F&aacute;ilte Ireland research, through its visitor attitude surveys, shows that nine out of ten visitors felt their holiday had exceeded or matched their expectations.  An impressive 98% went on to say they would recommend a <Col N="187"/>holiday in Ireland.  This extraordinarily high level of endorsement of our tourism product provides us with grounds for optimism about the future of the industry.</P>
        <P>I will briefly refer to the ongoing discussions on the airport tax.  Senator Cannon raised the issue today, as he did last week.  I have written directly to Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary asking him to spell out the <i>quid pro quo</i> on what his response would be if the Government abolished the tax.  He is quoted as having stated there would be an increase of 6 million visitors over a number of years.  I have great admiration for him and it is sad that he is not included in the poll under way seeking Ireland&rsquo;s greatest person.  What he has done to open up the travel industry and make travel relatively inexpensive is a monument to his entrepreneurial flair.  I have always publically admired what he has done, irrespective of his peccadillos and idiosyncrasies and the manner in which he sells himself and his airline.</P>
        <P>Underlying the public relation statements issued by Ryanair which capture the attention of those of us in the House &mdash; I am like Senator Cannon in this regard &mdash; the simple reality is that Mr. O&rsquo;Leary embodies the very best of capitalism.  He is there because of the bottom line, namely, the dollar and the euro and how much he can make for his company.  In that respect, when he speaks about the abolition of the travel tax, he bases it on the reduction in airport taxes at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports.  He has not specifically separated the airport tax issue from the landing charge issue.  Invariably, when one reads what he states, they are always tied together.  He will call on the Government to abolish the airport tax but also to reduce landing charges, get rid of the Dublin Airport Authority and blow up or magic away Terminal 2 because it is a complete waste of money.  All of these factors are channelled into the issue.</P>
        <P>Newspapers and the media in general like things simple; they like a 30 second soundbite.  It is very simple to state, &ldquo;O&rsquo;Leary promises 6 million if the Government abolishes the travel tax&rdquo;.  If only it were that simple.  I am encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s statement that she has met Aer Lingus and Ryanair and I wish her well in her continuing discussions with them.  I agree with Senator Cannon that there is a patriotism about Mr. O&rsquo;Leary, despite his capitalist inclinations.  Perhaps this is what we should tap into and the Minister is working on.  I wish her well in that regard.  I will be interested to see whether I receive a reply from Mr O&rsquo;Leary, whom I have met and admire greatly.</P>
        <P>I understand F&aacute;ilte Ireland is developing an exciting and innovative initiative based on the concept of the An T&oacute;stal festivals to actively encourage the Irish Diaspora to visit Ireland during 2012.  An T&oacute;stal was created in 1953 by forward-looking and creative public servants in Bord F&aacute;ilte.  An T&oacute;stal, which means a pageant or a muster, used the slogan &ldquo;Ireland at Home&rdquo; and targeted the UK and US markets using modern marketing strategies way ahead of their time.  Every village, town and city in Ireland was encouraged to set up an An T&oacute;stal council.  It was phenomenally successful and the festivals were the building blocks of our modern tourism industry.  I pay tribute to those innovative pioneers of the industry and the strategies they devised during the hungry 1950s when we haemorrhaged people from the country.</P>
        <P>In 2012 hundreds of millions of people across the world who are Irish or claim to be will be actively encouraged to visit Ireland in all of its wonderful manifestations.  I hope the entire community will be involved in marketing Ireland as a destination.  I am aware that the Minister is already involved in discussions with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the other State agencies to ensure this will happen.  The Irish abroad section of the Department of Foreign Affairs will also be involved.  The best example of the success of such an initiative is the Homecoming Scotland campaign which ran for two years and with which some Members will be familiar.  This is a very exciting concept.  I would be grateful if the Minister could set out her Department&rsquo;s thinking in this regard.  I understand there has been a positive reaction to the proposal, the details of which will unfold in the next 12 months.  If we tap into the Irish Dias<Col N="188"/>pora, we can bring hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people to this country in 2012.  Can one imagine the impact that would have?</P>
        <P>It is not just a question of encouraging people to come to Ireland, we also need to inform them about what they will experience when they get here.  We must ensure our sports and cultural organisations will be involved.  We need to harness the wonderful wealth of expertise and talent in this country.  I look forward to hearing more details about this wonderful and innovative concept which will be directed by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport, with the help of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, the two main State agencies charged with improving the country&rsquo;s tourism sector.  The event may prove to be a turning point.  The lead-in period will allow us to prepare for the initiatives being pursued by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  The Minister has referred to the 2011 business plan.</P>
        <P>I do not doubt the statistics mentioned by Senator Cannon, in relation to European countries, will be met and exceeded in this country.  In that context, I will make a point about the air travel tax.  I would not like us to lose the run of ourselves.  The German Government recently announced plans to introduce an air travel tax as part of a package of budget cuts and taxes.  It would serve as an environmental incentive, given that aviation fuel tax is unenforceable.  While it is too early to predict what the likely impact of this measure on outbound travel might be, it might make air travel relatively less competitive than other modes of travel available to German travellers.  That is the other side of the argument.  It is not as simple as abolishing the tax.  In principle and in spirit, I would be ideologically wedded to Senator Cannon&rsquo;s view that no obstacle should be placed in the way of providing access to the island of Ireland.  As an island nation, Ireland is different from nations on the Continent.  Any obstacle placed in the way of access should be considered and removed.  We can spend as much money as we want on marketing strategies, but the <i>quid pro quo</i> is that we ultimately rely on the airlines to use their marketing strategies to help to bring people in.  I am not calling the bluff of Mr. O&rsquo;Leary and Mr. Mueller.  If the Government is giving serious consideration to the abolition of the tax which is what the Minister seemed to indicate following her discussions with the Minister for Finance, the <i>quid pro quo</i> is that those running the airlines will have to deliver by putting their money where their mouths are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for this debate on the challenges facing the tourism sector which needs to be tinged with realism.  I do not doubt that there is significant potential for the sector to contribute to future economic recovery.  We need to identify the impediments and barriers hindering the development of a more successful tourism product in this country.  I suggest a number of categories can be highlighted in that context.  I refer, first, to difficulties in our transport infrastructure that make it difficult for people to travel to, from and around the country, and, second, to market difficulties.</P>
        <P>The current global economic climate seems to be affecting Ireland&rsquo;s traditional tourism markets &mdash; the United Kingdom and the United States &mdash; more than others.  We need to examine the potential for growth in our internal market and encourage more Irish people to vacation in Ireland.  I acknowledge the work that is being done to highlight the merits of travelling around Ireland and visiting various parts of the country for a week or weekend.  We also need to encourage people from other countries to come here in greater numbers.  I am aware that the new strategy points in that direction.</P>
        <P>I will also focus on the infrastructure that facilitates people in getting in and out of the country.  The traditional State airline carrier, Aer Lingus, is now, more or less, on its own as it competes in the international market.  The former State ferry companies have also gone by the wind.  It is anticipated that the private sector will meet the gaps in the market.  We have had to <Col N="189"/>depend on a co-operative organisation to restore the ferry link between Swansea and Cork.  That service gives tourists another means of getting in and out of the country and availing of tourism opportunities in west Cork and County Kerry not covered by the more traditional transport links in and out of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Difficulties continue to be associated with transport within Ireland.  Many areas showing tourism growth involve activities such as walking and cycling.  Those who take such holidays often prefer not to depend on cars.  That is why the public transport system needs to be at the heart of our tourism strategy.  It is regrettable that Irish Rail decided to discontinue its services on the railway line between Rosslare and Waterford.  I am aware that the decision taken by the National Transport Authority allows for a new operator to offer services on the line.  If a new company were to use disused railway lines in such a manner, not only would it revolutionise public transport services in this country, it would also offer enormous potential for tourism.  The management of the Rosslare to Waterford line by Irish Rail was something of a disaster.  A number of transport companies bring boats in and out of the ferry port at Rosslare.  There was no link between the scheduling of the train service and the arrival of the ferries.  That would not have been allowed to happen if we had had a transport strategy linked to a wider tourism strategy.  That it did happen contributed to bringing to an end services on that railway line.  It does not mean the service is not viable or cannot be run properly.  It is still not too late to avail of the tourism opportunities associated with the line.</P>
        <P>It is important that we adjust our public transport strategy to move from a radial transport system, with spokes extending from Dublin to various parts of the country, to a more integrated network that people could use to travel throughout the country.  One should be able to travel by train down the east coast, across the south coast, up the western corridor and, ultimately, into Northern Ireland.  That would open tourism opportunities in the regions.</P>
        <P>We need more medium-term strategies that link with major events such as the 2012 Olympic Games in London.  When Derry celebrates its year as the UK city of culture, we should provide for a wider programme of activities in Border counties such as Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.  I hope that opportunity will be taken.  Cork&rsquo;s stint as European capital of culture in 2005 has had massive tourism implications for the city.  We need to build on the positive rating given to Cork in a recent <i>Lonely Planet</i> guide &mdash; it was mentioned as one of the best cities in the world to visit &mdash; for example, by developing appropriate infrastructure.  If the private sector does not provide the transport links needed, perhaps the State should get involved, for example, by offering incentives.  If an alternative company reopens the rail service between Rosslare and Waterford, I hope it will inspire us to reconsider how we promote tourism throughout the country as a whole.  This is a time when many of the debates we are having, particularly in the economic sphere, involve the tackling of sacred cows.  If we are prepared to do tackle the sacred cow I have mentioned in the transport sector, it could have huge benefits for the country.</P>
        <P>The tourism sector did not benefit appropriately at the height of the Celtic tiger because just as many were leaving the country on holiday as were coming here for tourism purposes.  If we are to enjoy the economic benefits of tourism in years to come, we will have to make sure more people will stay here for their vacation.  The numbers who come here on holiday should be bigger than the numbers leaving.  I hope we will not see the day when people define their wealth by taking two, three or four foreign holidays per year.  This country has much to offer in terms of culture, scenic beauty and how its people promote their enjoyment of life and welcome visitors.  If all those ends are tied up and if we work around the edges in terms of the ongoing difficulties, I am confident tourism will play that role.</P>
        <P>Much has been said about the difficulties in the hotel sector, in particular with many of the properties being wrapped up in the NAMA process.  That is both a good and a bad thing.  The <Col N="190"/>good thing is that we are becoming more competitive and bed nights and eating out are less expensive than they used to be.  The bad thing is that we are not very good at linking the cultural aspects with where people stay and eat when they come here.  For instance, there are very few combined packages for those visiting many of our major centres, such as Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, where part of the experience should include a visit to the theatre, museums or galleries.  In other countries, local authorities, regional authorities and national tourism departments are good a promoting the idea of all-in packages whereby people experience as much as they can in an area within a particular time.  We do not see enough of that in this country.</P>
        <P>I can think of one example.  I attended a friend&rsquo;s wedding in Bordeaux, although I do not know why it was not in Ireland.  In the middle of town, the municipal authority provides a place in which it provides the local produce without taxation.  We produce food and drink which might benefit from being exposed in similar ways to people who visit our country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We talk about the barriers and impediments to a good tourism product, I reiterate that there is the potential.  Our economic development depends on using our tourism asset to the best advantage we can.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House for this debate on tourism.  Tourism is most important to this country and it is an area which we can grow.  It is in our own hands as to how we promote the tourism industry.  To some degree, I was heartened by the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  The Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport and Bord F&aacute;ilte have been lazy in recent years.  From what the Minister outlined today, new initiatives are being put in place, the Department is getting its act together and we will probably see growth in this area in the coming years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If anyone ever made the case for getting rid of the travel tax, Senator Cannon made a great one.  He spelled out in some detail the benefits of getting rid of the tax.  My party has always said it is against the travel tax.  As Senator Mooney said, this is an island nation.  There are only two ways to get people in and out of this country, by sea or by air.  While the &euro;10 travel tax may seem very small for someone coming to this country on holiday, it could prevent people from coming.  When people work out their costs, they will see they could visit a destination which has no travel tax.  For people on the Continent who have access to bus and rail travel, the &euro;10 tax may well be very off-putting for them.  </P>
        
        <P>I have said on numerous occasions that we have never had a better product.  We have fishing, golf, mountaineering and cycling.  We have never had better airports and air and sea access.  Recently, I travelled on some of the Irish ferries and they are very comfortable and provide a magnificent service.</P><Col N="191"/>
        <P Just="Left">We have never had better hotels but, sadly, the number of hotels built in recent years has been at the expense of the great bed and breakfast facilities.  The bed and breakfast sector is in serious decline because the hotels have taken over.  We must keep those hotels, however, which means we must sell the product and fill them.  There is no reason we cannot fill those hotels.  Westport or Killarney, from where Senator Coghlan comes, are not particularly large towns.  Killarney has a huge number of hotels.  Westport has a small population of 5,000 but has 12 magnificent hotels.  The reason these hotels can stay open is that they market themselves, I am sure in association with Bord F&aacute;ilte.  There is no reason hotels in difficulty cannot be marketed and filled.</P>
        <P>As Senator Cannon said, the travel tax is an imposition on some people coming to this country.  What incentives are being provided by Bord F&aacute;ilte?  Spain gives special deals to people over 55 years of age, including hotel accommodation, access to and from airports, bed and breakfast accommodation, golf outings and so forth.</P>
        <P>I refer to marketing.  A number of years ago I was involved in a company called Mayo 5000 to promote Mayo as a destination.  That was back in the 1980s when it was mainly travel agents who promoted the country.  One gave the product to the travel agents who promoted it.  I am sure there were tourism conferences to which these travel agents were brought.  Nowadays most people book their own holidays and this is where Ryanair, Aer Lingus and all the airline carriers come into play, and that is why it is very important the travel tax is abolished in the budget and I am delighted the Minister has made representations to the Minister for Finance in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The majority of people book their own holidays. What role do Bord F&aacute;ilte and the agencies promoting Ireland as a destination play in reaching out to them?  How do they access them?  Do they access them through Facebook, the Internet or otherwise?  People book cheap holidays on-line.  In the past, people went to the travel agent who might have said Ireland was a very good destination and he or she could do a good package.  These are the people to whom we must reach out.  The likes of Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary and Aer Lingus have a major role to play in reaching out to those people.  They state that they can do a special deal to Ireland through Shannon, Galway, Knock, Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Killarney or wherever, and perhaps we should give them the incentive, as well as taking away the tax.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, might inform Members how we can reach those who book the destinations through the Internet because this is a growing area.</P>
        <P>We have many facilities and there are many activities to do in Ireland.  We have inland fishing and deep sea fishing.  Deep sea fishing is an area that could be promoted widely along the west coast.  We also have great golf courses.  We have by far the majority of the golf links courses in the world and many want to play links golf.  In the 1980s Bord F&aacute;ilte was very much to the fore in promoting not only big international golf championships such as the Irish Open but also amateur golf competitions such as the West Coast Challenge, the Black Bush in the North and one in the south in the Dungarvan area.  These are areas in which Bord F&aacute;ilte should get involved again.  It should bring the golf courses in those areas on board and promote a package where a number of golf courses arrange competitions together.  This would bring people from Canada, the United States and the UK.  The last of these is our nearest neighbour with 60 million people right on our doorstep, and there are 50 million in France.  These are the people to whom we should be appealing.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity and hope the Minister might answer some of the questions I raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of specific questions and instead of dealing with the gambit of areas, I thought I might ask the Minister some pointed questions on the issue.</P><Col N="192"/>
        <P>Following on directly from what Senator Burke said about the golf tourism strategy, the Minister might elaborate on that.  Something of significant benefit would be to develop the amateur angles.  Senator Burke said this was done in the case of several tournaments, but the south of Portugal, for example, is promoting that angle in developing amateur golf tournaments.  The Irish Open is a considerable boost to any town.  Last year it came to Baltray in County Louth and this year it was in Killarney, and it provides a significant boost to the local area as a once-off event.  If we adopted a multi-pronged approach to amateur tours and even an amateur tour which included Ireland as a location at different times of the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Modelled on the Black Bush, as has been said. Senator Carroll is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that could be an innovative approach.  Mr. Dan Flinter is heading up the golf strategy.  There are Members with many different ideas and we might get an opportunity to deal directly with him to link up our various ideas and look at what Portugal is doing in this specific target market.</P>
        <P>In my own area, the Louth Economic Forum has developed a nine-point plan for economic regeneration in Louth, a key plank of which is tourism.  Mr. Ray Carroll, who was general manager of the K Club during the 2006 Ryder Cup, chairs this panel.  I encourage the Minister, if she gets an opportunity, to meet him, or the group as she will visit County Louth soon, or perhaps I could get them to visit Leinster House.  It would be a great opportunity to meet this group to see what it is doing for a county in the north east and how this could be used elsewhere, but obviously not to the detriment of County Louth.  The group is bringing together experts in the area to develop a number of different strategies.</P>
        <P>I was heartened to see within the past two weeks the official opening of the new tourist office at the Tholsel in Drogheda, at the junction of West Street and Shop Street, which has serious potential to draw people in to the heartland of the town.  Within 400 m of the new tourist office, there is St. Peter&rsquo;s Church which contains the head of St. Oliver Plunkett, St. Laurence&rsquo;s Gate, and the mace, which in many respects people felt was a symbol of British occupation in Ireland, which lay hidden for many years but which has recently been brought out to the public.  This is all within 60 seconds&rsquo; walk of the new tourist office in Drogheda.</P>
        <P>There are developments in local communities and the people realise that the Minister cannot come along and, with the sweep of her pen, solve the problem to bring an extra million visitors to the country.  It is up to various communities, local forums and local authorities to come up with the ideas and take their own small measures.  Obviously, the Minister needs to develop the policy on a macroeconomic level, which brings me on to my next point.</P>
        <P>A number of speakers raised the issue of the travel tax.  Senator Mooney articulated well the plan of Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary who said that if the Government cut the travel tax, he would get millions of people to come to the country.  It is not as simple as that, as the Minister stated previously, because Mr. O&rsquo;Leary has a range of issues behind that.  If the Minister cuts the travel tax, he also wants her to look at other airport taxes and then at Terminal 2.  There are a number of problems he wants solved.  Perhaps looking at getting rid of the travel tax could be an option, whether for a six-month or 12-month window, to see whether there is a direct correlation with tourist numbers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Personally, I do not know whether it makes that much of a difference.  For any of us who have been abroad in the past two or three years, the &euro;10 travel tax is not the key factor.  The key factor is the overall price of flights, accommodation and travel between flights to one&rsquo;s final destination.  It is when one gets the whole package that one sees the final figure and <Col N="193"/>decides whether to choose that destination.  It is a little ironic to hear Mr. O&rsquo;Leary say this because often he uses airports that are not exactly in the heartland of the cities he brings us to.  It is difficult to analyse directly and see what difference the &euro;10 travel tax makes because there are so many variables, such as whether the economy is buoyant or depressed, but I still think the Minister should look at removing it for a six or 12-month period and at getting rid of it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The next major issue I wonder about is the strategy for the London Olympics in 2012.  In my final year in UCD as president of the students&rsquo; union, we passed a levy to allow the building of a new 50 m swimming pool on campus in Belfield.  At that time, the London 2012 Olympics had just been announced and we said that it could provide a great opportunity for us to draw in the serious athletes from the four corners of the world who, realistically, would not train at home and come straight into London, and who would look for a base in Ireland.  There were a range of other factors.  There will be competitors from the continents of Australia, Asia, Africa and America who will want a running track in conditions similar to those that occur in London, and that is where Ireland really could make the most of it.  One might not necessarily get a long-term gain out of that but if people want to use it as a base coming up to 2012, there could be benefits subsequently in utilising those services.  We should move towards that.</P>
        <P>From her own perspective, the Minister has talked about different inexpensive projects that we should start looking at, such as walkways and other low-cost tourist initiatives.  Something we should look at for all our towns and villages are earphone tours where, for example, a person would pick up headphones at a local shop and there would be eight, ten or 12 points around the town to inform him or her about the history of those iconic locations.  For the walled towns around the country, this would be a fantastic small initiative and would cost relatively little.</P>
      
        <P>The model used for the dublinbikes scheme involves a private operator, JCDecaux, paying substantial capital costs in return for a commercial gain.  This novel approach could be used in other ways.  For example, if branded, low-cost earphones were used for tours, it would be much simpler for a project to become established.</P>
        <P>On the issue of walks, we need to promote our beautiful scenic coastline.  Last summer, during a week long visit to the Aran Islands and west coast I saw thousands of people cycling.  This should be replicated elsewhere, for example, in the north east.  In Clogherhead, which the Minister kindly visited in the summer to launch the prawn festival, we have some of the most magnificent views in the country and many small country roads.  As Senator Cannon noted, the National Roads Authority has launched an initiative for cycle tours.  We need to focus on small enterprises in areas such as this which could create one, two or five jobs.</P>
        <P>I am heartened by the Minister&rsquo;s initiative and the goodwill she has shown towards many projects.  I look forward to her response to my questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and apologise for my absence during her speech, which was caused by a meeting I had with one of her Cabinet colleagues.  However, I have had an opportunity to read her speech and will make a number of comments on it.  I am grateful to have an opportunity to discuss the issue of tourism with her and appreciate her presence in the House.</P>
        <P>As the Minister will be aware, the Labour Party recently published a policy paper on tourism.  I am grateful to my party colleague, Deputy Mary Upton, who developed our proposals.  I will refer to some of the points made in the paper and give some examples of areas which present challenges and opportunities for the tourism industry.</P><Col N="194"/>
        <P>We all welcome the Government&rsquo;s strategy and action plan and the work done by the tourism renewal group.  In view of the difficult economic times and falling visitor numbers, it is important we work in accordance with an overall strategy to increase the number of people employed in tourism, visiting the country and holidaying at home.  As the Minister noted, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s holiday at home promotion has been highly successful.  This is a growth area because when budgets are tight people are more inclined to stay at home.</P>
        <P>Holidaying at home is also a demographic issue.  As a parent of young children, I prefer to holiday at home because it is easier than travelling abroad.  From my personal experience of tourism in Ireland, I have concluded that parents with young pre-school children form a specific market, almost a subcategory of families, because they can holiday in September and are not restricted by school holidays.  This flexibility allows them to obtain better value, which is a major issue when one holidays in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As Members will be aware, hotel and self-catering accommodation costs can be high.  One of the problems with trying to book self-catering accommodation, particularly during school holiday periods for people with children, is the absence of an overall rating system by which one can establish in advance what standard or quality will apply to a specific holiday home.  In Ireland, one tends to establish such information through word of mouth, trial and error or knowing the area in question.  While this is fine for Irish people, it is difficult for visitors from abroad to try to establish through some central mechanism what are the best quality holiday homes and what holiday homes are accessible for children and so forth.  This is an area on which F&aacute;ilte Ireland could do more.</P>
        <P>A second issue for those holidaying at home with children is the problem of where one goes in the evening.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, tightened the law on children in pubs and while he did so for valid reasons, the measure has had an unfortunate side-effect.  It is often difficult for those holidaying in a rural area who wish to dine out with their children to find an establishment other than a pub which will not kick everyone out at an early hour.  From my experience of holidaying in countries such as Spain which are very welcoming of young children and actively accommodate them in restaurants in the evenings, such destinations tend to win out in this area and people will travel to them because this aspect of holidaying can be much easier than in Ireland where it is often difficult to find places to go in the evening.</P>
        <P>On the issue of access to Ireland for visitors from abroad, as the Minister stated, the tourism review group recommended abolition of the area travel tax.  The Labour Party also favours abolition of the tax and I am pleased the Minister will speak to the Minister for Finance about the issue.  The tax has become a focal point for protest from the tourism industry which perceives it as an obstacle to people coming here.</P>
        <P>An argument is also made for developing tourism on our offshore islands by increasing ferry services between the islands and marketing them as a package.  We must be positive about unique selling points such as our islands.  On all my visits to the islands, especially those on the west coast, I have been struck by their incredible beauty and how under-visited they are by Irish people.  One tends to meet more people from other European countries than from Ireland on the Aran Islands, for instance.</P>
        <P>With regard to regional travel, the Labour Party proposes extending free travel to anyone aged over 66 years who visits Ireland.  We also propose marketing the idea of a golden trekker, which would target a specific demographic market.  This proposal has significant potential as those aged more than 66 years, like parents of pre-school children, are not confined to travelling <Col N="195"/>at peak times.  They could contribute to filling excess capacity in our hotels during off-peak periods.</P>
        <P>Integrated ticketing for public transport in Dublin is an important element of a transport strategy to improve tourism.  Such a system has been promised for many years and is long overdue.  Will the Minister indicate integrated ticketing will be introduced?  I understand it will be launched in 2011, although we have heard many times that it will be introduced within a year.</P>
        <P>Signage and interactive mapping are other areas which we need to improve.  People from abroad who come here on driving holidays often complain about signage.  We should try to ensure signs at specific sites lead people to other local attractions.  For example, tourists visiting St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral could be directed, through signage, to the antique district on Francis Street, which is a unique part of medieval Dublin and one which is often overlooked by tourists travelling from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral and Christ Church to the Guinness Storehouse.  The idea, therefore, is for people to be mapped or signed through urban centres and rural areas.</P>
        <P>On-line resources also need to be improved.  I will cite two examples of interesting, small-scale initiatives in Dublin which have great potential.  The first, in which friends of mine are involved, is the Dublin culture map, which can be found at <i>www.dnote.info</i>.  The Minister may be aware of this clever idea, which is a simple cultural guide that provides information in map format on galleries, art spaces, theatres and other locations of cultural interest.  Ideas of this nature can generate interest in Dublin&rsquo;s cultural sites and attractions among tourists and indigenous visitors to the city.  This type of low level initiative should be supported by the Department.</P>
        <P>A second initiative, which a friend informed me about at the weekend, is <i>Dublin.lecool.com</i>, a Dublin franchise of a weekly newsletter and website which provides an alternative culture guide for different cities.  While the idea is new in Dublin, the Barcelona-based newsletter and website covers London, Madrid, Istanbul, Moscow, Lisbon and Budapest.  I understand Vienna and Paris will be covered soon and the project is in development for Dublin.  This is a small initiative being taken by a couple of individuals with a background in arts and event organisation.  It is a good idea because it sets out to market Dublin as a cultural attraction to different groups who search on-line rather than through more traditional routes such as travel agents, brochures and so forth.</P>
        <P>We must also examine how we harness technology for tourism in other ways, for example, creating cultural audio tours for MP3 devices or as podcasts, which could be downloaded free of charge on-line.  Famous individuals &mdash; Bono immediately springs to mind &mdash; could do the narrative.  I recall visiting the Forbidden City in Beijing on a visit to China many years ago and being stunned to find that Roger Moore was providing the commentary on the English language audio guide for visitors.  It was surreal to be guided through this ancient Chinese attraction by his voice.  However, it lent a certain additional element to the visit.  Using prominent figures in the arts and music world, in particular, as icons for the Irish tourism industry, if they were willing to do so, would be a really good idea and attract a new type of visitor.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party document refers to the concept of niche tourism and my specific interest lies in trying to develop cycling tourism, in particular.  Amateur cycling events have become a major crowd generator in Ireland.  During the summer I was involved in a minor way with others who participated in the Sky Ride in County Clare.  This huge event, which started and finished in Ennis, attracted more than 1,000 cyclists and closed roads in west Clare for a day.  It brought a huge number of visitors to Ballyvaughan and its environs.  It was an excellent example of how visitors could be attracted.  The scenery was magnificent, happily the weather was good and I understand the event will take place again next year.</P><Col N="196"/>
        <P>Other speakers have mentioned the dublinbikes scheme which also has been an important way to promote tourism in Ireland.  However, when trying to build tourism attractions for cyclists, Ireland has fallen down in the provision of rail transport services.  I have taken up the issue with the Minister for Transport and should have forwarded my correspondence to the Minister who is present in the House.  It arises from my experience in trying to take bicycles from Dublin to locations such as Clare, west Cork or County Kerry.  Ireland has some brilliant and well developed cycling routes such as the Kerry Way which one can complete in a number of days.  However, the difficulty is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has changed its policy on carrying bicycles on its trains.  I have raised the matter in the House previously, with the Minister for Transport and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann directly, but I have been told the policy is not going to change any time soon.  Unfortunately, because Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s trains no longer have guards&rsquo; vans, it cannot guarantee in advance that it will be able to carry more than three or four bicycles on each train.  This means that if one has a group of eight or nine friends coming over from England, France or Spain to participate in a major cycling event, as one might often do, they must arrange their own transport through the bus network or hire cars, which for many cyclists is not what they want to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has one minute remaining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I have much more to say.  However, we must consider how we can adopt a holistic approach to developing cycling tourism, one niche which offers great potential.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party document contains many more ideas.  Cultural tourism could be a major draw in Ireland, as we are uniquely well placed to take advantage of it.  One idea brought forward by Deputy Upton is to hold Culture Night more than once a year because it could act as a major draw.  As the Minister is aware, there is a huge array of highly successful festivals nationwide.  I refer, in particular, to the Festival of World Cultures in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, with which the Minister is familiar and which grew from very small beginnings involving a couple of individuals who were supported by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  It has now developed into a major draw for people from many other countries and throughout Ireland who come to D&uacute;n Laoghaire every August and has been a huge success.  We must consider the promotion of festivals in a holistic way, as well as promoting niche markets of the sort I have mentioned.</P>
        <P>In addition, we must perceive and promote the arts sector, for which the Minister also is responsible, to attract tourists.  The National Campaign for the Arts has made the case successfully for the promotion of cultural tourism as a genuine growth industry in Ireland.  In its recent survey F&aacute;ilte Ireland has stated cultural tourism, both domestic and international, is worth more than &euro;2 billion to the economy.  While I have seen other figures suggesting it is worth up to &euro;5 billion, it is clear a large number of visitors come here because they are attracted by particular aspects of Irish culture.  This must be promoted both within Ireland as part of the domestic tourism campaign and externally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and wish to be associated with the remarks made by previous speakers on her good work in the Department.  </P>
        <P>Previous speakers have alluded to hotels and the crisis faced by them.  As a crisis should be an opportunity to do something positive which should not be wasted, it is good that we are having this debate.  When discussing hotels, one is inclined to refer to the major chains.  However, a hotel in receivership in County Donegal was put up for sale for  &euro;500,000.  As one would not have been able to buy a house for that amount a couple of years ago, that is telling.  There should, therefore, be greater emphasis on small family run hotels which are unique, as <Col N="197"/>one appreciates when one travels abroad to countries such as France where they are quite different.  Many hotels in Ireland and other countries operate on the same model, are all decorated in the same fashion and do not differ from one another.</P>
        <P>On road signage, a bugbear of mine, it is a case of a lot done but more to do.  When travelling around the country, I often remark to myself that I do not know how tourists ever find their way around.  Some signs are obscured by trees.  This has been true for years, particularly in the midlands.  While I will not reveal their specific locations, other signs have been pointing towards ditches for years.  I recently attended a conference and getting in and out of the town in question was an absolute nightmare.  It took four hours and I never again want to return to the place.  In addition, there should be less emphasis on taxing goods, beds and so on and a greater emphasis on taxing detrimental environmental influences such as pollution.</P>
        <P>I refer to the village of Howth, located in the area I represent, to provide examples of where much more should be done.  It is probably one of the nicest villages in Ireland, let alone Dublin, but it only has one hotel.  As there are very few facilities there to attract tourists, I ask what can be done.  Marine tourism could be developed and great ideas have been presented by the local  community council, as well as by fishermen such as Mr. Brian Doyle.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Connick, held a very positive meeting with them.  Moreover, in common with all harbours nationwide, many small buildings have lain empty for years in the village.  The leases expired and people did not renew them.  In the context of marine tourism, they could be used for home industries such as jam making or similar activities.  A lot of assistance could be provided in this regard.</P>
        <P>Another area with potential is marine and ship maintenance.  I accompanied fisherman from Howth and representatives of its local community council on a visit to Kilkeel Harbour last year to see how it operated.  We found that it was absolutely booming.  One of the biggest aspects of its business was the field of marine repairs and maintenance.  When I asked from where it drew its clients, I was informed that they came from southern Ireland and Howth.  When I asked what was the reason for this, I was informed that it was 25% cheaper to use its facilities.  When I raised the issue with the Department responsible for marine affairs, I was told there were matters with which we had to comply in the Republic.  We should get rid of them and do business in a more competitive manner to create jobs.  That is the way forward.</P>
        <P>There is too much bureaucracy and too much bickering about small things.  For example, discussions on the location of a monument in Howth continued for two years on foot of objections.  My point is that this is not simply the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport, other Departments also are involved.  I refer to the Departments of Education and Skills and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which has responsibility for marine affairs, as well as the local authorities, all of which should be brought together.  While Howth has a tourist office, no one knows its location.  It is situated at the end of the harbour and there is no signage for it.  Despite this, 7,000 people visited the office in a recent quarter.  These are small things that could be done but which have not been.</P>
        <P>In addition, we must engage in upskilling.  For example, nets used to be made in Howth.  The old traditional skills, such as cheese making, must be promoted and facilities provided for people to upskill in these businesses.  People are now willing to do anything or go into any type of business.  The other day, I received a card from a former engineer who is now painting and doing up houses.  People must be given the assistance and encouragement to take up new skills.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik mentioned ticket integration by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  That should be done.  There is a great public transport service to Howth.  The DART goes there.  I would go further than Senator Bacik recommended.  A tourist in Cork, for example, should be able to buy a ticket in Cork that would take them all the way to Howth.</P><Col N="198"/>
        <P>We had a great angling industry, with people coming from England, France, Germany and other countries.  I do some fishing myself and I have good knowledge of the fishing in our rivers and lakes.  That business has gone.  It provided terrific business for bed and breakfast establishments.  Bed and breakfast providers should be supported, even more than hoteliers.  We are inclined to think they do not matter and are old-fashioned and outdated.  This is not so.  There is still a great deal of business for bed and breakfast providers.  I was in a bed and breakfast house in Donegal recently.  I met a fellow guest who comes from Belgium every year and stays for three months in the same house.  The woman of the house asked if I could explain why he did that.  I could not, except that he was a man of 80 years of age and nursing homes in Belgium might be expensive.  We should not forget about the bed and breakfast business.  We should support it.</P>
        <P>When we market tourism we should emphasise the fact that this is not &ldquo;rip-off Ireland&rdquo;.  This is not being done sufficiently.  One political party put this slogan on posters.  What a welcome for people driving into an Irish city from an airport to see a placard saying, &ldquo;You have now entered rip-off Ireland&rdquo;.  I hope that party never goes back to that campaign.  It did an amount of damage.</P>
        <P>I will pursue the rip-off Ireland slogan and tourism facilities in Howth with the Minister.  Many good people in Howth are doing very good work.  We had very productive meetings with the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, who has responsibility for marine matters.  I have some ideas on the subject and I ask the Minister to consider them.  We may work in conjunction with each other and bring all the interested groups in Howth together.  They are splintered and not united, through no fault of their own.  People need guidance, courage and assistance.  This is a very important industry which employs a large number of people.</P>
        <P>The National Employment Rights Authority is torturing employers.  Its staff go around at night querying employees and wasting time.  They should be redeployed to do some meaningful work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Leader on making this debate possible.  On the Order of Business, Members regularly request a debate on tourism.  We also like to think of this as being on an ongoing basis.  It should not be a once-off debate.  It is important that we keep up to date with developments.</P>
        <P>The tourism industry has met challenges over the years.  Bord F&aacute;ilte did a fantastic job of work with very limited staff and exceptionally dedicated people.  In the local regional tourism organisations and tourist offices amazing work was done by a small number of people.  With the new development of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland we are able to reflect the progress we made with the Good Friday Agreement.  In the context of tourism, that agreement should not be underestimated.  The Troubles in the North were one of the biggest challenges we met in Ireland.  Those of us who travelled abroad at that time, especially to America, met numbers of people who asked us if Ireland was safe to visit.  After an exceptional and costly marketing campaign by Bord F&aacute;ilte an incident might take place which would be reported throughout the world.  That was an amazing challenge.  Even before the Good Friday Agreement we could see improvements, although we saw many setbacks.  The establishment of Tourism Ireland has meant that marketing the whole island is much easier.  There are interactive attractions on both sides of the Border.  It is important that they be highlighted.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I met a delegation from Derry.  They are interested in holding the Fleadh Cheoil in Derry in 2013, when Derry will be the UK city of culture.  They made the point that people are now visiting the North to see where the various events unfolded.  There is a message for us here about the historic sites we have.  Excellent infrastructure has been put in place.  We talk <Col N="199"/>about the recession, but we should not ignore the fact that the Government did the right things at the right time when it had the money.  Development at tourist attractions, man-made and otherwise, is central to our tourism industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the past eight or nine years, there has been a tendency to focus more on Dublin than on the rest of the country.  I remember a time when large numbers came in to Shannon Airport and virtually remained in the Shannon region.  Five or six counties used benefit from that business.  That is changed, to some extent.  I do not suggest an anti-Dublin marketing campaign but we need to restore the balance that existed previously.</P>
        <P>Many discerning tourists come to Ireland.  Some tourists come in very large groups but others come with very specialist interests.  Those people in particular could be guided to other parts of Ireland, because there are things there for them.  The other day I met a couple from St. Louis.  The lady was the former chancellor of the university in St. Louis.  She was absolutely beaming because she had free travel in Ireland. I compliment the Minister on this.  These people would not be caught for a dollar but the mere recognition delighted them.  They were heading to Killarney and they telephoned me from there.  While I state an individual case, one can multiply it many times over.  It indicates that peripheral things will often bring people to realise that Ireland is a country worth visiting.  I thank the Minister for the free travel initiative.  I have no doubt that when the couple I met go home, they will become part of our marketing campaign because they will talk about their free travel to their friends in St. Louis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Brady referred to bed and breakfast accommodation.  We are particularly lucky that hotels are now learning to compete.  That was vital.  Prices now seem much more realistic, not just for visitors to Ireland but for Irish people holidaying at home, who are also important to the industry.  Everyone is pleased at what hotels are offering, but there is a danger that the bed and breakfast sector will suffer in the process.  Much work and investment has been put into bed and breakfast establishments and people of a certain age group have paid considerable personal attention to them.  One will not find younger members of the family staying at home waiting for the telephone to ring but the people who generated that business in the past were very important.  We should try to relieve the bureaucracy they face.  I accept the need for health and safety regulations but the level of bureaucracy and its consequential costs are more than a person running a bed and breakfast establishment can handle.  Perhaps the Minister would order a survey of the bed and breakfast industry.  While I am aware of the difficulties that can arise, would it not be nice if bed and breakfasts establishments could avail of some form of licence to sell intoxicating liquor?  That is one of the great challenges for the sector.  An individual bed and breakfast establishment will not sell a large volume but it would be more than a service and it might generate further business.  Hotels can be impersonal places to stay, particularly those which are not family run and we should not underestimate the public relations value of staying in somebody's home.  I do not want to see bed and breakfast establishments disappear but I would not be surprised if statistics showed that up to 30% of them closed over the last two years.  This is happening not just because of the recession but also due to challenges like bureaucracy.</P>
        
        <P>We continually speak about the 1980s but the tourism sector has encountered challenges in every decade.  I can hardly remember the recession of the 1980s but it was very different in many ways.  We now have an infrastructure which is second to none.  My friends who came from Derry yesterday noted that they look for the good roads in the Republic, whereas it was the other way around 20 years ago.  We have a good rail system and great roads, hotels and attractions.  We have much that we can build on.</P>
        <P>Given tourism&rsquo;s decentralised nature, it can do more than any other industry to lift the spirits of the people.  Even the remotest of places attract tourists.  Any resurgence will lift the morale of communities throughout Ireland.</P><Col N="200"/>
        <P>The Minister has spoken eloquently about cultural tourism on many occasions.  She was completely correct to note that we will be 50% ahead if we can market a product to which we have exclusive rights.  What we have is distinctive to us and well presented and because of our antiquity and connection with civilisation, there is much we can do with it.  The mere fact of the richness of our cultural tourism gives us a head start.  The Minister and her Department have been helping the industry to promote this area and it should be put centre stage in any future debate on tourism.  Ag an deireadh, traosla&iacute;m leis an Aire.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A number of Senators raised the issue of the air travel tax.  I met the airline operators to discuss this tax.  The initial estimate was that the tax would earn &euro;125 million for the Exchequer.  That is a significant sum of money, particularly in the current environment.  In light of the decrease in tourists and travel experienced this year, the figure will probably be smaller but it will nevertheless be substantial.  We will not know the precise figure until closer to the end of the year.  If we do not charge a travel tax, that money will have to come from elsewhere.  The central issue in my discussions with the airlines was not so much what the passenger pays as what routing decisions the airlines make on the basis of the tax.  As several Senators have noted, it is unclear whether &euro;10 will make a significant difference to the individual traveller when he or she is already paying for their bags and other charges.  It does, however, appear to have an impact on airlines&rsquo; decisions.  Senator Cannon was incorrect to claim that Ryanair has offered thousands of extra seats and hundreds of thousands of visitors solely in return for the removal of the air travel tax.  As Senator Mooney pointed out, that airline is also seeking the reduction or removal of charges at Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports, as well as changes in respect of Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport.  If I am to present a case to the Department of Finance, I need to find out what exactly the airlines can offer in return for the removal of the air travel tax.</P>
        <P>In terms of Ireland&rsquo;s marketing strategy, it is critical that we can present ourselves as an island at peace.  Both parts of the island benefit from being marketed as one unit and for this reason Tourism Ireland is jointly funded on a North-South basis.  There is nothing lovelier than to promote Ireland in New York, Frankfurt or London with the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway and the Cliffs of Moher on the same banner.  We are thereby able to present Ireland as a small but <Col N="201"/>beautiful island.  Tourism Ireland uses the entire range of modern media to promote Ireland and it is represented on 41 websites and in 19 languages.  It use social networking media, such as Facebook, to market the quality and value of our product.  However, the message about value for money will not reach its audience until next year because we only began offering good value this year.  Both those who stayed at home and visitors to the country found good value this summer but that message will reach a wider audience by next year.</P>
        <P>The golden trekker and free travel offers were a huge success.  We have not yet reached agreement on repeating these offers next year but I am hopeful that we will do so.  The silver surfer programme, which offered two-for-one deals to senior citizens, was also successful.</P>
        <P>Golf tourism has significant potential.  I will take on board Senator Carroll&rsquo;s advice on amateur competitions.  As Senators will be aware, Padraig Harrington is our golf ambassador and he has generously given his time and name to promoting the country.  The title of our promotional campaign is &ldquo;Time to Play&rdquo; and it markets the concept of leisure and relaxation while playing on one of our 400 golf courses.  The idea of attracting people to the country for a range of activities is critical.  Senator Bacik referred to cycling.  The programme for Government noted the difficulty with carrying bicycles by rail, on which we are following up.  We have developed cycle routes and cycle hubs in places like Killarney and the Mayo Greenway, as well as walking routes throughout the country.  Working in conjunction with Coillte, the Irish Sports Council and the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, we are seeing huge progress in this regard, including the development of playgrounds for children in villages and towns and the effort to ensure facilities are available for children, for whom we are always anxious to have more facilities developed.</P>
        <P>Fishing was referred to.  Senator Brady spoke of the importance of villages such as Howth, and the same is true of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, in trying to get yacht clubs, county councils, local businesses and politicians to work together in the interests of a town.  This is happening.  I opened and attended a number of festivals during the summer and made a point of ensuring it was not just the big festivals in Galway or Killarney but also what I thought would be smaller festivals, such as the Clogherhead prawn festival, only to find there were 2,000 people at the opening in Clogherhead and only 200 at some of the bigger festivals.  This shows the initiative that towns are taking to generate interest and attract people to their areas, from which businesses benefit greatly.  This will encourage the authorities to ensure important issues such as access, signage and ticketing are co-ordinated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Building on other events taking place, we see potential in the 2012 Olympic Games and have launched DCU, UL and UCD as potential training places for teams coming to the Games.  To date, we have had confirmation that the United States synchronised swimming team will use the National Aquatic Centre as its base on three occasions.  To have a team of that status will bring great publicity to the sports facilities in this country.  We know the economic value for tourism of having, for example, Ireland playing France in rugby here or hosting the matches which took place in Thomond Park in Limerick.  This type of sports tourism gives a significant boost in terms of business and accommodation in the towns involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I met the chamber of commerce in Donegal in regard to Derry being designated the city of culture as I believe Donegal can benefit from that.  The year 2012 provides a further opportunity, as Senator Mooney said, in regard to An T&oacute;stal and the idea of people coming home and coming together to organise different events.  I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to progress this very quickly because I see significant potential in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As was rightly said in regard to cultural tourism, as we has exclusive rights to our culture, it gives us an added edge.  People come to Ireland for its natural beauty and the friendliness of the people but also because we have a distinctive culture and visitors know they will have a <Col N="202"/>very different experience from that in any other country they visit.  We have been building on that in regard to capital infrastructure to be able to support visitors but also in regard to developments such as the census on-line facility.  We have had 9 million unique visitors on the website of the 1901 and 1911 censuses and 240 million hits, which shows the interest.  The next message to all those users is not just to look at the website to see about their grandfather, great grandfather and other ancestors but also to take this to the next stage and come to visit Ireland.  We are building on that also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the coming weeks, there will be much interest in the budget and related difficulties.  At the same time, we will be undertaking strong marketing.  We will attend the World Travel Market in London to promote Ireland and go to New York for Farmleigh Mark II and to promote Culture Ireland&rsquo;s activities in the United States &mdash; only for a day in each case, let it be said.  Next year, there will be a focus on branding Ireland and we will also meet the media markets in Paris.  We discussed previously the importance of the French market to us.  In addition, we have visited Frankfurt to meet market representatives there.  One of the great points about the way the tourism marketing budget is organised is that it is no longer spent over a whole year but seasonally, which means it is possible to identify new issues that have arisen.  I know all in the industry are hugely committed to doing this.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators for their genuine interest and for their many suggestions which we will certainly follow up.  There is an acceptance among us all that tourism is a vibrant, resilient industry which has the best interests of the country at heart.  That is something I am very proud to market on its behalf.</P>
