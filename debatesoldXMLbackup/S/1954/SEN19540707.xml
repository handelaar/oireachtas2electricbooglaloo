      <P>I understand that the business is as on the Order Paper with the addition that there is a Land Bill in the Dáil this afternoon, and it is expected that we would be likely to be able to deal with it this evening say about 7 o'clock if the House is agreeable. I understand that there is agreement to take it in the other House and pass all its stages, and it is hoped that a similar agreement could be reached here by this House so that we might take it at 7 o'clock.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1954&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Collection of Taxes (Confirmation) Act, 1954, which became law on 29th June last, the Financial Resolutions passed on Budget day this year were deemed to have had statutory effect from the outset and were continued in effect for a limited period pending the passing of the Finance Bill.  The Finance Bill now before the House embodies these Resolutions and provides as well for certain other items requiring legislation, most of which were mentioned in the financial statement on 21st April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> It is scarcely necessary at this stage to give a detailed analysis of the Bill, which has already received some publicity. I will refer only to those sections which deal with matters not covered by the Budget Resolutions or explained in the financial statement.</P>
    <P>The first sections to be mentioned, taking the Bill in this manner, are Sections 6 to 9 inclusive, in Part 1. These relate to the exemption from income-tax of certain statutory pensions, gratuities and allowances.  Section 6 exempts pensions payable to the widow of Terence MacSwiney and the widows of the former Mayors of Limerick&mdash;Michael O'Callaghan and George Clancy.  The other two sections bring up to date the tax exemption of pensions, gratuities and allowances under the Army Pensions Acts.  Section 10 merely brings Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1924, into conformity with the extension under the Courts of Justice Act, 1953, of the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts.  Section 12, which I might also mention, extends to future issues of transport stock&mdash;a Government guaranteed security&mdash;and to stock of the E.S.B. the privilege of dividends being payable without deduction of tax.</P>
    <P>I shall pass over the first four sections in Part II of the Bill which provide for the alterations in the duties on beer, matches and rural entertainments announced by my predecessor, and come to Sections 17 to 20, inclusive. These four sections deal with the termination of various customs duties no longer deemed necessary and at present suspended by Orders made under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Acts.  These Orders are due to lapse on the 31st March next and the suspended duties would automatically revive next day unless previously terminated.  In addition, Section 18 provides for the termination of the excise duties on glucose and saccharin.  The commodities covered by these sections are in Section 17, boots and shoes; Section 18, glucose and saccharin; Section 19, mats of straw, rush or grass; and Section 20, the items listed in the Second Schedule.</P>
    <P>I might explain with regard to the single Section 21 forming Part III of <Col N="883" /> the Bill that Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1943, was designed to stop possible evasion of corporation profits tax, including excess corporation profits tax, by preventing companies from claiming exemption on the ground that they were precluded by their constitution from distributing profits.  It is now considered that the section may safely be repealed.</P>
    <P>The undertaking given in the prospectus of the 4½ per cent.  National Loan, 1973-78, that stock of the loan would be accepted at its face value, with due allowance for any unpaid interest thereon, as the equivalent in cash in satisfaction of death duties, is implemented by Section 22 in Part IV. The authority is phrased in general terms and may, where so desired, be extended to any similar loan issued in future.</P>
    <P>In Part V, Section 23, as well as implementing a concession announced in the financial statement by abolishing the £5 stamp duty on special licences for marriages in Protestant places of worship, discontinues, for administrative convenience, the 1d. stamp duty on certificates of births, deaths and marriages.  Section 27 is the only other section in this part of the Bill requiring comment.  It exempts from stamp duty receipts given for payments under the Health Acts to persons suffering from an infectious disease and receipts for certain other payments to necessitous persons.</P>
    <P>Section 28&mdash;the first of four sections in the last part of the Bill&mdash;relates to the amortisation arrangements in respect of borrowings for voted &ldquo;capital services&rdquo; in 1953-54 and 1954-55.  The purpose of the other three sections is self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>That deals briefly with the technical aspects of the Bill.  So far as the general principle of the financial policy which this Bill enshrines is concerned, I think I made fairly clear in the other House&mdash;and I am sure that members of the Seanad have read it in the newspapers&mdash;the view that we have expressed that, because the date of the general election was put back, it was impossible for the incoming Government <Col N="884" /> in the time available to it to bring in and put through the Oireachtas new financial proposals.  It was impossible to bring these proposals in and to give them sufficient time to have operative effect in this financial year.</P>
    <P>That fact that we were not able to do that was not of our choice.  It was the deliberate choice&mdash;as they were entitled to take a deliberate choice&mdash; of the previous Government when they decided early in March to hold the general election after the inception of the financial year and on the date on which it was fixed.  Having taken that decision and the general election having been held at that time, we had no option in the circumstances but to accept the position as we found it and start from there.  The Bill, therefore, in its technical aspects to which I have referred is the Bill introduced following the financial statement made by my predecessor on 21st April last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in concluding his explanation of the Bill, said it was a brief summary of its technicalities. This Bill is a Bill to implement the Budget proposals and the Budget proposals of 1954 are similar to those introduced in 1951, with the exception of certain reliefs amounting to something in the region of £2,000,000 which are given in this Budget.  If we cast our minds back, we can remember the manner in which the 1951 Budget proposals were received and the statements then made by responsible persons who now occupy ministerial posts. We were told that these proposals inflicted great hardships on our people, that they contributed to unemployment and to stagnation in industrial and agricultural production.  I do not wish to quote many of the statements made at that time, but I want to remind members of the House and those who may read the Official Reports of the proceedings of the Seanad that the measure we are asked to pass to-day gives approval to the provisions of that Budget except for the reliefs given in the Budget of 21st May last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reliefs given are reliefs which the majority of the people appreciate. They are reliefs which extend to the great majority of our people and <Col N="885" /> amount to something in the region of £2,000,000.  The Budget this year removes from the category of payers of income-tax something like 40,000 people; it gives considerable reliefs to the widow and the widower; it makes provision for increased allowances up to £20 per child in respect of children; and it gives facilities, encouragement and reliefs to those who are prepared to set up house and to purchase their homes.  It makes provision also for a reduction of a ½d. per 2-lb. loaf of bread which will amount to £1,000,000 in the financial year.  The country in general welcomed the fact that, after it had been found necessary to put our finances on a sound basis, we had arrived in 1954 at the stage at which we could give these reliefs.  It was an encouragement to our people who could look with confidence to the future for reliefs of larger amounts.</P>
    <P>The people who now constitute the Government suggested that the taxes imposed to meet the current expenditure of the Government were not necessary, that the huge demand, as they referred to it, was not essential for the carrying on of the functions of a Government and they suggested many ways in which there could be given a reduction in general taxation and, at the same time, a reduction in the cost of living and in the costs of the commodities which the people in general consume.  While it may be suggested that a relief of ½d. in the price of the 2-lb. loaf is a relief for which the people should not have very great appreciation, I suggest that it was a more beneficial relief than what the Minister now proposes&mdash;a reduction of 5d. per lb. of butter.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like the Minister to give us more details, to give the House figures for the amount of creamery butter at present being consumed and the estimated increase which will arise due to the reduction of 5d. per lb.  He might also tell us whether this amount will be paid to the farming community who produce farmers' butter and, if not, whether the Government have taken into consideration the very serious effect which that will have.  The Minister for Agriculture in the previous Coalition Government stated that the bulk of <Col N="886" /> the butter produced by the farmers' wives was not fit for the table and would be more appropriately used for the greasing of carts.  That had a very serious effect and I am sure Senators who are interested in the farming community fully realise that.</P>
    <P>When the subsidy was removed from farmers' butter, those farmers who were engaged in that particular occupation had no alternative but to get out of milch cows.  They did so and were put on to the purchase of creamery butter.  If that is going to recur we will have the same state of affairs brought about and in a very short space of time we will have, as we had in the short period of three and a half years, a reduction of something like 20,000 in our milch cow population.  Those who are interested in the dairying industry will agree that it is the backbone of our agricultural industry and that if we have any serious decline in our milch cow population we will naturally have a general decline in our cattle population. While the Minister and the inter-Party Government may welcome an increase in beef production, you must remember that you cannot have the beef production without the cow population and any suggestion that is made for political purposes or otherwise should take that aspect into serious consideration.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this proposal. When the Central Fund Bill was going through the Seanad, I think Senator Baxter, who is the representative of the dairying industry and creamery industry in this House, asked the then Minister when was it proposed to give an increase to the milk producer and when was a report from the Milk Costings Commission expected.  We have heard now from the person who is in the responsible position of Minister for Agriculture that he has no great faith in whatever report this commission might make. Whether Senator Baxter has changed his views in connection with the demands the farmers were making for an increase in the price of milk&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator quote what I said in that regard because that is not what I said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="887" />
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter queried the price of milk and what the farmers would be paid for milk in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Baxter would like me to trouble the House and delay the proceedings by reading his whole speech on this occasion, I would be quite prepared to do so. However, the members of this House have heard Senator Baxter make the same speech over so many years that I will not worry them with a repetition now.</P>
      <P>We have seen in our daily papers that the Minister for Agriculture has sent an instruction to the creameries throughout the country that they may now export butter.  The Minister and Senator Baxter know as well as I do, if not better, that, at the price prevailing at the moment, butter cannot be exported from this country to any other country.  Therefore, I suggest this proposal to provide a subsidy to reduce the price of butter is not of itself a proposal to give cheaper butter to our people but a proposal to enable the Minister to subsidise the export of butter and that whatever may be the immediate effect of whatever statement may be made now, that will be the ultimate effect of it.</P>
      <P>In connection with the proposal before the House, the Minister in this and in the other House claimed our indulgence for not giving us more detailed information and for not bringing before us a Bill in conformity with and giving effect to the policy of the present Government, because of the short time at his disposal.  I would like to put one or two questions to the Minister.  Has he seriously considered what effect this Bill will have on the country as a whole and is he satisfied that the passing of this measure and the giving of effect to the demands it is going to make in regard to taxation are in the best interests of the country?  If not, he should have withheld the introduction of the Bill and brought in that Bill that he and his Government would consider to be the proper measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> There are many aspects of the situation on which one would like information. There is a general anxiety amongst our people to have a statement from the responsible Minister, who is the Minister for Finance.  We have had up and down the country during the general election campaign statements made that the previous Government accepted the advice of the Credit Corporation, that credits were frozen, and that because of that there were serious repercussions upon the country in general.  It was suggested that all that was necessary to bring about a liberal flow of credit facilities was to change the Government.  When it was suggested from time to time that the credit facilities that were available were there for those who were credit-worthy, we heard the cry: &ldquo;The creditworthy man does not want any of those facilities because he can get the credit anyhow, but the person who cannot get credit should be provided for and will be provided for when we bring about this desired change of Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like also to get some information as to what is going to be the attitude of the Government to the many State-sponsored organisations we have and in particular to Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna has become one of the greatest employers in this country. It has done tremendous work, and I think those who advocated the development of this great national resource of ours are very proud to see that this week we have representatives from 14 nations who are here to discuss problems with our people and to see for themselves the great progress that has been made here.  Is this great organisation going to be allowed to continue and, in particular, is it going to be allowed to continue in its own way, especially in regard to the recruitment of its employees?  We have had a very wild charge made by a responsible Minister of this Government that recruitment in this and in other spheres was conducted on political grounds.  There is a veiled threat behind this suggestion and I would like an assurance from the Minister that there is not going to be any ministerial or Government interference with the day-to-day operation and work of such <Col N="889" /> organisations as Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. or those other organisations that are doing their work in such an excellent way.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the National Development Fund.  A good deal of criticism was offered during the general election campaign to many of the proposals that were put forward for the utilisation of this fund and particularly in connection with Dublin Castle. This proposal was put forward by the inter-departmental committee that was set up to put proposals before the then Government, it was accepted as an essential project in that the building at present occupied by the staffs is in such a condition that they could not continue to be employed there.  The responsible Minister stated in the Dáil, I think, that this particular project would be abandoned.  What does the abandonment of that project mean? It means that the Civil Service staffs occupying these buildings at the moment must be housed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Where will they be housed?  Will they be housed by taking over private buildings throughout the city?  I suggest that already too much of that has been done to the detriment of the housing of our people.  That project was one which should be continued so that the staffs there would be housed properly. The present Government seem to have grave anxiety about the Civil Service as they made a promise that there would be no less a sum than £1,000,000 provided to give the full award of the arbitration tribunal.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have the greatest regard and respect for those employed in the Civil Service. They are all boys and girls, the majority of whom have come from the country.  They are all giving very good service and any of us who come in contact with them, particularly with the higher officers, have nothing but the highest regard and praise for them. If we did not give the full award, it was because we had to recognise the financial position at the time.  It should not be suggested because of that that we do not hold in the highest esteem the claims and privileges of the Civil Service.  I think that is one of the <Col N="890" /> reasons why we should see that as far as possible they should get what the State can afford and that they should be housed in the best manner the State can afford to house them.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to be more free with the House and give an outline now of what he proposes to do. Not alone is the House anxious to hear that but so also is the country.  The absence of such a statement is having a serious effect on trade and it would relieve that anxiety if the Minister could give any indication as to the great reductions in prices the public have been promised and which they expected.  There is a withholding of orders by the general trade throughout the country.  That is bad for industry, commerce and for the country in general.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to suggest, when you are in opposition, what you might do if you had control, but when you take over control and find the things you thought were possible cannot be accomplished, I think it is only fair that there should be a definite statement made as to when these reliefs might be given.  If it is not possible to give them this year, let that be clearly stated.  It will have a good effect and will be of great benefit to our people.  Whether that statement is made or not one very good thing to my mind has arisen out of this position and that is that in future we must have more honesty and more truth in Irish politics.  We must act more responsibly in political life and take more care when we make promises and statements of this kind to the general public.  I should like to have from the Minister a more clear and definite statement of policy in regard to what is in store for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have expected that in the dying hours of this House there would have been a little more realism brought into the Chamber than that which emanated from the speech made by Senator Hawkins.  He says there is general anxiety on the part of the people for a statement from the Minister.  I do not think there is any evidence whatever of that.  I think that any of us who come from the <Col N="891" /> country will admit that there was never more calm and peace in the political life of the country than there is to-day.  The election and the results of the election have had the most amazing stabilising effect on opinion. It has no doubt damped down the spirit&mdash;sometimes the almost disorderly enthusiasm one might say&mdash;of some of our people but if we are to judge by the tone and temper of the men in all Parties in the country there is an acceptance of the present political situation in a manner that does credit to the country.  I would say that on behalf of the people who are now in Opposition and who were defeated at the last general election just as I would say it of those of us who were the victors.  There was no great jubilation and defeat was accepted in a good spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no defeat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>They realise by now that a considerable majority wanted a change of Government.  We have got that change of Government and the people will permit the Government to carry on with their job just as they try to get on with their jobs.  That is a new and very welcome spirit.  I think the Minister is quite justified in saying that it would be unreasonable for anyone to expect from him a complete change of policy from that which was being pursued by the Government who outstayed their welcome.  There was nothing else for the Minister to do but to introduce and implement the proposals of his predecessors.  I would have thought that the Opposition would have acclaimed that decision on the part of the Minister.  I do not know whether they are acclaiming or denouncing the Minister for accepting their proposals, but whatever their temper and mood about it is, the fact is that he has done that.  He was very wise.  It was a much more sensible thing for him to do that than to come in and attempt to upset the whole house and change everything overnight.  I think it was very wise and far from his being denounced by all sides of the House he should be applauded for his right decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> I had hoped that both truth and realism would play a greater part in Irish political thought in the future than many of us have experienced over a very long period.  People in political life are frequently denounced.  We denounce each other.  Sometimes we are denounced by people who are not very prominent in political life but who are prominent in other walks of life.  Let us try in our own way to make a contribution in a reasonable, realistic manner and if we do that I think the government will be better.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins made a number of statements.  To me, they did not seem to hang together.  He asked when were we to have the general reduction of prices that has been expected and promised.  I do not know who made statements promising a general reduction of prices.  I do not think the Minister or any other members of our Party in their speeches up and down the country did so.</P>
    <P>If there were evidence of such declarations, Senator Hawkins would have introduced the document and read it to us.  That is sufficient proof that those statements were not made. A reduction of prices all round would be very desirable, but I was amazed at Senator Hawkins's attitude to the ministerial decision on the reduction of the price of butter.  It seemed to me he was not pleased about it, as he said it would have been better to reduce the price of bread by more than ½d.  How is one to please a Senator like that?  I am sure the reduction is as welcome to the Senator as it is to anyone else.</P>
    <P>I had hoped he would have approached the problems of the country in the spirit in which a Fianna Fáil Deputy in the Dáil last week attempted to approach them, when he addressed himself to them on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  If Senator Hawkins does not like to hear or to read my speeches, I suggest to him that at least he should read the speeches of his colleague, Deputy Moher, in the Dáil last week.  He would see a striking similarity between those speeches and mine.  I would commend to Senators on the other side that they should begin to think on <Col N="893" /> the lines along which Deputy Moher obviously is thinking to-day.  If they would do so and give their views in that fashion, they would be making a considerable contribution to the betterment of the people on the land and in that way to the betterment of all the people.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins referred to a ministerial decision taken in the last few days making it possible for us to export butter.  I do not know whether he is for or against that; I do not really know whether he knows himself. I would have imagined that would be something which he would have liked. On several occasions we heard him and his colleagues talk about the serious plight of the country, due to the balance of payments position.  The only way in which we can rectify our balance of payments, when it is going against us, is by trying to increase our exports of whatever commodities we have in which there is a surplus available. He is talking about our dairying joined to our beef.  One would be inclined to think he is against the export of beef.  One would have thought we had passed away from those dark, unhappy days.</P>
    <P>Those reading the Press in the last day or two felt a slight elation that Irish beef on the British market was commanding a very high price.  We all should hope that that high level of prices can be maintained, as the higher it is the higher living standards we can enjoy and the less we have to fear that the balance of trade may go against us. When the Senator spoke of the decision to export butter, he said he believed this proposal was to enable the Minister to subsidise the export of butter.  Surely Senator Hawkins can recall the days when we not only subsidised the export of butter but of beef, lamb, pigs, and everything we were sending off the farms?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing myself to the decision to export butter.  If, in the judgment of the Minister for Agriculture, butter production has risen to such a level that we cannot consume it all&mdash;even at the reduced price at which this Government has made it possible for the people to purchase it&mdash;what are we to do with it?  Are those opposite for or against the export of butter?  Do we not all know that if you can raise production to a certain level, beyond the capacity of our own people to consume the product, you have to export it or destroy it?  We have heard denouncements of other countries where wheat was burnt.  What are we to do with butter when we cannot eat it, or with lamb, pork, pigs and beef that we produce here?  Is the Minister who finds this surplus available to be denounced for the decision to export?  It seems to me to be a very sensible decision and it was better to take it now than in September or October next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can trust the Government of to-day to act wisely, carefully and with discretion.  I hope we will have larger quantities of butter to export in the future.  I believe that the prices for our exports after a little while will be lower than they are to-day, because the general trend of agricultural prices <Col N="895" /> is downwards.  That is unfortunate for us as a food-exporting country, but we have to contemplate it and visualise it and be prepared to grapple with the problem.  The people on the other side of the House will make a major contribution to political thought and economic development here when they are able to point to ways by which we here will become more efficient in our production, so that our export price may be lower but our income as great, if not greater than before.  That is why I would commend to the Senators opposite the wisdom of reading the speech of Deputy Moher.  They will find there a completely new approach, certainly from the Fianna Fáil angle, to the agricultural problems of this country.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the Minister should be congratulated from the Fianna Fáil side of the House for doing what he has done.  I am rather astonished that they want to disown their own child. I would have thought they would have applauded the man who took it to himself and tried to bring it up as a healthier baby than it was when it was passed on to him.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter in his last sentence expressed the wish that we applaud the Minister for adopting the Estimates and the Budget prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government.  We can go this far&mdash;we can commend him for his wisdom in accepting the Estimates; but what Senator Hawkins wished from him was an assurance that he was going to work in the future in the spirit of those Estimates and of that Budget. When Senator Hawkins spoke about honesty in politics amongst the variour Parties, I noticed that my friend Senator Burke said, &ldquo;hear, hear.&rdquo; During the last general election every politician knows, as do the ordinary people of the country, the campaign was the most dishonest ever carried out against a Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give plenty of them.  I heard Senator Baxter say that <Col N="896" /> no promises were made to the people. I listened to the candidate that Senator Burke spoke for, making this statement in the village of Cloneen: he announced there that if returned to power the prices of stout, bread, butter, tea, and various other commodities would be reduced immediately. I felt so keenly that day about those promises that I referred to them in a speech which I made at Mullinahone immediately afterwards.  On that occasion, I challenged them to state definitely&mdash;because I was anxious about the matter&mdash;whether or not the promised reductions in prices would result in a reintroduction of the rationing measures which, I felt, were in line with any proposals for bringing about a big change in the way of a reduction of prices.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke is as well aware as I am that in Clonmel a shop window was devoted to a display of the advertisement which the Fine Gael Party published both in the newspapers and in pamphlet form&mdash;the advertisement which showed the prices operating in 1951 and those operating in 1954.  The ordinary people may, in their opinion, be very stupid but the ordinary people did not fall for that line of propaganda. They knew it was simply Fine Gael bluff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not, and I will prove it.  In the County Tipperary &mdash;the county for which Senator Burke speaks&mdash;we walloped your Party completely. When our two candidates were elected, we had some 6,000 votes to spare.  We beat the Government and we beat them in rural Ireland on all those promises in relation to prices that were definitely made from Fine Gael platforms throughout the length and breadth of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard all kinds of foolish statements from Fine Gael platforms during the last general election.  I heard it stated from a platform from which the Minister for Agriculture spoke in Kilkenny that gloom and despair were stalking the land.  I assert that the country was never more prosperous <Col N="897" /> than it was when we handed it over after the last general election.  I assert, further, that prices were reasonable and that the price of butter was reasonable.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter spoke about a reduction in butter prices.  What, in fact, is this reduction?  You are taking it out of my pocket in order to give it back to me, and there is a loss in the exchange.  Every sensible person knows that a reduction by way of subsidy is no real reduction and that it is simply pulling the wool over the people's eyes.  If we want to give a reduction in prices, why take the money from the people in the first instance in order to give it back to them?  We realise that the Government were in a difficulty when they were faced with the redeeming of promises made on their behalf from election platforms.</P>
    <P>At the close of the counting in Clonmel, when moving a vote of thanks to the returning officer, I said that we had been faced with a dishonest campaign. I pointed out that while the leaders stated from the platforms that they would make no promises except to do their best, their supporters and candidates made these promises deliberately to the people.  The people were not, however, fooled by them except in Dublin City and some other places like that.</P>
    <P>Recently, I was asked by a civil servant to intercede with the Minister in order that she might get the bonus bribe which was offered&mdash;the arbitration money.  That offer was nothing but a bribe.  The taxpayers' money was to be used in order to win votes for certain candidates.  I have no doubt but that that particular bribe did get sufficient numbers throughout Ireland&mdash;small though they were &mdash;to bring about the change that gave the people on the other side the majority which they now hold.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the House that in the Province of Munster we had a majority in at least five three-member constituencies.  Take, for instance, Clare, which on this occasion was a three-member constituency&mdash;Senator McHugh's constituency.  Take also North Tipperary, East Cork, South <Col N="898" /> Kerry and West Limerick.  These are five three-member constituencies where the people definitely showed their disapproval of the present Government and definitely showed their disapproval of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator sure of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain of it. We had a majority in these five constituencies. It is interesting, therefore, to hear Senator Baxter inform us of the way in which the people rejected the Government.  We know they did, and, as he said, we accept their rejection.  We are glad that the Minister has the common sense to implement this Budget.  Nevertheless, Senator Hawkins is perfectly entitled to ask the Minister when he proposes to bring about the price reductions which were promised and which induced some people, at any rate, to give them the support they got at the last general election.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins referred to a number of matters which I should like to develop somewhat.  There is the question of the roads of Ireland.  In South Tipperary, no topic was more prominent from the platforms of the present Government than the story of the Bray Road.  I understand that in the Estimate for the coming year no provision is made for the expenditure of money on the Bray Road; that was the Estimate we prepared.  However, from every Fine Gael and Labour platform we heard talk about the shocking expenditure of money on the Bray Road.  I might mention that though Deputy Norton, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, was announced as coming to Clonmel he did not turn up.  Indeed, it would have been a very embarrassing situation for him.  We heard speakers from the Labour platforms denounce the Government for all the money which, they said, they were spending on the Bray Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to bear in mind the enormous sums of money which were spent over the years on a Kildare road &mdash;the Naas Road.  We heard nothing at all about that.  Deputy Sweetman, the present Minister for Finance, could <Col N="899" /> not denounce the Government for employing people on the repair and maintenance of the Naas Road and neither could Deputy Norton but the Bray Road was wide open for attack and neither of these two Deputies was concerned with it.  One would imagine that a Fine Gael man or a Labour man with any common sense would revel in the fact that our roads were being brought up to the required condition and that some of our people were being given employment on them.  It was money well spent on bringing our roads up to the standards that are definitely required if road travel is to be safe.</P>
    <P>We were nearly deafened by all the talk we heard about Dublin Castle and the squandering of money on it.  We heard Senator Burke and other speakers dwell on that topic.  There was plenty of talk about spending the taxpayers' money to build palaces for civil servants to work in, and so forth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>I am a Tipperary man and I am talking of conditions with which I am familiar.  After 30 years of self-government, I regret that we have <Col N="900" /> not given greater attention to the erection of public buildings.  I know of no way in which money could be better spent or that would establish this particular generation in this country so far as the future is concerned. In other countries we see the great buildings they have erected&mdash; very often out of public funds.  In our Irish towns and cities the only buildings that are worth while are those which were built by private enterprise. As Senator Hawkins said, our civil servants in Dublin Castle are undoubtedly working under the worst possible conditions.  The buildings of Dublin Castle are in ruins, and any sensible Senator who walks into them will realise that that is a fact, that they must be either torn down, evacuated or reconditioned.  If we had a report from an inter-departmental committee making certain recommendations to the Government that certain reconditioning of these premises should take place, that does not commit a Government to anything, but of course it is a useful weapon for Opposition groups to use even though we did not make provision, as I have already said, in the Budget to do anything about it.</P>
      <P>I think a great loss is that we did not pay more attention to the erection of buildings of that description.  We ought to be rather proud that we have here in Kildare Street the Industry and Commerce building.  It may be that if we were building it at the beginning of this general election we would hear an awful lot about all the squandering, as we did with the bus station.  We have no apologies to make.  I believe that we should devote more of the public funds to the erection of proper public buildings not only in our city here but throughout the country.  This is one of the things that will stand, when this generation has passed, as a reminder that this generation was mindful of what it should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see them encouraging native craft in the dressing of stone buildings even though they are much more expensive than those concrete monstrosities we have in a number of places.  Anything that will give work to the imagination of our architects and use our native products and our <Col N="901" /> craftsmen is to be commended.  It is regrettable that the representatives of big Parties in this country should condemn a Government that has even half-expressed approval of something which will add to the beauty of our country in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter brought us back to the sins of those who held power here and caused the subsidising of things like butter and beef and so on many years ago.  I happened to be in the Dáil when Deputy Costello, the Taoiseach, was announcing his new Ministry, and in the course of that announcement he expressed the great satisfaction it gave him that he had the wonderful legal knowledge of Deputy McGilligan and also, of course, his wonderful knowledge as a Minister when appointing him as Attorney-General. If I recollect properly, the same Taoiseach was the Attorney-General of the old Free State Government, and it was his advice during the later years of that Government on which the Government acted.  During that time&mdash;this is just a little preamble to something in connection with the economic war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These were clauses, he said, that could not be removed.  His advice caused very grave hardship to half the people of Ireland over a number of years.  His advice was also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think I have sufficiently proved that point.  If we had a united Parliament fighting that battle at that time it is very evident now after the years that have passed that that economic war would never have lasted and that these penal tariffs and so on that had to be imposed would never have been imposed.  We proved by the results in 1937 and 1938 that Britain was quite willing to yield when we had any kind of a united front at all and the economic war was wiped out.

I might advise him that the people in the country generally are making a joke now of those particular promises which we allege were made.  They are making a joke of the 5d. reduction, in the price of butter because many of them are sensible enough to realise that that 5d. is coming out of subsidy and that the subsidy is coming out of taxes and therefore coming from the people themselves.  We are entitled to that knowledge and I hope that the Minister will tell us something about it.</P>

      <P>Ask any ordinary person through the country what he felt.  I can tell you one person who said it.  I listened to a Fine Gael candidate in South Tipperary announcing to the people in the village of Cloonee &mdash;there were no Press present&mdash;that when they were returned to power&mdash; and he was very positive about it&mdash; that the price of the pint&mdash;it is always the pint they refer to&mdash;would come down and that the prices of butter, tea and sugar would come down.</P>

      <P>I want to begin the few words I have to say by welcoming the Minister to the Seanad on the occasion of the first Finance Bill <Col N="906" /> he is introducing.  He is an old member of the House&mdash;he was a member years before I was a member&mdash;and I am very glad to see him coming back. I hope he will introduce many more Finance Bills in future years.  He will always be welcome in the House of which he was a member, but he will be more welcome the lighter the load of taxation he brings in the Finance Bill.  A Minister coming with a Finance Bill is coming to perform an unwelcome task and there will be an inverse ratio between the warmth of the welcome for the Minister in his old House and the amount of taxation which he proposes in the Finance Bill every year.</P>
      <P>One thing I think I can say is that he will not remain very welcome in future years if the load of taxation he proposes is as heavy as the load he is proposing this year.  I fully accept that he is carrying on the proposals of the previous Administration, that he is not really responsible either for the Finance Bill or the Appropriation Bill which are to be introduced in the House to-day.  We therefore all hope that in future years he will bring us better news than he has brought to-day in the way of a reduction of taxation which can only be based in the long run on a reduction in expenditure. We therefore look forward to hearing from the Minister next year good news of a reduction in expenditure which will make it possible for a reduction in taxation to take place.</P>
      <P>Any criticisms I have to make of the Finance Bill&mdash;and they will not be many&mdash;are, therefore, of the Bill and not of the Minister, who is not responsible for its drafting and is responsible merely for its introduction.  The reason I make these suggestions is not that I have any hope that they will be adopted in the course of the present debate, but in order to put what I may respectfully suggest are some good ideas into the Minister's head on which he may ponder between now and next year when drafting, and not merely introducing, the Finance Bill for 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Seanad will not accuse me of being a person with a single idea, obsessed by the King Charles's <Col N="907" /> head of income-tax, if I return to that subject of which I have spoken several times already.  The reason I return to it is that I have reason to believe that there is a very considerable amount of public opinion aroused on the subject. This is the occasion on which to try to give expression to some of that public opinion, when we have the Minister with us.  I should like to say that, for reasons which I will explain later, the Finance Bill now being debated makes the income-tax position worse rather than better than it was before.  It is perfectly true that there are certain concessions in the Bill, but I think I will be able to give reasons to show that the injustice and inequity of income-tax have become greater and not less as a result of the changes in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Income-tax has been fully debated in this Chamber before.  There was a motion before the House a couple of years ago, as a result of which the former Minister for Finance appointed a committee on income-tax with very limited terms of reference.  The main point I wish to put before the Minister is that the utility of that commission would be very greatly increased if the terms of reference were widened.  I have discussed the commission with various of its members and they have told me that they are to some extent handicapped by the narrowness of the terms of reference.  The terms of reference practically confine the commission to discussion of business depreciation allowances, wear and tear and the effect of income-tax on industrial profits.  It is quite impossible to segregate matters of this kind in this way, and the members of the commission have been forced to reject memoranda from witnesses on the ground that the matters in the memoranda are not within the four walls of the very narrow terms of reference, whereas they are very definitely relevant to the income-tax position as a whole.</P>
    <P>I therefore ask the Minister, before putting his own mind down to this all-important question, to consider the possibility of amending the terms of reference of the commission.  It should, in my opinion, not only embrace the <Col N="908" /> whole question of income-tax but also a matter to which I will come back, the possibility of alternative sources of revenue.  To discuss the injustice of income-tax in isolation is rather barren.  Unless the commission is able to put forward suggestions, as I propose to do, for alternative sources of revenue, the commission is condemned to academic exercises in what I suggest is an unduly narrow field.  I ask the Minister not merely to widen the terms of reference of the commission, which to some extent puts off the responsibility of facing this issue, but to apply his own mind independently to some of the very serious problems involved.</P>
    <P>The Chancellor of the Exchequer in England has recently promised a radical revision of the income-tax code. I refer the Minister to the current issue of <i>The Economist</i> in which, at page 55, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Chancellor stated that he would prefer to consider a general overhaul of the income-tax system than a piecemeal reform of anomalies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say in the same extract:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the Chancellor considers that now we have the commission's report and the opportunity really to tackle this complicated branch of the income-tax law in its entirety it would be unwise to tackle it unless we can do so on a comprehensive and logical basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has been a Royal Commission on Income-tax sitting for many years. Several interim reports of great interest have been presented to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  In spite of that it apparently is the intention of the Chancellor to reinvestigate income-tax in a radical manner.  I appeal to the Minister to make a similar investigation in this country. If the income-tax code in England is ripe for a radical reinvestigation, for reasons which I have given in the Seanad before, it is still more ripe here.  The income-tax code was never really suitable for Irish conditions and in the last 100 years it has become more and more unsuitable, more and more <Col N="909" /> unjust, more and more out-of-date and in need of revision.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will remain in his present position for several years.  I appeal to him to use his time not merely to tinker with the existing income-tax system but to take a larger view of the subject, to consider it in relation to the fiscal system of the country, to scrap a bad system, lock, stock and barrel, and to put something more suitable to Irish conditions in its place.  As I said, when the matter was debated here a couple of years ago, the income-tax code in England is based on a number of political assumptions which are not universally agreed to-day. The high progressive taxation, which seems to be taken almost universally for granted as something self-evident, is not self-evident.  A great many politicians and a great many economists to-day are questioning the whole basis of this form of taxation both on the ground of the political repercussions in regard to the taxpayer and on the still deeper ground of moral and ethical justice.  The whole question of progression, which seems to be taken for granted by every politician in England and Ireland to-day, is open to very serious question.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to apply his mind to this matter, free of outmoded political assumptions which, as I say, are being discarded in many very reputable intellectual quarters at the present time.</P>
    <P>Last year was notable, amongst other things, for celebrating the centenary of the application of income-tax to Ireland.  It was not a particularly joyful event&mdash;there were no bonfires or flags&mdash;but it is an event which should not have been allowed to pass unnoticed. Income-tax, as everybody is aware, was imposed on Ireland for the first time in 1853 by Mr. Gladstone, avowedly as a temporary measure. When income-tax was imposed in 1853, Mr. Gladstone, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, stated quite categorically and definitely that it was a temporary measure to recover some of the loans made for famine relief which had become irrecoverable in other ways. Ever since then the income-tax remained on the Irish taxpayer right up to the Treaty.  Since the Treaty Irish <Col N="910" /> Ministers for Finance, I may say without disrespect, have shown a certain lack of imagination in dealing with the subject.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in addition to being a financier, is also a lawyer.  Reform of the common law has proceeded more rapidly in England than it has in Ireland.  The Irish legal profession seems to be content with a legal system which has been regarded as outmoded and out-of-date in many respects in the country of its origin.  As regards income-tax, as I said, a Royal Commission is sitting at the present moment in England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer has promised to approach the question in a very radical frame of mind.  Nevertheless, we go on limping slowly after the English income-tax authorities. The one step which could always be more or less accurately foretold in regard to an Irish Minister for Finance is that if English income-tax rises, Irish income-tax will rise very soon, if not by the same amount, certainly in the same direction.  In this respect it is very like the bank rate.  Since 1922, when the rate of income-tax in England was raised, the Irish income-tax rose almost invariably.</P>
    <P>I do appeal to the new Minister for Finance to approach this problem with a fresh mind and with a greater degree of originality and imagination than any of his predecessors since the Treaty.  Even if the income-tax was ever suitable for the circumstances of this country, which I suggest it was not, in its present form it has become out-of-date and is in need of radical revision in many directions.  No adequate allowance has been made in recent years for the great changes that have taken place in the value of money.  The income-tax code still seems to assume that money values are the same as they were in the middle of the 19th century.  I will give two or three examples of the way in which changes in the value of money have rendered necessary a revision of the income-tax code.  The first matter to which I will refer&mdash;and I hope I will not get into great trouble with some of the rural representatives in the Seanad&mdash;is the position of farmers. The income-tax on agricultural land <Col N="911" /> and property in this country, as everybody knows, is related to the rateable valuation of the land, and the rateable valuation of land has not been altered in the last 100 years in spite of the great change in the value of money and the unreality of the old values.</P>

      <P>I am now talking about income-tax, not about rates.  I intend in this speech to confine my remarks to the subjects in the Finance Bill and not to refer to other matters, as previous speakers have done.  I would refer on this matter to a memorandum on income-tax prepared for the Committee on Income-tax by the Irish Trade Union Congress in which the question of income-tax on agricultural land is dealt with very briefly.  What I intend to quote is only a very small part of an already condensed statement.  It is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The fact that this is largely an agricultural country makes it difficult for an income-tax code to operate wholly equitably since the income of farmers is difficult to assess in the absence of any widespread system of farm accounts. Farmers as a class pay very little income-tax.  Farmers as such are paying much less than 1 per cent. of the total income-tax.  It must be admitted, however&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and this will give comfort and solace to the great majority of the farmers</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;that the great majority of farmers are in all probability not liable for income-tax because of the fact that their income is below the exemption limit after taking into account the various reliefs and allowances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Trade Union Congress memorandum goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...we deduce that the great majority of farmers&mdash;about four-fifths&mdash;are not liable for income-tax, but that a relatively small number are.  It would seem that a large number of farmers on holdings of 50 acres and over, <Col N="912" /> numbering some 80,000, should be liable for income-tax on the basis of their farm income, yet only a minute minority are even assessed for tax.  It is difficult to devise proposals which would ensure that these farmers paid their fair share of income-tax and which would at the same time be equitable and practicable. The problem is one, however, which requires serious study and investigation.  The present system of relating the income-tax liability of farmers to the poor law valuation of their holdings or to the original land purchase annuity provides a possible basis.  Even though the general valuation of this country was made nearly 100 years ago, it is generally accepted that valuation is still a fairly reliable index to the value of farm land.  If this is so, the present method of assessment of farmers under Schedule B could be retained as a basis, but the assessable value taken as twice or three times the poor law valuation instead of the amount of the poor law valuation as at present.  Farmers' income (not including wages of farm employees) has increased nearly fourfold since pre-war, yet there has been no change in Schedule B assessments under the income-tax code.</P>
    <P>In any event, modern conditions require farmers to utilise proper record keeping in order to progress in their own industry.  The income-tax code did much to push business in this direction to its own advantage and the same indirect benefit would accrue to the farmer if he were required to keep and produce accurate accounts.</P>
    <P>It might be mentioned here that for the purposes of the Health Act, 1953, a farmer the valuation of whose holding is over £50 is put on a par with an employee with more than £600 per annum (or £11 11s. per week), which suggests that the view is held officially that a farm with a valuation exceeding £50 is equivalent at the least to an income of more than £600 a year.  There are around 33,000 agricultural holdings with a poor law valuation of more than £50.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> The whole question of the revaluation of agricultural land must sooner or later be faced.  One of the benefits which would accrue from such revaluation would be that a number of people who are now exempt from income-tax might be <i>prima facie</i> liable if they were not able to prove that their actual income was less than the amount liable to taxation.</P>
    <P>Another inequity caused by neglect to take account of changes in the value of money is that the personal and dependents' allowances, in spite of recent increases, are still inadequate. On this matter I should like to refer to a statement on the Budget which was published in the newspapers and prepared by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations.  Calculations are made in that statement of the change in the cost of living of salaried workers.  It is pointed out that the rise in the cost of living has not been compensated for even in the new allowances in the 1954 Finance Bill which we are debating to-day.  The following are the figures which are given in the memorandum. In 1935 the allowance for single persons was £125; married persons, £225; and children, £50. The equivalent allowances to-day should be £323, £582 and £129 instead of £150, £300 and £85 given in the Budget.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has increased even to a small extent these allowances is a recognition of the justice of the claim made by the conference. He boasted that the Bill excludes a further 40,000 people from the payment of income-tax.  I will come back to that matter in a moment.</P>
    <P>Another injustice caused by the failure to take into account changes in the value of money is that the wear and tear allowances in business and the depreciation allowances have become much too small.  This matter is within the terms of reference of the income-tax committee and I have no doubt that the Minister will, sooner or later, receive recommendations recommending a change.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister <Col N="914" /> to a short document prepared by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce by Dr. F. G. Hall, entitled <i>The Inadequacy of Irish Commercial Profits.</i>  This document deals in detail with the question of depreciation and wear and tear allowances.  I do not propose to weary the Minister by quoting to him the document with which he is, I believe, entirely familiar already.  I will, therefore, just recall to his mind pages nine and ten that he may, perhaps, peruse them again in the light of this debate.  At a time when everybody is talking about the necessity for more investment in Irish industry, it is inconsistent for the Government to maintain the wear and tear and depreciation allowances at a level which is quite inappropriate to the present level of prices.</P>
    <P>The final matter to which I refer in relation to the change in the value of money is that surtax begins at much too low a level.  It may be, perhaps, that at the beginning of this State in 1922 there was some justification for starting surtax at a £500 lower level than the British surtax which was £2,000 but whatever justification there ever was has long since disappeared.  The price level has risen greatly since 1922.  I do not think that anybody would suggest that an income of £1,500 is now so great as to be singled out as a proper object of high exceptional taxation.  These are some of the old grievances regarding income-tax which I for one have raised already in the Seanad.  I should now like to come to the Finance Bill before the House and indicate to the Minister that some of the proposals of that Bill instead of making things better make them, in my opinion, rather worse.</P>
    <P>The late Minister for Finance in the Dáil boasted that one result of this Bill would be that 40,000 less people would now pay tax.  A statement was made in the Dáil on the 24th February, 1954, by the late Minister for Finance that the number of individual taxpayers paying income-tax in 1952-53 was 195,000.  The occupied population comes roughly to about 1,200,000 people so that about two out of every 13 persons <Col N="915" /> at work are liable to income-tax.  If the Finance Bill takes 40,000 people out of paying income-tax it means that the total income-tax in the country in future will be paid by 150,000 people. That is to say, one in 20 of the population. Therefore 19 out of 20 of the population are not paying income-tax and, therefore, will be completely unaffected by the level of tax or pressure of the tax on the underprivileged and unfortunate very small minority who are singled out for this entirely unjust and inequitable imposition.</P>
    <P>The reason why the number of people paying income-tax is so small is partly the basis of assessment of Schedule A and Schedule B which, in fact, operate to exempt a large number of people from taxation in a perfectly legal way. The method of making allowances to business people for business expenses also reduces the burden of taxation on a great many people.  In addition to that&mdash;it is a matter of common knowledge&mdash;there must be a considerable amount of evasion so that the number of people who do not pay income-tax in this country is partly the result of favourable assessment and partly the result of illegal evasion.  The fact of the matter is that this tax which now raises something like £10,000,000 of revenue per annum, presses on 5 per cent. of the population.  I cannot help feeling that <i>prima facie</i> that looks rather like as if a small minority of the population are picked out for unfavourable treatment in the fiscal system.</P>
    <P>The reason why I say the present Budget makes things worse is this, that as the area of impact of this tax becomes narrower the possibility of a reduction in the standard rate becomes less.  The tax is now spread over fewer and fewer people and the logical conclusion to this progressive nibbling away year after year is that, sooner or later, the whole £10,000,000 will be collected from 2,000 people.  When we get to that stage, the only possible way in which an increase in the yield of income-tax can be secured is by a very stiff rise in the rate.  I suggest that every time the area of impact of <Col N="916" /> income-tax is narrowed, the burden on the wretched people who are still inside the net must become greater and, instead of it being a matter of congratulation for the Minister for Finance that there is a narrowing of the net, so to speak, it should be a matter of apology, if not of shame.</P>
    <P>There is one feature of the present Finance Bill which to me is suggestive &mdash;maybe because I have a suspicious or evil mind&mdash;that is, the way it is stated that no person with less than £250 a year will be liable to any income-tax in the future.  When the late Minister for Finance was introducing this Bill in the Dáil he stated that this would mean that no agricultural labourer in the future would be liable to pay tax.  My mind began to dwell on the association of ideas between these two statements and the conclusion I came to was that, owing to the favourable assessment of farmers, the position has arisen that agricultural labourers are being assessed for tax and that when they refuse to pay it, or fall into arrears, their employers &mdash;many of whom are rich farmers&mdash;are being called on by the Revenue Commissioners to deduct tax from wages. It has reached a perfectly absurd state of affairs that a comparatively rich farmer who, owing to the differential basis of assessment, is not paying tax, is deducting a shilling or two each week from agricultural labourers, owing to their arrears of tax.</P>
    <P>If this suspicion of mine is correct, we are driven to this conclusion, that the minimum income ever liable to income-tax will in future be fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board.  If agricultural wages rise to £6 a week, we then will be assured that no one with less than £300 a year will in any circumstances whatsoever be asked to pay income-tax; because, if they were, a rich farmer might be asked to take a shilling or two each week from some poor labourer working on his estate, for arrears of tax.  That is what used to be called in my school days a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i></P>
    <P>The exemption of all incomes up to £250 has the effect of pressing the income-tax more and more severely on <Col N="917" /> the salaried or white-collar class. We have already gone into this fully in the Seanad, that Schedule E accounts for more than its fair share of tax.  Now that all incomes up to £250 are exempted, a very large part of manual workers will escape tax altogether.  Therefore, the impact becomes more and more narrowly driven in on the white collar or salaried class. This is brought out very clearly in the statement on the Budget from which I have already quoted, prepared by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, where it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In spite of the reliefs given in the Budget, the incidence of direct taxation still bears unjustly and unduly on a very limited number of citizens. It is estimated that some 151,000 taxpayers are assessed under Schedule E and that the tax collected from them amounts to approximately £9,500,000.  This means that those citizens are paying on an average £1 4s. 6d. per week in direct taxation.  The average income of the person so taxed is £550 and when it is remembered that they also pay a considerable share of that income in indirect taxation, rates and welfare contributions, it has to be admitted that they bear a very undue share of the cost of running the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Irish Conference of Professional and Service Association have elaborated that point in a memorandum they have submitted to the Committee on Income-tax Reform, in which they give the following striking figures. They show the percentage of the total income-tax collected in the year 1951-52 under the different schedules, with the following result: Schedule A, 4.21 per cent.; B, 1.07; C, 1.2; D, 41.55; E, 52.2.  They followed that up with what I can only describe as a very remarkable comparison between the amount of income enjoyed and the amount of income-tax paid by different sections of the community.  The figures given in the memorandum&mdash;which as I say, is before the Committee on Taxation&mdash;are as follows.  The income of the community is divided into four classes:&mdash;(1) agricultural; (2) company <Col N="918" /> profits; (3) other profits, professional earnings, etc.; (4) salary and wage earners.</P>
    <P>I need not give all the figures, as the Minister has a copy of this memorandum. In the first column is given the amount of the national income estimated to be enjoyed under each of these categories.  In the next column is given the amount of tax paid by the people in each of these categories.  In the last column, which I am going to quote, the income-tax paid is stated as a percentage of the income received in each of these categories.  The following figures are, I think, impressive&mdash; Income-tax as a percentage of the national income enjoyed: (1) agriculture, 0.51; (2) company profits, 13.3; other profits, professional earnings, etc., 7.0; salary and wage earners, 5.6. The contrast between salary and wage earners and the agricultural community is, to say the least of it, rather striking.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he has already been struck by a certain inconsistency in his predecessor's Budget.  The late Minister for Finance boasted that no person with an income of less than £250 would pay income-tax in future.  We may take it, therefore, that that is officially regarded as the irreducible amount of income which is necessary to a person to live. If that assumption is correct, the personal allowance should be £250, not £150.  It seems to me that one of the two figures is wrong and that there is a clear inconsistency.  If no person with a total income of less than £250 should ever be liable to income-tax, the first £250 of every taxpayer's income should be free of tax.</P>
    <P>This is a new inconsistency introduced into this Budget for the first time.  In previous years there was a direct relation or identity between the personal allowance and the minimum taxable income.  Now, owing, as I suggest, to the difficulty regarding the rise in farm wages, we have an inconsistency. If £250 is the absolute minimum income that can stand any income-tax, every taxpayer whoever it may be&mdash;whether he be a company director or a salaried worker, civil servant or a teacher&mdash;should have £250 <Col N="919" /> free of tax.  I would ask the Minister to apply his mind to that inconsistency in his predecessor's Budget&mdash;an inconsistency of which I do not believe a man of his own logical mind would be guilty.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would apply his attention to this whole question in an open and liberal manner.  After all, the five schedules A, B, C, D and E were not handed down with the Tables of the Law.  There is nothing sacred about them.  They are the creature of William Pitt during the French War.  Yet they have become so much a part of our lives and, for some of us, a part of our dreams and nightmares that it has now become almost elementary that they cannot be altered.  The fact of the matter is that the figures I have already quoted show they are entirely unjust and unsuitable for the circumstances of this country. I would ask the Minister coming with a fresh mind to these very difficult problems to face them in a way that they have not been faced before.  I would ask him to consider whether or not these five schedules are in the same category as the Tables of the Law handed down from Heaven.  I suggest they are not of that degree of sacredness and that they are quite capable of being amended or, if it is not disrespectful to the Revenue Commissioners to say so, even improved.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that other forms of taxation exist in other countries.  If the income-tax is as unjust and as unsuitable for this country as I have suggested, I think it would be rather unfair for me to finish without throwing out at least a suggestion to the Minister and one which may be brought before the commission, assuming the Minister widens their terms of reference in an appropriate manner.  I do not for a moment claim to have thought fully about this matter.  I have no doubt but that a great many objections will be made to it and a great many points will be raised which have not occurred to my mind.  But I throw these suggestions out for discussion in the Seanad and for reflection by the Minister.  In the peculiar circumstances of this <Col N="920" /> country, I suggest the same amount of revenue now raised by income-tax could be raised more easily and more cheaply and more equitably by means of a purchase or a sales tax.  Such taxes are collected in many other countries and they seem to work reasonably well.  The first great advantage of a purchase tax or a sales tax is ease of collection.  All that has to be done is to take the Schedule to the Finance Bill&mdash;which now includes beer, spirits, tobacco and a few other dutiable commodities&mdash;and simply to lengthen it to include boots, shoes, household goods, and so forth. The collection of these taxes is impersonal. There is no inquisition.</P>
    <P>I think I have made some valid points in criticising the income-tax code in this country.  They have been financial points and moral points connected with the equity of the policy. However, as a citizen and as a member of the Seanad, I think I may say that the greatest objection I have to income-tax is the amount of prying and inquisition into the private affairs of people which the tax necessarily imposes.  I do not blame the Revenue Commissioners: everybody's hand is against them.  The collection of income-tax in this country is almost like a hunt where you have large packs of well fed hounds hunting half famished foxes.  That is the picture as I see it.  When the animal is dug out he is subjected to something which could be likened only to third degree and to the sort of things we read about as taking place in less free countries than this.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest that income-tax involves an inquisition into private affairs.  It involves a lack of privacy which would be completely absent in an impersonal sales tax or purchase tax of the kind I suggest.  Another great advantage&mdash;and this is on the financial side and it should appeal to the Minister&mdash;is that every Minister, including the Minister who is present to-day, on practically every occasion on which he appears in public praises the virtue of thrift, the virtue of saving. We hear remarks to the effect that our industrial progress depends on investment and investment depends on saving, so let us all save more.  May <Col N="921" /> I point out to the Minister that the income-tax code as we know it to-day directly discourages saving whereas a purchase tax directly encourages saving?</P>
    <P>Income-tax is discouraging to saving for the reason that a person pays income-tax on the whole of his income &mdash;on that part which he spends and on that part which he saves.  On that part of his income which he spends, he pays income-tax only once, but on that part of his income which he saves and invests in income-yielding securities he continues to pay income-tax year after year.  That is a well-known criticism of the present code.  It is not an original criticism: you will read it in any elementary book on public finance. Compared with that, a purchase tax has the advantage that nobody pays any tax on that part of his income which he does not spend.  That part of a man's income which he chooses to save is free of tax.  If the Minister for Finance is sincere in his desire to encourage thrift and saving, I suggest that here is a weapon ready to his hand&mdash;a system of taxation which does not tax savings and which does tax spending.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a tax of this kind is unfair to the poor.  In other countries it has been graduated in such a way as to fall more heavily on the purchases of the rich people than on those of the poor.  In Britain, during and since the war, many experiments in the graduation of purchase tax have been tried and many of them have been successful.  There is no reason why the progressive principle should not be applied to purchase tax. It has also been suggested that it cannot be adjusted to the taxable capacity of the taxpayers in the way that income-tax is by children's and dependents' allowances.  The answer to that is that increased children's allowances and increased social services and allowances to dependents, wives and children, educational allowances, and so forth, can give an equivalent amount of relief to the parents of families to that which they now derive under the income-tax code.</P>
    <P>It may be said that no differentiation <Col N="922" /> is made in purchase tax between taxation of earned and unearned income. One of the features of our income-tax code is that people pay at a higher rate on income derived from property than on income derived from their own labour.  Most people will agree that that is a fair distinction.  A purchase tax can continue to operate that distinction if it is accompanied by high graduated death duties.  My suggestion for the substitution of a purchase tax for income-tax does not include the abolition of death duties.  Death duties can still be retained as the main direct tax.  In so far as people have increased their capital wealth by speculation or otherwise, that can be taxed at death, and in that way an effective distinction can be made between taxation on earned and unearned income.</P>
    <P>On a couple of occasions when I have discussed this matter with students in my college, they have raised the objection that when they read the English financial papers they see a great desire to abolish the purchase tax&mdash;everybody complaining about the purchase tax there while I am advocating a purchase tax for Ireland.  The answer to that is this&mdash;that in England the purchase tax is on top of 9/-income-tax and so felt as a very heavy fiscal burden, whereas my suggestion is that purchase tax should not be an addition to income-tax but instead of income-tax.  The proposals I make would involve no additional burden on the taxpayers as a whole.</P>
    <P>These suggestions are made to the Minister merely to show that alternatives do exist, that I am not merely complaining of a tax which many of us do not like.  I wish to end as I began, by welcoming the new Minister for Finance to the Seanad, by hoping that he will have many years of office before him, that he will introduce many Finance Bills into the Seanad, and that between now and the next Finance Bill he will apply his mind to these problems in a fresh and original way. The present Minister for Finance is a young man.  He has many years of life and office before him, and can if he wishes establish a great reputation in <Col N="923" /> the history of this country.  As I have said, since the Treaty we have followed the English tax code slavishly without any real originality or any thought of our own.  Over the years great Chancellors of the Exchequer in England have made reputations by adjusting the tax system to a new situation.  In the 40's Sir Robert Peel scrapped the whole old-fashioned out-of-date tax system and introduced new taxes.  Gladstone did something of the same kind in the 50's; and in the years before the first World War Lloyd George overhauled the tax system.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with some of the things these statesmen did, the point is that at least they had originality to apply new taxes in a new situation.  Here are three Chancellors of the Exchequer who have gone down to history as people who had courage and originality to deal with a dynamic situation in a dynamic manner.  I appeal to the present Minister for Finance to be the first of a long line of Ministers for Finance who will go down to history with a similar record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I hardly know how to begin my remarks, but I think I will begin by welcoming the distinguished ex-Senator now Minister for Finance.  I do not suppose that every member of the House wishes him a long reign over us, but all of us would express our goodwill to him and hope that during his term of office he will be able to produce those financial miracles that the circumstances of the country so much require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Finance it is his function to acquire the means of paying for the public services, but he must never forget that in the exercise of that function he is also an important agent of public economic policy. Every tax and every subsidy has some effect, good or bad, in developing or perhaps in perverting the general economy of the nation.  That consideration applies especially to the decision to subsidise once more the price of butter, because there is an indirect economic repercussion from subsidising butter, which means, in effect, creamery butter.  Between 1948 and <Col N="924" /> 1951 when the butter subsidy operated there was, indeed, an increase of some 40,000,000 gallons of milk sent to the creameries, but that was balanced by a decrease of nearly 100,000 cwt. of butter produced by farmers on their own farms, the equivalent of some 25,000,000 gallons of milk turned into butter on the farms.</P>
    <P>The production of farmers' butter is an important element in the total butter production and consumption in the country, and it is not desirable public policy to discourage the production of that butter.  Recently there was a desirable increase in the production of farmers' butter.  It was associated with an increased tendency to rear young beef cattle on the farms.  An important by-product of that was the production of farmers' butter for sale locally.  That, I think, was a thing that we should welcome. I imagine that as a result of this new subsidy that desirable tendency will probably be reversed.</P>
    <P>The functions of a Minister for Finance rather resemble the functions of a gardener, in this matter of using the pruning knife of taxation. Sometimes it is the duty of a gardener to cut out an over-luxuriant growth if he wishes the tree as a whole to grow more in another direction and to produce a better balance in itself.  In effect, it has been a common practice for former Ministers for Finance to use the principle of the levy on one over-exuberant branch of the economy in order to subsidise another branch of the economy which it was desired to see expanding and developing.  It was common practice to levy something on the export price of turkeys in recent years with a view to maintaining a desirable level in the export price of eggs.  That was considered to be normal and possibly a proper exercise of the function of a Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>That brings me by a natural transition to discuss a large-scale application of the same principle with which my name has been rather prominently and unpleasantly associated in recent debates in the Dáil and in recent <Col N="925" /> hustings down the country during the election period.  I refer to a reference I made to the possibility of an export tax on cattle when talking on the Finance Bill in 1952 here, on the 16th June of that year.  Senators will find my remarks in Volume 40, No. 22, page 1571 and the following pages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, the 19th June, 1952.  I do not propose to inflict them at greater length now.  The references to me which I regard as rather unpleasant and rather a violation of parliamentary manners took place in the Dáil on Wednesday and Thursday of last week.  You will find them on record in Volume 146, No. 7 of the Dáil Debates, page 835, and Volume 146, No. 8, Dáil Debates, page 1044.  In one or other of those references you will find a quotation from my speech of two years ago which is completely wrenched out of its context and gives a most misleading impression of what I said or advocated in the speech as a whole.  I want to take this opportunity of putting the whole matter in its proper perspective and giving the whole idea of an export tax on cattle the decent burial that I thought I had given to it in a publication, not referred to in the Dáil, which I sent to the Press two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assumption behind the recent controversy seems to have been that what I recommend in the way of agricultural policy to-day becomes Government policy the day after and the law of the land on the third day.  That has never been the case in my personal experience with reference to the previous Government and I am sure it has no application either to the probable practice of the present Government. It is true, and I am perhaps rather proud of the fact, that I served on a rather important committee, the Committee on post-Emergency Agricultural Policy, which sat from 1942 to 1945 and produced a certain report which I think has been adopted in many of its most essential aspects by both the major Parties when they were <Col N="926" /> in power from time to time.  I had more than a little to do, in association with another member of that committee, in writing and drafting that report though he contributed the major part of it.</P>
    <P>After it appeared, a certain person who was then a Minister in a Fianna Fáil Government, asked me if it was true.  I modestly admitted that it was and he said: &ldquo;You deserve a medal for the part you played in that connection.&rdquo; Not long after that, I met another person who subsequently became Minister for Agriculture in the inter-Party Government, and who is now again the Minister for Agriculture. He asked me a similar question and I said, yes, and he said: &ldquo;The report is worth its weight in gold.&rdquo;  I was rather pleased with these pleasant remarks, but I have travelled a long way from 1945 to 1954, because, in the recent controversy with which my name has been associated with regard to agricultural policy, I have been demoted to the position of a stick to beat the Fianna Fáil dog, and I strongly object to being pilloried as a stick to beat a Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael dog, or any other dog that happens for the time being to be in power.  So far as I can ensure that result, that stick will become a boomerang, so long as I am able to remain in public life and exercise the right of free speech.</P>
    <P>Let me put on record the genesis of the whole controversy with regard to this matter of an export tax on cattle. I have been known to write articles for the <i>Irish Press</i> and I have also been known to write articles for the <i>Irish Independent</i> and also for the <i>Irish Times.</i>  I am quite catholic, in the etymological sense of the term, with regard to the organs in which I choose to put my views before the public.  It happened around about the spring of 1952 that I thought it would be a good idea to make certain suggestions to the readers of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The initiative was mine and the responsibility for what I said in those articles was mine.  The whole idea was to put certain ideas before the public and bring about intelligent public discussion of these ideas.</P>
    <P>In the course of the second article, dated 14th March, 1952, which I should <Col N="927" /> like to put on the records of the House because it is necessary to a complete understanding of this matter, I said as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why has our agricultural (unlike our industrial) arm been so comparatively static in its output in recent years?  In a recent lecture to the Institute of Bankers, Mr. Meenan has pointed out that between 1926 and 1946 the number of persons occupied in agriculture diminished by over 75,000, and 50,000 more males had left agriculture by 1950.  On farms up to 30 acres in size, the diminution (mostly of family labour) was as much as 47,000 up to 1946. On the larger farms the number remained comparatively stable.  By 1949, gross output was practically 100 per cent. of the 1938 level, but it was the output of perhaps 100,000 fewer persons.  Output per person has increased substantially and encouragingly and there is good reason for thinking that it is capable of further substantial increase.  If this can be accomplished without further decline of rural population, gross output will increase, and with it taxable capacity and export capacity.</P>
    <P>Why have the surplus members of small farm families been fleeing from the land in such large numbers, especially since 1939?  The small farmer is pre-eminently a processor of raw materials (much of which he must buy from sources other than his own farm), and cannot possibly make a tolerable living by the production and sale merely of cash crops.  As I explained in my recent book <i>Irish Agriculture in Transition</i> the Second World War created conditions in which it was no longer possible for the small farmer to make a tolerable living.  His traditional specialities, pig and poultry production, depended upon imported Indian meal as a necessary component of the ration, and during the war to obtain this was a physical impossibility.</P>
    <P>After the war, for a year or two, Indian meal was obtainable at a price which bore a favourable ratio to the <Col N="928" /> prices at which pigs and eggs could be sold, and the small farmer's production again began to expand.  But the devaluation of 1949 raised the price of Indian meal considerably, while the price of eggs continued to be depressed by the rigid policy of the British Ministry of Food.  A reviving export trade in bacon was annihilated and an expanding export trade in eggs was checked and reversed. Poultry production is now declining, and pig production is static.</P>
    <P>The problem is to recreate conditions in which the small farmer (numerically our most important productive agent) can afford to expand his productive effort without inviting financial bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>The traditional dependence on Indian meal as a raw material for live-stock production must be brought to an end.  Fortunately, a new cereal &mdash;Ymer barley&mdash;has been increasingly grown in Ireland in recent years, and it is capable of becoming an almost perfect substitute for the Indian corn which is now no longer to be relied on.  Here again there are problems of quantity and price. We would need to grow this year an additional 200,000 acres of Ymer barley without diminishing the acreage under other cereals if we are to make a serious impression on the problem.  As we also require an additional 200,000 acres under wheat if we are to be reasonably self-sufficient with regard to this all-important cereal, it looks as if the total area under the plough would need to increase by nearly 500,000 acres in the current year.  This additional programme is primarily a job for the owners of the middle-sized and larger farms, especially those of them who have access to tractor power and modern implements.</P>
    <P>Live cattle are now commanding nearly 120/- a cwt.  There is no reason to suppose that there would be any fewer cattle reared or matured if the price were only 100/-per cwt.  They might perhaps be fed less generously in the wintertime, but silage will do quite well, along <Col N="929" /> with hay and roots, and there is reason to think that feeding barley, produced on the larger farms, is now being fed to cattle, whereas it would be more in the national interest if it were sold to small farmers and fed by them to pigs and poultry.</P>
    <P>If the price of cattle were only 100/- a cwt. instead of nearly 120/-, the price of beef in the shops would be cheaper and the cost of living would come down.  During the war, the British Ministry of Food kept the price of beef cattle here down to around 60/-.  They overdid it, of course, and there were reactions on the rearing of calves, but the relatively low price paid in those days for beef cattle was a material factor in keeping down the cost of living for us in Ireland.</P>
    <P>According to a recent broadcast talk from Finland, the Finns have lately imposed an export tax on food products, and have thus successfully reduced their cost of living.  I suggest that our Government impose an export tax of £5 a head on all cattle exported &lsquo;on the hoof.&rsquo;  This would bring in, perhaps, £3,000,000 in a full year.  The effect would be to cheapen all cattle and beef in the home market, and to give a rapidly expanding dead meat trade a valuable &lsquo;boost&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>The yield of such a tax should not be treated as ordinary revenue, but should be earmarked to subsidise and encourage the productive efforts of small farmers, now handicapped, as explained above.</P>
    <P>During the eighteenth century there was a bounty on the inland carriage of corn (mainly by canal to Dublin), which is said to have had a considerable effect in expanding tillage.  The proceeds of the cattle tax should be used as a bounty or subsidy on the production and sale of Ymer barley as a raw material for live-stock product production. The larger farmers, of course, won't like the cattle tax (but they can &lsquo;take it,&rsquo; for they have been doing pretty well in recent years).  As growers of a largely increased area <Col N="930" /> of your barley, they can get back all or most of the tax in the form of a suitably guaranteed price.  I see no reason why the guaranteed price for Ymer barley should differ at all from the guaranteed price for wheat. Offaly County is a typical area in which much wheat and barley are grown and relatively few pigs and poultry are kept.  County Galway is the exact reverse.  If the Offaly County farmer could count on selling Ymer barley at £32 a ton, and the County Galway peasant could count on buying it at £22 a ton (plus transport), would there not be a considerable expansion of barley growing in Offaly County and pig and poultry production in small farm areas, even at present prices of eggs and bacon and is not this precisely the result we now need to achieve?  I am assuming a yield of 300,000 tons of Ymer barley, produced and sold, and a subsidy of £10 a ton in respect of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seemed to fall that flat for the time being but, as I said, I made some further reference to it in my speech on the Finance Bill in this House two years ago, the speech from which an inadequate quotation was made in the proceedings of the Dáil the other day. I stressed the fact that the price of beef was at that time so high that farmers were turning into beef cattle young heifers that should in the ordinary way have been turned into cows, that we were killing off what should be heifer replacements of our future cattle stock and, therefore, doing something which made it impossible for us to increase the total cow population in the long run.  Everyone knows that the first condition of any real, permanent increase in agricultural output in this country is that the number of good milch cows should substantially increase.  I recommended the discouragement of the practice of turning potential cows into prematurely killed beef.  Again I stressed the fact that if it was not considered desirable to use the tax for ordinary revenue purposes it should be and could be used to subsidise the price of Ymer barley, for use as a feeding stuff on farms specialising in pigs and poultry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting a letter I wrote to the <i>Irish Times</i> which was published on the 11th July, 1952:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Some time ago I suggested that it might be a good idea to put an export tax on all cattle exported &lsquo;on the hoof&rsquo;.  There is not the least likelihood of the suggestion being adopted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I underlined that sentence.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Desperate diseases may indeed require desperate remedies, but our present Government is not so desperate as to consider this remedy seriously, however persuasive the theoretical consideration I may have urged in its favour.  The remedy, then, being out of the question, the problem (or the disease) remains, and I would be glad to hear of other solutions for the problem which are politically feasible.</P>
      <P>The problem is to secure the maximum possible increase of agricultural production in the shortest possible space of time.  There are at least two aspects of this problem. In our agricultural set-up we cannot in the long run increase the output either of beef cattle or live-stock products unless we increase the total number of well-fed, fertile cows. There were 1,189,000 milch cows in the Republic in 1951&mdash;just 1,000 more than there were in the same area in 1911.  In the interval the number has rarely exceeded 1,300,000. Last autumn the price situation was such that, if you tried to sell a two-year-old heifer that seemed likely to make a good cow, the first question the dealer would ask was: &lsquo;Is she in calf?&rsquo;  If the answer was affirmative, you could count on getting about £5 less than if she were suitable for the store and beef trade.</P>
      <P>The relatively high price of beef and store cattle must have caused the destruction of tens of thousands of heifers which in a normal price situation would have been retained to replenish and increase our inadequate stock of milch cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1947 to 1950 the number of heifers in calf on June 1st was <Col N="933" /> abnormally high, and total milch cows increased from 1,156,000 in 1947 to 1,209,000 in 1950.  The long term trend was then satisfactory.  In 1948 the number of in-calf heifers on June 1st was 128,000&mdash;the highest number in any year since 1931, and about 40,000 above the average.  In 1951 the number was down to 80,000.  If this present situation continues, what is the outlook for total milch cows, total cattle population, and total agricultural production in two or three years' time?</P>
    <P>The other aspect of our major agricultural problem is how to make it worth while for our small farmers and their families to expand poultry and pig production.  You can't make a living out of store or beef cattle on 30 acres of land.  In 1936, 386,000 males were trying to do so on farms under 50 acres in size, and since then over 50,000 of them have disappeared from our agriculture, largely because under war conditions and under present conditions the expansion of poultry and pig production is financially precarious.  With Indian meal nearly 40/- a cwt., the price of eggs and pigs would need to be fantastically higher than their present high level to justify an expansion of pig and poultry production based on Indian meal as the primary raw material.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has rightly pointed out that we must rely increasingly on home grown barley and fodder beet as feed crops.  It is satisfactory to note that the acreage under barley is increasing though somewhat at the expense of other cereals.</P>
    <P>Anyhow, these are our two main problems&mdash;to prevent the destruction of heifers that should be kept for breeding and put the small farmer and his family back in a situation where it will not be financially suicidal for them to increase production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those problems, like the poor, are still with us.  I bequeath the solution of those problems to the present Government and the new Seanad.  The success or failure of the Government in solving this problem will make or mar <Col N="934" /> the prospects of that Government and the welfare of the country in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that we meet to-day in an air of unreality.  Here we are, an almost dying Seanad, meeting to discuss something that has come to us from a new Dáil.  Even so, there are certain fundamental matters which come under review when a Finance Bill is before us.  When I came into the House to-day, I heard the tail-end of Senator O'Brien's speech in which he advocated a purchase tax as a means of providing revenue which we all know is necessary for the running of the Government of the country.</P>
      <P>I will try to avoid any controversial note.  As an individual, may I wish to an ex-member of this House, the new Minister for Finance, a triumphant success in the job he has now got as Minister for Finance?  I wish the new Minister for Finance a big success in his job.  The job he has got is a big one and if he does not succeed in it the country as a whole will suffer.</P>
      <P>In general, I do not think it can be denied, whether it is the new Government which has come in, or the one that has gone out, that we are all appalled at the amount of money the nation is called upon to provide for the cost of government of this small community of ours and in so far as that amount can be broken down into sections, is it wrong for me to say that too much of that money is being provided by too few of the community? In so far as direct taxation is concerned the white-collar worker, the salaried worker and the company that has audited figures cannot escape the amounts they are called upon to contribute. Does anybody in this House know the degree to which tax responsibilities are being evaded in this country to-day?  It is not fashionable to talk now of the moneys made out of agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fashionable to talk to-day of the moneys made by the professional sections of our community.  I suggest to the new Minister&mdash;I do this in the friendliest possible way; he has got a very alert mind&mdash;that something should <Col N="935" /> be done to get at people who to-day are making more money in relation to other sections of the community than ever before, and who in my opinion are paying less in tribute than they should to the State of which they are a part.</P>
    <P>We all know&mdash;we talk about this matter in clubs, bars and all over the place&mdash;that the man who is not on a salary, the man who is not the owner of a business whose accounts are audited, enjoys to-day by reason of circumstances that have arisen in recent years a prosperity which he never before enjoyed.  Thanks be to God for that.  I do not envy him for it, but he is not paying anything like the amount in direct taxation to the State as those people whom I have enumerated, the white-collar worker, the salaried worker and the business man whose accounts are audited by responsible auditors.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is a natural thing to try to pass the buck, but I do suggest that the new Minister, with all the virility of his youthful mind, should devise some system by means of which all of us, no matter in what activity we engage, will pay our requisite tribute to Caesar.  That is what I ask for.  If every man in proportion to the money he is making within the confines of our State, pays his share of direct taxation, then I think the burden of the Minister for Finance will be lessened and the general burden be equalised.  I could discuss this matter at length, but I do not think this is the occasion for it.</P>
    <P>As far as I am personally concerned the Government of the day is the Government of the day, and on all things that are not controversial they will get the support of the more responsible elements of the community.  That goes in particular fashion for the Minister for Finance who is an ex-member of this House.  He has not got an easy job, but I would suggest to him, with 50 years of industrial activity behind me, that we are spancelled with old associations with Great Britain.  Even income-tax as we know it is a heritage from Great Britain. <Col N="936" /> It was created, devised and developed under conditions that did not exist here.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that, when the Minister gets time to get down to it, he might examine the economic situation with a view to getting the revenues we all admit are necessary for the running of the State, in a more equitable manner.  On another occasion, I hope I will have an opportunity of discussing other matters in detail.  I might have something to say about the cost of the administration of government.  Are the myriad of Departments we have necessary for the controlling of the destinies of 3,000,000 people?</P>
    <P>We know that the Minister for Finance has got a youthful and virile mind, and he might cut adrift from these spancels which we have inherited and accepted willingly from John Bull, and see whether, in fact, he could devise some economic and financial scheme which would be less of a burden on industry yet be more equitable and provide him with the revenues which he or his successor needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at the risk of offending slightly, I must join with the other Senators in welcoming our new Minister to the House.  I hope this will not be a prelude to disappointments on some other occasion when we will be telling him what we think of his policy.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Senator Summerfield was not in earlier.  He has re-stated exactly what Senator O'Brien said in his speech particularly in connection with the methods of income-tax, where they came from and their effects, and his suggestions as to reapportionment.  I rise mainly to support the appeal of Senator O'Brien to the Minister that a new and more imaginative approach be made to the whole question of taxation.  The Minister is carrying on a system which if it succeeded in another country may not be the best so far as our financial position is concerned. I think Senator O'Brien's suggestion was a timely one.  It may even have come too late in the day and even now it might be too late to some extent to have a new approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Psychologically, income-tax has a very bad effect upon people.  As everybody knows, the Irish people are a peculiar race and they resent income-tax as such.  Any other form of taxation that I know of is not nearly so objectionable to the people as a people as income-tax is.  From the psychological point of view alone the securing of the national income through some other form of taxation might bring in more, might be more palatable and more appealing to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The creation of that income from either purchases or sales taxes involves another psychological problem which Senator O'Brien overlooked.  It is to some extent an academic matter, but I wonder to what extent it might affect the purchasing desire of the people.  We know that in England the purchase tax had a retarding effect on certain consumer goods.  Whether the transfer of the collection of our national revenue from the present income-tax system to a new form of purchase tax would have a peculiar reaction upon producers is something one will have to think about, because eventually all income comes from production.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with what Senator O'Brien said&mdash;and which Senator Summerfield has restated&mdash;in the argument for the equitable distribution of liability in proportion to share of national income.  I am not going to stress that matter, as it is something that has been discussed already. Neither do I want to refer, beyond in passing, to the wear and tear allowances and depreciation allowances to which Senator O'Brien referred and which are at present the subject of consideration by the commission appointed by the last Minister.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand Senator O'Brien when he states that nobody would pay tax on that part of his income which he does not spend.  I would like to follow that argument to its conclusion and I wonder what happens to that part of the income which he does not spend.  Senator O'Brien said it is for free investment and that the return from that portion of his income is not spendable, at least by him.  But surely that portion of earned income which <Col N="938" /> results to somebody else from that investment is liable to tax in some form or another?  However, that is only an academic matter.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Commissioners of Revenue to get over &ldquo;gobbledegook&rdquo;, if I may so describe it.  I know that the income-tax code is an involved and intricate one, but outside of the Seven Mysteries there is no greater mystery insoluble to-day than the income-tax demand, in certain ways. As a result, there has grown up a parasitic class known as income-tax accountants, who do a very good job of work in assisting people like myself to secure that which we should have a right to get without having to employ them.  The forms presently issued are nearly non-translatable by ordinary minds.  I would appeal for a simplification of these documents.  It would be of great advantage particularly to the business community, as it costs us quite a lot every year in the employment of men who might otherwise be employed in another way in something productive.  They try to show to us means of extracting from the income-tax authorities what we should get, and their activities are in no way adding to our national income.</P>
    <P>The other recommendation I would like to make is that they would write letters of a conciliatory character to those unfortunate people who are not able to pay their income-tax up to time.  Again I come back to the psychological feature of the Irish people.  If you write that sort of letter to an Irishman he is not going to keep on paying, whereas it would be better if they wrote to us&mdash;most of us are in one class, always overdue in income-tax&mdash;as we would write to a customer in ordinary business in regard to a debt, in an inoffensive way.  The ordinary letter going out in the ordinary way from the income-tax collector is offensive, as it is a sort of a threat or a mandatory indictment to his future seclusion in the purlieus of Mountjoy Gaol.</P>
    <P>To the average man income-tax is a method of collecting part of our national income and it would be all to the good if that income can be extracted <Col N="939" /> with the least possible dislike on the part of the public.  When talking in this fashion I am not talking in a personal sense of the personnel of the Revenue Commissioners or the personnel of the Department, with which I have the friendliest relations, but I am talking about the attitude of mind which has grown up in the collection of the tax, which does not suit the mentality of this country&mdash;just as I am wondering if the new form of tax suggested by Senator George O'Brien, a purchase tax in substitution for the present income-tax, is suitable for the psychological attributes of our people.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree that he has heard quite a different angle on our financial position, or that quite a different viewpoint has been expressed on it from this House, from what he heard elsewhere.  In so far as it is new and novel and to some extent invigorating, we hope it will help him on his road to be one of the most successful Ministers for Finance we have had for a long time.  Everything we can do to help him in any way we will do and that, added to his own natural gifts, means that it will be a great day for all of us when no one in this country will be contributing income-tax as such and in substitution there will be some other sort of taxation and then, I would say, there will be golden statues put up to him all over the countryside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to answer a few of the points made by speakers opposite.  Senator Hawkins was very worried about the export of butter and Senator Johnston seemed to be very worried that we would not have enough milk.  I think it is well that the agricultural policy has been such that we have had the dual-purpose animal, that we are reaping to-day the benefits of the very high price of meat and meat products in the neighbouring island, that we have not, like the Danes and the New Zealanders, to be sending ambassadors to Moscow to try to sell milk and milk products there and that we are not like the Americans to-day with thousands of millions of lb. weight of butter and cheese and dried milk they do not know what to do with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> I believe the greatest asset we have at present is the export of our live stock or live-stock products&mdash;meat and those types of highly-valued goods which we have been able to export. The standard of living of all our people would be very much reduced if that was not so.  There is great credit due to the Department of Agriculture and to the Ministers for Agriculture who have been handling the affairs of this country&mdash;that they were not led away by any catch-cries regarding the cattle or dead meat industries and the basis on which they are being preserved as our greatest asset.  It pays probably for 80 per cent. of the imports of everything that comes into this, island.</P>
    <P>Through neglect in the past, our land is not producing what it ought to produce. I believe that to-day we have a Minister for Agriculture who sees that problem.  In 1948, when Mr. Holmes was over here from Australia, he said that some of the land that he examined was such that it was not possible for it to grow less under an Irish sky.  That was a shocking indictment of the neglect of grass which, if properly looked after and appreciated as a crop, with our high rainfall, could be the most valuable asset we have. Many countries which are considered progressive would love to have it and to exploit it to the full.  That is why I wanted to reply briefly to those matters referred to by Senator Hawkins.</P>

      <P>Laughed?  I think Senator Loughman also mentioned the election in Tipperary.  It ought to be said that in 1951 we won a seat from Fianna Fáil in Tipperary&mdash;and we won it by 152 votes.  When we got the second seat in Tipperary this year, we had almost 2,400 surplus votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>The 152 votes meant that we got three out of four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1951, 152 votes gave us the second seat and in the recent general election we increased our surplus to almost 2,400 votes.  I do not propose to develop that point any further as I want to answer what has been said as briefly as possible.  If there was any indictment by the people of the last Government surely it was in respect of their incapacity to borrow money at a reasonable price for the development of the resources of this country.  The Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government had to pay 4½ per cent. to 5 per cent. for the money which he borrowed during his term of office.  When Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance in the inter-Party Government he was able to borrow all the money he required at 3 per cent. and 3½ per cent. During the past three years, the Fianna Fáil Government paid more for money than municipal corporations in Britain.  They paid from ½ per cent. to 1 per cent. more than cities such as <Col N="942" /> Bristol and Birmingham.  Any State which is properly managed and in which the people have confidence should be able to borrow money at a very much lower rate than a municipal corporation.</P>
      <P>I believe the financial interests and the men and women who made a little money and saved a little money had no confidence in the last Government and did not give their money to the last Government so that it was necessary for the then Minister to offer that high and attractive rate of interest.  In its turn, the high rate of interest which the Minister offered had ill effects.  It depressed the value of the savings which other people had previously given to the Government by way of loan and it caused those people a great deal of hardship.  Further, it made housing and development in this country very much more expensive than it need have been, and for the next 20 years our people will have to pay the cost of that folly and the cost of that period of maladministration.</P>
      <P>I should like to return to some of the matters which were mentioned here to-day by Senator O'Brien and other speakers.  I believe a tax system should be such as to allow that which is good and best in the nation to survive and, as Senator Johnston said, to remove some of the overgrowth which may be crowding in on some of the things that are good.  If the tax to-day is light on the farmer, the farmer is investing more money in his land and holding and in the capital equipment of that holding than ever before.  The farmer never got a fair chance in this country.  Anyone who reads a page of Irish history will see at once that it was always the land and the things that appertained to the land that were the cause of the fight.  That is only natural because the land is our major asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, by and large, the farmer did not get a chance.  If he gets a period in which he will be encouraged to work hard and to invest the major portion of the fruits of his work in industry, in the development of the land and in increasing production on that land, we should be very slow to <Col N="943" /> devise any scheme here in Dublin City that would stop him from so investing that money.  I believe that to-day many farmers are investing 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. of the proceeds of their work and industry in their land and in capital goods.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of wear and tear allowances.  I think that the Minister for Finance will have to consider the fact that those people who reinvest their money in the industry should have the proceeds of that reinvestment taxed in a different way from money which is often spent on objects which may be socially undesirable. There is another aspect relating to the Irish economy which I do not think has been properly stressed.  We are a small economy.  Businesses are small and many businesses are family businesses. When a member of the family dies, the incidence of death duties falls heavily on that family business and in a way which is not common in other countries where, generally, they are companies&mdash;sometimes very large companies of a kind that we do not know in this country.  In that way, the continuity of a natural development of Irish life and Irish industry is destroyed, in my opinion, by the incidence of death duties.</P>
    <P>In fact, this trend has been noticed in Great Britain where a company was established a couple of years ago&mdash;I think it had the very homely name of &ldquo;Edith&rdquo;&mdash;for the purpose of helping family and private companies to avoid being swamped by the incidence of death duties.  Undoubtedly, the Minister has the advantage of having very able men in his Department to advise him in these matters.  I believe, however, that he ought to give great attention to the report of this commission which is dealing with taxes at the present moment and that it ought to be the duty of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to try to devise a system that will give us the best and the healthiest growth in our Irish life.</P>
    <P>I notice that to-day practically every town in this country is almost overrun with multiple shops.  These shops have no real interest in the life of the towns <Col N="944" /> in which they are set up.  They will praise neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael policy and they take little or no interest in the social or cultural life of the communities among whom they are trading.  I believe that, with a properly devised tax system, such types of growth would be arrested and the normal types of growth in our country towns would be encouraged and directed.  We are a comparatively young State, and as Senator O'Brien has said, we have taken our taxation system from Great Britain.  They have revised their system but we have just carried on with their old system.  We have to-day a young Minister for Finance who is not affected too much by time-established precedents.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask, in conclusion, that the Minister for Finance would, during his term of office, give us a system of taxation which would be more amenable to those who have to work it and to those who have to bear the tax burden which it imposes, and that would also create a climate that would be good for the proper development of our economy and our social life in this island of ours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>This short Bill is fortunately free from the complications that are normally associated with a Land Bill. Its purpose is simply to alter the retiring age of lay commissioners of the Land Commission which is at present regulated by Sections 15 and 16 of the Land Act, 1950.</P>
      <P>There are four lay commissioners who, together with the Judicial Commissioner, constitute the Land Commission. Prior to the passing of the Land Act, 1950, the lay commissioners had life tenure.  The position at present is that two of the commissioners who were in office prior to the enactment of the 1950 Act and who enjoyed life tenure may, under the provisions of Section 16, continue to serve until the age of 72.  The remaining two commissioners, who have been appointed since the passing of the 1950 Act, are, under Section 15 of the Act, conditioned to a retiring age of 65 years and the proposal in the present Bill is to extend that age limit to 67 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to stress the importance of the lay commissioners' functions in relation to the ownership and user of agricultural land throughout the State.  The law gives them exclusive independent jurisdiction in relation to a wide range of what are known as &ldquo;excepted matters&rdquo;.  These include matters of such vital importance to the land-owning community as the determination of the particular lands to be acquired for Land Commission purposes and the persons to whom they are to be allotted.  The commissioners' decisions are final subject only to appeal on questions of law and price to the Appeal Tribunal and the Supreme Court.  The office of lay commissioner is therefore, in some respects, comparable with the judicial office and calls for the same qualities of ripe experience and sound judgment. When the 1950 Act was under consideration there was clear agreement that <Col N="946" /> the principle of life tenure was open to serious objection, but different views were expressed as to what should be substituted.  One of the suggestions in the course of the debates was that the retiring age should be fixed at 70, and it was alternatively suggested that future lay commissioners should be allowed to continue in office from year to year between the ages of 65 and 70, subject to the Minister being satisfied as to their fitness and suitability.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of a system of year-to-year extensions, as it is open to the fundamental objection that it would endanger the independence of the lay commissioners which has always been jealously guarded in the statutes.  It was for that reason that a fixed and inflexible rule of retirement was adopted in 1950 and incorporated in the Act of that year.  The decision then made was to apply the normal Civil Service retiring age of 65, but experience in the meantime has served to show that, having regard to the special nature of the office, that limit is restrictive.  It is now considered that the requirements of the situation would be best met by fixing the retiring age midway between 65 and 70 years.  Section 1 of the Bill, therefore, proposes a new age limit of 67.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill contains the usual legal provisions found in every Land Act.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Bill will effect a worthwhile improvement on the present position and I commend it to the House.  Its enactment is a matter of urgency and I would ask the House to be good enough to give me all stages to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the Minister's explanation and having regard to the importance of keeping in office the persons who have held the positions for a number of years, with all the experience they have gained in that period, and having regard to the importance which the work of the Land Commission has for the nation as a whole, we on this side are prepared to give the Minister all stages. <Col N="947" /> There is just one point which I would like to put to the Minister.  Why was it decided to extend the age limit to 67 and not to 70?  Why was it not decided even to leave it to the discretion of the Minister?  It is only a matter of two years and if it means that the Dáil and Seanad have to be approached for further extensions, it is not the best means of dealing with a matter of this kind.  My own view with regard to this retiring age is that the age of 65 should in all cases be extended much further.  That does not arise particularly on this Bill, but I feel that the Minister should give his views on why the age of 67 was fixed rather than 68 or 69, or even 70, as in the case of the three present commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given ample reason for an extension of the age limit, except that he did not tell us the particular reasons, that these commissioners&mdash;I do not know them&mdash;are people whose services in the past have been worth while and whose services in the future will be of great value.  I am sure they are people of that description, but I should like to hear the Minister say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this Bill and, as this is possibly the last sitting of the Seanad, it is probably not worth anybody's while kicking up a row about these things.  I have always voiced my views of the system under which the commissioners work, but this is not the occasion on which to give expression to these views.  The Minister has his own reasons, I know, for extending the period of office of these gentlemen, but I wonder is he wise in doing so, without having an infusion of new blood. There are as good fish in the sea as ever were caught and there are as good junior officials in the Land Commission as there are senior officials.  It might be wise if we gave some of these juniors a chance to move forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a good deal of experience of the Land Commission and I can say that Deputies and Senators have good reason to be thankful that <Col N="948" /> a certain individual was placed in a certain position in the Land Commission a few years ago, because when they look for something which their constituents are entitled to know, they get replies and get the information so far as possible from the Land Commission in the same way as it was always got from other Departments. Because of the success which attended the promotion of that young man&mdash;a junior official, if you like&mdash;some years ago, I am inclined to say that perhaps if we let these commissioners go at 65 and fill their places from the ranks, we might be just as well off. However, they have experience and they use it.  The law is there and they act according to the law laid down for them and nobody who comes into that office could act in any other way; but, while not objecting, I make the comment that if we were to let these commissioners go at 65 and to replace them by promotion from the ranks of the Land Commission, the Land Commission would go ahead just as well, because we have all had experience of what happened a few years ago and we know that it was for the betterment of the working of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I join with Senators who have said that all stages of the Bill should be given.  I see no reason why that should not be done, but, like Senator Hawkins, I cannot see why, when the Minister decided to go so far, he did not go a little further.  The Minister, being a farmer and in the habit of selling a few cattle at a fair, must have divided a &ldquo;fiver&rdquo; on numerous occasions and in this case he might have said 68 instead of 67. I agree with the Minister that the lay commissioners, in view of their experience over a long number of years, are very important men and the knowledge they have accumulated over those years must be very valuable from the point of view of the Land Commission.  Some of these men would know without reference to any records the situation of most estates in the country and I believe that knowledge should be safeguarded and that the Minister should ensure so far as possible that they will be available to <Col N="949" /> give the benefit of their experience for as long a period as possible.</P>
      <P>I would not at all be in favour of people of that kind having life tenure because that definitely presents a lot of difficulties.  As we advance in years ourselves we beging to think that the fellow who is only ten years older than ourselves is a comparatively young fellow, but when a man reaches the age of 70 it is about time he should be allowed to retire.  The only suggestion I would make it that instead of 67 it should be made 68.</P>
      <P>With regard to getting younger men into the position of lay commissioners, time would regulate that because it is natural to assume that the ages of all these young men&mdash;I do not know them any more than the previous speaker&mdash; vary and they are not all on the brink of 67 or 65 and as the older men retire, some of these younger men should be coming in.  Apart from young men coming in, I also think it is a good thing that the experience gained by those men over a long number of years should be preserved.  In conclusion, I see no reason why any controversial discussion should take place on a Bill of this kind and we agree to give all stages.</P>

      <P>I hope that I will not cause any offence when I say I think it is not generally appreciated that the lay commissioners have a very responsible job of work to do.  While on all sides we are accustomed to hearing criticism of the Land Commission being slow and various other criticisms, the lay commissioners are the only body in this country or in any other country democratically-governed I know of that has the power to dispossess a man of his property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be said the Commissioners of Inland Revenue have the power to collect a man's income-tax and to recover moneys from a person if that person got the sum wrongfully from the State but there is a big difference between property and money.  The lay commissioners have the power, from which there is no appeal, to take anybody's land in the country.  For that reason the commissioners have a very <Col N="950" /> heavy responsibility laid on their shoulders.  Some people are inclined to think that their position is much easier than, say, that of a Circuit Court judge but a Circuit Court judge, a High Court judge, or even a Supreme Court judge has not the power to dispossess anybody of their property.</P>
    <P>Before the passing of the 1950 Act the commissioners had tenure for life, the same as the High Court judges.  I admit that under the 1950 Act I decided that they would retire at 65. I am of the opinion now that while life tenure was pulling the pendulum too far in one direction, I pulled it a little bit too far in the other direction.</P>
    <P>At the present time we have over there some commissioners whom I personally would not like to see going because they have accumulated a vast amount of experience in dealing with the taking of property which is a very touching business as I am sure every Senator knows and every Deputy in the other House knows.  It is a very serious thing when you are issued with a statutory notice.  The Land Commission tells you: &ldquo;We have decided to take your land.&rdquo;  You go in before them and they hear your case but they have the power to take that land although it might be the family land for five, six or seven generations with all the sentimental value which is naturally attached to it.  For that reason I do not like to lose the experience of men who, through sitting on the bench for so long now, have learned to value properly the evidence that a person puts before them by way of petition not to acquire their land.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies in the Dáil, particularly newly-elected Deputies, think&mdash; as I did myself one time&mdash;the Land Commission should go out and take this, that and the other land. Naturally new Deputies and new Senators desire to settle a burning problem, that is, the relief of congestion, but we must also take into account that we are plucking a man and perhaps his family up by the roots from the land which was handed down to them generations ago.</P>
    <P>For that reason the lay commissioners, having such a sweeping power <Col N="951" /> which no other court in this or any other land I know of possesses, should use that power with the greatest possible caution.  Sometimes we chafe when we seen them going slowly, realising that whole townlands may be badly congested with people living in poverty and waiting for the Land Commission to come along.  We become irked and understandably so at what we think is slowness but if we are going to have any respect for title and for ownership of land, we must go a little bit slowly about the acquisition of land except in cases where it is clear that it will not cause hardship to the person whose property is being acquired or a snapping of sentimental strings.  I have seen people who have been migrated to much better holdings, out of all proportion to the holdings, they were giving up, and when it came to leaving the old homestead, which may have been a tumbledown house with a thatched roof, they were weeping and hardly able to tear themselves away.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke has mentioned that he thought the age should be 68.  I gave a good deal of thought to 67 and, while it might appear strange to Senators that I fixed on 67, perhaps as we gain a little bit more experience, later on some future Minister may decide to alter it and bring it up to 70.</P>
    <P>In order to hold on to the commissioners I could have presented a different type of Bill to the House, that is a Bill under which the Minister or the Government could renew the life of a particular commissioner from year to year.  The Government can do that in the case of civil servants but, because of the cast-iron construction of the 1950 Act, when a commissioner reaches 65 he must go and the Government has no power to reinstate him from year to year.  I would not by any means favour that because we must protect and preserve the full independence of the commissioners.  For that reason I am asking for 67 as the halfway mark between 65 and 70.  As I said, perhaps some time in the future when we gain a little more experience there may be a Bill before both Houses either extending the age a little bit further or making some other change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first to express my appreciation to those Senators who, in their speeches here to-day, welcomed me back again to this House.  I am very grateful indeed to them for their remarks.  We had a discussion to-day that I feel quite sure will be of great assistance to me in the task that I am going to have between this and next year.  I am referring particularly to the speech that was made by Senator George O'Brien.  On that point, I will give the remarks that he has made the most careful consideration and they will be of use to me in the basis of approach for the future.</P>
      <P>I am afraid, however, that Senator O'Brien was misled in one part of his statement, by certain figures that have been put before him.  He referred to the amount that was paid towards the general collection of income-tax by Schedule E taxpayers.  Initially, of course&mdash;obviously in a clerical slip&mdash;he referred to the total figure of tax collected as being £10,000,000.  Of course, it is more than double that&mdash;in 1952-53 it was £21.78 millions&mdash;but that was quite obviously a clerical slip.  In the figures which he gave&mdash;which had been taken by him from a memorandum submitted by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations and which he made the basis for some parts of his case&mdash;it was suggested that the amount of tax which had been paid under Schedule E was £9.6 millions, representing 52 per cent. of the total income-tax revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I had asked for certain figures rather on those lines <Col N="953" /> before and I have some figures which show that the basis of computation which that conference had made was not quite accurate.  It was a very different picture that was put before me, that instead of some £9.6 million, the amount collected under Schedule E is, in fact, much more in the region of £5,500,000 and the percentage collected under Schedule E would be much nearer the 25 per cent. mark than the over 50 per cent. mark suggested in the memorandum which was quoted by the Senator.  I do not propose to go into the details of that, but I think it is desirable that, as the figures were given some publicity on the one side, the more accurate one on the other side should also have publicity.  Of course, even that Schedule E figure, which is taken by reason of the assessment under that heading in the Income Tax Acts, is one that is not solely restricted to what one might term the white-collar worker: it would include certain other assessments of people with larger incomes&mdash;directors' fees, for example, and so forth.</P>
    <P>The general principle that everybody seems to have&mdash;when they are suggesting that the incidence of taxation falls heavily upon any one section&mdash;is, of course, that they want a revision in the whole code.  What they do not say but what they mean is that they want a revision in the code in so far as it affects the personal case in which they are interested.  I do not mean that in so far as it affects their own personal pockets, but the particular class in which they are interested.  All of us rather naturally are inclined to do that when we consider any system of taxation. What we want to do is to revise that system of taxation in such a way that it will not press quite so heavily on the class that we have in mind at the time.  Ultimately the effect of that, if one were to accept all the suggestions, would be that the amount which would come into the revenue would be very substantially less.</P>
    <P>The Senator made some very interesting suggestions which I will be able to consider in due course when the task comes of setting out to frame new proposals for next year.  Another matter that was raised by him of a <Col N="954" /> technical nature, that I might perhaps refer to very briefly, was the question of the number of taxpayers.  I think the exact figures are&mdash;before the Financial Statement, 205,000 and now, 165,000 approximately.  Part of the consideration that any Minister must give&mdash;and obviously part of the consideration that was given by my predecessor&mdash;is to the cost of collecting the tax.  It is not for me to suggest what was particularly weighing on his mind at the time, but part of the consideration that must have been before him was the undue proportionate cost of collecting a small amount, of tax at the bottom of the scale.</P>
    <P>In the remarks that were made by Senator O'Brien, perhaps sufficient weight was not given to that aspect of it.  He also mentioned the level at which surtax commenced.  I think that level was not, as he suggested, £1,500 when the State was established but was much larger then and has come down since in a series of changes&mdash;at least two, I think.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the case for industrial taxation, which is being dealt with in a special way by the commission, the other matters that were raised were more of a political nature.  I think it would be unwise for me to attempt to prejudice the report of the commission on the industrial taxation point.  It seems to be a clear case in which we should wait at least until some of the very valuable information they are collecting will be available to us.</P>
    <P>The other speeches were more of a political nature and I am afraid I apparently misjudged one or two Senators on the other side.</P>
    <P>I assumed they had read what had been stated in the Dáil on the Financial Motions and on this Bill.  If they had not read it there, I assumed they had read it in the newspapers, but Senators Hawkins and Loughman quite clearly had not because both of them came back to ask whether there would be further reductions in taxation during the current year.  I do not think anything could have been clearer than my statement in the Dáil in that respect.  I feel I must repeat it now because there has been a similar <Col N="955" /> suggestion to that made by those two Senators made elsewhere which might very easily prejudice the inflow of revenue and, therefore, the efficiency of the Government during the current year.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on the 15th June in the other House, I made it quite clear that the Government had decided to make the very substantial concession they made in regard to the price of butter.  I made it equally clear on that occasion the Government felt that was the only concession they could make for this financial year. Senator Hawkins, when opening this debate for the Opposition, adopted the well-known pretext and political tactic of endeavouring to put into the mouths of his opponents things they could not say and then wrongly castigating them for having said them.  That attitude was adopted in another place but I understand that it is not proper for me to refer in this Chamber to all that transpired in another Chamber.  It was, as I saw, a device that was adopted in another place.  When the Senator considers more carefully what he stated and when he considers it in a calmer light after the election now pending for this House has terminated, I think he will realise that what he attempted to put in our mouths was not what was said.</P>
    <P>I do not want in this allegedly vocational Chamber to go into too much politics but I feel, having regard to their speeches, that I must say this. Senators on the other side of the House do not appear to realise why they were defeated in the general election.  They were defeated for a very simple reason in that election. The shop in Clonmel which Senator Loughman mentioned&mdash;there were others of a similar nature in other parts of the country&mdash;merely served to emphasise the feeling of the people.  It was perfectly clear to the mind of the electorate that the previous Government got into office in 1951 because in the election of 1951 they campaigned on the high cost of living under what they termed the Coalition Government of that time.  They got into office <Col N="956" /> because they held out to the people that if they were elected there would be an immediate reduction in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>They campaigned on the basis that the prices which were in operation in 1951 were more than the people could bear and the leaflet, the shop window and the feeling of the people were quite clear in this election.  The people realised that the campaign which had taken place in 1951 was a dishonest campaign.  That leaflet and that shop window served to emphasise that the promises and the protests made by Fianna Fáil were not, to use two of the Senator's own words, &ldquo;honest politics.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that in so far as the recent election was concerned it would have made very much difference what any people on this side of the House said.  What the electors had made their mind up to do was to have a change of Government because they felt they had been duped in 1951 and were going to take revenge for that duping.  The Senators asked me for various declarations. I am afraid that were I to go into them at all to any great length I would have to hold up the House unduly.</P>
    <P>We made it quite clear in the other House in so far as the subsidy on butter was concerned that it was to cover creamery butter only and not farmers' butter.  Again, in that respect, Senator Hawkins attempted to put into the mouth of the present Minister for Agriculture a statement about farmers' butter which he never made. Senator Hawkins alleged the present Minister for Agriculture said that all farmers' butter was only fit for cart grease.  Of course, the present Minister for Agriculture said nothing of the sort.  What the Minister for Agriculture said was that there was good farmers' butter and bad farmers' butter and that the bad butter was only fit for this purpose.  That is an entirely different story.  It is, as I said in the beginning, just an instance of the way in which it is very easy tactics to put into the mouths of your opponents something they did not say and then castigate them soundly for having said it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> We were also told that the achievement of the previous Government in regard to credit was a satisfactory achievement.  I must confess that I never under any circumstances understood the great hullabaloo, the apparent boast about the interview and the statement made following the interview between the former Taoiseach and the banks.  It amounted to this &mdash;that the banks undertook to give credit to any person who was credit-worthy. It seems astonishing to me that that should have been regarded as a noteworthy stride forward.  Surely the task of the banks is to carry on their business on the basis of giving credit to credit-worthy people?  Why it should be suggested that that was an amazing advance is something I find impossible to understand.  There was, too, another suggestion that there had been an immediate promise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like interrupting the Minister but I should like to have from him a statement at this stage as to what provision is now being made to facilitate those people who are not credit-worthy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must assume that I am really very naïve indeed.  At the moment we are dealing with what he was trying to call a wonderful achievement, that credit-worthy people would get credit.  That was the sum total of the statement issued.  There is one thing the Senator, every member on this side of the House, and the public, must clearly understand and that is that so far as this Government is concerned whatever facilities are required for proper productive development will be made available.  So far as we are concerned we will shape our policy more along the utilisation of money and materials towards things that will make real productive expansion rather than towards some of the things the previous administration had in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator has only a little patience he may be able to understand the goal at which we are <Col N="958" /> aiming.  The previous Government apparently made up their mind that it was the bigness of the thing they wanted to plan which was of operative effect.  I do not take that view and neither do my colleagues.  The manner in which they had proposals before them dealing with the National Development Fund indicated their minds were operating in that direction rather than according to the lines that most of us, I think, would agree was a better course.</P>
      <P>Senator Loughman referred particularly to the question of roads.  If there is to be any choice on whether money is to be utilised for the building of autobahns or utilised for the proper drainage and development of the land of this country, we shall come down quite clearly in favour of the drainage and development of our land.  I do not accept that the easing of corners, the taking away of dangerous turns and dealing with dangerous spots in villages is at all the same thing as building large double-track roads for road users which would mean that, at the same time, the limited resources that are in this country&mdash;and I think we are agreed on both sides of the House that there are limited resources in this country&mdash;would be utilised for that purpose rather than for the extension of the land project or the extension of arterial drainage or the extension of other drainage works, thus ensuring that our agricultural production would be expanded in the way we should like to see it expanded.  I do not propose to go into any great detail to-night on those lines or those plans because I feel it would be undesirable to do so at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is always the difficulty in regard to this House&mdash;the difficulty which, I must confess quite frankly, I felt when I was sitting on a seat over there on the far side of the House&mdash; that whatever Minister is here on a Finance Bill or the Appropriation Bill is generally in the position of having to deal not merely with matters purely financial but also with matters referring to other ministerial Departments because the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill, just as the Central <Col N="959" /> Fund Bill, are perhaps some of the ways in which members of this House can deal with things which would be dealt with in the other House by way of question across the House to the responsible Minister.  The members of the House will find in due course that the Government will announce their plans.  I am quite satisfied from my contacts throughout the country that not merely the people in business who support this Government but very many of the people who did not support it, and who still say quite unashamedly that they are not supporting it, maintain that it is only right that the members of this Government should get an opportunity to develop their plans and that they should not be badgered and pestered by an endeavour to get them to bring out details before they have got warm in their new seats of office.  That is a thing that is not restricted at all to people outside who support the Government itself.  Many of the people who support the Opposition are somewhat resentful, to put it mildly, of the line being taken by the Opposition generally in regard to the Government and to the plans that will ultimately be put into operation.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the question of the amount of money that would be available and referred to the criticisms that were made at the time of the 1952 Budget.  We must remember that, at the time of the 1952 Budget, the expenditure that was visualised was £94.8 million.  To-day, we are dealing with an expenditure of about £105,000,000: I am talking about current account.  If one had only got to deal with the problem that there was in relation to the figure of expenditure in the financial year 1952-53, my task would be a very much easier one indeed and it would be much easier to deal with the matter on lines which have been suggested.  It is entirely wrong and fallacious and, I suggest, politically dishonest, for people to attempt to attribute to us statements as regards the 1954 position which, in fact, were made in regard to the 1952 position which was, as I say, different to the extent of approximately £10,000,000 as regards expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> There has been a suggestion, by way of interjection, from Senator Yeats on the subject of borrowing.  May I repeat quietly certain figures which I gave the other House?  In 1950-51 the amount required for the service of debt was some £7.2 million.  In the year 1953-54&mdash;not the current year but last year&mdash;after the three years during which the previous Government were in office, that amount was £12.6 million.  I was asked in the other House, and I had not the exact figure available, how much of that figure was attributable to Marshall Aid repayment: it is £1.14 million.  Therefore, it means that, so far as service of debt is concerned&mdash;excluding Marshall Aid, to which I shall refer in a moment&mdash;the figure rose during the three years of the previous Government by something over £4,000,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I want just to mention that for the purpose, I hope, of killing the argument that has been made time and time again that the inter-Party Administration of 1948 to 1951 borrowed more than the Fianna Fáil Administration of 1951 to 1954.  It is not true and, in fact, the reverse is the truth if one takes account of the liabilities on the one side and the assets on the other and of the fact that my predecessor in office, when he went into office in June, 1951, had there available for him in Marshall Aid money a sum of £22,500,000.  If you take from the liabilities of the State that were created in the two three-year periods in each case the amount of the assets that were created during each period you will find that, in fact, the excess of liabilities over assets in the three-year term of Fianna Fáil is approximately £10,000,000 more than the excess in the previous three-year period.</P>
    <P>The figures are available on the records of the other House for anybody who wishes to see them.  They are undeniable.  They are facts&mdash;not merely a construction on facts&mdash;and they speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>They should, by anybody who wishes to understand them and who wishes to get down to them, terminate the political propaganda that has been made that the previous inter-Party <Col N="961" /> Government went in more for capital indebtedness than the Government that immediately preceded us.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston took apparently great exception to certain references that had been made throughout the country and in the other House the other day to a statement that he had made here in this House on the 19th June, 1952.  The Senator suggested that he had been quoted in those statements on the lines that what he advocated one day the previous Government did the next.  There was no such suggestion at all.  The suggestion was quite clear, that Senator Johnston had advocated a certain course of conduct and that when the Senator had advocated that the leader of the Government Party in this House had then supported that advocacy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnston suggested a somewhat different line to the line that I find in the debates of the 19th June.  He did to-day, as then, suggest very properly that part of his anxiety was to stress his point of view that in his opinion it was desirable to shift the trend somewhat from cattle towards other types of agricultural production.  The Senator suggested to-day that it was not fair at all to attribute any portion of his remarks on that occasion to a desire for revenue collection, and that it was because such a suggestion had been made in the country that he felt very disappointed, very displeased and very dissatisfied with the references that were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can only take the Senator as reported.  It may be, perhaps, that he did not exactly express what was in his mind, but if the Senator would again look at column 1574 of his speech of the 19th June, 1952, he will see there that he was speaking of this tax that was to be, in his advocacy, on cattle that were exported on the hoof, but he will see that he was advocating it also as an addition towards my predecessor, as &ldquo;a nice little contribution for the <Col N="962" /> Minister towards balancing his Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the statement there, and that is not at all the case that was made to-day here by the Senator, that the sole case made by him in advocating that suggestion was that it was going to be by way of a levy, to transfer it from one type of agricultural production to the other.  The whole tone of me Senator's remarks on that occasion meant, as far as I can understand his words, that he was considering it partly from the angle of transferring from one type of agriculture to another but partly, as I say, in his own words, &ldquo;as a nice little contribution towards balancing the Budget&rdquo;.  It was on that line that great exception was taken to it down the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons has suggested just now that the comment of Senator Quirke as leader of the House was a jovial suggestion, not to be taken seriously. Far be it from me to suggest that any member of this august assembly should never be jovial.  It would be disastrous if we could not be jovial on occasion, and may I say in passing that I hope that many members of this House will feel extremely jovial when the results of their election are announced at the end of the coming week.  That, of course, would be a case when they would be entitled to feel somewhat jovial.</P>
    <P>But I do suggest that for the leader of a Government Party in this House to treat a suggestion that was put forward as part of a long case by Senator Professor Johnston, that was put forward by Senator Johnston as a method of finding &ldquo;a nice little contribution towards the Minister's balancing the Budget&rdquo;&mdash;for the leader of the House, of the Government Party in the House and the spokesman, therefore, of the Government in the House to treat that purely in a jovial way, if it was so treated, would not, in my humble opinion, be a fair construction to put on any person's remarks speaking in that capacity. Therefore, with all due respect to the Senator, I find it difficult, to accept the explanation that was put forward by him at this stage.</P>

I suggest that it would be better for anybody who wishes to make the case, on the one hand, that the Senator's suggestion was serious, or for anybody, on the other hand, who wishes to make the case that the suggestion was jovial, to read the whole of Senator Quirke's speech on that occasion and come to their own conclusions.  I personally feel that when they do that they can only come to the conclusion that I came to, that a kite was being flown to see how it would go.</P>
      <P>The other things that were mentioned in this debate are things, as I say, with which we will deal in our own good time, with which we will deal and put during the term of office of this Government to the people in a serious and responsible way, having worked them out to the best of our ability and having made it clear that we are considering our problems not from the point of view of this year, or this year alone, but from the point of view of five years, from a long-term point of view; because I suggest, with respect, to this House, that it is perfectly clear that this Government is going to run that time and have that time to fulfil and to put its policies into operation.</P>

      <P>I should like to have on this section, which proposes to give remission of the excise duty on beer, information as to whether the Minister has made arrangements that the relief given will be passed on to the consumer <Col N="964" /> or whether it is to be completely a relief for the licensed trade.  It is a fairly considerable sum of money&mdash; something like £890,000&mdash;and when the Budget proposals were going through the other House, Deputy Costello, who is now Taoiseach, asked the same question. I wonder if the Minister has come to a decision as to whether this remission shall be passed on to the consumer at this stage or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator wish me to answer exactly in the words of my predecessor, words which I can remember, namely, that he was making the remission and it would be for the brewers to decide.  I would suggest, however, that the remission of duty provided for here is for the purpose of ensuring that the price will remain the same.  Otherwise, as was explained on that occasion&mdash;I do not think the Senator is quite aware of it&mdash;the price might have had to be increased.  This has been met in this way and it is for the purpose of making adjustments vertically down through the trade.</P>

      <P>Surely when the present Taoiseach was dissatisfied with that procedure, with the provision the Minister was making, some steps should be taken by him and his Minister for Finance to ensure that what he wished at that stage should follow and that the benefit would be passed on to the consumer.</P>

      <P>This Bill is in the ordinary form which Appropriation Bills have followed for some number of years and I do not think I need explain the details of it. If there is any particular provision in it, however, that any member of the House would wish me to explain in greater detail, I shall be only too happy to do so.  The purpose of the Bill is to authorise the issue from the Central Fund of the balance of the amount granted for the current year. The Vote on Account which is passed in the Dáil just before the commencement of the financial year and which comes to the Seanad in the form of the Central Fund Bill covers the financial expenditure required up to 31st of this month.  The Bill authorises the issue of the remainder of the appropriation required for the rest of the financial year up to 31st March next.  It is in standard form, but, as I say, if there is anything which any member would wish me to deal with, I shall be happy to do so.</P>

      <P>This Bill which, as the Minister has said, is in standard form is, with the Finance Bill which we have just passed, one of the few opportunities available to the House of expressing its views on the many matters involved in such measures.  I do not wish to go into any details in connection with the provision made in this Bill, except to relate it to some extent to the measure which has just passed.  I put at least three questions to the Minister, and I am very glad to have got one very definite answer, an answer which will, I am sure, as the Minister would desire, have the effect of making clearer to the people that they cannot now expect the promises made during the general election campaign to be fulfilled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the only relief that can be expected is that <Col N="966" /> which has already been announced in relation to a reduction in the price of butter.  We have that very clear statement from the Minister that, until 31st March next or until whatever date the new Budget is introduced, there can be no hope of any relief in taxation or any reduction in the cost of living brought about by Government action.</P>

      <P>I have here a very elaborate advertisement which appeared in the <i>Clare Champion</i> on 15th May, 1954.  That advertisement contains the pictures of two very lovable people&mdash;the two candidates standing on behalf of Fine Gael&mdash;and it carries a comparison between the prices of tea, sugar, bread, flour, petrol, wireless licences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The promise was: &ldquo;Once more we pledge ourselves to reduce taxation and the cost of living as we did in 1948 within six weeks.&rdquo;  The Minister might say that we have taken him at a disadvantage when we ask him to do these things not in six weeks but in two months.  If Senator O'Reilly wishes to have any more of these advertisements, from which he is prepared to run away now, read out, I have quite a number of them here.  They cost something and they must have conveyed to the people that, if a change of Government was brought about, the prices of these commodities would come down to the 1951 level.</P>

      <P>As I said at the outset it is, I suppose, fitting, particularly at this stage of the Seanad's life, that we should pass over these Bills as lightly as we possibly can and give the Minister all stages of this Appropriation Bill.

      <P>I did the Senator a further injustice when I said I assumed he had read the debates in the other House.  Nothing could have been more clear than the manner in which I said in the other House that the amount that was necessary to provide the subvention to reduce the price of butter by 5d. a lb. as from 23rd August next was to be made by economies.  When that announcement was made on the 15th of last month it was made crystal clear for anybody who read that debate either in the records of the other House or in the newspapers that that was the manner in which the moneys required were going to be found.  I have yet to find or to hear&mdash; and the deputy leader of the Senator's Party would, I think he will admit, be quick to produce the appropriate quotations if he could find them&mdash;from any member of the Fianna Fáil Party a quotation correctly taken or correctly given, which would imply that any of the leaders of the Fine Gael Party suggested that these reductions or that any amelioration was going to take place forthwith or immediately.  I <Col N="969" /> asked across the floor of the other House on more than one occasion for the exact quotations to be given.  On the contrary, the quotations that were given in the other House and the speeches that were made by the leaders of the Senator's Party and editorials written by the <i>Irish Press</i> during the course of the election were all to the effect that Mr. Costello was promising nothing.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera, the Taoiseach as he then was, in one speech, Deputy Lemass, the Tánaiste as he then was, speaking in Banagher, Deputy Traynor, the then Minister for Defence, speaking in Dublin, and an editorial in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;all those four sources, made authoritative pronouncements giving tremendous weight to the fact that Mr. Costello had promised nothing and because he had promised nothing people should not support him.  Now we have got the exact reverse being suggested by the people on the other side of the House. That was their case during the general election.  The complaint was that under no circumstances should the people support Fine Gael because Mr. Costello was promising nothing.  Now they are coming along and saying that Mr. Costello promised everything.  I would suggest, with all respect to my friends opposite, even, as I said before, in this, perhaps, vocational House, that they should make up their minds which foot they want to stand on.  They cannot stand on one foot to-day and another foot last May during the election campaign.  When they have made up their minds which foot they want to stand on, then they will be able to chart a constructive course in the Opposition.  I hope I will see them charting a constructive course there in the new House that will arise.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the Order is to extend the area within which gas may be supplied to within nine miles of the General Post Office, and also to the Bray district.</P>
      <P>Secondly, its purpose is to increase the borrowing powers by £250,000 by the issue of debenture stock.  Thirdly, it increases the permitted maximum of the Special Purposes Fund from £93,000 to £130,000.  The existing limitations were imposed in 1909 and this increase is necessitated by the considerable rise in the cost of plant and renewals since that time.</P>

    <P>Fourthly, it establishes a new fund to be called the Renewals Fund.  At <Col N="971" /> present the company does not include in its annual accounts any amount for depreciation, but such renewals are charged as and when effected.  This method would have the effect of equalising as far as possible the annual charge in respect of such renewals. Fifthly, the purpose of the Order is to empower the company to appoint as directors persons in administrative and technical posts in the company.  At present, the company is precluded <Col N="972" /> from appointing any person holding office under the company.</P>
