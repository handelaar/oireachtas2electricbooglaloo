      <P>Ní foláir nó ba thrua le Seanadóirí a chloisteáil i rith an tSosa go raibh an Seanadóir Séamas Mac Giollaruaidh tar éis bháis. Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>Ba duine an Seanadóir Mac Giollaruaidh a thug grá dhá thír as a óige.  Ghlac sé páirt sa ghluaiseacht náisiúnta trí ghabháil le Sinn Féin nuaír nach raibh an eagraíocht sin ach ina tús; bhí céim Aidiúnaigh Chathláin aige in Arm na Poblachta ina dhiaidh sin.  Throid sé i gcatha uíle an Cheathrú Rannáin Iartharaigh ina Cheantar le linn Cogaidh na Saoirse.  Gearradh príosúntacht air níos mó ná uair amháin mar gheall ar a ghníomhartha.</P>
      <P>Toghadh ina chomhalta de Chomhairle Chontae Mhuigheo é i 1927 agus bhí sé ina chomhalta dhi sin agus de chomhluchta áitiúla eile i gContae Mhuigheo go dtí go bhfuair sé bás.</P>
      <P>Toghadh chun Dáil Éireann é i 1943 mar ionadaí do Mhuigheo Thuaidh ar son Fianna Fáil agus hatoghadh ina dhiaidh sin é go dtí 1951.  Toghadh chun an tSeanaid é i 1951 ar an Rolla Talmhaíochta.</P>
      <P>Chaith an Seanadóir Mac Giollaruaidh dúthracth lena dhualgais phoiblí agus rinne sé freastal go dtí an deireadh, d ainneoin drochshláinte, ar an Seanad agus ar na comhairlí áitiúla a raibh baint agie leo.  Is mór a aireos comhaltaí uile an tSeanaid uathu é.  Duine lách múinte a bhí ann agus bhí gean ag Teachtaí agus ag Seanadóirí i gcoitinne air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator approached me just before the House sat, and, so far as I can see, there is no objection. The other motions have been on the Order Paper for a considerable time and have not been moved, and it would be a good thing if they could be disposed of one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to object to any motion being taken, provided the other business is dealt with, but I might suggest that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, apart altogether from what may be arranged with regard to this motion, might be asked to consider the position of motions, the question of priority and <Col N="377" /> possible delay, and whether they should be dependent on the attendance of a Minister or not.  It is rather a farce to have these motions standing on the Order Paper for a long time, and, if the question were considered amicably, as it would be, by the committee, some understanding would probably be reached.  Some types of motions should not be taken without the attendance of a Minister under any circumstances, but there are others which could be taken, and possibly some understanding could be reached and the question of priority would not then arise in relation to these motions.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with the suggestion put forward by the Cathaoirleach.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCrea</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that some protest should be made against the treatment being meted out to these motions. Senator Tunney and I have a motion on the paper which was tabled when loan charges were increased.  At the time, it was a matter of importance but since then the matter has been discussed <Col N="378" /> in every boardroom in the country.  It seems to me that Ministers treat these motions with contempt and that no effort is made to bring them before the House.  If Senator Tunney were here to-day I would advise him to get the permission of the House to withdraw that motion because they are being treated as jokes not alone in present circumstances, but even under the previous Government when I have known motions to have been on the Order Paper for 15 and 18 months.  I think that is very unfair.  The motion to which I refer was a very important motion when it was tabled and was a matter of considerable discussion but to-day it does not make very much difference.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is quite fair to say that motions were treated with contempt.  There was never any pressure from the people who put down the motions, so far as I am aware, that they should be dealt with whenever it came to deal with the motions.  There never was to my knowledge any pressure to have the motions taken.</P>

      <P>In connection with item No. 14, on three occasions efforts were made to have the motion raised and for various reasons it was impossible for the Minister to come to the House.  It would be untrue to say that efforts&mdash;and strong efforts&mdash;were not made to bring before the House item No. 14 on the Order Paper.  Those efforts were made.</P>

    <Title>National Development Fund Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Acting-Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Acting-Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)">
      <NameTxt>Acting-Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill a sum of £5,000,00 is being set aside this year in the National Development Fund which can be drawn upon to meet the cost of development works.  The fund is a kind of capital reserve which can be used, as may be necessary, to give an impetus to the capital development programme by making additional money available over and above the Budget allocation for programmes of works already approved and to initiate new projects which might otherwise have been deferred for some time yet.  This reserve will be especially useful to combat unemployment and its existence will enable prompt action to be taken whenever the unemployment situation becomes unsatisfactory, as money will be immediately available in the fund for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the relief of unemployment through the fund will be associated directly with the promotion of development projects.  the fund will make it possible to carry out works which will not only provide employment but will be of lasting benefit to the economy as a whole.  The existence of the fund is stimulating the examination of possibilities over the whole field of State-financed development and a number of worthwhile and employment-giving projects have already emerged.  Although the fund is, relatively speaking, a small one&mdash;about 3 per cent. of total State expenditure&mdash; its existence is, nevertheless, a real incentive to development.  It gives the Government a limited and reasonable flexibility in the financial sphere and ensures that various authorities will not be deterred from putting forward their plans by doubts as to whether money will be available after the work of preparing the plans has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> Out of this year's provision the fund is supplying £1,000,000 to the Road Fund, as well as £500,000 for special employment schemes, £250,000 for Gaeltacht projects and £100,000 for schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.  Grants have also been allocated to other approved projects as follows: Cork Harbour improvements, £550,000; road development works in connection with E.S.B. hand-won turf stations, £200,000; Dublin Harbour improvements, £527,000; bridge over railway connection to Limerick, cement factory, £20,000; Department of Agriculture projects, development of fish hatcheries, £25,000; progeny testing, pigs and sheep, £88,000; special veterinary research, £25,000; production of foundation stocks of seed, £150,000; cattle progeny testing, £35,000; artificial insemination stations for north-west counties, £40,000; control stations for eggs and poultry, £100,000.</P>
    <P>That is a total, issued from the fund to date or projects approved, of £3,610,000.  Projects financed from the fund will be carried out by or under the auspices of the various Government Departments and Departments receiving issues from the fund will account for the expenditure in the same way as they account for other Exchequer issues for departmental services.  These departmental accounts will be in addition to the accounts of the fund itself for which provision is made in Section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the current financial year the full amount of £5,000,000 will be paid into the fund.  The amount to be paid into the fund in each of the next three financial years within the statutory limit of £5,000,000 will be determined each year in relation to relevant factors such as the level of employment, the balance of payments situation, and the provision already made in the Budget for development works.  Any balance in the fund which is not needed for immediate expenditure can be re-invested in accordance with the provision of Section 6 of the Bill. When the fund is wound up on the 31st March, 1957, any balance remaining to the credit of the fund can be expended on projects which had been approved <Col N="383" /> but had not been completed before that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, I understand, a Money Bill.  It is, therefore, a Bill we can talk about but can do nothing otherwise than express opinions.  I should like to ask the Minister a few questions.  Quite frankly, I am not very clear as to the extent to which this represents new procedure.  I gathered from a report of one of his speeches in the Press that the main effect was to provide a little less control by the Oireachtas, that is, by the Dáil, to the extent of approximately 3 per cent. of expenditure, which, he pointed out, was a relatively small sum.  What puzzles me is that there is any need for a lessening of control.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of this House for about 30 years and I cannot recollect any one case of a Government proposing expenditure which was refused by the Dáil.  Therefore, whatever merit may be in this Bill as a new procedure it is not entirely due to any difficulty in obtaining money for what the Government of the day considers to be wise or satisfactory expenditure.  Apparently the only gain is&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong; I am not anxious to make any points that are not correct&mdash;that this can be done beforehand whereas otherwise the sanction would have to be given by the Dáil before the expenditure took place. I wonder is this really necessary?  Is it a step in the right direction?</P>
      <P>In the statement made by the Minister a few minutes ago he used the words &ldquo;capital development&rdquo; and said that all the expenditure under this fund would be of a capital development nature.  I am not quite sure whether that is the case.  When I read the Bill I took a different view.  I thought the phrase &ldquo;projects of development of a public character and in the national interest&rdquo; was definitely framed to include expenditure other than capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us are strongly in favour of wise capital expenditure.  By wise capital expenditure I mean expenditure which will yield in future income either to the citizens of this country or to the State thereby enabling national development <Col N="384" /> of a financial and economic character.  I am not happy at the moment at the competition which seems to be going on between the political Parties as to which can spend the most.  I read in the <i>Irish Times</i> a report of one of the Ministers of the present Government who boasted that the inter-Party Government were spending £24,000,000 whereas the present Government were spending £45,000,000.  It does not seem to me that the spending of money in itself is anything to boast about, whereas expenditure in the way in which expenditure can be utilised in order to produce economic benefit is something which can promote healthy competition between Parties.  However, I think there has been too much of the idea: &ldquo;We are better than others because we spend more money.&rdquo;  I think that is wrong, and the tendency of this Bill is to make it easier&mdash;only to the extent of 3 per cent. and, therefore, perhaps not very important &mdash;to get sanction for expenditure whereas I am rather inclined to think what we want is something in the opposite direction, namely, to make it rather more difficult; a too easy sanctioning of expenditure has in itself little if any merit.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill apparently the only sanction required is that the Minister for Finance of the day considers that the projects are projects of development of a public character and are in the national interest.  If he considered anything that was not in the national interest or that he thought was not in the national interest, he would not be fit to be a Minister and he would not be here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other phrase &ldquo;development of a public character&rdquo;  I would be glad if the Minister in replying could give us a little information as to whether this is intended to be confined to expenditure of a capital nature.  We can remember that the present Minister for Finance&mdash;I am very sorry that he is not here, although that is no reflection on Deputy Aiken&mdash; made it very clear that he was very sceptical of certain funds being set aside by his predecessor for capital development.  I think the description he gave them was that they were unwieldy; <Col N="385" /> the suggestion quite definitely was that they were too large.  Now, apparently, they are only half big enough, because twice as much is being spent.  Can we take it that any portion of the money which is voted under the £5,000,000 has to be found out of taxation or may we take it definitely as the policy of the Government that this will be of a capital nature and will be met by borrowing?  That is something which has not been mentioned in the Minister's statement.  Maybe if I read all the Dáil Reports it would be quite clear, but it is not clear to me at the moment.</P>
    <P>As far as this House is concerned it does not seem to me we have much function in criticising or deciding how the Dáil will sanction State expenditure. That is one of the matters in which our function is very clearly defined by the Constitution as being of an advisory character.  We have no powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must all welcome this Bill in the general terms in which the Minister has put it before us.  However, I want to ask the Minister in his reply to give us a little bit more information than he did in his short statement.  There is no doubt at all that if this expenditure of £5,000,000 per year is to be to the lasting benefit of the nation&mdash;in other words, if it is going to be spent on investment of a definite nature which will be productive, rather than just spending £5,000,000 to alleviate unemployment here, there, or elsewhere&mdash; we will all gladly take the necessary steps to find the money.  However, the Minister made mention of certain projects to which moneys had already been allotted and one of them was the Dublin Port and Docks Board to which, I think, the amount of £527,000 has been made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was at that board meeting to-day, and I think that sum represents 60 per cent. of the money that the board is to spend.  When we are dealing in terms of money and when public authorities are mentioned, I think there should be no misunderstanding in the public mind as to what the exact situation is.  In other words, the board itself must find somewhere in the <Col N="386" /> neighbourhood of £400,000 in addition to this £527,000 from the State.  I do not want that statement to be taken as unfriendly criticism of the scheme. The board is very grateful to the Government for making it possible to do works of that size and character, involving expenditure that otherwise would not be possible, but I feel&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will not mind my saying so&mdash;that now that the picture is to be put before the public as to how the moneys are to be spent, that the full picture should be painted so that the public will know what is happening; otherwise it will be assumed that the board is overnight going to get something over £500,000, and, naturally, everybody interested in employment will be expecting new schemes to be put in hand to-morrow morning, which just cannot happen.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that certain very definite schemes have already been considered.  There is a network of projects to be carried out at the docks and these are being made possible by the moneys now being contributed out of the scheme but I would like it to be known that as far as the item for the Dublin Port and Docks Board is concerned the £527,000 represents only 60 per cent. of the amount which it hopes to spend.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

I would like to say, outright, that I am not opposed to this Bill but, at the same time, I think the principles which it embodies are not without a certain danger and give rise to the possibility of adverse criticism. It is an effective instrument in the hands of the Government to enable them to deal with unforeseen contingencies in the way of a sudden increase in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the giving to the Government of a certain discretion in the handling of the matter is justified by the fact that the Dáil is not always in session and that an emergency might arise at a time when it would not be convenient to summon the Dáil and <Col N="387" /> that therefore the Government should have a certain amount of discretion in the matter of the use of public money for purposes of an unforeseen emergency character.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation is not good: at the same time, it is not as bad as all that.  If I have rightly interpreted the statistics which are circulated to Senators, unemployment in the month of January was up by 12,440, as compared with the 19th December.  However, as compared with January, 1953, it was down by 5,628.  Therefore, it will be admitted that it varies very considerably from month to month and no one can tell what the unemployment situation will be in a few months' time.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the Bill is open to objection on constitutional grounds. However, if the administration of this money is carried out under the auspices of a suitable organisation&mdash;and I am sure the staff of the Minister can be trusted to provide such an organisation &mdash;and especially if a certain proportion of it should be set aside to meet the special requirements of the congested districts and the Gaeltacht areas, I think it would be open to less objection on constitutional grounds.  For instance, there is the problem of the onion growers in the Dingle Peninsula. I believe that by means of this particular measure it might be possible to help to organise the business of those onion growers on a permanent and more satisfactory basis, and enable them to supply the requirements of the home market more efficiently and to the greater satisfaction of all concerned.</P>
    <P>There is always the fact that under the ordinary unemployment legislation there is regularly provided to the members of families in small farming areas in the off seasons a certain amount of money for doing nothing.  The unemployment period determines the length of the time they can draw that money. If, in some way, the use of this money could be amalgamated with some saving from the other sources of expenditure to increase the opportunities for employment for such people who are now paid for doing nothing, it would <Col N="388" /> be a definite saving to the public purse. That is co-ordination about which a flexible administrative organisation, which really knew intimately the circumstances of the country, might be able to make valuable suggestions which the Minister could act on in his public capacity.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for the State, by the mere expenditure of public money on the various projects that are available to them, directly to increase permanent employment.  The kind of things on which public money is generally spent are essentially temporary&mdash;the widening of roads, the removal of a bridge, and so forth.  It provides employment for the time being, so long as the money is there and the work remains to be done.  But when the Naas Bridge has been removed and a level crossing is placed in its stead of a kind to enable motor cars to tear into the town of Naas at 40 m.p.h. instead of 30 or 25 m.p.h., the only permanent employment you are likely to increase is the employment of undertakers and grave-diggers.</P>

      <P>It is more a question of the objects on which that public money is spent than the mere expenditure of the money itself which is going to make any permanent improvement in the capital equipment of the country.  It is extremely difficult, with the expenditure of public money, to ensure that you are going to remove the root causes of unemployment and contribute permanently to an increase in long-term employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his remarks in the other House, the Minister said that he would like to see individuals&mdash;farmers and others&mdash;spending their own capital in developing their own productive capacity, especially in the matter of liming the land.  The Minister pointed out that an expenditure of £2 or £3 would give a return, over a period of years, as much as fifty fold in an extreme case.  I thoroughly agree.  I think it is really more in accordance with the character of our economy that we should encourage private individuals to spend their own capital in developing profit-making opportunities for <Col N="389" /> themselves which will guarantee permanent employment for themselves and their employees than that we should develop too much the functions of the State in this matter.</P>
    <P>I think it was the Ibec Report that pointed out that already, although we claimed to be a private enterprise economy, the State has absorbed so many of the economic functions or so much of the control of the economic life of the nation that, in some respects, we are a more Socialist community than Britain.  That report warned us that we are in some danger of undermining the springs of private enterprise and that private investment of capital for one's own profit-making purposes is discouraged if the State goes too far in the way of spending capital on objects of public enterprise.  My fear is that if we spend too much money, especially on inadequately considered objects of public expenditure, we may lessen rather than increase the disposition of private owners of business and firms to expend or invest their capital in their own business enterprises. After all, I take it that this additional money is more likely to come out of additional borrowing than out of any surplus available in the current revenues of the State.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the long run, it must add to the national debt and prevent a reduction, if it does not actually entail an increase, in taxation.  Those two causes alone are apt to diminish the incentive of the owners of private business to extend their investments and provide more and permanent employment. However, perhaps the moral is rather that we should be extremely choosy of the objects on which this money will be spent.  From that point of view, I hope it will not be spent in parts of the country where its principal effect would be to draw labour away from existing opportunities of permanent work but rather that it will be used to provide occupation in parts of the country where people have not the same opportunity for permanent wage paid labour.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter is that, as the Ibec Committee pointed out, already the State claims I think the whole of the total current savings of the community.  Consequently, if the <Col N="390" /> State expands its demand for capital for its various purposes and if private enterprise also should develop a demand for capital for various developmental purposes, the net effect must be to unbalance the balance of payments again, and to create the situation which confronted the Government when they came into office three years ago.  Any unbalancing of the balance of payments must lead to a surplus of imports and to a disinvestment of external assets.</P>
    <P>I now come to what I regard as the fundamental cause of the unemployment situation and of the migration and emigration from the country and of the slow increase in agricultural production.  Farms are of all sorts of different sizes, but they can be divided mainly into three groups&mdash;those under 50 acres, those between 50 and 100 acres and those over 100 acres.  Of the total manpower engaged in agriculture &mdash;which is about 500,000 people&mdash; 350,000, approximately, are engaged on farms of under 50 acres.  In most cases the farmers themselves or the persons occupied are relatives of the farm family.  Since 1939 these 350,000 people&mdash;on whose energies the country must mainly rely for any potential increase of agricultural production&mdash;have found the circumstances adverse to any expansion of their efforts to increase production.  Those circumstances were adverse partly owing to world conditions and partly owing to Government policies, not only here but in other countries.  The economy of a small-scale farm, one of under 50 acres, is inevitably based on dairying, whether that farm is in a creamery district or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose nobody could object to the terms of this Bill, as the money to be voted is to be utilised for the employment creating projects which the Minister enumerated. Taking the broader outlook which Senator Johnston touched on&mdash;and which he was not allowed to deal with in too much detail&mdash;I think that, in the main, he was on the right track. First of all, there is much perturbation in the public mind and in the minds of business people&mdash;I do not mean big business people, but all people who have to make their money the hard way&mdash;at the necessity for this Government priming of the economy in dealing with the unemployment situation. If our economy were good, if business were prosperous in agriculture and industry and commerce, I wonder would this Bill be necessary.  It really stems from the fact that the unemployment situation was getting serious, that it was becoming politically embarrassing and that it was absolutely necessary that something should be done to keep the unemployment figures from getting bigger month by month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that unemployment was growing, after 30 years of self-Government, surely points to the fact that there is something wrong with our whole economy.  I know there is something wrong.  What I believe is wrong is that we have no proper basic policy behind our economy.  We say it is a private enterprise economy, but we make it impossible for private enterprise to function, because the Government takes too much on itself.  We are told by certain individuals that private enterprise is a failure, but no system could succeed if it is not allowed to function properly.  It is hamstrung in all sorts of ways&mdash;by taxation and by control, as well as by a psychological atmosphere that makes it impossible for it to function.  The things that make for a prosperous private enterprise economy are success and wealth. <Col N="392" /> If we are to have successful private enterprises certain persons and bodies must be allowed to get rich.  But to get rich, for an individual or a corporation, is forbidden by law and is impossible.  But what is wrong, what is the necessity for the Bill, is that we have not wholeheartedly made up our minds as to the kind of economy we want.</P>
    <P>If we want a socialist economy, where the Government is asked to do all sorts of things, let us say so and get on with it, let us know that it is a socialist economy and let us know what our limitations are; but if it is to be a private enterprise economy, let us make our laws such that they will make it possible for the private enterprise economy to function, let us make our laws and our taxation system such that people will be able to build up and utilise capital.  If I were to see any force exerted in this country, if we are a private enterprise economy, I would like to see the force exerted in making people create capital, in making it almost obligatory to create a certain amount of capital.  Of course, we never would do that, but at least let us create the incentives.  This Bill is in fact a symptom of the fact that all is not well with our economy.</P>
    <P>I thought up to recently that perhaps the situation here was not different from that anywhere else, but this last week-end I had the owner of one of the leading departmental stores&mdash; the leading departmental store&mdash;in England as a guest in my house and I asked him how was trade in distribution. He said it was excellent, indeed, better than last year.  I had a lady here at the same time from America&mdash;from one of the leading stores in New York.  This lady is a buyer for that store, turning over some $3,000,000 a year, which is £1,000,000. This year she is expecting that $3,000,000 turnover to go up by another $500,000.  That is the picture from two of the leading stores&mdash;in New York and London&mdash;to-day.  In my own business, the textile trade, it is no secret that in both distribution and manufacturing things are not good at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas referred to two matters&mdash;he asked the Minister if this <Col N="393" /> Bill would be dealt with through taxation or through borrowing.  I suggest that, whichever way it is done, it is going to be bad for our economy.  If it is through taxation, it involves more taxation on to that which already so heavily weighs us down.  If, on the other hand, it is by borrowing, I would suggest that a peculiar situation will arise.  It is well known that we are under-capitalised in private enterprise in this country.  It is made impossible to build up capital, by our taxation laws; but at the same time, having made it impossible to build up the capital we need, through taxation, the State is engaged in borrowing at a very high rate of interest.  The last loan was floated at 5 per cent.  Such an attractive rate naturally succeeded in mopping up very large amounts of risk capital.  What some people have not noticed is that, at the same time as this high rate is being offered by the State for capital, industry and commerce is being controlled by tribunals and inquiries of all kinds and is being prevented from showing a proper return to investors of capital in private industry.  The result is that we get the comparison as between State investment, which is gilt-edged security, giving this high rate of interest, and private industry is prevented from giving a proper rate of interest on risk capital.  Therefore, the State is having it both ways and, as I say, it is paralysng our private enterprise economy.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I feel that if we should even now make up our minds as to whether we are a private enterprise economy or not and if we could get down to these questions of taxation, creation of capital and so on, a Bill of this sort would not be necessary and it would not be necessary to provide these sums of money through State organisations to create employment.  As Senator Douglas says, we have no power to do anything about the Bill, but we can at least express our views on it, and all I can say is that I am very sorry that such a Bill should have to be introduced at this time.  After 30 years of self-Government, I feel that our unemployment situation should be dealt with for the most part through <Col N="394" /> the ordinary channels of private enterprise industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in the House will agree on the necessity for national development.  It is a matter on which all Parties in the State are in substantial agreement.  The history of this country is one of underdevelopment in the past.  There have been a number of unfortunate influences impeding the development of the national resources and it is a very right and proper thing that an Irish Government should do everything it can to build up the resources of the country.  At the same time, I agree with Senator McGuire that private enterprise is the best way of developing the country. Everything he says is, in my opinion, true; but I am afraid we have to admit that private enterprise, in the circumstances of Ireland at the moment, is unlikely to develop sufficiently fast to solve the unemployment problem to any great extent and to open up investment in all desirable directions.</P>
      <P>There is a certain lack of tradition of investment in Irish business and a certain lack of knowledge of opportunities amongst the agricultural community. As was said by Senator Johnston, the ideal type of national investment would be the investment by farmers of their savings in their own farms.  That, we hope, will come with the passage of time&mdash;it is largely a matter of education of farmers regarding the openings and the opportunities in their own industry.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Senator McGuire that the high taxation of individuals and companies has a deterrent effect on private enterprise.  It is extremely difficult for anybody to-day to save any money.  The whole system of income-tax, profits tax and death duties is a deterrent to saving.  I am glad that the Minister for Finance, whose absence from this debate, we regret, has acceded to the wishes of the Seanad in setting up an inquiry into income-tax&mdash;with special regard to the effect of income-tax on business.  The result of the report of that committee may be to take away some of the disincentive effect of the present taxation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must all agree with Senator <Col N="395" /> Douglas that the spending of public money is not an end in itself, that, other things being equal, the less public money is spent the better, and that anything in the nature of competition between political Parties on a spending spree is wholly deplorable. Having said all that, we must admit that the present Bill is justified in the circumstances of the situation.  Public investment is being pursued in every country in the world to-day, and, although I quite agree with what Senator McGuire said regarding the mixed type of our system&mdash;not being clearly either capitalist or socialist&mdash;we are only following many other countries, which are quite as individualist as ours, in extending the field of public development.  I think the extension of public investment is inevitable in the 20th century.  My attitude towards the Bill is that it is a regrettable necessity.  It is a second best, but, at the same time, it is a necessity, and therefore we should welcome it.  We should direct our attention in the Seanad to making some constructive criticism in the direction of seeing that the Bill does the most possible good and the least possible harm.</P>
    <P>A particular aspect of the Bill which strikes me as requiring discussion is the need for a consistent policy by the Government in administering it and clear thinking regarding the purposes of the Bill.  One matter which I wish to emphasise very strongly is that, in the debates in the Dáil and in the Bill itself, there seems to be a certain confusion of thinking between the aim of employment and the aim of national development.  The two are frequently spoken of as if they were synonymous, the fact being that measures which give a great deal of employment may not do much to develop the country and measures which do a great deal to develop the country may not give much employment.  It is necessary for the Seanad and the Government to be perfectly clear what the object of this legislation is.  If I thought the object of the legislation was merely to deal with demonstrations of unemployed, I would be entirely opposed to it.  I have frequently said in the Seanad that the <Col N="396" /> finding of work out of public money for work's sake is not justified in our situation to-day.  Therefore it is very important that we should have an assurance from the Minister that the object of the Bill is not merely relief works or doles or the giving of employment but definitely the building up of the resources of the country, with the hope of giving not merely temporary employment, but, as Senator Johnston said, some measure of more permanent employment, so that when any particular scheme has been completed, the employment will not come to an end and another problem will not have to be faced.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the question of the choice of investments is very important and I will come later to that question again&mdash;who is to make the choice of investments?  We are giving in the Bill considerable discretion to somebody to invest public money without specific parliamentary sanction, and, in doing so, there should be clear guidance given to the Government as to what are the wishes of the Legislature regarding the directions in which that investment should take place.  In the first place, I should say that one object that must be ruled out is work for work's sake.  The classical case which is always quoted is the Keynes example&mdash;digging holes and filling them up again.  That is not the type of employment which we wish to see given under the Bill.</P>
    <P>In choosing schemes under the Bill, choice will have to be made between schemes with a high labour content and schemes with a less high labour content, and I suggest that the labour content of a scheme should not be the decisive criterion of its desirability.  I suggest that, where schemes are more or less equal in other respects, a high labour content is preferable to a low labour content.  I suggest that there might be some preference given, even when things are not entirely equal, to schemes with a high labour content, because we all agree that the stemming of the tide of emigration is a benefit for which the country should be prepared to pay a certain price.</P>
    <P>I gathered from the Minister's introductory observations here and the <Col N="397" /> debate in the Dáil that the amount of money spent under this Bill will vary with the condition of the balance of payments.  I gather that the powers in this Bill will be used as a sort of thermostat to keep employment stable, that when the balance of payments is good more may be spent and when it is bad less will be spent.  It is perfectly proper and in accordance with all modern approaches to the trade cycle and balance of payments that the Government is entitled to vary the amount of public expenditure in accordance with changes in the business climate and the state of trade.</P>
    <P>I take it that it is the intention of the Government that, if the balance of payments position is unsatisfactory, no money will be spent under this Bill and that if the balance of payments position is unfavourable all expenditure under this Bill must be clamped down.  The justification given by the Minister in the Dáil for the introduction of the Bill was that the balance of payments had become favourable and that, therefore, expenditure of this money could be afforded.  I take it that the Minister accepts the truth of the converse of that proposition&mdash; that if the balance of payments position becomes unfavourable expenditure under this Bill cannot be afforded and will, therefore, come to an end.  Even if the balance of payments is favourable, it is to be hoped that the expenditure under the Bill will be of a kind which will help to make it more favourable in the future, that the criterion of expenditure will always be ultimately the strengthening of the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>A mere temporary improvement in the balance of payments caused by some quite fortuitous factor, such as an improvement in the terms of trade, should never be allowed to justify a mere spending spree on unproductive expenditure.  Even when the balance of payments is quite favourable, expenditure under this Bill should be very judicious and very carefully chosen and not wasteful.  It should not be designed simply to provide work for work's sake and to stop unemployment <Col N="398" /> at any cost in order to keep the unemployed quiet and prevent them from sitting down in the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>As was suggested by a previous speaker in the debate, there always is the danger that expenditure of this kind may help impair the balance of payments.  Therefore, I suggest that the Oireachtas is giving the Government in this Bill certain powers which may be used for good but, if unwisely used, may be harmful in their consequence. The justification for the Bill is that certain circumstances change rapidly.  The Dáil is not always in session, Estimates have sometimes to be debated at length and action must be taken without delay.  There are many circumstances which change in an unforeseeable and rapid manner.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation changes not only in regard to nations as a whole but in regard to particular localities.  As Senator Johnston has indicated, the cessation of some types of public works may leave a train of unemployment in its wake.  The openings for productive employment change from time to time.  Governments must have the same keen eye for productive openings that a good business man has. Finally, the balance of payments itself changes quite rapidly as a result of changes in the terms of trade, import and export prices and all sorts of influences which may develop quite rapidly and quite unpredictably.  The fact of these changes and the necessity for rapid action are the justifications of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Parliament is abrogating part of its function and part of its sovereignty in this Bill.  It is giving to the Administration the choice of the objects of public expenditure and the handling of public money without specific votes and individual estimates.  It, therefore, becomes a matter of great importance for Parliament to be sure, in abrogating its function, that these powers will not be abused.  The question we must all ask is: &ldquo;Who is to make the decision under this Bill?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In previous debates on cognate subjects in this Chamber I referred more than once to the recommendations of the Banking Committee for a national <Col N="399" /> investment council.  That is a matter which was not implemented in the Central Bank Act which implemented other recommendations of the commission. I always thought that it did not receive sufficient attention from the Government of the day.  The growing volume of public investment has rendered the recommendation of the Banking Commission more rather than less urgent.</P>
    <P>When this Bill came forward, it occurred to me that some sort of advisory body of that kind might be usefully constituted to supervise the operation of the Bill.  Parliament is handling over a large amount of money to be spent without direct responsibility and, therefore, there should be some sort of check on this large public expenditure.  In reading the speech of the Minister in the Dáil on the 10th February, column 95 of the Parliamentary debates, I see that there is a reference by the Minister to the National Development Committee.  It seems perhaps that the body for which I have been pleading has existed all the time, but so far as I know this is the first reference in a parliamentary debate to the existence of this body.</P>
    <P>The National Development Committee could be a body of very considerable importance in the country.  It is not, as far as I know, provided for in the Constitution or in any statute. Therefore, I would welcome some statement from the Minister in his reply to this debate as to precisely what is the composition of this National Development Committee to which he referred in the Dáil, for the first time, to my knowledge.</P>
    <P>What I suggest is that, where Parliament is giving to the Government powers of a discretionary nature in spending public money, there should be some machinery for combining the general principles laid down in the Bill with the requisite flexibility necessary for rapidly adjusting policy to changing circumstances.  There should be some compromise between the dilatory procedure of individual estimates, which may take months to go through the Dáil and quite arbitrary decisions taken by Ministers, possibly on the <Col N="400" /> advice of a committee of this kind which we have now heard about for the first time.  Such decisions may be dictated by purely political considerations and even if not dictated by purely political considerations, may be regarded by public opinion as being so dictated especially at times of approaching elections.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that some sort of machinery is necessary to combine consistency and flexibility, and that in introducing this Bill a very good opportunity has arisen for reconsidering the recommendations of the Banking Commission regarding the necessity for a national development council.  Those are the only observations I have to make on the Bill which I welcome in its general principles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not only necessary, but essential, though perhaps not quite in the form in which it is here.  Senator Johnston suggested that this Bill did not evoke much interest in this House but it appears to have evoked a great deal of interest on this side of the House.  It does not seem to have commended itself very strongly to members on the other side of the House and the reason for that is that the necessity for the introduction of this Bill is a complete confession and an acknowledgment by the Government of the entire failure of their economic and financial policy.</P>
      <P>This Bill is essential to relieve the serious unemployment which exists. This Bill, called the National Development Fund Bill, should be really called the &ldquo;Relief of Unemployment Bill&rdquo;. This Bill is brought in because of the serious state of unemployment which has been worsening every week since the Government attained power.  It is for that reason and for that reason only that this Bill is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view it is nonsense to talk about capital development works.  So far as I know capital development works have, in the main, been provided for from time to time by the Oireachtas. Each Minister concerned with capital development has put forward his requirements in Bills which were brought before the Dáil and the Seanad giving the Minister the necessary power to deal with capital <Col N="401" /> development works.  These schemes for developing poultry stations, artificial insemination stations and so on&mdash; is it not childish to expect us to believe that these are really in the nature of capital development works?  This Bill is brought in merely to relieve unemployment, serious unemployment which has been caused as a result of the policy of the Government.  If the Government had any decency they would have resigned months ago or they would have given this Bill its proper title.</P>
    <P>Following these few remarks some little interest may be shown from the other side of the House in regard to this Bill.  This Bill will have my support.  I am not deterred by the fact that it is a Money Bill from making recommendations, as I propose to do, later on.  It seems to be suggested here that because this Bill is a Money Bill the Seanad can do nothing about it.  We can make some recommendations which, it is hoped, will be given consideration elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would recommend that the Minister be given this £5,000,000 for only one year, for the year ending on 31st March next.  We could then review what the Minister had done with these moneys and if he satisfies us we can give him a further £5,000,000 for another year. The Minister should account every year for the manner in which he has expended the £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien referred on a number of occasions to the balance of payments and stated that the Minister had given some indication that the moneys to be expended might have to be considered in regard to the state of the balance of payments.  I do not know if there is anything in the Bill&mdash; I do not think there is any obligation on the Minister to have regard to any balance of payments.  Under the Bill, he may spend £5,000,000 per year.  I am afraid the balance of payments will have nothing whatever to do with the £5,000,000 to be or not to be expended. What may have something to do with it, as Senator O'Brien perhaps suggested when he was concluding his speech, is the balance of votes.  I am not suggesting that the Minister for <Col N="402" /> Finance would be concerned solely with the balance of votes, but he might decide, on the balance of votes, to allot the moneys in a particular way.  If I were right in thinking that that might occur, that is another reason why we should not give the Minister power for four years but only for one year.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give us in a little more detail particulars of the proposed development works.  He has referred to one or two schemes, but he has merely given us headings.  I have no clear idea as to how the money might be spent.  Would the Minister think that in cities like Galway, Cork, Limerick and Dublin he could or would allot moneys for, say, the construction of car parks to relieve very serious problems in those cities?  Such works would give a great deal of employment and would be of lasting service to the particular city.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us a considerable portion of the money is being allotted in regard to roads.  There are roads in other big towns throughout the country in a bad state of repair with which, apparently, the local authority will not for some reason deal.  Perhaps roads of that kind might be dealt with and moneys given to the local authority to enable them to repair these roads.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear about this Bill. I submit it is brought in, quite properly, to relieve the unemployment situation that has been caused.  The money, despite what some Senators have suggested, will be used in the main to relieve unemployment; otherwise there is no point in asking us to approve the Bill at all.  The unemployment situation is such that it must be relieved.</P>
    <P>As I say, we should not be asked to give the Minister the power to spend up to £5,000,000 per year for four years.  How do we know what he will do with this money?  He may think the purchase of another Tulyar would be a proper purpose for which to expend money, on the claim that such a purchase would be for national development. Subject to giving the Minister the power for one year, I fully approve of this Bill.</P>

      <P>It is, I understand, a common practice, when a person is suffering from anaemia, to give him a blood transfusion and, to a certain extent, that is what this Bill is.  This Bill is an indictment not alone of this Government, as Senator O'Reilly has suggested, but of all the Governments that have been in this country so far because the time has arrived when acknowledgment is made of the fact that underdevelopment has been allowed to exist for a long period of time.  This transfusion of £5,000,000 into the body economic is an overdue injection and it would be a very foolhardy person, no matter what Party he belonged to, who would object to such an injection.  Let us not be fooled into making political capital by holding the present Minister responsible.  All the Governments of this country, no matter who their Ministers for Finance were, were just as guilty as the present Government.  With regard to underdevelopment and unemployment, unless the State proceeded in certain circumstances in the matter of private enterprise, as has been suggested by Senator O'Brien, nobody would do it. Might I say here, as an aside, that private enterprise probably fails to do it for the reason that the majority of the people of this country who compose that peculiar thing known as &ldquo;private enterprise&rdquo; are people of small means.  The wealthy people of this country had no national outlook. They were not interested at all in national development.  Those who have grown up in private enterprise to-day are people who came from the soil.  I suggest that where this Government and previous Governments have failed is in their failure to champion national finance through national spending sources in the persons of those people who came up from the soil and who were under-capitalised because they came from the people themselves.  That failure is the cause of this Development Bill to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We created certain Government institutions here, one of which was the Industrial Credit Corporation which has now become, contrary to its original objective, a profit-earning corporation for the Government.  May be that is <Col N="404" /> desirable in its own way but it was not the original objective of that corporation that it should be profit earning. The original intention was that development schemes would be governed by private enterprise, behind the running of which would be men of integrity, of imagination and of knowledge, who would be financed through that Industrial Credit Corporation.  It has been obvious to many of us for many years past that the entire operations of that corporation are not directed upon those lines.  The Minister has now come before this House with this Bill and the inference of this remarks is that we must have some fusion of finance in the body politic.  In other words, he is refuting what the Minister for Finance stated two years ago and he is doing now what other political Parties have for years been asking this Government to do, that is, to admit that there has been underdevelopment in this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  Let us, however, not sail under any false colours in regard to it or claim glories in respect of it or say that the reason for this Bill is because a situation has now arisen which we did not foresee.  It should have been foreseen.  This country has been underdeveloped not since to-day or yesterday but for hundreds of years past.  I do not care what Government it may be, any Government which did not finance national development from its own resources is as guilty as the present Government of failure to implement a policy of national development.  Five million pounds is a welcome fusion into the purchasing power of the country but I suggest that that amount will not make any radical change.  I should prefer to see the greater portion of our external investments converted to the same purpose and, for that reason, I am not in entire agreement with what Senator P.F. O'Reilly said on this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien spoke about how the financing of this £5,000,000 would take place&mdash;whether it would be by way of loan or by way of taxation.  I am wondering why it should be either of these two ways.  We have Government funds under our own control&mdash;funds which are externally invested at the moment. <Col N="405" /> I suggest that those funds would be much better invested in our own country where there are plenty of opportunities for development whether in capital works or otherwise.  Whether or not the Minister agrees with me now, there was a time, in his early days, when he did not like to see financial spending under the complete control of a Government, as such.  It is rather a bad principle to find in this National Development Fund Bill this statement: &ldquo;The National Development Fund shall be under the control and management of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would reinforce the plea which Senator O'Brien made that what I might term a national economic council be formed for consultation about and implementation of all such schemes proposed by this and future Governments.  In fairness to the Minister himself and to anybody implementing this scheme, I think that that should be done.  No matter how justly the Minister may administer any proportion of the scheme, it is open to suspicion that there will be a political bias on any scheme which he fosters. If a certain road down in County Meath gets attention it will be said that that was probably because the Minister had a Deputy there who was a friend of his and who was able to put up a good case.  Senator O'Brien's suggestion should have been acted upon long ago by this and previous Governments.  I should like to see the Minister far removed from any atmosphere of suspicion in this matter. Senator O'Brien's suggestion is not new.  It was made by the Banking Commission he mentioned and it was made earlier than that by organisations of industrialists and Irish cooperative ventures.  The old I.D.A., in the early twenties, completely outlined that principle and the Federation of Irish Manufacturers asked on many occasions for the establishment of a National Economic Council.</P>
    <P>I would be in complete agreement with Senator McGuire in his desire to ensure that as far as possible investments of this nature should go through private enterprise rather than through what I might term Government-sponsored projects.  I am quite certain the Minister will agree that State <Col N="406" /> investment is not the best and most economic form of investments.  What is nobody's business is nobody's business. Moneys which belong to the State are spent by people in a manner in which they would not be spent if they belonged to those people themselves. How the Minister can divert any portion of this fund towards private enterprise projects is something I cannot say but I suggest exploring the avenues he has through the Industrial Credit Corporation and other similar institutions and that judgments in the granting of credits to proposed industries be based not entirely upon the profit motive.</P>
    <P>The original idea was that young men who went out and fought for this country and did their best for this country and who wished to partake in the industrialisation of this country in the early days would be given an opportunity through the Credit Corporation of going into the economic life of the country and taking their part in it.  That was not done generally.  If it were there would not be this necessity on the Minister now to ask for £5,000,000 for national development to-day.  I am not blaming this Minister in particular in this connection: I am blaming all our Governments for failure to implement in the best way they could the policy to which they espoused themselves of developing the country through private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will believe me when I say that I am not trying to make any political capital whatsoever out of this Bill.  As a matter of fact I welcome this Bill more than I have welcomed any Bill which has come before this House since I became a Senator, because it is the first time that I have heard the Minister say publicly that there are problems in this country which can be and which must be solved by our financing them, whether it be done through Government sources or through private enterprise. In effect that means that we may recover and invest in our own country some proportion of those external investments which could more properly be invested in our own country.</P>
    <P>Five million pounds are an extremely <Col N="407" /> small sum.  I should like to see the Minister go much further in this matter. I have perfect confidence that any Government, in the matter of the dispersal of such a fund for national development, would do it as good and honest men.  I have that faith in every, what I might term, politician in this country.  We should not say that any Minister would use it for political purposes.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that, to save himself and any successors he may have, from any such aspersion it would be advisable to take the advice of Senator O'Brien and create a national economic advisory council.</P>
    <P>I think that this Bill is too small, too insignificant, and that it will not make any great mark on the body politic.  However, in so far as it is a step on the right road, I welcome and support it.</P>

      <P>I rise to give my support to this Bill.  I regard it as a continuance of the policy of providing capital for national development, initiated by the inter-Party Government Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan.  I had not an opportunity of being present when the acting-Minister for Finance made his statement here to-day but looking up the Dáil reports I found no indication in the Minister's introductory speech there as to the manner in which this money is to be spent.  We know that when Deputy McGilligan produced the dual Budget, the capital Budget, the items of expenditure of a capital nature were definitely specified in the Book of Estimates&mdash;so much so, that members of the Oireachtas had an opportunity of discussing the matter and drawing the attention of the Minister and the Government to questions which they felt might be dealt with more fully or to certain matters or developments that might be left in abeyance while others were more in need of attention. We have not that opportunity here. My trouble to-day is to find out what is capital development, as the Minister understands it, or what is the capital development on which the £5,000,000 is to be expended annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from a rural area, I have my own ideas as to how quite a considerable <Col N="408" /> amount of the annual provision of £5,000,000 could be spent.  If I refer specifically to one county it is because I happen to be, naturally, more in touch with affairs there.  I believe that the details to which I wish to draw the attention of the House are common in every county of the TwentySix Counties.  I understand that part of this money can be spent on roads and I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and the Seanad to one class of roads that are sadly in need of very special attention&mdash;roads that accommodate the vast majority of the people in the rural areas and that have deteriorated very much during the past ten, 12 or 15 years because they had to carry traffic of a kind for which they were never intended: I mean the county roads.  Of these, we have in County Mayo 2,300 miles.  These roads were mainly intended for horse-drawn traffic, vehicles with iron-shod wheels.  They served that purpose very well.  The local bodies, by way of contracts, made ample provision for the repair and maintenance of these roads.  However, that is a thing of the past.  For the past ten or 12 years, and certainly for the past five or six years, these roads have been carrying very heavy traffic and trucks conveying ground limestone to areas in which the land rehabilitation scheme is being given effect to.  They are carrying travelling shops, vans, bulldozers and other vehicles of a kind for which the roads were never intended.  Those roads were never soled as the main roads are.  This year in County Mayo, to provide for a new contract&mdash;because the three year period expires, and we could not look forward to contractors taking these roads on, at anything like the price they took them three years ago&mdash;we have found it necessary to step up the expenditure on roads by 1/3 in the £.  That means that for these roads in County Mayo the rate-payers have to find £27,000 this year if they are to get contractors to take them on for the next triennial period. Even if they do, I do not see how these contractors, even at the higher price, can keep them in repair, if they still have to carry the traffic like they have had for the past three years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> The Government made a very serious effort to cut across that traffic, by putting an extra heavy tax on motor vehicles, but did not succeed. I hold that a very useful way in which some of this £5,000,000 could be spent would be in helping the local bodies to put these roads in a state of repair and to keep them that way, by providing the machinery which the contractors cannot provide.</P>
    <P>We have not been told&mdash;as some speakers have pointed out&mdash;how this annual contribution of £5,000,000 is to be provided&mdash;whether by taxation or borrowing.  I imagine it is not the intention of the Government to provide it by taxation, as the Taoiseach himself has said that taxation has reached the highest level and that the people cannot bear any more.  If it is to be met by borrowing, it would be interesting to us to know the rate at which it will borrowed.  Since this proposal was mooted, I know that the Chief Executive Officer in County Mayo has circularised different members of public bodies, asking them to put up proposals that could be met by grants from this fund.  Several proposals have come forward.  One is for the provision of a piped water supply for areas that so far have been deprived of that particular amenity.  I take it that, before any local body can avail of the financial benefits provided in this Bill, a local contribution will be necessary.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to come back to the question of roads, I wish to state that the local bodies are making a very liberal contribution at present, in order to secure a substantial slice of this annual amount of money provided for national development.  I trust that before the Bill becomes law we may have a clearer idea as to how this money is to be spent&mdash;whether it is the intention of the Government that it will be spent so as to increase production and thus enable the people to pay the interest on this money, if it is to be obtained by borrowing.  I certainly would not like to think that the only dividends the Government expect to get from the expenditure of this money are political dividends.  We would rather see economic dividends forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas referred to this fund as something new in Government procedure and procedure in the Oireachtas.  Surely he remembers the Transition Development Fund?  It was put forward by me in 1946 in order to meet the situation that existed at that time.  We were then shortly after the war and material for all sorts of development work was very hard to get.  We were anxious that local authorities should go ahead with housebuilding, that the E.S.B. should get ahead with the rural electrification schemes and that various Government or semi-State organisations like Bord na Móna should go ahead as rapidly as possible with national development.  In order to deal with the uncertainties of supply and the difficulty of pricing a job ahead of time in those days, we undertook to meet extraordinary costs relating to the period out of that fund, if these various authorities and organisations would go ahead.</P>
      <P>I am certain that the existence of that fund enabled us to get very rapidly into our stride after the war and indeed we were ahead of a number of other countries in the rapidity of our development.  Our housebuilding, notwithstanding the difficulties, jumped from very few houses per year to a considerable number, even by 1947; the rural electrification scheme got under way very rapidly; and other schemes also got under way with speed. When the Coalition Government came in in 1948, they paid me the best possible compliment, a few years in arrear, by continuing the fund and adding another £2,000,000 to it, although, by 1948, things had become as normal as they are likely to become for some years in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This National Development Fund has the same basic idea underlying it as the Transition Development Fund.  We want to take advantage of all possible opportunities to have capital development carried out, and we want to stimulate activity on capital development that might, perhaps, be postponed for a number of years in the absence of this fund.  I have given the Seanad, as I gave the Dáil, an indication of the type of works for which we are prepared to draw on the fund, <Col N="411" /> and I did not hear any Senators or members of the Dáil criticise any of the items in the list I gave here and in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston and Senator O'Brien were anxious about the general financial stability of the country and the effect of this fund upon financial stability.  I am quite prepared to agree that, when there is a heavy adverse trade balance, Governments should find the money for necessary works and for current expenditure other than by means of borrowing or any other system of raising money which would add to the volume of money circulating within the country. Back in 1947, we introduced a Supplementary Budget in order to take, through taxation, some of the excess purchasing power floating around, when we wanted to raise funds for certain expenditures.  That was not very popular with certain members who are now very enthusiastic for Government expenditure.  In 1952, the Minister for Finance introduced a Budget which had in it increased taxation, and he imposed that increased taxation in order that the Government might meet its current expenditure and promote capital development, without causing an inflation in the volume of money, an inflation which would have the result which Senator Johnston pointed out, of drawing on our past reserves.</P>
    <P>In the present situation, it is open to the Government to borrow and to spend this money, if there are projects available which will add to the national wealth.  We have those opportunities available and, at the same time, we have a number of unemployed in the country.  It was because our international balance of payments was reasonably right and because we had a number of unemployed in the country and opportunities for productive work, for productive schemes, that the Government reintroduced the principle of the Transition Development Fund and established this National Development Fund.  I think that if it is used properly it will help the general policy of development in which this Government has always been interested.  I do <Col N="412" /> not know where Senator O'Reilly got the idea that national development was started by Deputy McGilligan, ex-Minister for Finance.  Senator O'Reilly must have gone round a lot of election platforms recently to get that dinned into his ear.  There is no basis of truth in it.</P>
    <P>One of the members of his Party who talks mostly now about national development once said in the Dáil, when he was Minister responsible for housing, that they could not introduce any great housing drive until the price of materials and wages fell to a point where houses could be built and let at an economic rent.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the sensible people throughout the country.  Senator Johnston said that the principles upon which the Development Fund is based <Col N="413" /> are not without certain dangers.  The sum of £5,000,000 is, of course, a big one to an individual, but in relation to our national income and to our national expenditure at the moment it is not a very huge sum.  It amounts to approximately 3 per cent. of our total national expenditure and it is not 1 per cent. of our total national income.  In times like these I think it is not over-dangerous to give the Government which the people have entrusted with the authority to run the country a sum of money equivalent to less than 1 per cent. of the national income to meet extraordinary situations and to take advantage of opportunities for development that have not been foreseen and provided for ahead of time.</P>
      <P>In spite of the fact that we have a very good statistical service, and that the Revenue Commissioners and other Government Departments are very good at forecasting what is likely to happen a year ahead, it is impossible for human beings, in the present state of the world, to be 100 per cent. accurate in their forecasts.  We want to have the right to spend up to 3 per cent. more than the expenditure this year in order to meet a situation that exists both in the numbers of the unemployed and the opportunities for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire was very pessimistic about business in this part of the country.  Judging from the returns in respect of the turnover in business throughout the country the volume of business was greater than in any previous year.  I think Senator McGuire is making a case in public that he could not sustain in private. Take the bank debits, which are a fair indication of the turnover in business throughout the country, and you will find that in every month this year the daily average turnover is much greater than in any previous year.  Indeed, if you start off with January, 1953, and compare it with January, 1950, you will find that the average bank debits were £600,000 more in January, 1953, than they were in January, 1950.  It does not matter what month of the year you take.  Let us take June of 1953.  The figure was £6,070,000 as against £4,570,000 for June, 1950.  Take <Col N="414" /> June, 1951, which was the month in which the Coalition Government went out of office, the bank debits were £5,360,000 as against £6,070,000 last year.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily.  It happens in practice.  It is not one of the immutable laws of nature but it is one of the underlying practices of trade and industry.  I should like to say to Senator McGuire that the statistics of employment and unemployment show that there has been a decrease of about 9,000 people on the unemployment register at the labour exchanges. That has been going on now for quite a long time.  On the latest date for which we have returns, the 13th February, the registered unemployed were 9,300 fewer than they were in February of the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Johnston and Senator O'Brien, adverted to one aspect of national development, and that is the importance of private capital being used to the utmost extent to develop the national resources.  This National Development Fund or the £40,000,000 odd that the State is spending direct through State organisations and semi-State organisations is no substitute for the proper expenditure of private capital.  If the nation is to prosper, every possible opportunity should be <Col N="415" /> seized by people who have capital of their own or who can borrow to develop the business in which they are engaged.  It is of great importance that we should get agricultural production increased, that we should have greater production per acre, per person employed in agriculture.  The best fund that is available to the farmers is the amount of money that they have on deposit in the banks and it is well known that that is a sum of about £73,000,000 on which they are getting only 1½ per cent.  If they invested that £73,000,000 or even 50 per cent. or 25 per cent. of it in bringing their land to a state in which it would come somewhere near maximum production, undoubtedly agricultural output would increase enormously.</P>
    <P>The oportunity for increasing agricultural production exists, I am sure, on 95 per cent. of our farms.  If we could bring the farmers of Ireland as a whole up to the upper 5 per cent. we would double agricultural production, if we could bring the 90 per cent. up to the upper 10 per cent. we would probably add 50 per cent.  The opportunity is there for the increase and the knowledge of what is to be done is fairly widespread.  If a farmer does not know exactly how to treat his land all he has to do is to call in his agricultural adviser.  He can have his land tested and he can be told exactly or within a fair measure of exactness how much of the essential elements such as lime, phosphate, potash, and so on, he should add to his soil in order to put it into a state to obtain the maximum production with proper seeding and cultivation.</P>
    <P>The Government has made provision, is so far as the Government can, to help those who are not in a position to help themselves in this matter.  The banks have promised the Government that they will do their utmost to give credit to creditworthy merchants and farmers to enable an increase of artificial fertilisers and lime to be put on the soil.  So that there would be nobody left out, the Government, through the Department of Agriculture, is making loans available for the same purpose. If the farmers of Ireland were only to <Col N="416" /> take 25 per cent. of the money that they have on deposit in the banks and put it into their soil where it is particularly needed it would do one hundredfold more in the immediate future for the increase of the national wealth than we can do by means of this £5,000,000.  The farmers have the opportunity of applying these essential elements to their tillage crops but they could apply them at once to their grass crops and if they cannot do it before they get the other crops in, they can apply them throughout the year.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien spoke about a national investment council and Senator O'Donnell spoke of a national economic advisory council.  In the present state of the world there is one national development council which can work.  Wherever responsibility of that kind is placed there should also reside the power to deal with the situation.  I cannot see either the people or the Government setting up a national development council, giving it very large sums of money&mdash;anything like the sums of money that the Dáil votes and passes for the Government &mdash;and giving them <i>carte blanche</i> as to how the money should be spent.  When a Government proposes an expenditure that proposal is reviewed very carefully and very critically in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Take the amount of money that the Government is spending, apart from this National Development Fund, on capital development works this year&mdash;a sum of nearly £40,000,000.  What five or ten men could we get whom the people would trust to spend that money without a close day-to-day supervision and criticism? It could not be done.</P>

      <P>The Government have not only one national development council in the sense which Senator O'Donnell now defines it: they have dozens of such councils.  Every board of a semi-state organisation is such an <Col N="417" /> advisory body.  The Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry and Commerce and other Departments give advice to the Government as to how money should be spent and how much should be spent and, in the final analysis, the Government is the national development authority or the national development investment council which Senator O'Brien advocated. In present circumstances, I can see no other body to do the work.  If the investment programme of the country is not great enough the Deputies or Senators can criticise the Government and if they have suggestions to put up, can put forward such suggestions.</P>
      <P>There has been a suggestion that this Bill should only be given for one year.  Actually, what the Bill asks is that each year the Government should have the right to approach the Dáil for a sum not exceeding £5,000,000. This Bill is giving no money to the Government.  It is giving the Government the right to go to the Dáil and ask for an Estimate of £5,000,000, to be spent in this way.  Last December, the Dáil passed a Supplementary Estimate, in anticipation of the passage of this Bill, for £5,000,000. If the Government want to spend an extra £5,000,000 next year, the Dáil will have to be asked for the money.  It will be seen, therefore, that, in fact, there is no basis for the suggestion that the Seanad, by voting this Bill, is voting a sum of £20,000,000.  It is doing nothing of the sort.  The Dáil will have to vote the £5,000,000 each financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnston said that 350,000 persons are employed on farms under 50 acres and that if we could get production going on those farms we would be doing a lot more for permanent production than we can do under this Bill.  Quite a lot can be done by the farmers, as I have said, but quite a lot can be done, too, to help both those farmers and the other producers in the nation by means of a fund of this kind.  I am certain that, for a great number of years and perhaps for centuries, the work which is being started now under this fund will bear good fruit.  In the list of projects I have read out, there are <Col N="418" /> several that have been mentioned and frequently proposed in public debate and in private conversations throughout the country.  I think that a lot of the projects upon which this money is being spent are very long overdue. A number of people particularly interested in some of them would say that they are very much overdue. Take, for instance, the development of fish hatcheries.</P>
    <P>I think no one will contest the fact that if we had good fish hatcheries throughout the country, making available the young fish for our rivers and lakes, we could improve the fish population in these waters very considerably within a few years.  The progeny testing for pigs and sheep&mdash; on which, under this measure, we propose to spend £88,000&mdash;is, many people would say, long overdue.  If we are to keep pigs and sheep, it is necessary we should have the best breeds, the breeds that will give us the best production of meat or the best production of wool for the least food.</P>
    <P>I need not say anything about the special veterinary research proposals. That research is already well known throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The production of foundation stocks of seed is a problem regarding which several efforts have been made already. There are some of our highly specialised institutions producing seeds. There is the Glasnevin Agricultural College, which is doing extremely valuable work in producing foundation stocks.  What is necessary is to have those foundation stocks multiplied under careful control so that they will be available to most of the progressive farmers throughout the country.  They then can grow good crops of oats, wheat or barley and distribute some of the seed to their neighbours.  For that particular project we have here a sum of £150,000.</P>
    <P>Before the war we had a Pedigree Seed Merchants' Association which was composed of a number of merchants and some co-operative organisations.  They bought the foundation stocks from Glasnevin, had them grown by farmers under supervision and then sold the seed crop widely throughout the country.  Having good <Col N="419" /> seed makes all the difference in the world.  You may have excellent land, well manured and well cultivated, but if the seed is not of good quality the results may be negligible.  What we want is not only good land in good heart but good seed and good cultivation. Unfortunately, in 1948 the pedigree seed merchants' scheme was thrown out the window and there was nothing substituted for it.  We lost three or four years in promoting good seed for these cereal crops&mdash;we lost the years between 1948 and 1951.</P>
    <P>I need not talk about beet, as the Irish Sugar Company is engaged in intensive research on that matter. They produce their own seed under their own control.  However, you have potatoes and turnips and mangolds and flax and grass.  We are very far behind in the grass that exists throughout the country on the vast majority of our farms.  It is ridiculous that in the present stage good ground should be encumbered with the poor, weed-like vegetation that covers a great part of our farms.  It is impossible to develop good grass seeds without the foundation stocks, which should be provided by research institutions.  Glasnevin has done extremely good work also in grass.  These foundation stocks should be developed in larger quantity and then distributed under supervision throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The next project is that of cattle progeny testing.  There again the scheme is one that a lot of people would say is overdue.  From time to time we have certain controversies in the country as to what is the best breed of cattle; but whatever the breed or breeds there is no reason why we should not have the best of their kind. The only way to discover what is the best Shorthorn strain or the best Hereford or Friesian strain or Ayrshire, is by having the cattle tested.  We should not only see how much milk they give and what weight they put on in a certain period but we should also see what it is costing the farmer in food units to produce the gallon of milk or the pound of beef on the back.</P>
    <P>The next case is that of artificial insemination stations for north-west <Col N="420" /> counties.  Throughout the dairying districts in the South and in the East you have the artificial insemination stations open now for a year or two. It is proposed under this to build further stations which would cover from Sligo to Mayo and Donegal and that general region.</P>
    <P>The next and last item on the agricultural side is the control station for eggs and poultry, £100,000.  If we are to have an export trade in eggs and poultry, we must produce and pack both in the best possible way so as to get the best possible price.  The price will be improved to the farmer if, instead of producing poor eggs and packing them badly, the eggs are well produced, clean and safely packed so as to obtain the highest possible price on the foreign market and so that the best price will trickle back to the farmer.</P>
    <P>I now come to the other schemes that Senator Summerfield spoke about. Regarding the improvement of Dublin harbour, he pointed out that this fund was given only 60 per cent. of the total cost of the harbour improvements in Dublin.  The same thing exists in regard to the Cork harbour works for which £550,000 is being provided out of this fund.  There is a small scheme for road development works for the E.S.B. hand-won turf power stations.  As Senators know, it was decided last year to go ahead with four power stations, using hand-won turf, along the western counties.  It will be necessary to improve the roads in the regions of the power stations so that the turf can be transported safely and as cheaply as possible.  The sum of £200,000 is being set aside out of this fund, to improve the roads in the regions which will deliver the turf to the power stations.</P>
    <P>There is a small sum of £20,000 for the bridge over the railway connecting Limerick to the cement factory.  This is a thing that is desirable.  It is required to link up the railway with the cement factory and to have a bridge over the railway so that the traffic on the main Limerick-southern road will not be held up.  For that a sum of £20,000 is being made available. The linking of the cement works with the railway will have a very desirable <Col N="421" /> effect on the price of cement and the putting of a bridge over the railway will enable the traffic to flow as freely as usual on that road.</P>

      <P>As the Senator is aware, already out of this particular fund a sum of £250,000 has been made available to Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng.  That, of course, is in addition to the £400,000 which is being spent for the tourist road development in the Gaeltacht, under the scheme announced last year.  It is being done by the Minister for Local Government.  It is in addition to the £200,000 that is being spent by Gaeltacht Services.  This £250,000 is at the disposal of the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng.  So far he has authorised the expenditure of about £50,000.  There are two schemes in it that I remember.  One is for harbour works in Inis Meadhon and another for Inis Thiar in the Aran Islands.  The rest approved to date is for roads which serve the Fíor-Ghaeltacht districts.  The Parliamentary Secretary is not only responsible for making recommendations for expenditure out of this fund but also for recommendations to Government Departments generally as to how they can help.  It was as a result of his activities and recommendations that the sum of £400,000 a year for a number of years&mdash; I forget how many&mdash;is to be issued for tourist roads in the Gaeltacht regions. The Parliamentary Secretary will have the right to recommend expenditure out of this fund up to £250,000 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting-Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended to replace the Emergency Powers (No. 157) Order, 1942, and amending Orders.  These Orders derive their present authority from the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, as extended.  It is Government policy not to continue to rely on emergency statutes where it is appropriate to have permanent legislation.  The present Bill implements this policy in connection with State guarantees.  The Emergency Powers Order mentioned authorised the guarantees of payment with interest of borrowings by certain State sponsored bodies, mainly those set up during the emergency to further the maintenance of essential supplies.</P>
      <P>The bodies whose borrowings are so guaranteed at present are: Fuel Importers (Eire), Limited; Grain Importers (Éire), Limited; Tea Importers, Limited; Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, and the Irish Potato Marketing Company, Limited.  A limit to the amount which may be guaranteed in each case is specified by these Orders, which require also that a statement be submitted to the Dáil every year containing particulars of guarantees actually given and showing the State's contingent liability for principal as at the 1st April and the amount, if any, paid by the State in fulfilment of a guarantee.</P>
      <P>It is desirable to retain permanently the power to give guarantees of this kind, so that central importing and distributing agencies and other concerns functioning under State auspices may be facilitated in obtaining the financial accommodation necessary for their activities.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Great Northern Railway Board, the bodies listed in the Schedule to the Bill are those whose borrowings are at present guaranteed under the Emergency Powers (No. 157) Order, as amended, and the maxima specified are those provided for by the Orders, save as regards Fuel Importers (Eire) Ltd. where the maximum is being reduced from £6,000,000 to £4,000,000 which in present circumstances is considered to be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing guarantees&mdash;within the Schedule&mdash;are continued in force by Section 2 (2) of the Bill.  The Dáil <Col N="427" /> agreed at the Report Stage of this Bill to substitute &ldquo;Great Northern Railways Board&rdquo; for &ldquo;Great Northern Railway Company&rdquo;, an amendment consequential on the enactment of the Great Northern Railway Act, 1953; it was necessary to ensure that the power to guarantee the company's borrowings should now relate to the borrowings of the board.  No guarantee is at present operative in the case of the board.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Section 9 for amending the Schedule by deleting a body or adding a new one or by altering the maximum amount of the guarantee in any case.  Amendment will be by Government Order but, before any Order is made adding a new body to the Schedule or increasing the maximum amount of a guarantee, such Order must have been approved in draft by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As is shown by the latest return presented to the Dáil and Seanad, the guarantees in force at the 31st March, 1953, covered borrowings up to a total of £18,650,000.  The State's contingent liability for principal amounted, in fact, to much less, namely, £10,096,455.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill differ from those of the basic Emergency Powers Order in three important respects. First, under the 1942 Order any State payment under a guarantee would be from voted moneys.  In this permanent legislation, it is considered preferable to provide for the fulfilment of a guarantee by an advance from the Central Fund, subject to recoupment to the Central Fund from voted moneys of any amount not repaid within 12 months.</P>
    <P>Second, Section 9, as I have said, provides that an Order adding a new body to the Schedule or increasing the maximum amount that may be guaranteed in the case of a scheduled body cannot be made until a draft of the Order has been approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  A guarantee Order can be made under the existing law without prior reference to the Dáil or Seanad and is effective forthwith but&mdash;like all Orders made under the Supply and Services <Col N="428" /> (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946&mdash;it has to be presented to each House, either of which may, by resolution, annul it.  The new procedure is that appropriate to normal, as distinct from emergency, conditions and is more in keeping with proper parliamentary procedure and control.</P>
    <P>The third way in which it differs is this.  Section 8 requires for the first time that bodies availing of State guarantees must furnish an abstract of their accounts, together with the auditor's report thereon, to the Minister for Finance, who will present them to each House of the Oireachtas. This will ensure that full information will be available about the financial operations of bodies whose borrowings are guaranteed by the State.</P>
    <P>The relevant emergency powers Orders will be revoked as from the date on which the Bill comes into operation, which date will be fixed by Order under Section 11 (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision is made in this Bill for further issues from the Local Loans Fund in respect of local loans. The existing statutory limit on aggregate issues, as fixed by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1953, is £70,000,000.  The Bill extends this limit to £90,000,000.</P>
      <P>Since the fund was established on 1st May, 1935, issues from it have amounted to approximately £57,500,000, of which £47,500,000 was for housing loans, £6,500,000 for public health loans and over £780,000 for temporary advances to the Dublin Corporation under the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1945, in connection with the redemption of stock, over £1,000,000 for vocational education loans and approximately £1,500,000 for loans for other services.</P>
      <P>Loans sanctioned from the fund, including a carry-over from before 1st May, 1935, have amounted to approximately £68,500,000.  While loans are normally sanctioned in full, they are issued in instalments as required by the borrowing authority, a fact which accounts for the difference between the figures for sanctions and for issues.</P>
      <P>As the total commitments of the fund will shortly reach the present limit of £70,000,000, the extension proposed in the present Bill is necessary. The additional margin of £20,000,000 should suffice to cover commitments for at least two years at the present rate of issue.</P>

Níl ach an t-aon Choinbhinsiún consalachta déanta againn go fóill&mdash;an ceann leis na Stáit Aontaithe, a síníodh an lú Bealtaine, 1950.  Is é an gar-chuspóir atá leis an mBille cumhacht a thabhairt don Rialtas a chomhairlíú don Uachtarán an Coínbhínsíún sin a dhaíngniú. Tá sé daingnithe cheana féin ag Uachtarán na Stát Aontaithe.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ós cuid de dhlí na hÉireann an dlí eadarnáisiúnta, do réir Airteagail 29 den Bhunreacht, measfaí, b'fhéidir, nár ghá Bille mar é seo de bhrí go n-aithneofaí saoirsí agus pribhléidí oifigeach consalachta ar aon nós.  Ní foláir, ámhthach, a thuiscint nach ionann oifigigh chonsalachta agus oifigigh taidhleoireachta agus go raibh difríocht tábhachtach riamh idir an dá dhream faoin dlí agus faoin ngnás eadarnáisiúnta.  Ionadaí do stát ceannasach, <Col N="431" /> a creidiúnaíodh chun stáit cheannasaigh eile, is ea toscaire taidhleoireachta, is cuma é a bheith ina ionadaí do rí nó d'impire nó do phoblacht.  Le fada riamh tugtaí urraim ar leith don toscaire nó don ambasadóir, sa cháil sin dó, agus is é do-sháraitheacht a phearsan is bonn do na saoirsí agus na pribhléidí eile go léir atá aige.  Tá na saoirsí agus na pribhléidí sin bunaithe go maith sa dlí eadarnáisiúnta.  Is é an príomhcheann acu eis-tíriúlacht na hambasáide nó na léagáideachta ina gcónaíonn an t-ambasadóir nó an t-aire.  Do réir teoiríce an dlí meastar gur geall le cuid dá chríocha dúchais teach cónaithe an toscaire agus nach mbaineann dlithe an stáit seo againne leis.</P>
    <P>Luas an méid sin d'fhonn é a dhéanamh soiléir nach ngabhann aon cháilíocht acu sin leis an oifigeach consalachta.  Níl an t-oifigeach consalachta ina ionadaí creidiúnaithe ó rialtas ceannasach chun rialtais cheannassaigh eile.  Is chuige a ceaptar é chun náisiúnaigh a stáit féin a chosaint in áit áirithe agus is chun údarás áitiúla na háite áirithe sin a creídiúnaítear é. Bíonn coimisiún ceapacháin aige, ar ndóigh, agus is gnáthach, nuair a bhíonn rialtas na tíre a bhfuil sé lena fheidhmeanna a chomhlíonadh ann tar éis glacadh lena cheapadh, go dtugtar exequatur dó, ach ní thugann sin eis-tíriúlacht dó.  Níl consal saor ón dlínse áitiúil.  Tá a bheag nó a mhór d'aimhreas sa dlí eadarnáisiúnta i dtaobh na saoirsí is cóir a bheith ag consal de bhuaidh a oifige.

      <P>It is rather strange that the Minister should tell us about this Bill in our native language and that in the National Development Bill he would use a foreign language.  Perhaps he has a good reason for that and will let us know the reason later on.  I do not approve of the giving of diplomatic immunity to those of consular status as provided for in this Bill.  Certain representatives of other countries have diplomatic immunity and diplomatic privileges which have come possibly from years and years of tradition. Actually, in the cases of persons who enjoyed diplomatic privilege it is an offence, in our law at any rate, for any person here to make any effort to prosecute them, or to make them amenable to the civil law.  I do not know why we should endeavour to pass on that immunity or privilege to a consular official.  The case apparently made by the Minister is that the head of another country has approved a like privilege for our consular officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, I oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  This Bill creates a new class or perhaps extends a class that already exists.  It seeks to extend a privileged class, persons enjoying ambassadorial or equivalent rank in this State.  They are thereby exempt in all cases from the laws of the country to which they are attached, so that should any offence be <Col N="433" /> committed by any person holding such rank that person could not be proceeded against in the country to which he is attached.  This Bill seeks to confer that privilege on a lower rank, on a consul, a member of the consular rank.  This Bill seeks to give such a person in this country very great privilege. I do not see any reason why the privilege enjoyed by a Minister or ambassador should be extended to cover the consul.</P>
      <P>So far as I know, the law at present here does not give any privilege whatever to a person holding merely the rank of counsul unless he, at the same time, holds the rank of ambassador or equivalent rank.  Why is it necessary to give privilege such as this to a consul, to a member of the consular staff, or, as the Bill provides, a consular employee?  It may be said that we should give these privileges to consuls here because our consuls in other countries would have the same privileges.  In my view, that is no answer.  Our consuls surely do not want all the privileges that this Bill seeks to confer on consuls here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some privileges which I would readily concede.  I refer to Section 3, which enables grants of probate and administration to be made to consuls.  I see no objection, either, to Section 4.  Section 5 in my view is quite in order.  Section 6 provides that a legal process may not be given effect to where it necessitates the entry into a consul's house.  In such a case one could not recover from a consul money which by virtue of Section 7 (4) he had made himself liable to pay.  Under Section 6 a person may not enter a consul's house to execute a legal process unless consent is given.  Consent may be withheld and the legal process cannot be proceeded with and a consul might thereby successfully refuse to pay a creditor.  It will be remembered that by virtue of Section 7 (4) a consular officer may not be exempted from civil liability arising out of a contract concluded by him in which he did not expressly contract as agent.  Therefore, a consul may enter into a contract to render himself personally liable.  The other party to the contract <Col N="434" /> may succeed in obtaining judgment against him for a sum of money under that contract, but when he seeks to have effect given to his judgment, he will find that the sheriff cannot enter into possession of the consul's goods with a view to recovering the money, because of Section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (1) and (2) provides that a consular officer or consular employee shall not be liable in any proceedings, civil or criminal, in respect of acts per formed by him in his official capacity. At the moment, if a consul driving a motor car in the course of his duties happens to run down a person here and as a result of his negligence that person is injured and subsequently obtains judgment for damages, the injured person may recover those damages.  But by virtue of these two sub-sections of Section 7, when this new privilege has been conferred on consuls, it will be impossible to recover the amount of such a judgment.  It may be said that the foreign country concerned will surely raise no difficulty in a case of that kind.</P>
    <P>I know of two cases which raised difficulties.  In one case a minister's car knocked down a lady and seriously injured her.  When she endeavoured to recover damages for negligence the Minister not merely pleaded his diplomatic immunity but warned his insurance company&mdash;who were quite prepared to settle the lady's claim&mdash;that under no circumstances would he allow them to settle the claim.  Despite the Road Traffic Act, under which motor drivers are insured, the lady was unable to proceed with her claim until the Minister concerned left this country. It was only then that the diplomatic immunity or privilege was lifted against the insurance company; he having left the country it no longer applied to the insurance company and they settled the lady's claim.</P>
    <P>In another case the Minister did not go so far as to plead his diplomatic immunity.  His motor car had caused damage to an animal.  He indicated to the owner that it was not his fault but that in any event he was going to plead his diplomatic immunity if any proceedings were to be taken against him.  Of <Col N="435" /> course, no proceedings could be taken against the Minister because of the diplomatic privilege a Minister enjoys. Incidentally, a citizen would be committing an offence in taking proceedings against a person who had diplomatic privilege.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to extend to consuls the same law that enables Ministers of foreign states to escape legal liabilities. It may be said that these things occur only occasionally, but we should not pass laws to enable them to occur at all.  In my view, there is no reason for extending to consuls the privileges that are enjoyed by Ministers.  If I had my way, I would not give Ministers any privilege at all.  I would treat them as I would expect our Ministers to be treated in the countries to which they are accredited.  I would not expect any privilege or immunity for our Ministers.  I would expect that they be treated in the same manner as a citizen of the country to which they are accredited.</P>
    <P>There are some things in the Bill which have my approval, there are a number of things which meet with my strong disapproval; and I think we should not give a Second Reading to it as it stands at present.</P>

      <P>I regret that I did not hear the beginning of Senator O'Reilly's speech.  I disagree with him in what he said towards the end of his speech.  It is of the greatest importance that we should encourage foreign representatives and should give them the widest possible facilities and even privileges in this country.  One of the pleasantest features of our life in Dublin to-day, in contrast with life in Dublin 20 or 30 years ago, is the wealth of foreign residents we have&mdash; some of them officially accredited and others camp followers, so to speak&mdash; who give our city the air of a metropolis and a European capital.  The more we can bring it home to ourselves and to Europe that we are a European capital the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we do not often have an opportunity of discussing matters in connection with external affairs I crave your indulgence, Sir, and that of the Minister, in raising a small matter which <Col N="436" /> is not directly mentioned in the Bill. It will not take long and it is not a controversial point.  Recently, I had occasion to look into the facilities for travel in Greece and I found that, while we have an excellent honorary Greek consul in this city, he has not the power of granting visas.  When I took the matter up with the Consulate-General of Greece in London, I found that whereas British citizens, Danish citizens, and Turkish citizens, can travel in Greece without a visa, Irish citizens have not got that privilege.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister&mdash;he will forgive me for a certain irrelevancy, but it is not, as he sees, a controversial matter&mdash;if he would look into the possibilities of extending our diplomatic relationship with Greece and, in particular, of having the necessity for visas abolished for Irish citizens.  It costs an Irishman £1 1s. 6d. usually whenever he wants to go to Greece and it does not cost that sum to any of the citizens of the countries I have mentioned.  Further, I find in the latest Council of Europe news that the Netherlands have just concluded bilateral negotiations with Greece and Turkey respectively on the subject of the abolition of visas and now Netherlands citizens no longer need them.  I urge the Minister, when he finds time for a small matter of this kind, to look into it for us.</P>
    <P>I should like to add in conclusion, since I am an admirer of Greece both by inclination and profession, that when I did ultimately apply to the Consul-General in London for a visa, he returned my cheque for £1 1s. 6d. and hoped I would have a pleasant holiday.  I would recommend that to our Minister, too.  He can hardly imagine how much it warms the heart of a visitor in a case of that kind to get an initial gesture of hospitality and friendship in a small matter.  If he ever has an opportunity of doing the same for Greek citizens coming to Ireland, I hope he will do so.</P>

      <P>It is rather amusing to think that a cheque from Senator Stanford was &ldquo;bumped&rdquo; by a Greek Minister, of all people.  We get many <Col N="437" /> bumps ourselves, but never bumps of that nature.  I am aware of a certain accident which occurred recently in which a young lady was rather badly injured and I understand that she was told that the person causing the accident, claimed diplomatic immunity.  I myself was the victim of another accident, the gentleman concerned telling me that he was a member of a consulate. I was never able to trace him and possibly I was dealing with somebody who had told me a lie.  If we are according to Ministers here the same privileges as they accord to our Ministers elsewhere, I wonder could there be some inter-State agreement whereby, if a Minister of a foreign country here causes injury to a citizen, our State would take on the liability and recover in some fashion from that Minister's State.  There should be some balancing up, because it is unfortunate that, if a citizen is run down by a Minister, that citizen has not got some redress because of a tradition in diplomatic appointments.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is wrong if such is the case, and some method of providing for damages of that nature might be established so as to avoid the sort of thing we have been told about and which I had already heard had happened in another case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an occasion on which many of us would like to say something about the diplomatic corps in this country.  I agree with Senator Stanford that, since the establishment of a diplomatic corps in Dublin and in Ireland generally, we have had all sorts of benefits from the appearance of these people in our midst.  We have had political and cultural benefits, as well as benefits to our social life, and not the least of these is the contribution they make to the cultural life of the country.  They have shown themselves to be very interested in the arts, in our history, our historical buildings and our historical life and I think the contribution they have made under these headings far outweighs any material disadvantages &mdash;and I think they are very small&mdash; which may arise by reason of occasional accidents and injuries to our citizens.  The terrific amount of good <Col N="438" /> they have done brings the scales down heavily on one side as compared with the few small accidents which have happened in which citizens have suffered.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly has a good point when he says that, if a citizen is seriously hurt and perhaps maimed and undergoes not only bodily but financial suffering, it is only right that something should be done to compensate him.  I feel it is our duty as a State to do something about it.  I cannot see why the Department of External Affairs cannot take out an ordinary insurance policy against accidents under these headings which would satisfy all parties.  Even on an insurance basis I think an actuary would find that, considering the number of years for which we have had diplomats and the number of diplomats and the number of accidents which have occurred involving compensation, or which would have involved compensation, the premium would be very low and I suggest that, if the Department took out such a policy, it would be a way out.</P>

      <P>When I heard Senator O'Reilly's opening remarks, I thought he was going to enter into the competition to slander the diplomatic corps.  The situation is that we get reciprocity.  Diplomats here have certain privileges and immunities according to international law which we recognise in our Constitution.  These immunities and privileges cannot be denied to them unless we change the Constitution or change international law.  However, in modern times the diplomatic corps in various countries have to conform to local traditions and they do it by and large.  According to international law we could not compel a diplomat here to insure his car but the fact is they do.  I do not know when the case arose in the dim and distant past where some diplomat is alleged to have pleaded his immunity in an accident case.  No such plea ever arose about a car in my time.  The diplomatic corps have agreed, as a whole, to have their cars insured here and not to plead their diplomatic immunity or privileges in a case in which somebody is injured by their car.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Reilly seems to have the intention of leading a revolt in Fine Gael.  More power to his elbow.  I hope he will not succeed, however, in carrying the day in this particular field.  This Bill proposes to grant to consuls certain immunities which we promised the American Government we would grant to American consuls here and the immunities are indicated in the agreement which we signed in 1950 with the Americans.  A consul can only be given the privileges provided for in the Bill on the fulfilment of two conditions: one is that the country from which he comes grants similar privileges to Irish consuls in their country; and the second is that he must be fulfilling his consular duties if he is to get these particular privileges.  The privileges only cover him when he is carrying out consular duties.  In the case of a diplomatic representative his personal immunities cover him at all times when he is within the country whether or not he could be held to be engaged in diplomatic work.

    <P>Senator Stanford raised the matter of the necessity of obtaining a visa to go to Greece.  We have a number of agreements with various countries in which both sides agree that visas would not be necessary.  If we allowed <Col N="440" /> Greeks to come here without a visa we would only do so on the undertaking by the Greek Government that they would allow Irishmen to travel there without a visa.  However, the case can be examined.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced last August that with a view to encouraging building I intended to introduce legislation which would extend rate remission to a large variety of buildings not at present benefiting by it.  This Bill implements that promise.</P>
      <P>It will extend rate remission to such buildings as shops, business offices, hotels, and factories, if they are built or improved within the prescribed period of three years from 27th July last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remission will last for seven years and will be to the extent of two-thirds of the rates on the valuation of new buildings or the increase in the valuation of existing buildings that are enlarged or improved.  This means that if a new building is valued at £90 it will, if it qualifies under the Bill, be assessed to rates on only £30 for seven years.  If an existing building is improved and the valuation goes up <Col N="441" /> from, say, £60 to £90 the building will be rated on £70 for seven years.  I should mention here that when the valuation of an existing building which has been improved goes up the increase may be due in part to the improvements, in part to earlier improvements which have escaped notice, and in part to the fact that the old valuation was completely out of date.  The remission under this Bill will be given on two-thirds of the total increase in the valuation following improvements irrespective of the cause of the increase.</P>
    <P>Because of the large variety of buildings which are already entitled to rate remission or other assistance from public funds it is necessary to make a number of exceptions to the rate remission provisions of the Bill.  These exceptions are set out in Section 3.  Cottages or houses erected by local authorities under the Labourers Acts or the Housing of the Working Classes Acts will not get rate remission under this Bill as they are already subsidised out of rates and State funds.  Where, however, a cottage or house has been sold by a local authority the occupier will receive remission under the Bill in respect of any enlargement or improvement carried out by him without assistance under the Housing Acts or the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts.  The Housing Acts and the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts have their own provisions for rate remission and consequently building work carried out with the aid of grants or rate remission under those Acts, including houses erected or reconstructed by private persons and public utility societies, will not be entitled to remission under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Other exceptions are new or improved farm buildings, which get the benefit of seven years' deferment of valuation under the 1852 Valuation Act, and buildings which get remission of rates under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  Finally, the remission will not apply where work of a trivial nature of alteration, extension, repair or renewal is carried out on an existing building.  The commissioner of valuation will be empowered to decide whether the work is of a trivial nature and there is provision for appeal against his decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> Under Part III of the Bill I propose to deal with the situation which has arisen in Buncrana as a result of the increase in valuation from £7,563 at 1st March, 1950, to £11,445 at 1st March, 1951, which followed on the urban council's request for a revision of all rateable hereditaments in the urban district.  This increase caused a large increase in the amount of the county demand on Buncrana which is calculated according to valuation. Part III of the Bill and the Schedule will bring the valuation of the urban district for county demand purposes back to what it is estimated it would have been if no general revision had occurred and only normal increases had taken place.  In the year 1963-64 the county demand will be based on £11,520; from then on the ordinary basis of calculation will apply.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill is necessary to provide that rate remission under the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Acts, 1940-1952, which expired on 31st March, 1953, will be given in cases where work was commenced on dwelling-houses coming within the scope of the Acts before 27th July, 1953, and completed before 31st March next. If the work was commenced on or after the 27th July, 1953, and completed within the prescribed period, the rate remission granted under Part II of the Bill will apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the principle of this Bill is acceptable to all sides of the House and any points that arise would arise on the Committee Stage. I would be glad if the Minister, when he is replying, would explain the reasons why there is objection to postponing the increase in rates for a certain number of years and provision made instead for a remission.  It would be very much more advantageous, more attractive and less complicated in many cases if you simply provided that only one-third of whatever increase the commissioner of valuation would fix would come into effect for a period of years.  I do not know all the details, but I know that certain people feel that a number of other matters might have been provided for, such as the cost of licences. <Col N="443" /> I suppose the E.S.B. charge will not arise now because of the change of system and I understand there are also certain elements of local government which would be affected by a change. I do not know very much about this particular matter.  I have been asked by several people if the Minister could not deal with it in the way I have suggested. I am simply asking him, when he is replying, to give the reasons why the method adopted is a remission of rates rather than a postponement of a full increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcCrea" hpid="Mr. McCrea Mr. McCrea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCrea</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Senator Douglas, welcome the Bill, but the Minister made one statement during his remarks which, to my mind, would make the Bill valueless.  He suggested that where houses have not been revalued for a great number of years the remission of rates would not apply. In every case where people have appealed against increased valuations that has been the defence put up by the valuation commissioner, that the premises had not been revalued for a great number of years.</P>
      <P>Another point on which I disagree is that it only goes back to July, 1953. It must be known to the Minister and to the Government that when the Tourist Board was established many hoteliers throughout the country had to carry out extensive alterations and enlargements if they were to carry on business.  In every case that I know the valuations were doubled.  I think the Minister should have taken that into consideration but we may move some amendments to this Bill before it goes through.</P>

The Associated Chambers of Commerce, and similar bodies, have for years been urging on this Government and its predecessor that a Bill of this kind should be introduced.

      <P>I agree with Senator McCrea that the concessions in the Bill do not go sufficiently far back. Very recently, the E.S.B. varied their system of fixing the overhead charge. The valuation figure has now been substituted by the number of rooms lighted by electricity.  Therefore, any concession people might secure as a result of this Bill goes by the board as a result of the new E.S.B. regulations.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not go sufficiently far back to give relief to the people who deserve it and who are entitled to get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear about one point: the Minister said something on it.  I take it that I am right in believing that ordinary residences do not come within the scope of this Bill.  That is so, Mr. Minister, I take it?  In that case, it amounts to this, from my point of view.  If this means that certain buildings will get a remission of rates and that the kind of building I am primarily interested in, that is, an ordinary residence, cannot get remission of rates for improvements or extensions it amounts to the fact that we who are primarily interested in ordinary residences will have to pay rather higher rates to make things easier for the people who are interested in different kinds of buildings.  Ultimately that is rather unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that our policy has been to stimulate business and industry generally but I think that in some ways that is a short-sighted policy. The Minister ought to keep in mind living conditions.  It is as important for the welfare of the State that ordinary people should be able to build on to their houses without incurring a large increase in rates and perhaps a higher valuation as it is to cover the matters that are covered in this Bill.  I hope I am not misinterpreting the effect of the Bill but that is the ultimate effect, as I see it.  Mr. X, Mr. Y and Mr. Z, who have business premises, will benefit. Mr. A, Mr. B and Mr. C, who have ordinary residences and who would very much like to improve them and who have, perhaps, a growing family and really need to improve them do <Col N="445" /> not benefit under this Bill but will pay higher rates.  The rates must come from somewhere: the same amount of rates must be collected.  I think that, in the end, that is a short-sighted policy.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Bill which is before the House allow ordinary residences to be extended and improved with some certainty that the rates would not go up to an unbearable degree.  If I am wrong, perhaps Senator Douglas will correct me in this matter.  If Senator Douglas thinks I am wrong, I will be grateful if he will correct me here and now and I will not continue on this line of argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an old grievance outstanding between county councils and urban councils for a long number of years.  It is in relation to a county council demand on urban districts and it is based on the gross valuation instead of on the net valuation. For a long number of years, the urban councils of Ireland have been appealing to the various Ministers here to do something about the matter.  The view of the Minister was that until the county councils would agree to recommending the repeal of the relevant section in the 1927 or 1928 Act he would not do anything about it.  It is no harm to remind him now that the General Council of County Councils passed a resolution <Col N="446" /> recommending that that section be repealed.</P>
      <P>It is a hardship on a large number of urban districts throughout the country to have to pay rates on something in respect of which they do not collect at all.  In other words, if my valuation is £30 as a result of doing up my property and it is now reduced to £20, or whatever it may be, the urban council will pay to the county council on a valuation of £30 instead of on a valuation of £20.  That is an injustice.  I happen to be the chairman of a county council but, nevertheless, I believe that this is an injustice and that the Minister should remedy it on the Committee Stage of the Bill. A ministerial amendment would be accepted by this House and by the Dáil.  I feel I have a mandate from the county councils of Ireland because the general council recommended this step to the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to make an effort now to remedy this injustice which has existed in this country since 1928.  I ask him to bring in an amendment on the Committee Stage because I believe that the time is now opportune to do so.</P>

      <P>If my memory serves me correctly, this is the first Bill in my whole time in the Seanad that has not caused some new form of taxation, either direct or indirect.  Therefore, I welcome it.  It is the first sign of some alleviation of taxation.</P>
      <P>I do not think that very much can be said on the Second Reading of this Bill, but quite a lot can be said on the Committee Stage.  It is a Bill that will require quite a lot of discussion on the question of relief of rates.  I have mentioned that I welcome this Bill as it signifies some alleviation of taxation. An interesting point is that the relief seems to come at the expense of the local authorities and not of the Exchequer.  I hope that, having given a lead, the Government having given some relief to us through the local authorities, the next time they come with a Bill they will give us some relief direct from the Exchequer itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point made by Senator Fitzsimons.  It is not a matter that I could deal with in this <Col N="447" /> measure.  I can say, however, that my Department are considering it.  While I am not giving any undertaking, I can say that from the first occasion on which I met the representatives of the municipal bodies, I felt that there were legitimate grounds for complaint on their part.  The Senator himself stated that he happens to be a member of two bodies in his own county.  He is chairman of the county council and he is associated with an important urban council also.  While the municipal bodies might make a demand like this, county councils might not receive it too well if the demand were conceded.  I was anxious that, as between the municipal bodies and the General Council of County Councils, they might find some means of doing away with a burden which might be bearing a bit heavily on the urban areas and especially the smaller ones.  I cannot deal with it now, even with the best will in the world, but an opportunity may present itself when I can.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas made a point that was made in the other House.  It seemed to suggest that in considering a measure of this nature one should have regard to all the other charges imposed by other bodies&mdash;income-tax, E.S.B. charges, and so on.  I do not believe that in a measure of this nature one is called upon to consider these matters.  I have gone, with the approval of the Government, as far as one could justifiably go.  I think it was Senator McGuire who said that this will not result in imposing any burden upon the general taxpayer. That is just the point.  It does create some difficulty in the smaller urban areas where these reliefs will be conceded. The rates in many of those places are high and those who are called upon to carry the burden do not look too kindly upon a Minister or Government being too generous at their expense.  In going as far as we propose to go, we are meeting the case fairly enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McCrea seemed to misunderstand the reference in my opening statement to improvements carried out over an extended period.  We are <Col N="448" /> aware that improvements were carried out on all sorts of premises over the last 20 years and have not been checked up by the valuation office.  As the law stood, if an owner were to add an extension the valuation office could come along and find that all those improvements of 20 years were not accounted for, and if we were not to take some power to cover that situation it would deter that man from effecting any addition to his premises.  The result is that instead of creating the situation that Senator McCrea seemed to think we were creating we are doing the very opposite.  As a result of the Bill, if an owner of premises carries out reasonably substantial improvements and if, on the approach of the valuation office it is found by them that he had done a considerable amount of work over a period of years, that work will be included with the new work and he will get the relief in respect of it.  That is designed to encourage him to go ahead with further improvements in the full knowledge that he will not be penalised in the manner that Senator McCrea seemed to think he might be.</P>
    <P>We had some amendments in the other House and I suppose Senators may wish to table some amendments for the Committee Stage here.  I do not wish to come here talking about the urgency of this measure.  It is not vital but I would like to get it as soon as the House can conveniently give it to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of this Bill will, I think, be non-controversial.  It is to cure, with retrospective effect, a flaw in the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946.  It was the intention of the Legislature in 1946 that a district justice sitting privately should have power to make a provisional order fixing the rents of small premises, whether or not they were let with some little furniture or with services, such as a supply of electricity.  The High Court recently quashed two provisional orders, however, on the ground that a district justice has no power to apportion the rent of partly furnished or partly serviced premises as between the premises themselves and the furniture or the service and that only a court may make such an apportionment. The result is that applications from tenants of small premises which are partly furnished or partly serviced cannot be dealt with by a justice sitting privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 remedies this defect retrospectively, but not so as to validate a provisional order which has been quashed before this Bill is enacted.  The two tenants whose provisional orders have been quashed now find themselves involved in arrears of rent because they became liable to pay the difference between the rents fixed by the orders and the original contract rents.  Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill are intended to minimise this unfortunate consequence.  Section 3 will enable a district justice to make a fresh and valid provisional order, the result of <Col N="450" /> which will be to prevent any further accumulation of arrears.  As regards the arrears which have accumulated, it is provided in Section 4 that the court will have discretion to stay the execution of a decree for the amount of the arrears, or of a decree for possession of the premises so long as the arrears are paid by instalments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill, particularly in Sections 3 and 4, seem to be reasonable enough.  I remember the 1946 Act going through and it was intended, to make for what is called cheaper law, that a district justice should have certain powers. Apparently we were not successful in framing the Bill in the end, so as to give that power effectively.  The Minister has now avoided the objectionable idea of nullifying a decision of the courts already given.</P>

From that point of view, the Bill is unobjectionable as it stands and I am in favour of it.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell us if he is perfectly clear that he is not dealing with the cases with which the orders of certiorari dealt? As I understood the Minister he suggested that the Bill would not deal with those cases in respect of which the certiorari orders had been made <Col N="451" /> but it would appear from the Bill that, notwithstanding the orders of certiorari, the cases are being dealt with by the Bill.  I should like the Minister to clear the position for us. I understand the Bill to deal with the two cases in which the High Court made orders.  If that is the case, as I think it is, I am afraid I do not share the views expressed by Senator Hayes. I think we should not attempt in any way to have legislation that would operate retrospectively.  It is entirely wrong and both Houses have from time to time emphasised that we should not endeavour to do anything by means of retrospective legislation to affect parties whose rights have been changed, particularly by court orders. I strongly disapprove of any effort to do that and I should like the Minister to clear the position for us.</P>

      <P>My recollection of the Act which this Bill proposes to amend was that it was the clear intention, and accepted by everyone in both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, that so-and-so should be the law.  It transpired&mdash;it is immaterial what the reasons were&mdash;that that intention was not upheld by the courts in their legal technical interpretation of the law as it was.  Like Senator O'Reilly, I am averse from retrospective legislation in so far as such retrospective legislation will deprive a citizen of rights which the Oireachtas gives him; but in a case like this I have no inhibitions at all because the clear intention was that the law should be so-and-so. Technical legal interpretation of the Act by the courts arrived at a different conclusion and, therefore, I think we are entitled, in justice and in fair play to the Houses which are superior to the courts of the land&mdash;this is a point I want to emphasise&mdash;to take the action which the Bill proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In matters of this kind, matters of intention, the Houses of the Oireachtas are far superior to the courts of the land.  I repeat that the intention of the Oireachtas was that the law should be so-and-so.  Legal interpretation later on by the courts decided that the law was not as we intended it to be.  What is proposed to be <Col N="452" /> done in this Bill is to make clear, as far as it can be made clear, that our intentions will be effective and good law.</P>

      <P>What actually happended was that the order made by the district justice was quashed by the court.  All we are doing here is to have it go back to the district justice to make a valid order.  I do not think we are interfering with the court decision there.  I agree that in the Bill as originally introduced in the Dáil that could be said.</P>
      <P>As far as the Constitution is concerned&mdash;I am not a lawyer&mdash;I have been advised by the Attorney-General and our legal advisers that it was quite consistent with the Constitution. I inquired again and they assured me that that was so.  I agreed to an amendment in the other House.  Undoubtedly we are taking something off a person which he had been given by the court.  The tenants knew that other tenants had got these orders made and had got the benefit of a reduction in their rent.  They had incurred, through no fault of their own, arrears of rent that no working people could face.  On the Report Stage in the Dáil I accepted an amendment safeguarding for the landlords the rights they had got in this particular case.  We cannot be said to be interfering.</P>
      <P>We have laid it down in Section 4 that they can pay by instalments and that if they are not able to pay by instalments they cannot be evicted without another order from the court. I think that was about the fairest way we could have got out of it having regard to all the circumstances of the case.</P>

We <Col N="453" /> thought we would have got all stages in both Houses but we found there were snags in it in the other House. The Bill was delayed a week longer than I thought it would.

      <P>May I say on the general principle I quite agree with what Senator Hearne said on the Second Stage that the Houses of the Oireachtas are superior to the courts in so far as the Houses devise the law and the courts interpret it?  When the courts have interpreted the law, it is extremely bad practice that a Parliament should come along and reverse a decision to the detriment of the persons who had benefited by the interpretation given in the courts.  That is what is objected to.  There is no question but that we are superior to the courts as far as making the law is concerned.</P>
      <P>One other point.  It is not a question of the landlord or the tenant.  It is not a question of any section, rich or poor, landlord or tenant who get something from the courts.  It is generally felt by most lawyers and by nearly all constitutionists that such a person would be allowed to retain the rights he has got from the particular court decision and that any amendment of the law which purports to put the law back into the position it was meant to be in should only apply to subsequently tried cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that in Section 3 the Minister has effected a compromise.  He has left the decision to a person who got the decision.  He endeavoured to make in this section changes which will mean that the decision will not weigh too heavily on the person who lost the <Col N="454" /> particular case.  From that point of view it does seem to be a reasonable compromise.  When I say that I am, unlike Senator O'Reilly, a person without practical knowledge of the courts as they work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to these old houses.  In this Rent Restrictions Act we provided that the district justice in his private chamber could apportion the valuation of a particular room in one of these tenements.  Only unfurnished apartments come under the Rent Restrictions Act.  In order to be unfurnished the furniture or services, that is, electric light and heat, should at least be 25 per cent.  In the section in which we were making this decision we said the court would fix it instead of saying the district justice.  Since 1946 they have proceeded on the basis that the intention was there.  It was not spotted that we did not put the district justice down instead of the court.</P>
      <P>The practice is that a person who feels the rent is too high gets a provisional order.  The district justice then makes the order.  The landlord is told that this order has been made and he gets three months within which to appeal.  In this case the solicitor for the landlord did not appeal.  I do not know whether it was deliberate or otherwise.  The time was up and I am told that when he looked into it he found a flaw in the Act and he got the whole thing quashed.</P>

      <P>A fundamental principle of legislation is involved here and I think it is a very serious matter. The proper government of a country depends on a balance between the Oireachtas and the law courts.  I can see that the law courts and the judges might well take umbrage at this measure.  They, exercising their functions as part of the management, so to speak, of the country, made certain rulings.  Apparently they were right, having regard to the terms of the 1946 Act.  As far as I can see&mdash;I may be wrong; it is a very technical point&mdash; we are now removing that by what, to my mind, amounts to retrospective legislation.  Although the Attorney-General and others seem to take a different view, and they are naturally more competent to judge, I think we should look carefully into this matter. Very important constitutional crises have arisen over a clash between the judicature and the legislative body.</P>
      <P>We can go too far in this.  I do not think we have a right, under the ultimate principles of legislation, to enact this measure.  It virtually amounts to retrospective legislation. I think that the law courts and the judges may well take a poor view of it.  I should like to hear a lawyer speaking from the point of view of the courts on this matter.</P>

      <P>I share the views expressed by Senator Hayes in regard to what Senator Hearne said. Senator Hearne and the Minister are quite right.  It was never intended that the district justice in chamber would not have this power but the Legislature did not give him the power; therefore Senator Stanford is <Col N="456" /> quite right in saying that we are now stepping in by retrospective legislation to correct a mistake or an oversight of ours.</P>
      <P>Let us imagine that the penalty for an offence was intended by the Oireachtas to be, say, two years' imprisonment and that in the course of proceedings against an offender whom it was understood would be visited with this penalty, it was found he could be sent to jail for only six months.  If we here are going to allow retrospective legislation to be passed we may expect to have a Minister coming in and saying: &ldquo;You will remember that in such and such case the Oireachtas had intended that if such a person as has been convicted recently of that particular offence were to be convicted he should get two years' imprisonment instead of six months. I want you to pass legislation to enable us to give that particular person two years instead of six months.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is not a bit far-fetched.  What has happened in this case is that the district justice made an order, as the Minister has explained; undoubtedly the Oireachtas intended to give him jurisdiction but we failed to give him that jurisdiction and that order which was wrongly made was subsequently quashed by the High Court, whose duty, incidentally, it is to quash orders of that kind.  We are now turning around and not merely correcting the mistake in general, not merely giving a new to the district justice the jurisdiction we had intended, but we are also saying to the High Court in regard to the two cases in which the justice acted wrongly and in which the High Court, having had its powers invoked, quashed the orders: &ldquo;We can operate without you.&rdquo;  If the High Court exercises its jurisdiction and quashes an order we restore the position by new legislation.</P>

According to the legislation as it stood, on the day on which the High Court order was made the matter should end.  Does the Minister say that that will have ended the matter when this Bill goes through? The tenant whose order was quashed may now come along and operate as if the law always had been as it may be to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned with the position of any other tenant.  I am quite ready to let the Bill go through to deal with any other tenant.  That will not be retrospective legislation.  That will be new or additional legislation so far as any other tenant is concerned but in so far as the tenant and the landlord concerned with the particular order are dealt with in this Bill, the intention is to restore the tenant's position that had obtained when the order was made.</P>
      <P>On principle, if we have any regard for our obligations to our citizens we must set our face against retrospective legislation of this kind.  We here should say: &ldquo;It is unfortunate that that tenant was not within the Act at the time but the courts dealt with him and administered the law as it existed when they made their order.&rdquo;  I do not know what view the High Court will take of our action in this matter, but I should imagine they will think it strange that in one Act the Oireachtas gives the High Court power to quash orders which other courts made in excess of or without jurisdiction, and then, when these orders have been made under the authority of statute, the Oireachtas comes along and undoes them.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask Senator O'Reilly one question.  If the Minister had phrased this differently and said that the tenant whose provisional order had been quashed by the High Court should be permitted to make a new application in due form of law, would Senator O'Reilly consider that that was a infringement of the dignity of the courts or an interference with the functions of the courts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell him that that would mean that one tenant or two tenants who have been unfortunate enough to be caught on the wrong foot are going to be victimised in respect of the premises which they occupy for all time while 10,000 other tenants get the benefit of that section of the Rent Act and of this amending Act.

      <P>He expatiated at some length on the position that would arise if the Oireachtas, while a judge was practically on the point of sentencing a man to six months, thereupon extended the total sentence to two years.  That is a very interesting problem and I have no doubt many more people than Senator O'Reilly would become excited if that occurred but it has not arisen.  It is not in the Bill.  The Bill we are dealing with has nothing to do with that and is on a very different plane.  I would suggest that what we are doing in this Bill is what is done at least once every year in the annual Finance Bill.  Everybody knows very well that the income-tax law, for example, is very complicated. That is a better instance to choose than the one Senator O'Reilly produced. A certain wise man is very adept at finding loopholes in various laws and because some of those loopholes <Col N="459" /> are discovered certain lucky clients of his get away with the lot. However, the next year the Minister for Finance closes up that loophole and they will not get away with it again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The person who gets away with the loophole saves paying income-tax but nobody else can try it.  That is precisely what we are doing here.  The position in regard to certain anomalies is now being remedied.  All we are doing here is what has been done on numerous occasions in the annual Finance Bill and certain other legislation.  I do not see that there is any real problem and certainly there is no injustice involved. I think Senator Hartnett's point is absolutely valid and that Senator O'Reilly wants to have 10,000 tenants coming in under this particular section of the 1946 Act with one solitary tenant remaining without the protection that the Oireachtas has given to the remaining 10,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>What happened is this. The order was quashed because they had not jurisdiction.  All tenants owed the difference between the contract rent they had paid and what was fixed by the court.  We are not interfering with that.  We are providing that they will pay by instalments.  We are not interfering with the debt incurred through no fault of their own.  We are just making the Act as we intended it to be.  Surely we are entitled to do that?  We are amending it.  We are not doing anything else except saying that this provision has been shown to be defective and we are making it as the Oireachtas intended it to be.  We are not interfering with anybody who has won or lost in this matter.  I do not know how that can be objectionable. It is simply that an order was quashed.  Therefore, it is as if it did not exist.  Everyone who wants to avail of this, including the two persons concerned, can now get an order and <Col N="460" /> so can the landlord if he objects to whatever the court decided.  They can still go to the court: they have their three months.  If the court says: &ldquo;There has been too much of a reduction. We will fix the rent at such a point,&rdquo; the landlord's rights are still there.  Of course, no one likes retrospective legislation but it has to be done practically every year.</P>

However, it is not correct to say that there have been frequent examples or, as far as I recollect, any examples of endeavouring to take away from an individual the benefit of the judgment of a court.  Retrospective legislation &mdash;yes, if you like, but not if you take away from a citizen the benefit of the judgment of the court.  Actually, the Minister is not doing that here, so he is giving his own case away, to some extent.  Here, he is amending the law for the future.  He is giving the people who lost the case the right to get the future benefit of this law we are making now and he is giving them the additional benefit of modifying the losses by letting the money be paid in instalments rather than in one lot.  I hope I have made the Minister's case well.  I should also like to say that there have not been examples of depriving a citizen of a judgment given to him by the court.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Reilly and Senator Hayes in this matter.  It is a matter of fundamental principle.  It is a small point in relation to what looks, in a way, an unimportant Bill.  This is how bad precedents can be made.  It will be argued on a more important Bill: &ldquo;We said so and so on the Rent Restrictions Bill.  Why should we not say it now on this more important Bill?&rdquo;  We can deal with this in a calm manner.  The fundamental question of the balance of power between the courts and the Legislature is at fault in this.  For the benefit of those members of the House who do not know the Constitution by heart, as we all should, I suppose, I should like to read paragraph 5 of Article 15 of the Constitution, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Suppose someone appealed to the Constitution in this matter.  The Supreme Court might rule that this was a case of declaring acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.  These people had the benefit of the law from 1946 until now&mdash;and now we are going to deprive them of that benefit, retrospectively. That has now been conceded.</P>

There is certainly a suspicion of retrospective legislation here.  I appeal to the Minister, in all calmness and solemnity, to reconsider this clause.  It goes right through the fundamental principle of the balance of power in our country between the Legislature and the courts.  That is why I make this appeal in this matter.</P>

      <P>May I add a final word and appeal for some clear thinking on this particular matter? Before I came into the House and <Col N="462" /> listened to what we all had to say on the matter I thought it was quite clear. I find a little more difficulty now.  The subject has been somewhat confused by Senators on the other side of the House who are undoubtedly expressing an honest point of view in the matter. Surely no rights which have accrued to the landlords in question in respect of the orders which were quashed by the High Court on certiorari do remain to them.  The provisional order having been quashed, the landlord is still entitled to recover the rent which the tenant pays up to the date that the district justice proceeds with the application.  As I understand it that is what the Act proposes to do.  For the life of me I cannot see how that can be suggested as an infringement of constitutional rights.</P>
      <P>If a person made an application to the court last year or this year, for example, and got an order fixing a lawful rent, a basic rent, under the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, and if next week the Minister were to introduce a new Rent Restrictions Act enabling tenants to apply to the court to secure the fixing of rents at a lower ceiling than now obtains, in accordance with a different rule of thumb, would that be an infringement of the constitutional rights of the tenants who had already obtained an order under the 1946 Act?  Of course it would not.  There should be some clear thinking on the matter.  It would certainly not be an infringement.  In my view it is clearly not unconstitutional. If Senators on the other side think it is they have a way of testing it.</P>

I should like to have something that could be written down on the records from the Minister on this point.  Will the Minister state categorically that the effect of this <Col N="463" /> Bill, as far as the rent and legal rights in respect of premises go, will be from the date of the enactment of this Bill&mdash; in other words, that there will be no effect on the rent as it was until this Bill is passed?  If this is going back to 1946, and saying that as far as rent is concerned the state of affairs is the same as it was in 1946, that is retrospective legislation; but if it simply means that the state of affairs will be the same as if a district justice had made an order at the passing of this Bill, I am satisfied.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case I do not mind how long the Seanad takes, as there is no hurry about the Bill.  I have delayed it quite a long time myself.  This Bill is concerned with a single type of intestacy and with no other type of case, namely, the case of a man who dies leaving a widow but no children.  It is not a Bill to deal with the law of intestate succession generally.  Nor does it aim at a reform of the law of property, which some people think is overdue.  It is as well to say this at the outset so <Col N="465" /> as to forestall suggestions which would be appropriate to a measure of a different kind but which are out of place in connection with the present Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill differs from the Bill that was introduced in 1951, chiefly in two respects.  Under the previous Bill the widow was to take the whole of the intestate's personal estate.  Thus, if the deceased's estate consisted solely of a farm of registered land (which devolves as personal estate) the widow would take the entire estate.  This, we believe, would be inconsistent with the wishes of intestates generally in this country and we have, therefore, proceeded on a different principle. Secondly, the previous Bill would have given the widow a life interest in the whole of the real estate but no other interest therein.  This would put the widow in a worse position than she is in at present in the case of a small estate of real property as it would deprive her of the statutory legacy and a lump sum equivalent to half the value of the residue which would be a much more valuable interest in such a case.  Opinion is indeed unanimous that life interests in small estates are most undesirable.  We consider, therefore, that it would be a retrograde step to make such a change in the law.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to make better provision for the childless widows of intestates in three ways.  In the first place it proposes to increase eight times the statutory legacy payable to such widows under the existing law; that is to say, to increase the statutory legacy from the sum of £500 to the sum of £4,000.  Secondly, it provides that in the case of a partial intestacy the provisions of the Bill will apply to the intestate part.  As the law stands the widow has no right to the statutory legacy in the case of a partial intestacy.  And, finally, it provides that any property which, for want of an heir or next-of-kin, would pass to the State under the existing law shall in future belong to the widow absolutely and exclusively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a good deal of discussion in the other House as to what the statutory legacy should be and I was asked to take into consideration not <Col N="466" /> alone the fall in the value of money that has taken place since 1890 but also the fact that the sum of £500 was inadequate even at that time and represented a much less ample provision than an intestate would have wished to make for his widow before he would have wished his parents or brothers and sisters to benefit.  It is clear that very different views may be taken as to what provision should be made for the widow where there is no issue surviving, but I was impressed by the argument that the widow should be provided with a competence which would be sufficient to maintain her for the rest of her life in modest comfort where the estate was large enough to permit of this.  I therefore agreed that the statutory legacy should be fixed at the sum of £4,000 instead of £2,000, as I had originally intended.</P>
    <P>There is one provision in the Bill which calls for a word of explanation and that is the provision contained in Section 7, which relates to the method of valuing real estate for the purposes of the Bill.  Under the law as it stands, the value of the real estate (including registered land), for the purpose of determining the widow's rights, falls to be calculated in an artificial manner upon the basis of 20 times the rateable valuation.  The effect of this artificial manner of valuing real estate under present day conditions when the price of land is high is to produce the most anomalous results.  Let me give an illustration.  Suppose that two persons die intestate, one possessed of a farm of registered land with a rateable valuation of £25 and the other possessed of nothing but £500 in the bank, the widow takes the entire estate in each case but the saleable value of the farm of registered land might be worth as much as £1,500 or £2,000.  The anomaly is no less striking in the case of two farms of registered land the artificial valuation of which is slightly below £500 in one case and slightly above it in the other since the market value of both farms is very much in excess of the artificial valuation.  In the first case the widow takes the entire farm, but in the second she gets no more than a charge for £500 on the farm and half the balance of its <Col N="467" /> market value.  The Bill proposes to get rid of these anomalies by providing that in future real estate is to be taken at its market or saleable value, which is what Section 7 means.</P>
    <P>It remains for me to say that Section 1 of the Bill provides that the Act shall come into operation on the 1st June next.  This is to allow persons concerned an opportunity of making their wills if they do not wish their property to be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the new legislation. We thought it only right we should give due notice.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been substantially improved from my point of view since it was introduced in the Dáil.  It aims at modifying the previous Bill introduced here in 1951.  In one case, it modifies it, as the Minister points out, in favour of the widow, and, in the other, against her.  I was never an ardent advocate of women's rights.</P>

      <P>If Senator Dowdall will listen to me, she will find that I am not as bad as she thinks.  I was never an ardent advocate of women's rights because, when the Minister and I were younger, we were interested in Cathlín Ní Houlihán rather than any other lady, and we were interested in her rights rather than in the rights of women generally. I should like to point out&mdash;and if Senator Dowdall will bear with me, she might get some information&mdash;that the Sinn Féin movement and the Gaelic League movement were the first in these countries and, perhaps, in Europe, to give complete equality to women.  Without discussing the principle at all, or having any argument about it, they just gave it to them.  They let them do jobs of work; they gave them votes and every consideration. Indeed, they married them in many cases, which was, perhaps, the best of all kinds of consideration. For that reason, I am still an advocate of rights of equality for women, and I do think that, although the Minister has made an improvement by making <Col N="468" /> the sum £4,000, where a man dies intestate and leaves a widow without children, the widow should take the whole of the personal estate as was provided in the Bill of 1951.  I do not see why she could not or should not.</P>
      <P>The Minister's pretence&mdash;I do not use the word offensively&mdash;or the Minister's argument that that would not be the desire of the majority of Irish intestates just does not hold water.  If a man wants to will any part of his estate away from his wife he should make a will doing that, and if he does not do it his widow should get the whole lot.  That is my opinion. The Minister in the other House cited the case&mdash;it occurs frequently in this country&mdash;of an old man marrying a young woman.  If she is good enough to be his wife it seems to me that she is good enough to take his whole personal estate if he does not make a will providing for other people.  At this hour of the day, as things stand now, it is quite a retrograde step to provide that the widow shall not get the whole of the estate.</P>
      <P>The Minister may very well be right that a life interest in real estate is a bad thing.  I know from some examples in the country that it is very difficult to work but, while the £4,000 is an improvement on what the Minister originally had in the Bill, I see no reason&mdash;he is going to give notice now and the date in the Bill is 1st June; I would not mind the date being put back in order to give plenty of notice&mdash;why if a man dies intestate and leaving no children his widow should not get the whole of the estate. I suggest to the Minister that would be a proper thing to do in the Bill. He would then be able to say that he adopted a good part of the 1951 Bill in its entirety and amended a part which was defective.  From the point of view of justice, of being up-to-date, of looking at the realities of our present situation in relation to men and women in this country and practically everywhere else, that would be the proper provision, and I suggest it should be done.</P>

      <P>As the only woman here, I might be permitted to say <Col N="469" /> something about this Bill.  I want to thank the Minister for it&mdash;it is a step in the right direction.  I agree with Senator Hayes that limiting the amount of the intestacy to be given to the widow does not seem quite fair. Take the case of a man who dies leaving a large young family.  It will be agreed by all men that in that case the widow does a very good job of work in bringing up these children under the most trying circumstances, circumstances in which she has to go out and work day by day.  In fact, I suggest that she makes a better job of it than does a man who is left in charge of children, even with a large income.  Where there is money and where a woman is not fortunate enough to have had children, I agree with Senator Hayes that whatever her husband dies worth, except it is a fabulous fortune, should go to her, but I suggest that in her own interest &mdash;I do not know how this could be put into an Act&mdash;she should be protected from people who might be running after her money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in reading out the parts of this Bill which should interest us, warned us against bringing in any irrelevant matters relating to women. I crave your indulgence, Sir, and that of the Minister in trying to do that. The Minister in this Bill has been very progressive and certainly the women of Ireland will thank him and pray for him.  It will do him an awful lot of good and it will do good also in other ways.  I think the attitude of married people in this country with regard to money is simply ridiculous. Husbands rarely discuss with their wives their financial situation.  I learned from my friends&mdash;it did not happen to me; I was always told the ups and downs&mdash;that their husbands never discussed their financial situation with them, and I suggest that <Col N="470" /> that is not intelligent, even on the man's part, because, if a woman takes on the onerous job of managing a husband, she should, in turn, be told how she stands financially.</P>
    <P>All women are not gold diggers anxious to spend the money a man has. Most women are intelligent enough to arrange their lives according to the situation in which they find themselves and this old-fashioned idea that men have, that if women knew how much they had, they would be much more extravagant, I suggest, is not true.</P>
    <P>I have in mind some cases of women who, when their husbands died, found themselves absolutely penniless when they had thought they were comparatively well off.  I have in mind the case of a doctor's widow.  That man went out every morning as if to his practice at the hospital when for years he had not been doing any business at all.  She was a case for charity when he died.  That is a very sad situation and I put it forward as a hint to men in general that women are more intelligent than men give them credit for.  They will be glad to know the situation and to face up to it.</P>
    <P>I come now to the part the Minister warned me of, but I am going to take a chance.  There is in the neighbouring island legislation to guard against any man leaving his fortune away from his wife.  That arose in recent years, but we have no such legislation here. A man may die intestate and in that case there is provision for the widow, but he make take it into his head to make a will leaving his fortune away from his wife.  It is not a condition of affairs which arises very often here, but in England there was a famous case within the past 12 years of a man who left a fabulous fortune to a dog's home&mdash;it was in the region of millions &mdash;and cynically left 1/- to his wife. That may be the way he felt about it, but I do not think he ought to be allowed to make it public and to treat her in that way.  She immediately became a care on public charity, and I suggest to the Minister, while he is in this good frame of mind, that he should consider legislation to prevent such a situation arising here and to provide that, in circumstances where <Col N="471" /> people are found not to be competent to make a correct will, the widow will be guarded.  I repeat my thanks to the Minister for this good piece of legislation and for the benefit it may be to men in general in getting them to waken up to a realisation of the ideas I have suggested to them.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that this ceiling of £4,000 seems to be very artificial. There is a point in this section which I should like to have clarified.  Maybe there is some simple explanation which I should see but which I cannot see at the moment.  What happens to the life interest when the widow dies?  As I understand a life interest, the person who has it cannot do anything about it in relation to disposing of it after he or she is dead.  Here is the State compelling a widow to take a life interest in such fraction of her husband's property as exceeds £4,000. What can she do about that if she dies, and, if she cannot do anything about it, what has the Minister in mind will happen to it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion this Bill was before the House, I found myself in a minority of one.  I cannot agree with the main objects of this Bill and a point was raised in the Dáil which I think the Minister would do well to consider.  There is the question of the aged dependents of a husband. Where a man dies who had been supporting or partly supporting an aged father or a mother, provision should be made for their continued support.  I think it would be worth while if some such provision were put in the Bill.  I do not think I have been converted during the past three years.  It seems to me that a mistake was made in dealing jointly with real and personal property.  Real property I take to be land and farms.  It may be all right, where a man dies possessed of a large sum of money, houses or a business, that the widow should be at no loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems wrong in the case of land. This is an agricultural country and our basic concern should be the land. <Col N="472" /> There is still in this country a feeling in regard to the hereditary rights of the owners of land.  There is a strong sentiment connected with the ownership of land which cannot be eradicated. That sentiment is a national asset and a very vital asset in the development of the country.  It is the only thing that up to the present has kept the people on the land.</P>
    <P>We hear of exiles in far-off countries. They always think of their own country.  No matter how of a family may break up they think all the time of the home farm and always look forward to coming back.  It would not be wise for the Legislature to ignore that sentiment. I pointed out before the position that may arise when a husband dies without leaving any children.  His widow may be young and the probability is that there may be a father and mother in the house. The young woman may marry again with the result that the old people will have to go.</P>
    <P>A couple may live to an old age. Then the husband dies.  Is it not clearly a case as to whom the farm should go, the husband's family or the wife's family because it is only a case of a couple of years?  In view of the general feeling I submit that it should go to the husband's family.  I would suggest that in this Bill the Minister would separate the question of farms from all other classes of property.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that this provision of £4,000 covers practically all the farms in this country.  Any lawyer in the House who has experience of matters of this kind, will be able to certify that the great majority of wills, where there is no family, leave the farm to the widow for her life and to the family of the husband after her death.  It would be well for the Minister to follow the custom of the country and provide that the widow got all the cash, cattle and other property except the land.  She had only a life interest in the land.  I think that would be doing what is usually done in the country.  We in the country know that feeling on this matter is deepseated. I think the Minister would do a great deal for the rural districts if he brought in the amendment I <Col N="473" /> suggest.  It would not deprive any woman of any rights she possesses She would be in exactly the same position after the husband's death as she was before.</P>

      <P>I must say that I agree entirely with the views expressed by Senator Professor Hayes on this matter.  However, I thank the Minister for the Bill on the principle that half a loaf is better than no bread. I must say that I admire very much the manner in which the Minister, in his customary skilful way, obviated or tried to obviate attempts which would be made by lawyers to remedy other anomalies in the law of intestacy.</P>
      <P>There is one point&mdash;I will be very brief on it&mdash;I should like to make to the Minister.  I am not altogether sure of my facts.  I did not think this matter would be reached to-day and I had intended to look it up, but I remember being struck by it in the course of my practice a number of years ago.</P>
      <P>If a man dies leaving a widow and one child or a widow and one grandchild, the widow in that case gets one-third and the child or the grandchild, as the case may be, gets two-thirds of the estate.  That, I think, is a gross anomaly.  I think it is a matter which the Minister could rectify by a simple section in this particular Bill.  Before the Cathaoirleach rules me out of order, I will resume my seat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think it is a step in the right direction to deal with the law in regard to intestacy.  However, it is only a very short step in the right direction. The Minister put a certain limit on the benefit accruing to the widow.  The Dáil, with the approval of the Minister, considerably improved on that.  As we have the Bill at the moment, it is a good Bill and we should welcome it. As this Bill is perfectly non-controversial, we in the Seanad have an excellent opportunity of doing something really good.  We have an opportunity of amending something and putting an end to what has existed for many, many centuries, a very strange anomaly.  We are being given the opportunity of providing that a man who marries and dies intestate <Col N="474" /> should not be prevented, by virtue of his death intestate, from leaving all his property to her whom he chose rather than to people with the choice of whom he was not concerned.</P>
      <P>A man marries late, settles down, and, perhaps a year or longer afterwards, dies intestate and without issue.  Why, in such a case, should not the widow become entitled to all the estate of the husband so dying?  Who will advance a reason why the widow in such a case should not get all the property of the person who had chosen her for his wife.  There can be no reason in the world why there should be any limit, £4,000 or £40,000, to the estate that a married woman should get on the death intestate of her husband, not leaving any children or grandchildren.  I read the Dáil Debates in this matter.  I was not surprised that they raised the amount from £2,000 to £4,000, but I was rather surprised that they did not say: &ldquo;Leave the widow in such a case absolutely everything.&rdquo; What is the position where a widow dies intestate with or without children? In such a case, the husband becomes entitled to all the wife's estate.  Why should that be the case?</P>

      <P>That is the answer, because men made the law. The law giving effect to all this was passed before women were allowed to sit as representatives in parliamentary assemblies.  Surely things have changed since then so that women are entitled to be treated in the same way in this matter as men?  Why should we refuse to alter this Bill so as to provide that a widow would get exactly what the husband would get if his wife died intestate.  I see no reason why we should not alter this Bill and make it a really good Bill, by providing that on the death intestate of a man without children or issue, his widow should get all his property.  I have not heard even the Minister say there is any reason why we should not do that.  He may have a good reason; I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told or will be told that where a Ryan man marries a Brown lady and the Brown lady, on <Col N="475" /> the death intestate of Ryan, gets the Ryan farm, the Ryan family will bitterly complain&mdash;that there will never be a Ryan on that land again; it will be all the Brown's land.  Of course, that will have been Mr. Ryan's fault. If he married Miss Brown surely Miss Brown is entitled to get his worldly goods as he would be entitled to get hers?  In this Bill we are being afforded an opportunity of putting right a wrong and an unfairness that has existed for many, many years.</P>
    <P>There are one or two small points in the Bill about which I would ask the Minister to tell us something.  In Section 4 (2) it is provided that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As between the real and personal representatives of the deceased, such charge shall be borne and paid in proportion to the values of the real and personal estates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that gross values or net values? That is something we must consider. Again in Section 7 it is provided that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The net value of real estate shall for the purposes of this Act be ascertained in the case of a free-simple by deducting from the gross value thereof the gross amount of any mortgage or other principal sum...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what the meaning of &ldquo;the gross amount of any mortgage&rdquo; is.  Perhaps we shall get some assistance as to that later on.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I regard this as an important opportunity for the Seanad to do something that is really right and to do something in a matter that cannot arouse any strong feeling. Simply put, I believe that if the husband is entitled to all his wife's estate, the widow should be entitled to all the husband's estate.  What injustice can be done particularly as the husband who would desire to see that his widow would not have the benefit of this Act, will have ample notice so that he may very easily provide that he does not die intestate?</P>
    <P>I also suggest that the date of the commencement of the Act be extended far beyond June next.  So that everybody would have full notice and that nobody would have any grievance, I <Col N="476" /> feel the date should be 1st January next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he goes altogether too far.  The problem with which this Bill deals can be divided into two parts.  There are, first of all, the people who are not farmers whether they live in cities or not, and then there are farmers.  In the case of widows whose husbands live in cities or in small towns and whose property consists of business, stocks and shares, and so forth, I think there is a strong case for the widow getting an order.  In the case of a man who has £5,000 or £10,000 in the bank it is very difficult to see why anybody but the widow should get the whole lot on his death intestate.</P>
      <P>In the case of farmers, the position is different.  The Minister is quite correct in saying that the general feeling amongst the rural community would be, in the case of a farmer who died intestate, that the widow should not get the whole farm but that it should stay in the family.  I think Senator O'Reilly is altogether too hopeful in his suggestion that there would be no difficulty in regard to his proposal that the widow should get the whole farm.  There are larger numbers of difficulties, apart altogether from the feelings aroused by a breach in the tradition of land tenure.  Very often, the widow comes from a different part of the country altogether and very often if she gets the farm it has to be sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the ideal solution, if the Minister could see his way to adopt it, would be that in the case of land&mdash;as <Col N="477" /> was suggested by Senator O'Dwyer&mdash; the widow should get a life interest in the whole of the property concerned and that in all other cases the widow should get the entire property, stocks, shares or whatever it may happen to be.  That would deal with the farmer and the non-farmer.  I think it would do substantial justice and I suggest to the Minister that he might consider that possibility.  Even as it stands, the Bill is a very substantial improvement on the present position and I should like, again, to congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another important aspect and nobody has referred to it except Senator O'Dwyer. He referred to the effects of such a Bill upon the parents of a deceased farmer.  The Minister is aware that, as the law stands, people of property can, three or more years before their death, sign over their property to a relative and, consequently, avoid death duty charges.  I have in mind a case which occurred recently, where a father signed over his property to his son and died a fortnight later. Actually, the son treated his family very badly.  Let us presuppose a family where the father is possessed of property which he signs over to his son during his lifetime.  Suppose that, during the lifetime of his father, that son dies.  Under this Bill, all that property which the father made over to his son goes completely and entirely to the son's widow to the extent of £4,000 or over, as was suggested by Senator O'Reilly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It very often happens that a daughter-in-law and father-in-law are on very bad terms.  Consider the position of a father-in-law who, during his lifetime, made over his property to his son.  On the death of that son, according to this Bill, the daughter-in-law, who hates her father-in-law, inherits the property and probably throws her father-in-law out of the house.  I am interested in protecting parents under this Bill.  I can see that, as the Bill is framed at the moment, it is designed to protect the rights of the wife.  But it can have a very peculiar reaction in the case of parents.  Is there any other Act whereby parents who have <Col N="478" /> given away their property, and who have no legal claim on the widow of their son, can be protected?  There are things which override legal rights, namely, moral rights.  In so far as we can, we should protect the moral claims of a parent to support by his daughter-in-law in respect of moneys earned by him during a certain part of his life.  Legally, I may be all at sea about this.</P>

When a man takes a woman to be his wife, and endows her with all his worldly goods in a very solemn way, I think we should stand by that arrangement. Even apart from that particular contract, I think that when a man gets married he should undertake that what he owns equally with what his wife owns shall be their joint property and shall, on the death of one partner, become the entire property of the surviving partner.</P>

I hope that, at some future time, a Bill will be introduced which will go the whole hog and put the wife on the same terms as the husband.  If the wife dies intestate, the husband gets all her property.  I see no reason why the situation should not be the same if the husband dies intestate.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donnell refers to parents who hand over their property to a son or a daughter when they get married. In such cases, there is usually what is termed a marriage settlement.</P>

      <P>If they do not think it worth their while to make an arrangement at that particular time, they should be prepared to take the consequences.  I think we should not give consideration to cases of that description.  Take, for example, a man who dies intestate and whose widow is in a mental hospital and has no children, and let us suppose that she has no relatives within 100 miles of the place.  It sounds odd that all his property should go to the widow who is in a mental hospital and who is likely to remain there.  In passing a Bill of this description, I would consider making an exception in her case. I think we should take the bull by the horns and agree that if the husband is entitled to the wife's possessions if she dies intestate, the wife should equally be entitled to the husband's possessions if he dies intestate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that the Minister will act on the suggestion of Senator Hayes and Senator Mrs. Dowdall at some future date and go the whole hog.</P>

      <P>I have just listened to Senator Loughman.  He has raised another hare&mdash;and a very important one.  Let us consider the case of a person who dies intestate and whose widow is in a mental home.  She would not be capable of making any decision. I have a certain amount of sympathy for Senator O'Dwyer's argument.  At the same time, in any cases throughout the country where the owner of a farm gives it to his son and that son gets married and gets in a fortune with the wife, if that son feels he is under any obligation to his aged father or mother, or both, or to any relatives, he is at liberty to make whatever disposition he likes.  He can make a will in their favour and if he does not make it, it is his own fault.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not help us here.  In reply to Senator Loughman, the point I was trying to make was that a transfer of property generally takes place, as the Minister knows, to escape death duties.  I am speaking subject to legal correction on this.  You cannot lay down conditions in the transfer of real estate on the transfer of that property and consequently the parents are entirely dependent on the goodwill of the beneficiaries. In the case of a beneficiary who is a daughter-in-law, who dislikes her parents-in-law, they are thrown on the waves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped I might have the last word&mdash;but after all it is the very powerful prerogative of the female sex.  One thing struck me, as the legal gentlemen in this House said their say&mdash;I have always regarded intestacies as lawyers' dreams and I have no reason to change my mind.  A lot could be said one way or another on this Bill.  One man may take a very strong view on the rights of widows as Senator P.F. O'Reilly did. It is not as simple as that.  I do not suggest that I am right but I am not prepared to say Senator P.F. O'Reilly is right either.  This Bill should be studied carefully, as it has a lot of social implications and may mean a lot of hardship and lack of equity and human justice if we come to a hasty decision.  Human law and human justice are two different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a few hares have been slipped into the course on this measure already and it may be no harm if I slip in some <Col N="481" /> more.  Senator P.F. O'Reilly asks why the widow should not get the whole estate if her husband dies intestate. May I put the case where she herself, without being in a mental home, dies intestate, what then?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>She gets all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>But she is already dead.  Supposing she died intestate&mdash; she may have had a farm worth £1,000. It is not as simple as Senator O'Reilly and the other legal gentlemen suggest. I agree that better provision should be made generally for widows, where the husband dies intestate; but there is quite a lot in the view expressed by Senator O'Dwyer and the Minister should examine this more carefully.</P>
      <P>In the case of land, the wife inheriting the personal estate of a husband who dies intestate should have a life interest in that property.  I am inclined to take Senator O'Dwyer's view that in the case of land it should not be alienated from the family of the deceased husband.  In 90 cases out of 100 it is the life effort of generations of the husband's family that has built up that estate and it should not be completely alienated from the family or next of kin of the deceased husband. There may be a case where the husband inherits the wife's estate. Why should not the wife inherit the husband's estate?  I do not know the number of cases, but I believe that the greater bulk of real estates is vested in the male population, it is assigned from one male member of a family to another.  Senator O'Reilly, without knowing it, made a case why land should not be alienated from the family of the deceased husband.  There is a lot in the viewpoint expressed by Senator O'Dwyer and agreed to by Senator Yeats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell raised another point.  Supposing a man assigns a farm of 100 acres to a son.  That farm may be worth £3,000, the only property that man had, and his wife may also be living.  The son gets married and dies without issue.  His wife then becomes the absolute owner of all the property.  What is going to become of the parents?  Surely in <Col N="482" /> equity or in justice there should be some provision made for the father and mother in that case.  I think the best approach would be that the widow should inherit a life interest. Apparently nobody thought about the fact that, even though the husband dies intestate, his wife, be she young or old, if there is no issue can inherit the estate.  Suppose she dies intestate? I raise that question in the hope that there will be some consideration given to it.  I still believe the Bill is not a perfect measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I definitely agree with Senator O'Dwyer that a special examination is required in the case of land.  Everybody from the country knows that there is a certain sentiment attached to the succession of land which no business, profession or any other calling carries with it.  That will always be the case in this country and it should be borne in mind.  I do not want to be in any way harsh to the widow, but while provision should be made for a life interest for the wife for such time as she is to hold on to the land, there should be some provision that the land will then go to the next of kin of the deceased husband. Everybody will agree that there is a lot of sentiment attached to this matter &mdash;so many generations of such people having been on that farm&mdash;and that even if there is not a direct relation, a nephew is deemed to be near enough. Titles long ago were always continued to the second, third and fourth cousin and whatever value they were to the different families who held them, the land, the old homestead has as great a value for the ordinary farmer, and I feel that it is a case deserving of special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a business, if a man goes in and changes the name over the door, the house has no appeal compared with the appeal of the old house on the hill.  There may be an old house in the place like the house Tom Moore was born in which will carry a plaque, but all the rest are so much stones and mortar in which So-and-so carried on a good business for years or in which So-and-so went down.  That is all they mean.  These places do not hold the <Col N="483" /> appeal for the brothers and sisters who leave that the country home holds for those who leave it, even though they go to the ends of the earth and it is the last thing they see on their death beds.  They regret that they have been deprived of the opportunity of dying in the old land and priests attending them on their death beds have often stated that at such a time two considerations were uppermost in their minds&mdash;their hope of reaching Heaven and regret that they had not been enabled to die in the old homestead in the old land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed by most of the speeches made here to-night.  I have a fairly good knowledge of the members of this House, and, so far as I know, there is only one man in the House who has not already committed himself to doing certain things; in other words, there is only one man here who has not gone to the altar and said to some woman: &ldquo;With all my worldly goods I thee endow,&rdquo; and I should like to hear a few words on this matter from that Senator, Senator Goulding.  I am inclined to be on the side of those who say that the Minister has done a reasonably good or a fairly good job, but to say that he has done a fairly good job is like saying that a man is fairly honest.  I think he should have gone much further.  I believe that most of us who went to the altar and made these vows were quite sincere about them and I see no reason why we should change our opinions over the years.  I do not believe we have any right to do that, and, while the Bill goes a certain distance, I believe it does not go far enough.  However, maybe we will go a little further at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very interesting and alarming to hear the speeches made by people from the various sections of society, and, while I have a lot of sympathy with the speeches made by Senator O'Dwyer and Senator Hartney, I think that if one really thought seriously on the question, one would realise that, despite all this talk of tradition and so on, it could entail a lot of hardship if a man died intestate and his wife <Col N="484" /> had to get out of the place.  If that happened a week after the wedding, the hardship might not be so great, but any of us who know the country know of farmers' houses which have been practically rebuilt, redecorated and modernised by the wife in many cases, against the wishes of the husband.  That woman can live there for years, can cultivate a garden, have the house decorated, have gates painted and outoffices provided and insist on modern buildings being put up, but, according to some of the people here, she should not have any claim at all when the husband dies.  I do not believe in that.</P>
    <P>When Senator P.F. O'Reilly was talking I could see that he was a little excited.  I can envisage the solicitors, when this Bill has passed, being very busy men for a long time and the Senator will have a good harvest.  I can also see that auctioneers will have something to do making out valuations and so on, but, in any case, though the Bill is not what it ought to be, if we had the figures, we would find that it covers a very great percentage of the people of the country under this £4,000 limit.  So far as the agricultural community are concerned there are not so many farms making over £4,000 even now.  There are quite a few in each county making well over that figure, but the valuation of the greater percentage would not be at all in the nature of that kind of money.</P>
    <P>Senator P.F. O'Reilly spoke of a Ryan man who married a Brown woman.  I know an Irishman&mdash;I do not know whether his name was O'Reilly, Hayes or Ryan&mdash;who married a brown woman and when he died, all his property went to her.  That is the kind of law I believe in.  In that case there was no actual marriage, as we understand it.  They were married under what is known as the common law&mdash;it was a common-law marriage&mdash; I believe that law is founded on common sense and if people live together as man and wife, even under these circumstances, the man has no right to do otherwise.  Where, perhaps, there are no churches, a man has no right to enter into a contract of that <Col N="485" /> kind without being prepared to accept the responsibilities, and surely we in this country who are married in the churches and make these solemn vows, have no right to change our minds because we may not happen to be blessed with children.</P>
    <P>I believe that great injustices can be caused, and although this Bill will not go as far as some of us would like it to go, I believe it will have a good effect in so far as it will give people who would be very careless an opportunity to make their wills and do some serious thinking.  The results will be far more satisfactory than they <Col N="486" /> would have been if they had died intestate.  I wish to move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
