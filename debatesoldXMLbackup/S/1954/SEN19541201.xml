      <P>It is intended to take the business as on the Order Paper.  It should be stated, however, with regard to the National Monuments Bill, that two Government amendments have been circulated only just now.  If there is no objection, the Bill will be taken as on the Order Paper, but if there are Senators who object to the taking of that Bill, then of course it will not be taken to-day. There is another point.  As the House should be aware, next Wednesday is a Church holiday.  It is not the practice to meet on Church holidays.  The other House is not meeting at all next week. Therefore, assuming we adjourn to-day or to-morrow, we will not meet until the 15th December.  The Solicitors Bill is being considered in the Dáil to-day and I understand that all stages are to be given in the Dáil to-day.  There is a desire to start the compensation fund provided for in the Bill at the beginning of the next solicitors' year, <Col N="408" /> that is to say, on the 6th January.  If the House, therefore, would be prepared to take the Second Stage of the Solicitors Bill either this evening at 7 o'clock, if we are ready then, or to-morrow, the Committee Stage could be postponed for a fortnight.  I think it is essentially a Committee Bill.  If the House is willing to do that, we can take the Second Stage either this evening or to-morrow, as may be arranged, and then take the Committee Stage on the 15th, after an interval of a fortnight.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Minister for Lands to participate in a proposed increase of capital in Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the details of the proposal, a short review of the origin and history of the company may be of interest to the House.</P>
      <P>In 1942 the Gaeltacht Services Division of my Department succeeded in finding a purchaser in Scotland who was prepared to take large quantities of sea-rods.  Export of sea-rods in air-dried state, as supplied by the gatherers along the West Coast, commenced in the following year 1943. In 1947, a private company was formed for the purpose of establishing a factory at Kilkerrin, Connemara, which would kiln-dry the sea-rods, grind them into meal and export the material in the meal form.</P>
      <P>In 1949, the Minister for Lands under an Act passed in that year was given authority to acquire 5,100 shares of £1 each in this company.  Since then, considerable improvements have been carried out in the factory, which has been operating successfully and has provided steady and remunerative employment in one of the poorest districts in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report on the working of the company has been submitted each year for the information of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and the report on last year's operations shows that direct and indirect wages paid at the factory amounted to over £8,000.  In addition, locally-produced turf to the value of over £4,000 was consumed and then, of <Col N="410" /> course, the sea-rods themselves, bought as they are in the poorest areas along the western seaboard, are a satisfying source of supplementary income where it is badly needed.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed to expand the company's activities, first by improving its existing facilities for the drying and milling of sea-rods; secondly, by providing facilities for the purchase and preparation of carrageen for various markets; and thirdly by providing facilities for the production of seaweed meal for cattle food.  Additional capital will be required and this Bill seeks to authorise the expenditure of £37,900 on the purchase of shares in addition to the £5,100 already expended, making a total of £43,000, as set out in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first of the objectives I have mentioned, the company believes that more efficient and economic production can be achieved by effecting some changes in plant and lay-out at the factory in Kilkerrin.  As I have already mentioned, considerable improvements have been made from time to time, including the installation of a Mona jet furnace and E.S.B. power supply, and I am satisfied that the improved lay-out and new plant now proposed will further strengthen the position of the company as a supplier of rod-meal.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal that the company should engage in the carrageen industry it will be necessary to give a brief review of the recent history of this industry.  The quantity of carrageen harvested has been falling steadily in the last few years.  In 1940, 1941 and 1942, this country exported an average quantity of 600 tons of carrageen per annum.  In 1952, 1953 and 1954 the average quantity exported is estimated at less than 250 tons, and the tendency from year to year is downwards.</P>
    <P>As the collection of carrageen moss can be a very useful means of augmenting the income of those living along the west coast, this decline of the industry is a matter of concern, especially so since there is a ready market in America, Great Britain and the Continent, provided that the purchasers <Col N="411" /> can be assured of consistently high quality and regularity of supply. The lack of consistency in these matters has brought about a certain instability in the industry, which is reflected in the decline in the quantity harvested and exported.</P>
    <P>My Department has had the position under close examination, and visits were made to France and the United States to study the organisation and development of the industry in those countries.  Efforts were made to have exporters of carrageen co-operate in an association to safeguard the quality of moss for export but I regret to say that the response received was poor. The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards was requested to develop a machine for the mechanical cleaning and grading of carrageen with a view to securing a general improvement in standard.  This machine was demonstrated early this year to various firms and persons interested in the industry but, so far as I am aware, no one has yet proposed to install it.</P>
    <P>Carrageen moss is a raw material of great value, and its collection depends on the maintenance of a tradition for the work along the western coast.  It is therefore necessary that an effort be made to set a standard which will gain for Irish moss a high reputation in world markets and arrest the present decline in interest among the gatherers by bringing about conditions of stability.  With this object in view it is proposed that Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited, should equip themselves to handle and market carrageen moss to the best advantage and I am satisfied that this step is both necessary and desirable.  I am hopeful that as a result of the company's efforts there will be a revival of interest among gatherers and that the industry will be put on the right road to development.</P>
    <P>Finally, the company also proposes to put itself in a position to produce seaweed meal for cattle food.  In the neighbourhood of its factory at Kilkerrin, Connemara, the company can draw from the richest beds of ascophyllum or bladder weed in the world, and this would undoubtedly be a welcome <Col N="412" /> addition in income to the people of the area.  The company has in fact in the last two years produced limited quantities of this meal by extemporary modifications to their sea-rod plant, and the entire production was sold abroad.  The company is satisfied that there is a reasonable market on the Continent and elsewhere, and believes that with the installation of a suitable plant efficient and economic production could be achieved.</P>
    <P>To summarise, the company is seeking additional capital to enable it&mdash; first, to improve the operation of the existing sea-rod meal business; secondly, to equip itself for the handling of carrageen moss, and thirdly, to provide facilities for the production of sea weed meal for cattle food.  All three items relate to the development and use of native raw materials in parts of our country where natural resources are poor.  The difficulties in the way of improving the economic situation of the people who have to make a livelihood in these areas are so great that it is all the more important that whatever resources are available should be developed to the full.  The Bill now before the House seeks to authorise me to provide additional capital for the company for the purposes set out. Having regard to the excellent work of the company to date and the desirability of the further developments now proposed, I have no hesitation in recommending this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis an mBille seo, dúirt an tAire go raibh sé sasta le stiúrú an chomhluchta seo. Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil mé ar aon-aigne leis i dtaobh na ngnóthaí go léir atá ar bun sa tír seo faoin Stát. Is dóigh liom gur chóir rachmas an chomhluchta do mhéadú.  Sé an t-aon locht amháin a bheadh agam ar an scéal ná nach bhfuil sé dhá leathnú. Ní hionann sin is a rá gur chóir don Aire airgead do chaitheamh ar an dtionscal gan údar.  Má abraím gur mhaith liom a thuilleadh rachmais a bheith á iarraidh le haghaidh an ghnótha, sé an rud is mó atá ar intinn agam go mba mhaith liom go mbeadh <Col N="413" /> forás níos leithne air ná mar atá go dtí seo.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh liom gur tionscal é seo a bhfuil réim mhór éadálach i ndán dó. Maidir leis na slata mara féin, is cinnte go bhfuil an oiread déanta ag na stiúrthóirí agus is féidir leo a dhéanamh go dtí seo sa gcaoi a bhfuil an margadh.</P>
      <P>Maidir le cairrigín, is maith liom go bhfuil an comhlucht ar tí dul isteach ar an ngné sin den ghnó.  Duine ar bith a bhfuil spéis aige i gcúrsaí tionscail ní fhéadfadh sé bheith gan iontas a bheith air faoin spéis atá na hoifigigh a chur i gcúrsaí cairrigín.  Is iontach an méid ábhair a bhfuil cairrigín agus torthaí cairrigín á n-iarraidh ina gcóir.  Tá cairrigín ag teastáil na laethanta seo le haghaidh chuile shórt ó ola ghruaige go dtí an clúdach le haghaidh ispíní.  Tá, mar shompla, aicme chreidimh áirithe ann agus d'fheilfeadh go mór dóibh go mbeadh torthaí cairrigín le fáil ina gcóir siadsan.  Mar adeirim, is maith liom go bhfuil an rachmas á iarraidh ach is maith liom thar aon rud eile, a thabhairt faoi deara gur mian leis an gcomhlucht dul isteach ar bhrainse eile táirgeachta agus go leanfaidh siad den rud a bhí ar siúl acu go dtí seo, oiread agus is féidir leo a dhéanamh leis an ngnó, é a leathnú agus é a chur chun chinn.</P>
      <P>Maidir le grádáil chairrigín, ní fhaca mé an gléas atá curtha ar fáil ag an Roinn ina chóir ach chuala mé an-chuid molta ar an ngléas.  Ní thaitníonn an rud adeir an tAire liom, nach bhfuil éileamh ar an ngléas, nó ar an meaisín, i gcóir na hoibre sin.  A lán de na daoine a cheannaíonn cairrigín nó a bhíos ag plé leis, rachaidh sé rite leo a leithéid de mheaisín a cheannach as a ngustal féin.  B'fhéidir gurb shin é an fáth nach bhfuil éileamh air an oiread agus ba mhian leis an Aire. B'fhéidir go mb'fhiú dó féachaint chuige go mbeadh airgead le fáil ar théarmaí réasúnta, nó fiú go bhféadfaí deontas do chur ar fáil i gcásanna áirithe leis an meaisínre do cheannach. B'fhéidir ansin go mbeadh éileamh air agus go gcuirfí feabhas ar an tionscail dá bharr sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fhaid agus a chuimhním, ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do ghné <Col N="414" /> áirithe den cheist seo.  Mar is léir, ón méid atá ráite agam, táim go láidir i bhfábhar an chomhluchta i gCill Chiaráin do neartú agus do leathnú. Ag an am chéanna is eol dom go bhfuil a leithéidí céanna de thionscail ar bun taobh amuigh de Chill Chiaráin. Tá tionscail feamainne ar bun i gCill Ruis i gContae an Chláir agus is dóigh liom go bhfuil roint imní ar mhuintir Chill Ruis go gcuirfidh an beartas seo as dóibh.  Do bheadh spéis agam i dtionscal ar bith a bheadh ar bun cheana agus níor mhaith liom go ndéanfaí aon docar dó.  Ach do bheadh spéis speisialta agam sa ghnó i gCill Ruis mar gheall air seo: go bhfuil breac-Ghaeltacht taobh thiar de Chill Ruis, thiar ar chósta Chontae an Chláir ar an taobh ó dheas agus go bhfuil seans ann go gcaillfeadh Gaeilgeoirí a slí bheatha mar gheall ar imeachtaí an chomhluchta i gCill Chiaráin.  Níor mhaith liom go neartófaí an Ghaeilge in áit amháin agus í a mhilleadh in áiteacha eile.  Más féidir an dá rud do thúirt linn, sin é atá ag teastáil uaim.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag caint mar gheall ar an dtionscal i gCill Ruis gan aon eolas ró-bheacht agam air.  Casadh duine orm a mheabhraigh dom gur cheap sé go raibh baol ann go ndéanfadh forbairt monarchan Chill Chiaráin dochar don tionscal i gCill Ruis.  Ba mbaith liom go ndéanfadh an tAire machtnamh air sin agus go bhféachfadh sé chuige nach scriosfaí an tionscal i gCill Ruis de bharr imeachtaí tionscail Chill Chiaráin.  D'fhéadfaí a rá nach é an tionscal céanna é atá ar bun san dá áit.  Tá muintir Chill Ruis, chomh fada agus a thuigim, ad iarraidh an gnó seo a leathnú chomh mór agus is féidir leo.  An bhféadfaí comhar nó &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo; a bhunú i slí éigin idir Chill Chiaráin agus Cill Ruis i dtreo is go rachadh an dá cheann chun cinn agus go neartofaí an teanga sna ceantair sin?</P>
    <P>Thairis sin, is maith liom an tionscal seo a bheith ann agus is maith liom chomh maith an méid atá déanta aige le blianta.  Beidh mé ar aon intinn leis an Aire in aon iarracht a déanfar chun an obair seo a leathnú i dtreo is nach mbeidh aon ghá orainn an bun-ábhar a chur as an tír agus go ndéanfar <Col N="415" /> freastal ar an éileamh mór sin atá ag teacht chun cinn ó gach saghas gnótha san mBreatain Mhóir, an Mhór-Roinn agus na Stáit Aontaithe féin.  Is maith liom an Bille bheith ann agus guím gach rath air.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I am only sorry that the amount of money which the Minister seeks is not ten times as much.  This is the type of native ministry which, I think, any Government of this country should foster.  I was rather sorry to hear the Minister say in the course of his address to us that the export market in carrageen had fallen.  For a number of years in our restaurant here it was a favourite food.  I notice that for some time past it has disappeared from our menus.  Those who are better qualified than I to talk about the value and the uses of carrageen have praised it loudly.  I hope that some effort will be made by the Minister to see that carrageen as a food will be brought to the notice of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>Some years ago I know the Department had a special campaign in regard to carrageen as a food.  As a result, there was a general demand for it for eating purposes.  I must compliment the people who produced the carrageen at that time.  It was very nicely packeted.  It was very well presented and it was very attractive in the form in which it was offered to the public. It is regrettable that there has been a falling off.  I would have thought that an industry such as this with the raw materials at our very doors would not only have been developed but extended where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in what the Minister says about sea-rods.  I know something about that work.  The recovery of sea-rods is very hard and difficult work.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to another matter.  It is probably a bit premature to mention it yet.  Research work has gone on in America for the conversion of sea-rods into textile fibres.  I presume it will be possible in the course of time for our Irish ladies to wear Irish nylon stockings made from sea-rod fibres.  I hope that the Minister in conjunction with those <Col N="416" /> other developments in regard to sea-rods will have his Department investigate the conversion of sea-rods into textile fibres.  I understand it is possible with only slight chemical changes to do something of that nature.  Anything that could be done in that connection would obviate our having to import synthetic nylons from abroad as we have to do at the moment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will go all out for the recovery of the export market we have lost in these goods.  Some years ago London importers spoke to me very highly in regard to the carrageen. It is a native product and it is easily recoverable from the sea in comparison with sea-rods.  The Department should seek to recover as much as possible of the export market we have lost.  It does one good to see a Bill of this kind coming to the House as it deals with a native Irish industry which gives employment to workers in the Gaeltacht.  Every member of the House will be glad to see the Minister getting his money.  We hope that the next time he comes he will not be asking the House to base his carrageen developments on £10,000 but will ask for many more thousands or even millions of pounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only natural that I should also welcome this Bill.  If there is any question I have to ask it is in regard to the limit that the Bill puts on the possibility of developing one of our great national resources. In 1949, we first introduced a Bill making provision for the acquisition of shares in this particular company up to £43,000.  The Bill now before us provides that that sum be increased by £5,100.  While it is not always good to relate the advantage to the amount spent on any particular project, to my mind the amount the Minister is now providing will not be sufficient to do the things that his Department&mdash;and I am sure the Minister himself&mdash;would be anxious to do and that we on this side of the House, particularly those of us coming from those particular areas, would be very anxious that he would do.  The commodity that it is proposed to produce in a more up-to-date manner is one, as I have already said, of our natural resources.  Sea-rods <Col N="417" /> have become a very useful raw material for the production of many commodities.  While the amount of money which this House is asked to provide, is only going to ensure continuance of the production, as it has been undertaken up to the present, I would urge the Minister to go much further, and not be content with making provision for its collection.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the employment given, to the amount of natural resources, turf production, etc., that accrue from the development of this industry, I think the Minister should go a step further, and not be content with collecting these rods, and exporting them for conversion into one or other of many essential commodities, for which there is a world-wide market.  When I mentioned this to people who are interested in the development of this industry, they replied that the market here is very limited for the commodities produced from sea-rods.</P>
      <P>While it is true we are making provision for the collection and the conversion of these rods into a material for export to Scotland, there is an industry there where full benefit is taken of the collection and the moneys we expend here.  It is there the raw material is being converted into the many articles that have a very wide field for development. Many of these would be important from our point of view as a dollar earning export commodity, and it is for that reason I would urge the Minister to examine thoroughly, and be very sympathetic towards any suggestions which might be made by the officials of his Department, to fully utilise and fully develop the manufacture of this raw material into a commodity for export.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides, apart from its provision in regard to the further development of sea-rods, and the utilisation of machinery, for the development of carrageen moss, which has a very wide field of uses, including the manufacture of sweets, hair oil and sausage casing.  I think we should, in the same way as we would develop our sea-rods industry, do everything possible to have the complete manufacturing process carried out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> In the Gaeltacht areas, in general, is a very big problem, which the Minister is charged with solving to some extent.  The solving of this problem was at one time thought possible by dividing up the land of the country, and the Minister should realise that the solving of that problem in the Gaeltacht areas, is not possible by that method.  Therefore, the only method open to us is the development of whatever natural resources we have, their full utilisation, and the giving of employment to our young people as far as it is possible to do so.  This is a question that not only interests the people of Kilkerrin, but also interests the people of an area, where as Senator Ó Buachalla has said, there has been, for quite a number of years, the process of development of this industry.</P>
    <P>While it is natural that we in Galway should, as far as it would be possible, be concerned about the further development, we agree that the potentialities of this particular raw material are so great that, if properly investigated, and sympathetically approached by the Minister&mdash;I am sure I am speaking on behalf of all sides of the House&mdash;it would be money well spent, and would provide industries for our people in the districts which have often been referred to as the &ldquo;developed areas&rdquo;.  It is because of that I would urge on the Minister to examine very thoroughly and sympathetically, the possibilities of the complete manufacture of these raw materials, rather than exporting them to some other country, no matter how friendly it might be, which would derive the benefits our people here should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every other Senator I welcome this Bill.  It gives everyone great pleasure to see the Minister bringing in a measure to improve and extend the industry, which has proved reasonably successful in a part of Ireland which, unfortunately, has very much less industry than other parts, a part of the country where emigration, unemployment, and a low standard of living, have unfortunately become to be expected by the people there, as permanent features in their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> I think it is very desirable that industries of this nature should be given an opportunity to expand and develop.  I feel, in the long run, that if anything is to be done to make any real improvement in the conditions of these parts of Ireland, only State industries, financed entirely by the State, or heavily subsidised, can make any real contribution towards solving the problem.</P>
    <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act which really was brought in to see if it would be possible to get a system of private enterprise for Connemara, and for the undeveloped parts of Ireland, has been moderately successful, but from an over-all point of view its contribution to the problem that exists there is small.</P>
    <P>I therefore welcome this Bill, and I am only sorry that the Minister has not given to the House much more money in order to set out on very much bigger production.  I think it is a very great pity indeed that the harvesting of carrageen was allowed to fall so seriously as the Minister indicated in his speech.  He said that between 1940 and 1942 production was 600 tons per annum and by 1952 to 1954 it had fallen to 250 tons.</P>
    <P>I think if we are serious in our desire to improve conditions in Ireland, native industries and native resources, however small, should not be neglected in that fashion.  The Minister stated in his speech that a sum of £8,000 had been spent on wages during the year as a result of the existing alginate industry and £4,000 on the turf used by the factory.  We can easily appreciate how a sum of £12,000 would make a very considerable difference to the people affected and how it would affect their standard of living in what is a thinly populated area.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister the number of persons at present employed by the industry, and what the potential is likely to be.  I hope that in the future the Minister will come back to us with many more projects of this nature.  It is regrettable, as other Senators have pointed out, <Col N="420" /> that this industry is only a subsidiary of the one in England.  I think it is a great pity that we cannot finish the product here ourselves and export it. It is quite obvious that before we reach the position where we can do the full job here ourselves we must improve considerably the standard of our product. We must aim at an increased output before we can seek a very much bigger market.  I welcome the Bill and hope to see the Minister coming before the House again with many more proposals of this kind.</P>

      <P>We all welcome the Bill.  I should like to know from the Minister whether any survey has been made by those competent to do so as to the potential of the market, or markets, for this commodity.  I feel that, if it were well advertised, there should be a greatly increased market for it.  I should, however, like to have some assurance from the Minister that some kind of a survey has been made in regard to potential markets.</P>

      <P>I should like to endorse what the other Senators have said on this Bill.  We all welcome it. I feel, as one who has lived most of his life on the sea coast, that the Minister has been placed in a difficulty as regards the amount of capital provided. With that limited amount of money he can only develop one area on the sea coast.  If, however, the industry has such prospects as we are led to believe it has, then in my opinion more money should be provided to enable the Minister to investigate the possibilities of extending it. We know that all along our western seaboard from Donegal to Cork, our people depend on various types of seaweed, for manurial purposes, for the land.  That goes on all the year round. Seaweed is provided every month of the year for a different type of crop. I have seen the sea-rods, which are grown on the bottom of the sea, collected.  I have seen them cut off the bottom of the sea in West Cork and West Kerry and harvested directly on the spot.  I think, in view of the fact that sea-rods are available all along the west coast, that some further <Col N="421" /> efforts should be made to develop this very important industry all along the coast, and not confine it merely to a little bit of Galway and, I understand, of Clare.  The only fault that I have to find with the Bill is that enough money is not being provided for the development of this very important industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  Its object is the expansion of this industry and, therefore, any effort that is made to bring help to the people in the western areas will be greatly welcomed by them.  I do not profess to know a great deal about the industry because I live inland.  During the last week or ten days, however, a complaint was made to me by people who do know all about it.  As regards the money which they get from a collection of sea-rods and carrageen the people say that the labour of gathering the sea-rods is very heavy.  It is so heavy that the work is calculated to discourage the younger generation from undertaking it at all.  These people point out that the manual toil associated with the agricultural industry has now been cut by almost 90 per cent., due to the employment of machines.  Machines are now available for almost all kinds of agricultural work.  The people I speak of would like if some effort were made to help them by easing the heavy manual labour which is associated with the collection of sea-rods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who make that complaint are well qualified to speak on the subject. They know that these sea-rods have to be wrung from the sea; they have to be cut and carried by the people on their backs to the beach, sometimes up high cliffs, and over very rocky terrain. This is something that we should try to get rid of as soon as possible.  It may, perhaps, be that the people are satisfied with the money which they are getting for the sea-rods, and that the generation which is growing up may be glad to see this factory extended at Kilkerrin with a possibility of extending it still further.  At the same time, some effort should be made to ease the burdens on the people who are engaged in this work.  It involves heavy dragging labour.  It is the lot <Col N="422" /> of some people to have to toil in that manner.  If that is so, then it is the duty of the Government and of the Minister&mdash;I am sure both would be delighted to try and do something in this direction&mdash;to ease the burden and help those people who engage in the work of collecting sea-rods and carrageen. If the Minister and the Government can do that, they will certainly be making the nature of the work more attractive to those who engage in this activity.  At any rate, every effort should be made to try and ease the heavy burden which work of this kind involves at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am sure there must be a ready market for the animal food produced from seaweed, and other types of weed processed in this factory.  If this animal food can be used for live stock, then, I imagine there should be a good demand for it.  In my opinion, there should be a good market in this country for seaweed products if the price is competitive.  If the price is not competitive, there will be no market.  I do not know very much about it, but I make that suggestion to the Minister, that if this raw material is processed properly into animal food at a competitive price there should be a good market for it. There should, however, be no racketeering and no protection for any industry that would take money out of the pockets of the producers who have to buy it to feed to their live stock.</P>
    <P>The pity is that we cannot complete the processing of this material here at home and that we cannot, in Kilkerrin or elsewhere, expand the factory to complete the job that begins on the seashore.  I have been talking to the Minister about this, and I understand from him that there are some forms of processing which cannot be done here.  There is some firm, I understand, in England which has certain rights and has to get certain concessions. They are the only people, I gather, who can handle the project and finish it completely.  If that is so, we cannot do anything about it, but at least we could always be experimenting and always trying.  The officers of his Department and of the Department of Agriculture might see what they could <Col N="423" /> do to bring about a final processing of these sea-rods.  We know they are very bulky when they are dried out, very bulky bundles.  I heard a person once describe them, on seeing a lorry-load: &ldquo;Where are all the sticks of rhubarb coming from and haven't they grown very long?&rdquo;  It is a pity to see this bulky commodity leaving this country to be processed elsewhere.  I blame no one for it, as we have not altogether the technique or the skill to finish it off.  Finally, if we can make any progress in that way, I am sure everyone would like it.  I know the Minister himself would be just as anxious as anyone else.</P>
    <P>With regard to the supply of the rods that come up from the sea, carrageen and these other weeds that are to be processed for meal and other things, there is a never-failing supply and I hope the demand will also be never failing.  In conclusion, I would like the Minister to consult with his officials and try to make available some method which would make it easier for those people to go out and do the heavy work, because if they get that little extra I think they will be more satisfied than anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add one word of praise to the Minister for this Bill? The Minister may not be aware of another potential industry from perhaps other specimens of seaweeds that come to us in the harvest of the sea &mdash;I mean the seaweeds that are now being experimented with for the manufacture of cosmetics.  I am sure the Minister knows nothing about cosmetics. I can tell him in all sincerity that it is a very great business, with great potentialities.  I know that in recent weeks two Americans, who are experimenting and who are trying to get us to experiment, have inquired from Córas Tráchtála about what is being done, what is likely to be done and what they would be encouraged to do in the development of seaweeds for the manufacture of cosmetics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that development and the development that Senator O'Donnell suggested&mdash;the possibility of making textiles and nylon materials for our <Col N="424" /> stockings&mdash;we could go a long way to solving the Gaeltacht problem.  I would sincerely ask the Minister to do a little research on cosmetics in regard to their manufacture from seaweed. No doubt his Department will be able to give him information.  I am led to believe it would lead to big business. I thank the Minister and I hope there will be further research on it.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  Arising out of the remarks of other Senators, I would like to suggest one possibility as the industry develops and that is the possibility of a stronger link between the industry itself and the chemical research departments of the various universities. That is one of the ways in which the necessary processes for developing these industries will lie.  Endowment of research in the universities by industrial firms is now part of the normal processes of university life and I would particularly ask the Minister to direct his attention to this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank the Senators for the reception they have given the Bill.  It is very pleasing to find unanimity on introducing a Bill like this.  I think Senator Hawkins is under a misapprehension about the amount of money that we are asking in this Bill.  If I give again a review of the situation, it might be helpful to all Senators.  In 1949, under a previous Act, a company was set up with £10,000 of share capital.  The Minister for Lands held £5,100 of that and the sister company in England, Alginate Industries, England, held £4,900.  I am seeking in this Bill to increase the share capital to £50,000.  In reality, I am asking the House under this Bill for permission to purchase 37,900 more shares, to put £37,900 more into the company; £2,100 will be put in by the English company; and that, along with the £10,000, makes up the £50,000 share capital which the company will have if and when this Bill is passed. I am especially pleased with the growth of the industry from a modest little factory which at first was a purely private one established in 1947. It was taken over by Gaeltacht Services in 1949 with £10,000 share capital. <Col N="425" /> This Bill proposes to increase the share capital to £50,000 for the purpose of expanding the plant and also for the purpose of expanding the existing sea-rod meal business which has been carried on and which has been a very generous boon to the gatherers along the coast and also to the workmen employed in it.  I would like Senators to understand that this is not alone a development of the existing business but a branching out along other lines that were hitherto handled by private industry and that rose or fell according to the degree of interest put into them.  I am referring to carrageen moss and to the ordinary seaweed or ascophyllum&mdash;we know it more familiarly as the bladder weed that is along our coast on the rocks when the tide goes out.</P>
      <P>Carrageen is a difficult moss to gather, as it grows on the shore&mdash;at such a distance from the shore, though, that it is only uncovered at very low tides, that is, it is only uncovered once a fortnight by the tide and then only for a short period of four to six hours. For that reason, do not expect any spectacular results from the harvest of carrageen, because if the gatherers have only a short period of the year and can only get it for four to six hours every fortnight, when it is uncovered by the tide, a great deal cannot be gathered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Senator ffrench-O'Carroll who asked about the drop in the sale of it.  I think the Senator was forming the impression that the Gaeltacht Services division of the Department was engaged in the gathering and selling of carrageen up to this.  That is not so.  We were not engaged in it and all the gathering and selling was done by purely private individuals. There again it seemed to have a very uneasy life.  I hope I will not weary the House by giving the figures. In 1936 the quantity that was gathered and sold was 216 tons; in 1937 the figure was 396 tons; in 1938 it was 288 tons; in 1939 it was 325 tons; in 1940 it was 606 tons; in 1941 it was 559; in 1942 it was 625; in 1943 it was 532; in 1944 it was 411; in 1945 it was 516; in 1946 it was 411; in 1947 it was 403; in 1948 it was 325; in 1949 it was 353; in <Col N="426" /> 1950 it was 289; in 1951 it was 410; in 1952 it was 255; in 1953 it was 251; and in 1954 it was 202 tons.  I have formed my own opinion about the cause of all this; I think it was due to the war years and that then it fell off steeply again.  As Senator O'Donnell said, it is a valuable source of food and it is used for animal purposes.</P>
    <P>There is one branch of this particular industry that ought to be taken up by us and put on its feet.  Senator Ó Buachalla seems to think that the cost of the machine for cleaning carrageen and putting it into a marketable condition in the shop window was beyond the reach of the ordinary individual. I do not think it is so costly; I have not exact figures, but the impression I had is that it would not be any dearer than a middle-sized tractor and that would not be beyond the reach of those who are going into it. We are not going into competition with private business&mdash;that is the last thing I would like to see.</P>
    <P>I would like to see people purchase these machines, bringing in the carrageen, drying it and presenting it in the most attractive and cleanest possible condition.  Senator Ó Buachalla also mentioned grants for the purchase of such machines.  While I am not certain, I think grants for them would come under the heading of machines for which the Department of Agriculture makes loans available. After all, it would take a clever man to separate the seaweed industry from agriculture and if they are giving loans for the purchase of agricultural machinery, I think by a little stretch they could be given for these machines also.</P>
    <P>As far as the sea-rod industry is concerned, sea-rods grow in 18 feet of water.  They are torn from their moorings by storms, principally in the wintertime, and cast up in heaps on the shore by the storms and waves; but very often they are mixed up with rocks and with other kinds of seaweed and rubbish of all kinds, with the result that the gatherers, as Senator Commons said, have a pretty tough time going out to search for these sea-rods, which they tie in bundles and carry up on their backs to higher ground where they can be placed on <Col N="427" /> drying walls.  They must be air dried. They have to carry out tons of sea water, as I think it is no exaggeration to say that for every ton of dried sea-rods there would be something like seven tons brought out.  It is in the drying process that they lose a vast amount of the moisture.</P>
    <P>The question of making grants available for improving difficult pieces of coast is one that I will look into.  It is quite possible that something could be done under the Special Employment Schemes Office of the Board of Works.  The Gaeltacht Services Division of the Department of Lands makes grants available for drying walls, but not for roads or the improvement of the shore so that the rods can be carried up in greater comfort.</P>
    <P>A third type of seaweed is the ascophyllum or bladder weed that we see most plentifully.  For the past two years a little factory at Kilkerrin, Connemara, has been experimenting with the machinery there in the drying and grinding of some of that particular type of seaweed into meal for cattle food.  It is sold very readily on the Continent, particularly in France.  I am sure the House will be very pleased to hear that our seaweed meal as cattle food got very high praise on the Continent. That type of animal food is extensively used on the Continent and the Irish product was heralded as being the very best.  For that reason, we need not be uneasy about markets. We are pretty sure of a full market for all the carrageen we can sell in the United States and for all the cattle food we can sell on the Continent from the ascophyllum weed.  Prices may rise or fall and we will have to cut our coat according to the measure.  There is no likely change at present and it is rising now, so with good spirits and our heads up we should feel fairly certain of doing well.</P>
    <P>A few Senators mentioned that they would like to see the final processing of the sea-rods carried out in this country.  If I give some of the inside history of that, it may be of interest to Senators.  Some time about 1941 or 1942, an English doctor discovered a means of producing a material, a <Col N="428" /> chemical alginic acid from sea-rod meal.  It was known for quite a long time that it could be produced in small quantities in a laboratory, but it could not be produced economically in large quantities for commercial use.  He discovered how to produce it economically on a big scale and he has the secret; we have not and therein lies the difference.  He has the secret of producing it on this scale.  There is a great market for this sea-rod meal. We have not the secret; if we had, we could go into it.  It may interest the House to know that our firm and the corresponding English firm are the only two in the world that seem to have the secret of producing this very valuable acid from sea-rod meal in the whole world.  We certainly would be delighted to go into it if we could, no matter what Government was in power.  Every possible ton of sea-rods that can be brought economically into Kilkerrin means a lot.  Something like £10,000 was paid to the gatherers last year, £8,000 also was given out in wages in the factory at Kilkerrin and £4,000 was paid for local turf for the drying of the rods and other seaweeds.  That is not bad work since 1949 and it is a very useful development.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla feared that the development of this industry in Connemara might interfere with the private industry at Kilrush.  Senators may rest assured that we are only going to gather seaweed from areas not touched already.  We would not interfere with private industry.  Personally, I would not like to see any Government Department going into competition with private initiative and I think it would be wrong that that should happen.  Senators may set their minds at rest on that score.  There is more than ample seaweed, for the present at least, within a short distance of the factory at Kilkerrin to keep them going full time.  It would not be desirable to put private business out of existence.  If there are any questions I have left unanswered, I will be only too glad to give information to Senators on them.</P>

They could <Col N="430" /> reasonably ask the question: &ldquo;Why ask us to put capital into this?  This is a matter of your own goodwill to do it.&rdquo;  Senator Hawkins seems to think that the English company has a controlling interest.  No, the Minister for Lands has the full control in this case.  He has watched that.  He has full and absolute control.  Senator Hawkins seems to think that the English company has a hold on us some way or other.  It is the other way about.</P>

It would be a good principle for many Irish industries to set aside some of their capital for the granting of research scholarships to the universities.  That principle is observed widely in Britain where the industries concerned give research scholarships and grants to the universities for post-graduate research.  They need not necessarily be specific to the industry.  I should like to stress the fact that some of the money raised might be granted in that way with long term beneficial results.</P>

The Minister states that the purpose of this Bill is to make capital available for the further development of the carrageen moss and seaweed industry in general and that Alginate, London, are not interested in this particular field.  If that is so, I wonder why we have this Bill before us in the <Col N="432" /> form in which it is.  The Bill provides that moneys be made available to purchase additional shares.

      <P>Knowing something about this particular company&mdash;they are very shrewd, hard-headed Scotch business people&mdash;it strikes me as rather peculiar that out of their generosity they should come to the point of making a decision to invest £2,100 in the development of an off-shoot of an industry in which they have no particular interest and from which they would receive no remuneration of any kind.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is correct in his presentation of the case to us, this is not the Bill we should have before us but an entirely different Bill.  The Bill before us should be one to develop the seaweed and carrageen moss industry rather than the particular Bill we have.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with Senator Hawkins in his last suggestion. Why should we set up two industries side by side or elsewhere?  I do not think it would make sense.  The little industry that has been functioning since 1949 was dealing with one aspect of the matter.  We propose to branch out into two other unexplored areas, carrageen and ascophyllum.  Why should we not?  Senator Hawkins asked why is the English company so generous as to put in £2,000 capital as against our £37,900.  The reason is that the branch of the industry in which they are interested and already hold certain shares is also being expanded as well as the two new developments. That is the reason.  Why should they not?  Having gone almost 49 per cent. into the establishment of a former factory, why should we provide all the capital for the expansion of all the industry?  We are asking them to put up a reasonable proportion of the extra capital for the expansion of the plant in which they are <Col N="433" /> interested.  We are putting up all the capital in the two branches in which they are not interested but in which we are vitally interested.</P>

      <P>The answer to the Senator is that it is not.  We would like to see as many branches of the industry established as possible, but I should point out to the House that there is not an unlimited quantity of seaweeds available.  The sea-rods grow in about 18 feet of water.  They grow where the floor of the ocean slopes down to about 18 feet.  Consequently, if the slope is steep, the belt of sea-rods is very <Col N="434" /> narrow and, if it is a gradual slope, it is a wide belt.  In any case, it is not everywhere they grow.  The same applies to carrageen moss, but not in the case of ascophyllum which grows on rocks everywhere the tide goes up and down that we know of.</P>
      <P>The Senator is interested in establishing it in other areas and we will do so, provided the yield of seaweed is there.  We should be only too glad to dot the whole western and southern coastline from Malin Head to Waterford with little factories, provided there is a sufficient quantity of the right type of seaweed there.  It will, however, depend on that.</P>

Why should we put up more than the English who are getting the cream of the process?</P>

      <P>I did not intend that a chain of factories should be set up all around the coast.  I merely intended that an experiment should be made as to buying these sea-rods from the Shannon to Mizen Head and from Mizen Head to Wexford.  I have taken part in the collecting of these rods at low water when they can be cut with an instrument called a crann cam in about six feet of water and they were fairly plentiful.</P>
      <P>With regard to the bladder weed, it is the most plentiful weed I see on the southern and western seaboard.  It is collected very cheaply and easily, and there should be no trouble at all in developing this cattle food business, if the people were made sufficiently acquainted with it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in the Minister's announcement that he would be glad to see an extension of this industry throughout the Gaeltacht areas, but there is one question in that regard which I should like to have clarified.  The Minister, in outlining the setting up of this factory, gave us to understand that it was begun as a private concern by some people from outside.  That statement is not quite correct.  The originators of this industry were a Galway firm from whom the people outside secured a controlling interest.  The Bill provides that we make available a certain sum, a sum of £10,000, and that the other people increase their share capital by £2,000. The important question is: what controlling influence in the further development of this industry has Alginate Industries, London?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister is not quite correct in saying that it would be possible to expand this industry all over the seaboard areas without the consent of the London company.  He also gave us to understand that there were difficulties in relation to the development of the final process due to the fact that these people, as the Minister put it, have the secret.  Therefore, we have come to the point that Alginate Industries, London, have a <Col N="436" /> controlling influence over the development of the company because of their being the originators, having purchased the rights of the original founders of the industry.  By reason of that and by reason of controlling the final processing of the raw material, they have a very active control in the further development of this industry. If that is the case, I should like to put it to the Minister that some steps should be taken to purchase these people's rights out entirely and give the development of this industry over to Gaeltacht Industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator ffrench-O'Carroll asked a very pertinent question as to why it is that, in the former case, we had £5,100 of the capital and the English company £4,900.  We had just barely the 51 per cent. and that was for the establishment of a factory in which they were vitally interested.  We were their lifeline&mdash;if we did not supply their raw material, they could fold up.  It is not so now.  We are supplying the greater portion, £37,900, of the £40,000 proposed increase in the share capital, for this reason, that the English company will have nothing whatever to do with the output of either carrageen or ascophyllum weed. That is the answer.  In other words, this is all our concern&mdash;they are not interested.  They are interested in one thing only.  They are producing a highly valuable chemical from the raw material we supply and for that reason they had a large interest in the first factory.  They are not interested in this one because what we do with carrageen does not affect them and what we do with the ascophyllum does not affect them and they could very reasonably say to us: &ldquo;Why ask us to put capital into this?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Stanford's suggestion and also Senator McHugh's. That is a question I intend to go into fully, because as Senator Hawkins stated, in this particular branch of industry, research, in my opinion, plays a most important part, particularly in a young and growing country like this, which is trying to get on its feet. There is only one way to do it, and that is by just knowing as much, and more, than the other fellow.</P>

John Murphy could sell that policy of insurance to Patrick White, who would be entitled to export the policy, if it were not for this provision, and he could, in that way, get around the ordinary prohibitions in exchange control.  It is not intended that it should cover, for example, the case of a person who has a policy of insurance here, and then emigrates to America&mdash;if this is the type of case that the Senator has in mind.

      <P>As members of the Seanad will remember, I indicated on the Second Stage of the Bill last week that I would ask the Seanad to delete this section.  This section provided that by means of legislation by reference parts of the Real Property Limitation Act, 1874 would apply to State property under this Bill.  Since the Bill was published, we have had some discussion with people in respect to this section, and it would appear that there might perhaps be some doubt as to whether the legislative references in the section are, in fact, adequate.  There is under consideration a new Statute of Limitation Bill which will deal with limitation as a whole and in a more modern way.  On consideration, therefore, I think it would be better if we did not deal with this particular aspect of limitations in this Bill, that we <Col N="442" /> delete the reference to it here and deal with it later as part of the general picture, and as a whole, when the other Bill comes before the Oireachtas. For the benefit of those who are not lawyers, may I say that statutes of limitation as such are, of course, the means by which what are commonly known in lay language as &ldquo;squatters' rights&rdquo; are determined, as well as the number of years for which there must be what is known as &ldquo;adverse possession&rdquo; in order that those squatters' rights become effective.

      <P>There are certain properties which are controlled by the State or, rather, occupied by the State, and I should like the Minister to give us some information about them.  For example, the General Post Office premises in O'Connell Street, I understand, <Col N="443" /> are not State property, and I should be glad to know if there is any possibility of the State getting the ground rent of that property back to its own control.  It seems extraordinary to me, if my information is correct, that the ground rent of the General Post Office in Dublin should belong to what I might describe as a non-national.  It is a serious reflection upon us and I should like to know if there are any other State properties, or properties occupied by the State, which are not in their direct ownership and which would be recoverable and could become State properties as such?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather flattered by the suggestion of the Senator that I would have the answer to such a large question up my sleeve.  There are, of course, many properties held by many people, including the State, subject to rents of one sort or another. Whether the General Post Office is one of these or not, I am afraid I am not aware, but this Bill does not deal at all with the acquisition by the State of new properties or new interests in property of the type the Senator has in mind.  It is a Bill merely designed to regulate the properties already vested in the State, or which become vested in the State by any process.  The question the Senator raises, if it is a fact&mdash; and I quite candidly do not know whether it is or not&mdash;is one which would fall, I suggest, to be considered, with other problems regarding rents, by my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  I have no doubt that the Senator will get such information as the Minister may have, if he takes it up with him.</P>

      <P>This section amends Section 8 of the Principal Act and the point of interest is where the function of the interested citizen comes in.  On whose information can the advisory council or the Board of Works act? If, for instance an individual in a remote country area learns that a monument, which is a national monument, is in danger of decay, or otherwise comes within this section, that person is at a loss to know the steps which he or she should take to have the matter attended to.  I fear that the wording of this section may not cover that, because it states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where it appears to the commissioners, on a report made by the advisory council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If a request or recommendation is made by an interested citizen, will action be taken in that regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator, I think, did not give due advertence to the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  The citizen is covered in those two little words.  It may be, perhaps, an unusual way of so covering him. It is quite clear that the Commissioners of Public Works may act, first of all, on a report by the council; secondly, on a report by one of their own inspectors; or, thirdly, on the report of any interested party such as, perhaps, a local county council or a local authority or a private citizen in the area.  The reason the phraseology &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; is used is to cover all categories other than the council and make it as wide as possible.  The representations should be made by the people the <Col N="445" /> Senator has in mind to the commissioners.</P>

It would appear that this would be the only section under which the surroundings might be dealt with or brought into any Act.  The section says that the commissioners may, by Order, undertake the preservation of such a monument.  Could the power given under that section be stretched so as to cover the preservation of the surroundings of a monument?</P>

      <P>We did consider this matter fairly carefully but, while I can appreciate the anxiety of the two Senators, I am afraid that, in administrative practice, it would be a very difficult amendment, indeed, to put into effective operation.  If we were able to see in the future a really effective way of administering the idea that the Senators have in mind, I, personally, would not object to operate it but, as I am at present advised, I see very great difficulty, indeed, in operating it in any sort of a satisfactory way.  I am afraid that, in fact, far from easing the situation, it would probably have the effect of rendering it more difficult to get national monuments taken over and preserved.  It was on the administrative basis and not on any basis of principle that I was not inclined to introduce such an amendment.</P>

      <P>Here I speak, as the Minister would describe it, as an interested party.  I would ask whether, under this section, there is any hope of preventing the distortion of the front of Leinster House which has now been started?  May I draw the Minister's attention to it if he is not already aware of it?  The intention, I understand from official sources, is to fill in the Doric loggia on the right-hand side of the House as we enter it from Kildare Street, which is an architectural enhancement to the design of the building.  I think the matter is directly relevant, and I want to ask whether it will come under this particular section or not.  Will the Minister have power under this section to prevent what is virtually an architectural outrage being perpetrated on our House?</P>

      <P>I hope the Chair will excuse me, but, under Section 4 he will find that the matter may be relevant because that section says: &ldquo;.... a monument which in their opinion is a national monument&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister whether there is hope that Leinster House will, in their opinion, be deemed a national monument and, if that is possible, whether steps will be taken to prevent <Col N="447" /> these outrages on the design of Leinster House?  Let me give an example.  It may be deemed to be a national monument under this section. When Queen Victoria's statue was removed we had presented to us an outrageous feature, in what I can only call the An Tóstal style, in front of the House.  It cost a great deal of money in fine Dublin granite.  No one likes it and no one knows what it is for.  The only explanation I have had is that it is a jetty to anchor the ship of State in a storm.  It may be that the binnacles may help for that purpose. I am asking the Minister whether, under this section, he or anyone else will have power to prevent such a desecration of a good architectural design as is being perpetrated on Leinster House at the moment?</P>

I would point out to Senator Stanford the terms of Section 4.  I might say, as a matter of opinion, that I am in entire agreement with him as to the granite platform that is outside.  I never understood what it was for.  Quite honestly, I always felt myself that it was only second in objectionableness to the edifice on O'Connell Bridge.  But the work, as the Senator is aware, on the far end of this building, is being carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works, at the request, no doubt, of possibly my Department and possibly the Oireachtas itself.  As a matter of fact, I think it was the Dáil Committee of Procedure and Privileges which required that extra accommodation.  As the commissioners are themselves carrying it out, it is hardly likely that they will serve an order upon themselves under the section.</P>

      <P>I think I raised this matter before.  Would the Minister find it possible to insert between the words &ldquo;monument&rdquo; and &ldquo;as&rdquo; in the second last line of Section 9, &ldquo;or to such other suitable site&rdquo;.  The reason is that the section at present reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the commissioners are the owners of a national monument as defined in sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Principal Act they may, if they think it is desirable to do so, remove the monument to the site of such other national monument as they may think fit and approve.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is possible that it would be more desirable to remove a monument to a site which is not the site of a national monument, or perhaps even to the National Museum itself, and it is to allow for that possibility that I would ask the Minister respectfully to consider the insertion of those words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We already have power to remove it to the National Museum, but as regards removing it to another site, I think the Senator would find in practice that this would create local difficulties, which would be almost insurmountable.  I think it would be much better that we should try and keep our national monuments where they are, if at all possible, and if there is a case where a national monument has to be removed, it would be better, I think, for the sake of preserving our history, to remove it to some other place that has a similar link with the past in the shape of some other monument rather than break the tradition entirely by putting it somewhere in entirely fresh and new fields.  It would, I think, release a flood of requests for monuments to be moved from one place to another.  This would be very undesirable.</P>

    <P>16. Nothing in Section 26 of the Principal Act shall apply to or render unlawful digging or excavation in or <Col N="452" /> under any land solely for the purpose of securing the safety of a monument or archaeological object which is in imminent danger of destruction or decay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might explain the reason for this amendment. Section 26 of the Principal Act was framed in extremely wide terms and, as a result of its terms, it is technically illegal to carry out an emergency or what I might term a &ldquo;rescue excavation&rdquo; without a licence from the Commissioners of Public Works&mdash; that is, in respect of the specific case of excavation concerned.  The present Section 16, which I am asking the House to delete, was designed to facilitate such excavation, but it does not fully rectify the position.  The Minister for Education and the Commissioners of Public Works feel that rectification is desirable, since the position at present is that even a professional archaeologist might be confronted with the situation of having either to violate the law or else fail to carry out his scientific duty of preventing the immediate destruction of a monument or archaeological object.</P>
      <P>This point was raised by Senator McHugh on the Second Reading of the Bill.  The new Section 16 will enable the archaeologist who is confronted with that emergency to deal with it within the law, a thing that he was not able to do prior to the introduction of this amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to repeal Sections 259 and 260 (4) of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.</P>
      <P>Section 259 provides for a six months' limitation period where proceedings are taken by a person who has been detained in a mental institution, the time to run from the date of the cesser of the detention.  Section 260 (4) says that the proceedings shall for the purposes of Section 259 and the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, be deemed to have been commenced on the date on which notice of the application for leave of the High Court to institute the proceedings was given to the person against whom the proceedings are to be brought.</P>
      <P>The proposed repeal of these two provisions of the 1945 Act is consequential on the repeal of the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893.</P>

      <P>During the Second Reading debate, reference was made to the bringing of arbitration proceedings in the High Court.  It was pointed out that it may be convenient for certain parties to bring them in the Circuit Court.  I understand the underlying <Col N="455" /> intention of this measure is to relieve the existing courts of as much litigation as possible and to keep down the cost to the interested parties.  Will this Bill prevent them from having the arbitration in the Circuit Court? There is specific reference in this section to the High Court.

      <P>The function of the High Court in the Bill is simply to exercise a supervisory control over arbitrators in the same way as it exercises such control over courts of inferior jurisdiction.  Proceedings in regard to arbitrations before the High Court would be few and far between and where taken would be taken on affidavit.  To give the Circuit Court power would involve appeals to the High Court.  In reality only questions of law will be involved where the High Court deals with arbitration.  The Circuit Court is, however, being given the same powers as the High Court under Part IV of the Bill, but not, of course, in the Parts II, III and V where, as I have said, the High Court will simply exercise supervisory control.</P>

    <Title>Mortmain (Repeal of Enactments) Bill, 1954&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, which was prepared at the instance of the previous Taoiseach, is to repeal the Mortmain Acts.  Senators will have copies of the Explanatory Memorandum which was circulated with the Bill, so that I <Col N="458" /> do not think I need say very much on the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Mortmain Acts are now for all practical purposes obsolete and the only instance where they arise is in regard to the granting of licences to foreign corporations to hold land. These licences are granted from time to time as of course.  Any alien may acquire land in his private capacity so that if a foreign corporation desires to acquire land, it can in effect do so by taking the land in the individual names of the members of the corporation or by forming a joint stock company in this country.  Even where a foreign corporation purchases land in the name of the corporation, the Irish Mortmain Act of 1792 simply provides that the land shall be forfeited to the State. Alienation in mortmain does not vest the land in the State.  It merely gives the State a right to enter on the land but to complete the title of the State entry is essential, and, until entry is made, the corporation may retain the land.  It is extremely doubtful if any machinery could be devised under the existing law whereby the State could effect its rights of entry.  For that reason the Mortmain Acts do not provide a proper and enforceable remedy where a foreign corporation acquires land without a licence under the 1792 Act.</P>
      <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. The Mortmain Acts were originally measures against religious corporations. We have no longer any such corporations in this country.  Under the Constitution every religious denomination has the right to own, acquire and administer property.  Ordinary business corporations are dealt with under the Companies Acts.</P>

      <P>This Bill is like a number of smaller Bills which we had recently.  It is so uncontroversial that it is uninteresting.  It seeks to remove quite a number of Acts from the Statute Book which, apparently, serve no useful purpose and most of which are no longer effective. Apparently, the Mortmain Acts are still effective in regard to the question of foreign corporations holding land in this country.  As the Minister stated, in those circumstances it <Col N="459" /> is necessary for the Minister either to give a licence or for the foreign corporations to adopt some legal advice to circumvent the Act.  I think the Minister has done a good job in bringing the Bill before us to rid the Statute of these unnecessary Acts.  He has probably carried out what most of us would describe as nipping off a good deal of bureaucracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the introduction of this Bill is a step in the right direction.  It is about time that the people in control of the State would examine how many obsolete Acts there are on the Statute Books and get rid of those that have no practical application to the affairs of life to-day.  There is not very much to be said about the so-called Mortmain Acts.  They are of historical importance now.  They were first introduced for the purpose of preventing certain communities, mostly religious communities, from acquiring more property than it would be good for the State that they should acquire.</P>
      <P>There were several of these Acts. The time has passed when they can be of any practical use.  With regard to the question of the acquisition of property in this State by foreign companies, that is, to my mind, a very delicate matter and would require the most careful consideration of whatever Government would be in power.  We have heard a lot in the past about ordinary individuals who have come over here and purchased land.  The policy that made it possible for them to do that was condemned at the time but I submit it would be worse if any situation would arise where they would encourage foreign companies to come over and acquire property.  However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the commencement, it is a good thing to get rid of these obsolete measures and I would advise the Minister and the Government to have another look at the Statute Book and find out how many more Acts, going back to the time of Queen Acts, we can get rid of and which are hardly ever quoted except, perhaps, by some legal luminary in some part of the <Col N="460" /> country for the purpose of mesmerising the court.</P>

      <P>With my colleagues on the other side of the House, I welcome this Bill.  It is what might be described as a piece of spring-cleaning legislation. All good housekeepers, I understand, hold a spring-cleaning once a year in which they not only clean up the houses generally but get rid of such articles as may have become obsolete and cumbersome during the course of several years.  Quite frankly, I must admit that they get rid of things in the domestic sense which are most dear to the heart of man.  This is a spring-cleaning of the Statute Book.  It is a small step.  Like Senator Kissane, I trust the good work of clearing the Statute Book of obsolete legislation will continue.</P>

I can assure the Seanad that the question of getting rid of all the old useless Acts is under consideration.  We hope to have a Statute Law Revision Bill brought before the Oireachtas in the reasonably near future.  I am certain we will receive the same co-operation when I present the Bill as I received tonight. As was pointed out regarding foreign corporations acquiring land, that can at the present time be done indirectly by the members of a corporation acquiring land individually or by the corporation registering in this country as a joint stock company.</P>

      <P>In regard to Section 5, I would like to raise a point in respect of the licences of factories which have been recently, in my opinion, getting into the hands of people who I think are undesirable.  I would like to bring that to the Minister's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the existence of any circumstance that would give rise to such an apprehension on the part of the Senator.</P>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the Senator to the fact that this section only provides for the addition of conditions to existing licences and spares the Minister for Agriculture the necessity of revoking existing licences before he can add any new conditions to them. As the Senator has mentioned the point perhaps it is right that I should tell the Seanad the general principle which guides the Department of Agriculture in determining whether licences should issue or not to any citizen of the State to enter the fresh meat business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle is that certain regulations are laid down as to the character of the premises, the equipment available upon it, and the ability of the applicant to carry out the regulations <Col N="462" /> made by the Minister for Agriculture in order to ensure the quality of the meat sold from the premises.</P>
    <P>If any citizen of the State is in a position to comply with these requirements, he is entitled to be licensed. If, at any time, his subsequent conduct under licence is of a character to jeopardise the good name of the fresh meat industry of the country, and if after suitable warning and remonstrance and advice, where necessary, as to how to put his house in order, no improvement were found, he would be eliminated from the trade by the withdrawal of his licence.</P>
    <P>I need hardly tell the Seanad that is an extreme remedy to which, I think, recourse has never yet been had, but I avail of the Senator's intervention to say now what I think might want to be said, that owing to the considerable expansion of the dead meat industry it would be any intention to be ruthless in the enforcement of regulations designed to ensure that carcase meat sold from any licensed premises in this State, on the home or foreign market, should conform to the highest possible standard, and that if any licensee, having been advised, or having had his attention directed to shortcomings in the administration of his establishment, failed to put them right, I would deem it my duty ruthlessly to remove him from the trade for the protection of the industry as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Prendergast has raised what seems to me to be a very important question in relation to the Minister's power to amend regulations in regard to the holders of manufacturing licences.  In recent years we have built up a considerable trade in the export of dead meat.  It is quite possible that at some time or another one of these undertakings may come on the market.  I should like to have a definite statement from the Minister providing that, as regards the sale of the goodwill of that particular firm, no new conditions would be attached to the giving to it of an export licence.  Section 5 of the Bill provides that Section 34 of the Act of 1934 be hereby amended, and then the Minister may by notice in writing give <Col N="463" /> to a Holder a manufacturing licence on certain conditions.  I raised this point on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I felt convinced that I had extracted from the Minister then a guarantee that there would be no new conditions attached except the condition that would be attached to every other licensed holder.  Having listened to the Minister to-night, I am not convinced that he has related the statement he has just made to the guarantee that he gave on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be in a position to reiterate to the Seanad and to Senator Hawkins the assurance that any condition applying to any licence Under this section will apply to all licences.  The sole purpose of this section is to remove the present cumbersome necessity of cancelling the whole licence in order to introduce a new condition.  Under the existing law, every licence in Ireland would have to be cancelled and, presumably, business suspended until a new licence issued.  This is merely the machinery to enable us to introduce a new condition into licences attaching to meat premises.  The Senator may rest assured that a new condition applying to any licence of this character will apply to all licences of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to say that, where circumstances entail the transfer of a licence from one individual to another or from one company to another, the same conditions will apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because that would create a category of licences which were not subject to the general rule that any new condition would apply to all licences.  I think that if I were to give the undertaking which the Senator has asked for it would mean that if &ldquo;A&rdquo; transfers his licence in the ordinary course of business to &ldquo;B&rdquo; and if in the course of the next 12 months it became necessary for me to insert a condition which was to apply to all licences I would have to exclude the licence that had been transferred from &ldquo;A&rdquo; to &ldquo;B&rdquo;.  I <Col N="464" /> forget at the moment the number of licences there are, but whatever the number be, if there is a new condition inserted in any one of them that identical condition will attach to every other licence in existence in the State at the same time.</P>

      <P>The Minister is a person who has been engaged in business for a long time.  He knows well that there is what is known as the goodwill of a business.  That means a good deal.  Suppose I am engaged in this particular industry and for some reason or other I decide to sell my interest in it.  What I want to ensure is that the person who will buy my interest, my goodwill in the industry, will get from the Department the same consideration as if I were the person who had continued to carry on the industry.</P>

Nothing of the kind happened in the past under any of the Governments we have had here, and I do not think that such a thing is likely to happen in the future.  If the interests of a person and the money he has invested may be revoked by a stroke of the pen, we have a democratic institution here where these questions can be raised and must be answered. I do not think many holders of licences have any fears or that the fears need to be allayed at present.</P>

If he fails to do so, it is my duty to admonish him, to point out his shortcomings and offer him assistance in carrying out the regulations.  It would be only after full investigation, where a person was maliciously and dishonestly violating the regulations laid down for the protection of the consumer, that I would contemplate withdrawing his licence.  That covers the question of goodwill.</P>
    <P>I understood the Senator to ask also if one of the existing 20 canners could suddenly find a condition inserted in his licence that did not apply to the other 19.  That is not so.  If a new condition is inserted in one it will be inserted in all.  I trust that clarifies the position.</P>

      <P>If any licensee did not comply with the regulations, would the Minister object to the premises being sold and the business being carried on by someone else who would comply with them?  It would be hard if the whole business could be made of no value by the stroke of a pen.  I do not imagine that the Minister would object to its being sold to some reasonable and honest person.  If it were revoked entirely, it would put the workers out of business, just because a managing director, say, was an unscrupulous person.  An effort might be made instead to remove the unscrupulous person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have sympathy with me, as the answering of a hypothetical question might lead me on to the most extraordinary dilemma.  I can conceive a situation in which a licensee so grossly outraged the regulations that it would become the duty of the Minister to put him out of business on the ground that his conduct was so reckless that he ought to be put out.  However, the premises would remain and it would be open to another person to purchase and start up again, conforming with the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture constantly bears in mind that it is the servant of the people and not their master.  It is with the most profound <Col N="466" /> reluctance that we would ever approach a self-respecting citizen, great or humble, with the ultimatum that we were going to wipe him out. Such a necessity has never arisen. When anything has gone wrong, it has almost always been proved to be through want of advice or assistance to get the premises straight and the practice straight.  On that being provided, everything has worked satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on unhappy instances in the past, but there were one or two cases where the Department withdrew a licence.  If the Seanad knew the details, it would cordially endorse what the Department did. These things were not done while I was Minister but while my predecessor was Minister&mdash;and he was perfectly right in what he did.  I am sure the Senator would not wish me to rip up old cases that were effectively disposed of.</P>

      <P>As a member of the live-stock trade, which is slightly allied to the dead meat trade, I support the Minister in his attitude.  The dead meat Industry is a very large one in this country, now running into millions. His desire is that the dead meat produced here will be placed on the market second to none, and any Minister who is striving to do that is doing a good job for the country.  If he is severe in his examination of the factories, that is all to the good of this trade.  If men in the industry cannot measure up to the requirements, he is right in taking power to see that the regulations are carried out.  This is not a tin-pot industry but one with a great future.  Therefore, instead of quibbling on little points, we must accept his assurance that whatever treatment is meted out to one will be meted out to all.  I think that his statement is quite lucid and is understandable by anyone here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have heard from many sides of the House of the importance of this dead meat trade.  It is a new venture, or was in recent years, on behalf of our people. It was not started with very much enthusiasm. For that reason, I have striven to elicit from the Minister <Col N="467" /> to-night certain guarantees&mdash;that those who were the pioneers, who saw its importance and who for one reason or another may find it necessary to dispose of their interest or of the whole manufacturing process of their industry, will not find themselves in competition with those who came in recently.  The Minister is a businessman and has had long association with business.  He must have a very keen appreciation of this question of goodwill. He tried to satisfy me on that point, but I am not satisfied that the suggestions he put forward are sufficient for those who invested their money in an Irish industry and who may wish for any reason to dispose of their interest.</P>
      <P>I have no doubts with regard to the present Minister, as I had no doubts about the previous Minister, but we are dealing with a Bill which gives these powers to future Ministers, and, while the Minister here to-night might be prepared to give us a verbal guarantee that such and such was not his intention, that is of very little use when an Act comes before the High Court.  It is then approached on the basis of what the Oireachtas in their wisdom thought should be enshrined in it and I should like to have something more substantial from the Minister that, where there is a sale of an undertaking of this kind, it will receive from the Department a certificate as to the continuation in operation of the particular industry until such time as something occurs by reason of which the licence might be revoked.  We should not leave it to the discretion of a Minister, even this Minister, who is a very human person and who may change from day to day.  The guarantee which we get from the Minister to-night that these people, who were pioneers of this industry, will not suffer by reason of an adverse decision may not hold in the case of a future Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I do not quite understand what the Senator's difficulty is.  I do not think he can ask to have withdrawn from the Minister for Agriculture for the time being the right to withdraw a meat canning <Col N="468" /> licence from a licensee who has recklessly or maliciously offered diseased or bad meat in cans.  The final sanction, after you have done all you can to get the licensee to conform to the requirements necessary to maintain the standards, is to say: &ldquo;If you will not maintain these standards and if you will not let us help you to maintain these standards, we will not allow you to retain your licence to can meat, because you are a menace to the consumer and put the whole good name of the Irish canning industry in jeopardy.&rdquo;  Therefore, for myself and for my successors, I must ask the Seanad to leave that power in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>If the Senator has any apprehension that a Minister, for reasons of personal spite, or for some reason of that kind, would try to create unreasonable difficulties when one firm sought to sell their business to another firm, or when one individual sought to sell his canning business to another, nothing I can say will reassure the Senator, except to remind him that every citizen of this State has recourse to his parliamentary representative, who can question the responsible Minister in Dáil Éireann as to why he has done something which is unfair and unjust. If the Minister treats any individual citizen of the State, in the exercise of his powers, inequitably, he must answer in Dáil Éireann for it and the matter can be raised on the Adjournment or can be made the subject of a motion and a division in the House.  I think that is the only guarantee of an absolute character that is available to any citizen of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Senator is, however, concerned to have an assurance which he will be quite free to quote and to point to, he can be assured by me that there can be no question of using these powers for the purpose of injuring any person who desires legitimately to transfer his business in the ordinary course of trade.  There can be no question of any Minister hereafter using these powers to impose a condition on one canner that will not apply to all canners.  If there is any more exhaustive guarantee the Senator wants, if he will formulate it, I shall be very <Col N="469" /> glad to consider whether I can give my assent to it, but I think he will sympathise with me that, if we envisaged every conceivably hypothetical case, that could occur to our minds, no Minister will undertake off the cuff to answer back.  I can only lay down general principles, but I assure the Senator that it is my intention, and would be the intention of my successors, I cannot doubt, to abide by it.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers contained in the Destructive Insects and Pests Acts enable measures to be taken to prevent the introduction and spread in this country of the many plant diseases and pests which are prevalent in other countries, but from which we are in most cases free.  Under the Acts powers are given to control the importation of trees, plants, bulbs and similar produce which might be the means of bringing pests and diseases here and also to control the importation of the insects and pests themselves.</P>
      <P>Some countries have in recent years attempted to eradicate insects destructive to crops by bringing in other insects to prey on them.  It is unnecessary for me to point out that in such cases the primary consideration is to ensure that the predatory insects thus introduced do not become a greater danger to crops or to beneficial native insects than is the pest which they are intended to destroy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the control of pests and diseases, while of vital importance <Col N="470" /> to each country, is also the common concern of all nations.  This country shares in international measures for such control through its membership of the European Plant Protection Organisation and one of the measures which that body has recommended member countries to adopt, if they have not already done so, is to regulate the introduction of biological agents for the control of plant pests.</P>
    <P>The immediate cause of the European Plant Protection Organisation's recommendation regarding such control arose from the fact that the authorities in Jugo Slavia proposed to introduce six species of insect from North America in the hope that they would prey on and eradicate the Fall Webworm an insect of which we are thankfully free, but which in Jugo Slavia was causing great destruction to mulberry, fruit, and other trees and bushes.  One of the insects proposed to be introduced might, it was considered, also prove a danger to the silkworm. If this were the case great damage could well be done to the silk industries of continental Europe, as control of the migration of the insect could present insuperable problems. The Jugo Slavian authorities were conscious of this and very properly notified the European Plant Protection Organisation of their proposals, as a result of which the recommendation mentioned was made.</P>
    <P>It may be thought that happenings in Jugo Slavia are so remote as not to be any concern to this country and, indeed, there is no immediate prospect of any deliberate introduction of predatory insects into this country for the purpose of biological control.  It is none the less a sensible precaution to have powers to control such introductions. Another reason why such control is necessary is that countries to which we export produce such as potatoes, may require certificates to the effect that predatory insects do not exist in this country and that we have taken adequate steps to see that they are not introduced.  It is for these reasons that this short Bill contains provision to regulate the introduction of agents for the biological control of plant pests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> The earlier Destructive Insects and Pests Acts have been in operation for a very considerable time and as a consequence various powers are prescribed to be exercised under them by bodies, such as boards of guardians, etc., which have long ceased to exist. These responsibilities were transferred to my Department, which is their proper location by the 1929 Act.  That Act did not, however, formally relieve the local bodies of similar responsibilities and it is to eliminate this duality of function that the further sections of this Bill are designed. When the conflicting and obsolete provision of the earlier Act are removed simplicity of administration should result and the introduction of consolidating legislation to replace the various Acts relating to destructive insects and pests, which it is proposed to initiate at a later date, should be facilitated.</P>

      <P>The idea behind this Bill is an excellent one. We have very complicated international measures to prevent the introduction of disease as far as human beings are concerned and it is very important that the same scientific methods at home and abroad should be employed in regard to the introduction of disease, microbes, pests or whatever the case might be, in regard to plants.  There is one point I should like to raise on this.  While it is essential that we should have this legislation, I wonder, in fact, how practical it is when it comes to the implementation of it?  It is all very well to say that the House gives power to the Government to prevent the introduction of diseases, microbes or pests but in actual practice how is such power going to prevent the introduction of these diseases and pests? I am sorry to say the Bill does not apply to animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the recent example in regard to the question of myxomatosis.  I do not know whether legislation similar to this exists which would give the Minister power to prevent the introduction of myxomatosis.  Let us assume he had that power, how is the Minister or the officers responsible for the implementation <Col N="472" /> of this Bill going to find out how an individual will import micro-organisms or identify the persons or means used to introduce them?  It is an extraordinary thing that one section of the community, to enhance its profits, could be responsible for the introduction of pests, microbes or disease. We had a recent experience in connection with animals where it was done.  What steps are going to be taken to ensure that the very desirable powers envisaged in this Bill can, in fact, be implemented?</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this measure.  I would again say that the introduction of a Bill and the putting of that Bill into an Act is not to my mind the best way of dealing with a position of this kind.  I would suggest that this is one of the matters in regard to which we should make a very serious attempt to get down to our young people in our national schools.  In that regard, I would urge the Minister, if he has any responsibility in that direction, to seriously consider using his influence in having much more attention given to such matters as rural science and nature as a whole, particularly in our rural schools.  We are now introducing a Bill and making provision for many matters.  To the ordinary farmer they are something in which they are not very much interested.  To my mind, the best means by which we could interest people in activities of this kind is, first of all, in the national schools.</P>
      <P>I would agree with Senator ffrench-O'Carroll when he made reference to the virus of myxomatosis.  I think the Minister should have exercised his authority in regard to that matter.  It is one which has very serious consequences because while the rabbit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Therefore, the people who introduced it and who have engaged in this particular activity, did so illegally, as it were, and the Department of Agriculture has taken no steps against such persons.  One might say it is a very small matter.  It only relates to the rabbit pest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House would agree that it is very desirable to give the Minister the power which he seeks in this Bill.  We all realise that it might be possible to propagate diseases of a very dangerous nature introduced from other countries.  Senator Hawkins was quite right in drawing the parallel of the difficulty, which there is in a Government Department seeking to exclude micro-organisms or virus.  This Bill will give the Minister the legal powers to prevent those diseases from being introduced.  That is another <Col N="475" /> question and I think many Senators would have very grave doubts because there are so many ways by which those insects, micro-organisms and disease germs of any kind could be introduced. I think it would be a physical impossibility for the Department to exclude every possibility.  There is even I suppose during war conditions the danger of bad diseases being spread through Western Europe.  This is a possibility that has to be faced and what the Department could do about that matter is a question upon which I would not like to dwell.  I think at the same time it is desirable that the Department should have this power and I think we should even go a little further and in the matter of plant diseases we should have a little more intensive research.  It is one thing to try to exclude those diseases but we have got to face the possibility of failure to exclude them and we have got to face the possibility of their appearance here within this State.  Then the question arises how to deal with them and I think it is on that matter that the Department should do a good deal of research.  We all realise that the farming community has suffered very great losses by reason of plant diseases which affect practically every type of plant&mdash;cereals perhaps in particular, but also root crops of all kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past year has been one of exceptional severity in that respect, and the complete absence of sunshine has had the effect of promoting the propagation of various plant diseases. I think that it is not only necessary to exclude the possibility of new diseases being introduced but also to take steps to deal with such diseases if they are introduced and with diseases which at present operate within the State.  It is saddening to find that there are a number of very devastating diseases affecting cereals and root crops for which there is practically no remedy except to refrain from growing the particular crops until the land has become immune or partly immune.  It would be desirable to set up some kind of research into this whole matter with a view to safeguarding crops of all kinds from diseases.  It would be admitted that <Col N="476" /> good farming practice tends to a certain extent to curb disease.  I am not going to dwell on that particular aspect.  I would merely suggest that in addition to the powers which the Minister seeks in this Bill, he should give the House an assurance that his Department will get to work on measures of research with a view to dealing with existing diseases and with any that may be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell the Seanad that, in addition to the things it actually does, this Bill is submitted as an amendment of the Destructive Insects and Pests Code which Senators will observe in Section 1 comprises a long series of statutes from 1877 down to 1929.  It is my intention to submit to the Oireachtas in the early future a consolidating Bill which will bring into one statute all existing powers. This merely completes the code.</P>
      <P>Senator Cogan has directed the attention of the Seanad to the desirability of promoting research into matters relating to plant disease and parasites of all kinds.  I agree with Senator Cogan that that is very necessary.  That is one of the purposes which I hope the Institute of Agriculture and Veterinary Science will be fully equipped to deal with when we get it established which we hope to do in the early future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator ffrench-O'Carroll asked me how I hoped effectively to exclude insects and pests when I was not able to exclude myxomatosis.  The purpose of this legislation is not only to exclude that&mdash;we will do it if we are able to do it&mdash;but it is also to control, if exclusion fails.  One of the fortunate distinctions that exists between insects and pests and myxomatosis is that myxomatosis has the deplorable habit of running all over the country, whereas insects and pests we may reasonably hope to confine.  I would remind the Senator that when the foot and mouth disease breaks out we <Col N="477" /> do control it.  Because of its nature, it can be segregated more quickly and effective measures taken to circumscribe its incidence and stamp it out.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with myxomatosis, and this has been the experience all over Europe and indeed in Australia and New Zealand, is that whether you tried or did not try to stamp it out, did not seem to have very much effect, the reason being that the disease is communicable not only by contagion between rabbits but by the transfer of the disease from rabbit to rabbit by flying insects.  Every effort was made in France, Belgium and Holland to restrict the spread of the disease and they signally failed.  When the disease arrived in Great Britain all the resources of the British Ministry of Agriculture were marshalled to try and confine it and stamp it out in the south eastern counties of England. The efforts made signally failed.  The fencing off of hundreds of square miles had no effect because it became manifest that the disease was being carried over the fences by flying insects, and, consequently, there was no degree of control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is illegal here.  The person who brought a diseased rabbit into this country, if a diseased rabbit was brought in, acted in breach of the law.  If Senators wish to set down a motion to query why I did not more rigorously prosecute my search for the law breaker, it will be my duty to present myself in the Seanad to discuss it, but I take it that this is not the occasion to discuss the efforts that were appropriate to the outbreak of myxomatosis in this country. Senators, however, know my view on that because I stated it very plainly in Dáil Éireann when I was questioned as to whether it was right or wrong to bring that disease into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are taking power to try and stop the entrance of insects and pests at the point of entry.  I also have the power to deal with a crop if a destructive insect appears in it. Take, for example, the Colorado Beetle <Col N="478" /> which is a genuine menace and about which we are constantly vigilant.  I will have the power, if the Seanad passes this Bill of identifying a crop of potatoes in which the Colorado Beetle appears, of destroying it and of compensating the farmer.  If I had not this Bill I might be in the position that I might have to try and destroy each individual beetle, a thing it would be manifestly impossible to do, but if I have the power of surrounding the area and of destroying all the potato crops in the area and of suitably compensating the farmers, then I think I can tell the House that, in regard to any pest which we know of as constituting a possible danger, we believe we will be able to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I cannot deny that the contingency to which Senator Cogan has referred is always possible, that some pest might be introduced into the country which our best efforts would not eliminate and we would have to make up our minds to try and live with him, as countries on the continent of Europe have had to do.  France has to carry on a running warfare with the Colorado Beetle and cannot get it out. Our aim is to try and prevent pests from coming in here.  I am happy to say that we have had a considerable measure of success so far, and for that we may thank Providence and the vigilance we ourselves have exercised.  But if one does come in we want to have the power from Oireachtas Éireann to take effective new steps forthwith and to put it out again.  These, we will use to the best of our ability, and if our best efforts fail, then I suppose we shall have to try and live as best we can with him. I am sure the Seanad would like to give to the Minister whatever powers he requires, first of all to try and stop the pest coming in and if it comes in to put it out as soon as we possibly can.  That is the purpose of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not here for the Second Stage, as there were some points I wanted to make.  It is a pity the Minister has decided to allow the Red Cross to make charges at all.  I do not think the question would have arisen but for the court case about the ambulance.  In the case of the preventoria, I think it is a great mistake to allow them to charge at all.  The whole success of the Red Cross has been based on its voluntary character, on the unselfish work which everyone associated with it has been willing to do without remuneration. Both preventoria&mdash;in Montenotte and in Ballyowen&mdash;have been able to carry on so far on the local authority contribution for their patients.  The doctors give their services free and no one, apart from the nursing staff and catering staff, thinks in terms of remuneration.  Once the Minister gives permission to charge for patients, the whole voluntary character is altered.  Apart from that, the tuberculosis services at present are entirely free to the patients&mdash;there are no hospital payments, no contributions and no fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the fact that it will alter the character of the tuberculosis service, it will interfere with the fine concept of the Red Cross in itself.  Once they are in a position to make a charge, many of these people giving voluntary service will begin to think in terms of fees, remunerations and salaries.  It is a great pity that a commercial aspect should enter into the <Col N="480" /> running of this institution which has been running so well so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that will be the position as mentioned by Senator ffrench-O'Carroll?  I do not think that the giving of this liberty will influence those who are giving voluntary service or prevent them giving it in the future.  As one with some connection with the Red Cross Society in Cork City and with the preventorium in Montenotte, I think Senator Crosbie very rightly paid a tribute to those medical men who have given service there.  I do not think anything in this Bill will prevent that system from obtaining as long as the institution is there.  I agree that, except for those members of the staff looking after the patients, the others do not get as much as one penny remuneration. We would all be very keen on maintaining that spirit.  I would be glad to hear whether the Minister feels in the same way as Senator ffrench-O'Carroll. I would be surprised to hear that he does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Hickey and differ with Senator ffrench-O'Carroll, that the securing of these moneys for the upkeep of the children has in any way altered the voluntary character of the work done by the preventoria.  Senator Hickey and I know of the work in Cork.  We know that the only people who are paid are the nurses, the domestic staff and the catering staff.  The doctors do not receive any money and all the office work is done voluntarily.</P>
      <P>Senator Hickey may not agree with me on this point, that we are receiving far too much per capita for the children. We get the same amount for them as is given for the adult patients in hospitals where you have patients getting surgical and medical treatment of a most expensive kind.  The same amount is paid for tiny children who need only rest, nourishment and but little medical care.  It might be suggested to the responsible Minister that the amount be increased for the adults and not reduced for the children; but it always struck me as an anomaly that the same should be paid for the children as for serious surgical work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> I do not know if I am right in bringing in here a request to the Minister for a firm assurance that in the running of this ambulance service the Red Cross will never get into competition with private enterprise.  You had yesterday in Cork an excellent example of the proper use of Red Cross ambulances, when they rushed to Cobh with the military ambulances to assist in the dramatic sea rescues 40 miles out from our coast.  They were waiting there all day.  That is the sort of work that the Red Cross should be doing. Private enterprise ambulances, charging by the hour for delays like that, would be very expensive.  That is Red Cross work and the Red Cross should restrict itself to that.  I hope the Minister will never allow the society to get into competition with ambulances of companies earning their living by hospital work.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I wonder if it would be in order to suggest to the Minister that he should encourage the Red Cross, as he has power to do, to develop the plan for the care of the aged, the technical name for which is geriatrics. I do not know if he can make money available for that, but I suggest he use his power to encourage them in every way to bring that plan to a head as soon as possible.  Much talk and planning has gone on about it.  I know it is not easy.  A certain amount of work has been done in Dublin, but not anywhere else, so I would ask him to encourage the work in his influential way.</P>

      <P>Before there is any further misapprehension on this point, may I say this section is to enable the preventoria to receive the moneys from the public health authority?  If this power were not here, some fadist could take action to make them close down.  I am making sure that the preventorium in Montenotte can continue without any fear of being brought into the High Court by someone who would say: &ldquo;You are charging, because you are getting money from the local authority.&rdquo; There is no intention to change the type of service that is being rendered in Montenotte, but they will not be <Col N="482" /> put to the trouble of a big law suit, as I am throwing the mantle of protection around them.</P>
      <P>On the question of the ambulances, I was quite specific in that and I have adopted a very unusual course.  I have submitted a draft of the Order which I intend to make and which will be laid on the Table of the House, to prevent competition with private concerns. I think everything is well under control and that the Red Cross will not at any time attempt to exploit this power.  As the law stands at present, everyone who went out and rendered all these services to ships or anywhere else did so voluntarily but the people who received the service cannot make even a subscription to the Red Cross.  They will have to wait for 12 months to see that no one could say it was a payment.  Under this section the Red Cross can accept these subscriptions and send a receipt for the money received.</P>

      <P>It can happen and does happen, as we all know.  Ministers <Col N="483" /> have laid Orders on the Table and they have never been discovered until some point relating to them comes up for discussion.  In this case, the Minister makes an Order which may affect private enterprise, and the only way in which private enterprise can become aware of it is if some member of the House is sufficiently diligent to find the paper laid on the Table and then goes to the private concern and says it is going to be affected by it.  I have no solution to offer as to how this could be overcome and how all Orders made by the Minister may become public property; but I think that where Orders are made by Ministers which affect private enterprise, they should get some other form of publicity than a mere laying on the Table, because, as I have said, quite truthfully, the majority of people in this and the other House do not read them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which has the advantage <Col N="484" /> of having been considered by the previous Government as well as by ourselves. But the real credit for it must go to the solicitors themselves acting through the Law Society.  They are to be congratulated on their enterprise, particularly as the Bill imposes more burdens on individual solicitors than it takes away.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum indicates the main changes to be made in the present law and is a fair summary of the Bill.  I think Senators will not wish me to delay them by going over all the ground covered by the memorandum and I shall, therefore, at this stage only refer to the changes which are of particular interest to the public, that is, the proposed accounts regulations and the compensation fund.</P>
      <P>The Bill requires the Law Society to make regulations providing that a solicitor must keep his own money separate from clients' moneys and trust moneys. This is, of course, what every businesslike solicitor actually does at the present time and the only effect of the proposed change in the law is simply to make it a matter of legal obligation for all solicitors to do what most of them already do.  But no system of accounting, however good, can afford complete protection for clients and that is why there is provision also for a compensation fund.</P>
      <P>The Fund will be financed by annual contributions from solicitors.  After five years there will be full indemnity for clients' losses except where the Society consider that the client himself has contributed to the loss, in which event the amount of compensation to be paid will be at the discretion of the Society. When the Fund is put on a full indemnity basis, the Society will have power, if the financial situation so requires, to levy a special contribution not exceeding £5 on each solicitor in addition to the ordinary annual contribution of £5. At present it is impossible to forecast the extent to which there will be demands on the Fund but I have no doubt that the Society will be anxious to meet claims in full even within the first five years, if it is at all possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to mention the desirability of having the Bill enacted before the 6th January next. <Col N="485" /> The Bill proposes that on that date the Compensation Fund will be established and that solicitors will send their annual contributions to the Fund along with their applications for practising certificates in respect of the coming practice year which commences on that date.  If the Bill is not passed into law by that time, the establishment of the Fund will be delayed until the next practice year comes round.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that the general principles of the Bill are acceptable to all Parties in the House and I ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

Tá cúpla athrú á dheanamh agus is dóigh liom gur athruithe chun maitheasa iad.</P>
      <P>There is not very much to be said about this Bill.  I welcome it because I know very well that the subject matter of it has been under consideration by the legal profession, the Incorporated Law Society, for a number of years.  Its purpose is to control and regulate the conduct and practice of the legal profession&mdash;not, of course, that we can say, or should say that there has been anything like misconduct on any wide scale that would merit the attention of the general public.</P>
      <P>It is always better to have these things regulated by law.  There is now for the first time to be established a fund out of which clients in future will be indemnified in the event of defalcations that may be caused by the improper conduct or dishonesty of certain solicitors.  I think that is a step in the right direction and that the solicitors themselves will not begrudge the contributions they will be called upon to pay for the establishment of such a compensation fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see also that there is a provision by which it is proposed to exempt coming solicitors from stamp duty on their qualifying in their profession. I think that that should also apply to the other branch of the law&mdash;<Col N="486" /> barristers.  Barristers have also to suffer rather a stiff stamp duty and I think they should be brought into line with the solicitors.  That has been done in this Bill in regard to solicitors, but it should also apply to barristers but maybe that is a matter for future consideration.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill also it is to be ensured that solicitors will have to keep separate accounts.  I think that is a very good thing.  As I think the Minister said, it probably is the practice already that the vast majority of solicitors keep proper accounts and make sure to have their own private accounts segregated from their professional ones.  Now it is being made a legal obligation.  That, to my mind, is all to the good.  I welcome this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it should be said about this Bill in the first instance that it is a Bill which has been drafted in consultation with various Governments by the Incorporated Law Society, but it is not a Bill for the protection of the solicitors' profession.  It is a Bill for the protection of the public.  Its provisions are meant to assist and protect the public and not to protect the profession.  It does not change the law that has been observed, but it gives power to the Council of the Incorporated Law Society to see that the law is constantly and properly observed for the benefit of the public.</P>
      <P>The compensation fund is also provided for the benefit of the public. Generally, this Bill is one which is very properly a public Bill brought in by a Government because it concerns the public interest.  It is a Bill, as has been remarked, which can, of course, be more properly discussed in detail in Committee.  Nearly all its provisions are intended for the benefit of the public and in that way it is a very desirable measure.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is unusual for a layman to dip into things like this.  It is a professional matter but Senator Hayes explained it was a Bill to protect the public.  I was very pleased to hear it.  I notice in the explanatory memorandum that it is a Bill to regulate professional practice and conduct and to enforce strict <Col N="487" /> discipline in the profession and so on.</P>
      <P>I had an experience two years ago where a person had occasion to report to the Incorporated Law Society what he considered to be misconduct on the part of a solicitor.  That charge was duly investigated by the Incorporated Law Society.  Among the charges preferred at that meeting of the Incorporated Law Society was one for overcharging.  The President of the Incorporated Law Society informed the person concerned that if the Bill of Costs was taxed there was no doubt in the world but the charge would be regulated.  That was very nice and the person concerned went to three different solicitors but none of them would get the Bill of Costs taxed.  It was again reported to the Incorporated Law Society and while that society investigated the charges the matter still remains as it was.  I wonder is there any justice or protection for that person in this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to regulate the conduct of the profession.  Well, if the profession can regulate its own conduct sufficiently and adequately, then so much the better.  I have an idea that the general public does not come into contact with the legal profession very often, fortunately for them.  I say that in no carping tone at the legal profession.  In the past few years an increasing number has had contact with solicitors in relation to the purchase of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience of a lot of those people has been that whilst there has <Col N="488" /> been no misconduct as such there has on quite a few occasions been neglect of duty.  I am sure Senators, like myself, must have had numerous examples of difficulties in regard to the completion of the purchase of a house and in getting a loan passed.  We find on numerous occasions that the purchaser is told by the solicitor that it is, of course, the corporation, the county council or the Department of the Government that are at fault&mdash; the civil servants as usual.</P>
    <P>When the matter came to be investigated we found that instead of the Government, corporation or county council being at fault it was the purchaser's own solicitor.  The general public looks upon the legal profession as having something like the same etiquette as the medical profession where you trust your life to a doctor.  We do on occasions trust our money and our affairs to a solicitor.  I cannot complain. I have had no instances, as I say, of misconduct or dishonesty.  I am afraid, however, that there have been too many cases of neglect of duties. If this Bill and the legal profession themselves can improve on that position it will be very welcome.</P>

      <P>I should like, in welcoming this Bill, to agree with Senator Hayes that it certainly reffects the greatest credit on the profession for having initiated it.  The Senator pointed out that it is not altogether for the protection of the solicitors but to indemnify clients who suffer because of dishonesty.  There are complaints from time to time in the local bodies about the excessive legal charges made by solicitors but, of course, that does not come into this Bill.  I would not be carrying out the wishes of many of my colleagues on various bodies if I did not avail of this opportunity to comment that these charges are regarded as excessive and weigh very heavily on those who have to bear them.  As it is, this Bill will be welcomed by the general public as a safeguard against the rare cases of dishonesty that has characterised the conduct of certain solicitors in so far as their clients were concerned.  However, it will, I believe, give greater protection to members of the general public <Col N="489" /> who have from time to time to engage solicitors to carry out their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I do so, not only as an individual but as a member of the Council of the Incorporated Law Society, on whose behalf I would like to thank the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Boland, for all the time and attention they paid to it. The Council of the Law Society has been trying to press this Bill for about 15 years.  As several Senators have said, it is not a Bill which really proves of any benefit to the solicitors' profession itself, but it does help the profession to strengthen its own hand. It is intended to give to the Council of the Law Society powers very similar to those the Medical Registration Council, the Veterinary Council, and the Dental Council already possess. The powers that the council are taking are similar to those already given to the Council of the Law Society in England, so that the Bill is designed to protect, not the profession but the people whom the profession serves. The solicitors' profession is probably unique, in that it is a profession which has to make itself unpleasant to a lot of people very often.  A doctor enjoys the great advantage in coming in contact only with his patients, who invariably experience his kindness and help.  Unfortunately for himself, the solicitor has to spend much of his time standing on the toes of other people in the interests of his client, and it is for that reason also that it is necessary to strengthen the hand of the Council of the Law Society in dealing with these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting forward this Bill, the Law Society has been anxious to give the public the utmost protection that could possibly be given.  Senator O'Sullivan has spoken of one case which he says did not receive the attention it deserved. I can honestly say that I happen for a number of years, to be a member of the Disciplinary Statutory Committee, which at present exists, and I certainly cannot recall the case which Senator OSullivan mentioned.  As Senator O'Sullivan knows, the law has always provided that the fees of a solicitor can be taxed by the Taxing Master, and there is never any <Col N="490" /> difficulty if a client wants to tax a Bill of Costs, in going to another solicitor to have them taxed.</P>
    <P>I would say if Senator O'Sullivan would give particulars of the matter which he mentioned, to the Law Society, it would certainly be looked into. As regards the reference made by Senator Ruane to delays, I am afraid that one must recognise that the law is like other professions.  Delays on matters are often very difficult, and from time to time occur.  One of the objects of the present Bill is to enable the Council to deal with cases in which there is anything in the nature of real delay.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Senators who have spoken in support of the Bill. Members of my profession believe that the effect of the Bill will be beneficial for the public, and therefore for the law in general.</P>

      <P>I welcome both the Bill and the Minister to the House.  I would not have spoken at all were it not for the statement which I appreciate Senator Cox made honestly as a member of the profession.  He brought to my mind one of the burning questions on which I am sorry to say this Bill does not go far enough.  I hope there will be some legislation introduced to regulate the fees of the legal profession.  Senator Cox mentioned that his profession are not in the position of the medical profession. Surely anybody will have to admit that the work of the medical profession in saving lives is as important as the acquisition of a lease of a bit of ground.  I say that in proportion there is no comparison with the fees charged by the legal profession and I want to see something done about it.  Take for instance the case of a man in the middle income group about to acquire land and build a home for himself and his family. There are hundreds of such men prevented from doing this because they dread the legal costs.  It is not fair that in a percentage of cases of the acquisition <Col N="491" /> of the site loan charges and mortgage fees are entirely out of proportion. I have no hesitation in saying that they are exorbitant and I am sorry that there is not something in this Bill to prevent such fees being charged.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it protects the public who give their trust to the profession.  Until this Bill is enacted, the public have not the protection we would like them to have. While Senator Cox has stated that this Bill is for the protection of the public, I am sorry it does not go far enough by having a clause to protect the public from the fees charged by the legal profession in this country.</P>

When it was first decided by the First Dáil that we should set up an independent Irish Parliament, it was necessary that we should get the support of those in the legal profession. I think we got that support wholeheartedly, and because of that wholehearted support at that time, it was possible to organise and develop the Arbitration Courts then in existence. If it were for no other reason I would welcome this Bill to give a recognition of the conditions put before us by the organisation of such a body as the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is one to which we can give more detailed examination in Committee.  Many references have been made to solicitors' charges and to the conditions which should be laid down for solicitors.  I think we are all agreed on the general acceptance of the principle of the Bill.  As I said at the outset, if the Bill had nothing more to recommend it than the part which the legal profession played in the establishment of the institutions of this country, I for one would be prepared to support it.</P>

      <P>Senator Hawkins has to some extent said what I wanted to say on the Bill.  I want to <Col N="492" /> join with him in welcoming the Bill for the reasons which he has stated. I think we owe a tremendous amount in this House to the profession affected by the Bill.  I do not think that the Constitution of this State would be as good as it is were it not for the fact that it is the brain child of a solicitor who, I am glad to say, is with us in the House.  As an industrialist I welcome the Bill. Solicitors are constantly engaged and their advice is sought in all matters relating to industrial activity.</P>
      <P>The one point that I want to refer to is the matter of delays.  These have been with us ever since Dickens wrote on the subject.  Somehow there are qualities associated with solicitors' offices which are quite unique in this modern world.  They seem to be places where no one gets flurried.  We all know that when the young members of the profession come fresh from the universities they are all out for change and to make this a new world. But, in course of time, that spirit soon wears off and they begin to take things at a slower pace.  If the public have any complaint at all to make it is that the delays associated with the work of solicitors seem to be unnecessary and over long.  I should like to pay a tribute to the solicitors' profession in this country.  With very few exceptions, it has never blotted its copy or dirtied its escutcheon in any way.</P>
      <P>I think that, in accepting this Bill, we should avail of the opportunity it presents to us of paying tribute to the members of the solicitors' profession for what they have done for this country, for the help they have given in building up our legal institutions, for our Constitution and for the guidance which they have given to us.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the members of the House for the way they have welcomed the Bill.  It is really a Committee Bill so that the matters raised on the Second Reading can be discussed in greater detail when we reach that Stage of it.  I should like to point out that the remuneration of solicitors is strictly regulated by Statute.  There is no other profession that I know of where the remuneration <Col N="493" /> or fees charged by the members are regulated by Statute in the same way as the remuneration of solicitors is.</P>
      <P>In the memorandum which I circulated with the Bill, I explained that one of its main objects is to regulate and re-enact, with modifications, the existing law as to solicitors except the law concerning solicitors' remuneration.  In this particular case, solicitors are making sacrifices for the benefit of the public.  I cannot speak too highly of the assistance which the solicitors' profession has given me, as regards this Bill.  We should remember that they are prepared to put a levy on the innocent members of the profession in order that the public interest may be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that during the last 33 years I have had considerable experience <Col N="494" /> of the work of members of the profession, solicitors and barristers. As members of the House have said, I have never heard any complaints about them, other than the complaint which people make when they say that things are too dear in the shops or that the work of a tradesman is too costly, or something of that kind.  I think that, on the whole, one can say that the members of the solicitors' profession are worthy of our best support and thanks.</P>
