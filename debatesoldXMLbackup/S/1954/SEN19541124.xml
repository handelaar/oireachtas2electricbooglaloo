      <P>It is my painful duty to-day to bring to the notice of the Seanad the death, within the recess, of our friend and colleague, Senator James Green Douglas.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas was a member of Seanad Éireann almost continuously from its inception and was Leas-Chathaoirleach during the period 1922-1925. He was prominently identified with the public life of the State and took a keen interest in its economic development.</P>
      <P>In politics, James Green Douglas was, from his early youth, a Nationalist and a close friend of Arthur Griffith. In the difficult days of 1920-21, he undertook great responsibilities in the administration of the White Cross Fund.  In that work, he not only displayed moral and physical courage, but his knowledge of business and his resourceful mind helped to add to the fund and ensured that the moneys were put to the best practical use.  His backing of his countrymen during the period was of invaluable help.  He was regarded as a sound authority on constitutional law and, following the adoption of the Treaty, he was invited, with others, to frame the Constitution, and he was a member of the committee whose recommendations were eventually adopted. He subsequently took part in the work of several commissions and committees, including the Postal Commission in 1922, of which he was chairman, and which resulted in a considerable reorganisation of the country's postal services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas was deeply interested in the work of the Seanad and <Col N="206" /> was in constant attendance.  He served on almost every committee set up for its reorganisation or betterment.  It is only those who had the privilege of serving with the late Senator during his public life who can appreciate to the full the great gifts he brought to the service of his country as a parliamentarian. His address to the House displayed a lucidity of thought, precision of language and a marshalling of argument that made appeal not only to his hearers but to the wide public outside.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas took his parliamentary and other public duties very seriously and to the last, despite failing health, he continued to attend the Seanad.  His loss will be keenly felt by all members of the Seanad.  Of a courteous disposition, he was popular with members of the Oireachtas of all Parties.</P>
    <P>To the widow and relatives of the late Senator, I shall convey, with your assent, your sympathy and appreciation. Solás Dé le na anam.</P>

      <P>As members of the Seanad will be aware, when this Bill was circulated to the members of the Dáil a fairly full White Paper, by way of memorandum, was circulated at the same time. In that memorandum the provisions of this Bill were explained in some detail. I think, therefore, that with that memorandum before the members of the Seanad, as well as a record of the discussion that there was in the Dáil on the Bill, it will not be necessary for me at this stage to enter into any very long exposition of the terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The memorandum that was circulated also indicated the circumstances why it is necessary that this Bill be now enacted.  Senators are aware that it was considered desirable, as far as possible, to provide that more permanent legislation would be introduced to cover those matters which were formerly dealt with under the Supplies and Services Act which has been reenacted every year for some years past. That Act was, of course, as its very title indicated, a temporary Act.  It is better and more desirable, however, that the work involved under it should be enacted in another form, and for that reason this Exchange Control Bill, together with other Bills of a similar nature, are being brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchange Control Bill now before the House is modelled on the Order that was made first of all under the Emergency Powers Acts, and then under the Supplies and Services Act. In so far as the framework of this Bill is concerned, it has been drafted on the basis that it is desirable to take less power than there was under the previous Order, if that were possible. The Bill, therefore, does not include any power that was not in the previous Order made under the old Act.  In <Col N="209" /> fact, certain powers that were in that Order have now been dropped.  There was, under the Act, and there is still at present until this Bill is enacted and until the old Order is revoked, power to acquire gold coin, bullion and securities.  That power has been abandoned, and is not included in this Bill.  The other changes which are being made are minor changes and are introduced for the purpose of facilitating administration.  They certainly do not include any new restrictions.</P>
    <P>Senators will have noticed that this Bill expires in 1958.  It is so expressed because the Government feel it is desirable to show on the face of the Bill that it is not a measure which we hope will be permanently necessary.  No one can tell at this stage whether it will be possible to end exchange control before that date or not, but the House may rest assured that, at the earliest possible opportunity, it will be the desire of the Government to end that control.  I must, however, make it clear that the present indications are that such an event as the ending of control on both capital as well as on current account, and the free convertibility of sterling, are not likely to occur for some years.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as Senators will have noticed, is framed as an enabling Bill so that detailed administration can be carried out by Order.  The necessity for that arises because we hope to ease controls bit by bit and it would, obviously, be impossible to come to the Oireachtas every time it was feasible to ease some little control.  Therefore, it is better to arrange for the enabling provisions which are set out in this Bill in order to be able to carry out detailed administration by the Orders made under it.  I think that what I have said covers the general scope of the Bill.  Having regard to the memorandum that has been circulated, and the discussions which have taken place in the other House, it is not desirable for me I think at this stage to take up the time of the Seanad by going into any further detail as regards the provisions of the Bill.  Of course, if any member of the House wishes to get an explanation of any provision in the Bill, I shall be happy to afford such <Col N="210" /> explanation as it is in my power to give.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis an mBille seo, is fianaise é nach bhfuil an tsíocháin idirnáisiúnta fós ar fáil.  Ní hamháin go gciallaíonn sé nach bhfuil an tsíocháin ar fáil maidir le cúrsaí polaitíochta ach ciallaíonn sé go bhfuilimid tamall fada ó réiteach maidir le cúrsaí trádála idirnáisiúnta.  Tá súil agam ón méid adúirt an tAire agus ón méid atá sa mBille agus sa meamram nach mbeidh an Bille seo i bhfeidhm níos fuíde nó cheithre mbliain.  Dhá bhliain nó cheithre bliana tá siad fada go leor, ach do bheimis buíoch dá mbeadh an tsíocháin ann maidir le cúrsaí polaitíochta agus trádála faoi cheann an achair sin.</P>
      <P>Chomh fada agus is féidir linn a dhéanamh amach, tá dhá phríomhchuspóir ag an mBille seo agus is deacair gan aontú leo.  Déanann an Bille iarracht ar chosc a chur le onnmhuiriú mí-dhlistineach rachmais na tíre.  Tá fhios againn go ndéantar iarrachtaí ó am go ham ar nithe den tsaghas seo a dhéanamh agus is riachtanach go mbeadh an chumhacht ag an Aire agus ag an Aireacht cose a chur le himeachtaí den tsórt sin.  Is dóigh liom gur ceart go bhfaigheadh an tAire an chumhacht sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thairis sin, déanann an Bille seo cumhacht a thabhairt don Aire an t-airgead atá saothruithe nó dlite don tír, a riaradh ar mhaithe le leas na tíre.  Tá rudaí eile sa mBille agus dá mbeadh fonn ar dhuine díospóireacht fhada a dhéanamh bheadh cuid mhaith scóip ann chuige sin.  Tá ann earnála a bhfuil baint acu le hionaistríocht airgid. Ceapann daoine go mbeidh gach rud ceart an lá a mbeidh ionaistríocht ann. Ansin is ea a thosnaíonn an trioblóid. Níl aon dream is mó a thuigeas an baol ar hionaistríochta a chur i bhfeidhm ná na Sasanaigh.  Ní cuspóir ann féin é ionaistríocht &ldquo;convertibility&rdquo;.  Dá mbeadh sé indéanta amárach ní hionann sin is a rá go mbeadh gach rud ina cheart.  Dá mbeadh an ionaistríocht indéanta maidin amárach níl aon dabht ná go mbeadh baol ann go gcuirfeadh sé tús le trioblóid, i dtaobh na trádála coigchriche&mdash;go mór mhór i gcás tíre mar Shasana.  De bharr an ceangail <Col N="211" /> trádála atá againn le trádáil Sasana níl aon dabht ná go mothóimis é dá mbeadh aon trioblóid trádála a cur as do Sasana.</P>
    <P>Sé an trua go gcuireann an Bille seo isteach ar chearta pearsanta an duine. Níl aon dabht ná go ndéanann an Bille é sin ach ar mhaithe leis an tír is dóigh liom gur cheart duinn géilleadh agus na ceartanna sin a thabhairt suas ar feadh tamaill bhig.  Tabharfaimid an Bille don Aire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was sorry I had to leave the House for a few moments while the Minister was introducing the Bill.  On that account, the matter I am about to deal with was possibly raised in my absence.  In Part 5 of this Bill conditions for the export of goods outside scheduled areas are laid down. They are also mentioned in the White Paper.  It seems to me that those nonscheduled areas comprise the most of Europe, countries such as Holland, Denmark, Belgium, and the Scandinavian countries.  These are countries in which those of us who are industrialists are trying at the present moment to find an export market. What reaction will Part 5, Section 17 (1) have on these industrialists?  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The exportation of goods of any class or description to a destination in any territory, other than the scheduled territories, is hereby prohibited, except with the permission of the Minister, unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) (i) there is produced to the Revenue Commissioners the prescribed evidence that payment for the goods in such manner as may be prescribed in relation to goods of that class or description exported to a destination in that territory has been made to a person in the State, and</P>
      <P>(ii) the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the amount of the payment that has been made is such as to represent a return for the goods which is, in all the circumstances, adequate,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Revenue Commissioners are omniscient but I do not know how <Col N="212" /> they will decide what the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; means in relation to payment for these goods, unless they accept the amount stated by the exporter.  Surely we are not going to arrive at a point where the Revenue Commissioners say that in their opinion the payment is not adequate. I raise this only for interpretation.  I may have misinterpreted it myself.</P>
    <P>I know everyone is anxious to see exports develop and that any section that might retard exports would have serious consequences for us.  It may be that there was some ulterior motive in the draftsman's mind, not known to the man in the street.  Because of my complete ignorance, I ask for an assurance from the Minister that there will be no complete prohibition of export of any goods to territories other than those in the Schedule, if manufacturers here desire to find a market, and, furthermore, that no test of adequacy will be required other than the usual ones and the certificate of origin from the manufacturers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that we have no exchange rate for our currency and therefore no control over it?  I would like the Minister to expand on that and give us an idea as to future legislation. I understand we have no exchange rate.  Is it in the interest of the £ sterling we are dealing, when we talk about exchange control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Ó Buachalla indicated, this is a Bill which is necessary in the circumstances of the time and which will be necessary until there is complete convertibility between the currency of one country and that of another.  We must accept the factual position.  It is to provide for that factual position that the Bill is necessary.  Senator O'Donnell referred to Section 17, which deals with payments for exports. This section was discussed at some length in the other House and, as the Senator may have noticed from the report of the Debates, the original word in the Bill as drafted was not &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;.  The wording was changed to &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; following objections and representations in the Dáil by Deputy MacBride.  The section <Col N="213" /> does not give the Revenue Commissioners any overriding powers.  The Minister remains the determining person on exchange control, as he is at present.  In fact, Senators will see that the powers given to the Revenue Commissioners are powers to deal with cases where permission has not been granted by the Minister.  Therefore, it is merely the detailed prevention, where the consent of the Minister has not been obtained, that is dealt with in Section 17.</P>
      <P>This Government&mdash;as, of course, every Government&mdash;is particularly anxious that every effort be made by our industrialists to expand exports. Nobody need have any apprehension that there is anything in this section that would affect or prejudice or operate to prevent any genuine export of goods.  The section is necessary to prevent what is not a genuine transaction. If it were not there, it would be possible for a person to export his capital by way of goods, bringing no payment back to this country at all for those goods.  For example, in the case of goods to the value of, say, £10,000, it might not be possible under the existing exchange facilities of the time, to permit a person to transfer £10,000 worth of capital in terms of money into dollars to send to America and an application for a dollar credit to transfer it may not be within the exchange facilities of the particular period.  If this section were not there, that person could buy goods here to the value of £10,000, send them to America and get no money back, and by that device he would have the dollars in America in a way that was not intended or desired.  Exporters can rest absolutely assured that no genuine transaction will be prevented under this section. On the contrary, the Revenue Commissioners and my Department will be only too anxious to facilitate any desire to expand exports to any other country.  The section is necessary purely to ensure that a non-genuine exportation can be prevented by the Revenue Commissioners, who are in control of our frontiers from the point of view of smuggling.  The export of goods could be used as a smuggling device, if I may so phrase it, to get over exchange control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> Senator Hickey raised a point that I think is outside the ambit of this Bill. This is a machinery Bill, to enable us to operate in existing circumstances. I feel the Senator will forgive me if I say I do not think he really expected me to enter, on this Exchange Control Bill, into a long discussion on the link with sterling.  Some other time we may have that pleasure.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum was circulated with this Bill.  The Bill contains many detailed provisions which members of the Seanad probably will agree are more suitable for discussion on the Committee Stage.  The main purpose of the Bill is to make provision, in accordance with paragraphs (3) and (4) of Article 10 of the Constitution, for the management and alienation of State lands.  The Constitution of 1922, Article 11, provided that lands which were State lands immediately preceding the 6th December, 1922, were to be controlled and administered by the Oireachtas in accordance with such regulations and provisions as should from time to time be approved by legislation.  That article went on also to provide that they could be granted by way of lease or licence for terms not exceeding 99 years.  The enacting legislation under that Constitution was brought in in the State Lands Act, 1924.  Senators will see that it is proposed to repeal that Act now under this Bill.  Article 10 of the present Constitution provides that legislation can be brought in to provide for the management of lands which were State lands.  The article, however, does not restrict the method of dealing with State lands in the same way as the provisions of the Constitution of 1922.  We are not now restricted <Col N="215" /> to alienating State lands for periods not longer than 99 years.  Accordingly, in this present Bill there is no similar restriction.</P>
      <P>Under the procedure in the 1924 Act, before any lease or licence of State lands could be executed, it was necessary to get a formal tabling of the proposal in each House of the Oireachtas.  In many instances that caused undue delay, particularly in respect of the smaller and more unimportant lettings, as, for example, cases of letting on the 11 months' system and often weekly and monthly tenancies. It was very often found not feasible during a recess, particularly, to bring a number of leases on land into operation because the Houses were not in session.  Accordingly, what we propose in this Bill&mdash;a proposal which I may add was welcomed on all sides of the House when the Bill was in the Dáil&mdash; is that there should not be that necessity to put on the Table of either House details of proposed transactions in advance but that every six months there would be laid before the Houses specific lists showing all dealings that had taken place in State lands during that period.  By that method each House will be kept informed of the transactions in respect of State lands, and it will not have the hampering effect to which I referred in cases where it was necessary to await the sitting of the Dáil or the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains provisions by which it is possible for the State to accept gifts of lands to the country. There has not been any such general provision up to this, and whenever any question like that arose previously it was necessary to have special <i>ad hoc</i> legislation for the purpose.  The provision now will be that whenever a gift or bequest to the State is made, it can be covered under this Bill when it is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a great many very detailed matters dealt with in the Bill, some of them of an extremely technical nature and I would propose, if the House agrees, to leave over any question of <Col N="216" /> explanation of these detailed technical matters until the Committee Stage.  I would further like to say at this stage, that I propose to ask the Seanad on the Committee Stage to delete Section 18 altogether from the Bill.  Since the Bill was published, I have had some discussions in relation to that section which deals with the limitation of claims by way of reference to the 1874 Statute of Limitations.  On reconsideration I feel that it would be better not to legislate by reference under Section 18 of this Bill but to introduce at as early a date as we can a comprehensive measure dealing with limitations in general.  A modern statute to deal with such limitations would be far more satisfactory.  Limitations, of course, are the things that the lay person, if I may so describe him, normally thinks of in terms of squatters' rights, and as I say we propose to take steps to provide a modern Statute of Limitations and in the light of these steps it is not necessary to have Section 18 in this Bill at all.  I propose, therefore, to ask your leave to have this section deleted on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill, which we consider to have been many, many years overdue.  It was surely regrettable that we found ourselves in the position in this country for a number of years past that we had State lands and property lying derelict throughout the country.  Much of that position, of course, resulted from the fact that this country was held by another State and that many of these lands were taken for the purpose of holding the country in subjection, but by no stretch of the imagination could these lands or properties be considered necessary for the protection of our own country now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time different Ministers of all Governments have found themselves in the possession of lands for which they had no use, which were not being used for the good of the country and which they could not operate for any useful purpose.  When local authorities or possibly some local enterprise required any of these State lands or buildings for any useful purpose, they found that it was impossible <Col N="217" /> to get them except on a 99 year lease with complications and the result was that many useful purposes for which these State lands and properties could be used had to be abandoned for want of a Bill like this.  This is a complicated and technical Bill about which we will have something to say when it comes to the Committee Stage and, though it has taken many years and many Governments to produce it, we have it now and we welcome it.  I am sure the different Departments of State will be able to take advantage of it in various ways, to use State property in some profitable manner for the State.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter and that is that while the British held this country they compulsorily acquired most of this property from the natives.  We know what the anxiety for landed property has been among the natives of this country for many generations.  We know the natives have never forgotten that they were deprived wrongfully of their land and you have at the moment in this country the successors of those people who have never lost sight of their claims to these lands.  The Land Commission have from time to time recognised these claims but unfortunately were in the position that they were unable to do anything about it.  I expect that under this Bill when it is enacted these claims will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>One matter which I do not understand is why it is suggested that there will be six-monthly publications of the transactions after the transactions have been carried out.  Could these six-monthly publications not be issued before the transactions have actually taken place?  I do not see what point there is in having these six-monthly publications when the thing is all over and done with.  Nothing can then be done about them.  They would, of course, be useful as a matter of information but apart from that I do not see what useful purpose can be served. At any rate I welcome the Bill and trust that it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate the <Col N="218" /> Minister on bringing in this Bill.  If the records of the Dáil are looked up, it will be found that I asked many questions about those lands, and how they were acquired over a period of years.  One thing which has always struck me, in going from Cork to Dublin, is the amount of land in the Curragh that is not being put to proper use, and I would like the Minister, when he will be giving us full details, to give us some knowledge of what will be done with the many acres of land in the Curragh.  I have also in mind land at Fermoy for which we pay £224 a year for use as a training ground for our soldiers, and on which they are not even entitled to play football or hurling.  The State has been taken through the courts&mdash;not in recent times but as far back as 1938 and 1939&mdash;when the Minister for Defence was sued for damages because soldiers played hurling and football on those lands.</P>
      <P>I would also appeal to the Minister, now that we have an opportunity of dealing with State lands, to divide the land amongst people who need land, who will look after it, and make good use of it.</P>

      <P>While I welcome this Bill, there are at the same time certain safeguards, in regard to which I would like to have an assurance from the Minister, as to whether they were going to be put into operation, either for letting or disposing of any lands by the State.  The Minister, in his statement, referred to the difficulties that already exist because of the formality of having to give so many months' notice, by laying on the Table of the House particulars of either letting or selling.  While that might be so, we cannot afford to go to the other extreme; we cannot afford to have the letting of State lands undertaken without sufficient advertisement, without sufficient notice being given to the local people that these lands are there for their tender.  I think that would be the proper procedure for the State to adopt, so that it would be done publicly and above board, and that there would be sufficient notice <Col N="219" /> given to those people, who might be interested, to tender.</P>
      <P>In regard to sale, I understand that the purpose of this Bill is to enable State Departments to dispose of lands that are no longer required where it is necessary that it should be done.  Here again, I think that the very widest publicity should be given, because of the fact that it is a State sale, so that afterwards there would be no accusation or suggestion made against the State, or a particular Department, that it was done in a particular way.  We in this House have a certain responsibility in passing this Bill, because of the power it gives to the State to dispose of their lettings or dispose of lands as a whole, and I think the least we should procure from the Minister is a very clear and definite statement as to the procedure that will be adopted, in either the lettings or the total sale of any property, of which the State proposes to dispose.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Sullivan made reference to the return of lands in which there have been dealings, and that is referred to in Section 10, subsection 6.  That return, as the Senator I think appreciates, is a return that is made after the transactions have been concluded, for the purpose of letting in the light of day on them, and so that the members of each House can always&mdash;in the words of Senator Hawkins&mdash;satisfy themselves that everything has been completely above board in relation to those transactions. First of all may I make this clear? The difficulty has arisen, at the present time, that it has not been possible to arrange lettings during the recess of either House of the Oireachtas, because under the 1924 Act, the proposal must lie on the Table of each House, and this has often meant a very substantial delay, that has resulted sometimes in considerable loss of revenue to the State.  The provisions of the Bill will obviate that delay and at the same time obviate that loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan and Senator <Col N="220" /> Hawkins may rest absolutely assured that, except in the most special circumstances, sales or lettings of State lands will be carried out after public advertisement, and that the availability of those lands will be made known quite clearly to the public, so that all concerned will have an opportunity of making their bid and making their application accordingly.  In special circumstances&mdash;there are a couple of circumstances which occur to me, for example, if State lands were required by a local authority for housing purposes&mdash;I think members of the Seanad would agree that it would be desirable that the local authority should get those lands, rather than that there should be an opportunity given otherwise. Similarly, there are often cases where it would be unfair not to give an occupying tenant an option to purchase at a proper and reasonable price.  You might perhaps also have a case where there was a small piece of State land that was land-locked, and completely surrounded by land belonging to somebody else, where you would be in the situation of creating bad feeling, perhaps, if you did not offer it, at first, at a fair price to the person whose land surrounded it.</P>
    <P>The general principle must clearly be that there must be the widest information given to the public about land, or about buildings, or any property of the State, which the State does not require, and which, therefore, can be disposed of.</P>
    <P>Senator Hickey mentioned the Curragh and also some property in Fermoy.  There have been some legislative difficulties in respect of the Fermoy property, which among other things, will be relieved by this Bill, and it will, in fact, permit the State, under this Bill, to surrender the property for other desirable purposes, or if the State in fact has to get out of an onerous prohibition, or a covenant in respect of that property. The position in regard to the Curragh is a slightly different one because there are certain substantial rights of private individuals provided by the Curragh <Col N="221" /> Act of 1870.  The Senator can rest assured that, for obvious reasons, it being situated in my constituency, I am just as anxious as he would be to try to see if an adequate solution of such problem as there may be there could be found.  I appreciate that in this House there are no politics and no constituencies, and, if it were not for that, I should be rather worried in case Senator Hickey was thinking of coming up to stand for the constituency of Kildare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing legislation in respect of national monuments is that comprised in the National Monuments Act of 1930. There have been some practical difficulties which have arisen over the years in the administration of that Act and this short amending Bill is introduced for the purpose of clearing up some of these difficulties and enabling solutions to them to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Principal Act, the Act of 1930, defines the word &ldquo;monument&rdquo; in a very comprehensive manner and enables either the Commissioners of Public Works, on the one hand, or local authorities, on the other, to become guardians or owners of any monument, the preservation of which is a matter of national importance by reason of historical, architectural, traditional, artistic or archæological interest attaching thereto.  Senators will agree that that is a fairly wide definition.  There are, luckily, in Ireland many monuments of such interest.  We can pride ourselves on being rich in monuments, but unfortunately it is not possible for the State to take over and assume <Col N="222" /> ownership of every monument which might be considered worthy of preservation.  We, therefore, have to choose some of these monuments and to select those which we consider to be the most important.</P>
    <P>At present, there are about 500 monuments or groups of monuments in the ownership or guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works. About 200 of these were dealt with under the Act of 1930, the balance having been dealt with in earlier Acts. In addition, preservation Orders under the 1930 Act were made in about 200 cases, preventing demolition, removal, injury or defacement of the structures covered by the Orders.</P>
    <P>As I indicated this Bill is a Bill to amend the 1930 Act and the amendments which are proposed are mostly of a machinery or administrative character. There is a power included to enable the transfer of monuments, if it is considered desirable, from local authorities to the Commissioners of Public Works.  Under the existing law, local authorities cannot so transfer such monuments and the Commissioners of Public Works cannot accept them.  There is also a provision included in the Bill to expedite preservation Orders in case it is necessary more urgently to take steps to preserve some monument or some structure.</P>
    <P>There is a special provision dealing with temporary preservation Orders which will afford protection to monuments which are discovered to be in immediate danger of injury.  There is at present no power for the Commissioners of Public Works to transfer a national monument which they own to the site of another national monument, if that should be considered desirable. Members of the House will, I am sure, visualise circumstances in which that might be extremely desirable and accordingly, the Bill contains a provision enabling that to be done.  A part of the Bill also strengthens the position with regard to restricting the illegal export of archæological objects and we have included a more appropriate basis for the National Monuments Advisory Committee.  By these <Col N="223" /> arrangements, the tenure of office is changed and more latitude given in the nomination of <i>ex officio</i> members. While, as I say, the general question of our monuments is one in which we are all interested in a general way, the framework of this Bill within that general statement is one of machinery, machinery by which the aim we all have in mind can be achieved and again it is a matter for discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Sa nGaeltacht tugaimid faoi deara go bhfuil athruithe móra ag teacht, agus cuid de na hathruithe seo is maith linn iad agus cuid eile ní maith linn iad a bheith ann.  An saghas tighthe a bhí ann leis na céadta blian, tá siad ag imeacht.  An té a cuireann spéis ann tiúrfaidh sé faoi deara na hathruithe seo ó theach go teach agus ó cheantar go ceantar.  An cineál troscáin a bhí sna tithe seo, tá sé ag athrú freisin; an cineál éadaigh a chaitheadh na daoine, tá sé siúd ag imeacht agus an cineál nua ag teacht isteach ina áit.  Ar an slí chéanna tá athrú mór ag teacht ar an gcóras bídh, ar an gcóras cocáireachta, ar an gcóras tionscail agus ar an gcóras talmhaíochta.  Sé an rud ba mhaith liom, agus is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé in am againn tosú ar roinnt mhachnaimh a dhéanamh air, go gceapfaí in áit éigin sa tír ionad a <Col N="224" /> mbeadh Muséum na ndaoine le bunú agus le cothú ann.  Ní heol dom aon áit abfhearr in Éirinn lena haghaidh sin ná Gaillimh.  Theastódh 8, 9 or 10 n-acraí talún lena aghaidh agus níor mhór tithe d'aistriú isteach ó na Gaeltachtaí, agus bailtí féin d'aistriú isteach ann.  Níor mhór na seanghléasanna, idir gléasanna tís agus gléasanna ceirde a bhailiú agus a chur ar fáil sa Muséum sin chomh maith. Is dóigh liom gurb é an rud ba cheart a dhéanamh freisin, a leithéid sin de Mhuséum a bhunú agus é a fhágáil faoi stiúrú Ollscoil na Gaillimhe.  B'fhéidir le Seandalaiocht gur cheart go mbeadh an tOllamh le Léann agus lucht Ceilt mar chomhairleoirí i stirúrú a leithéid de Mhuséum.  Ní rud nua é sin.  Tá a leithéid le fáil sa tSualainn agus tá sé le fáil san Ioruaid agus tá sé le fáil i dtíortha eile&mdash;in aon tír a bhfuil meas acu ar a stair.  Sílim go bhfuil sé in am againn tosú ar a leithéid sin a chur ar fáil faoi choimirce Ollscoil i nGaillimh.  Ní féidir a leithéid a dhéanamh i gceart taobh istigh de thalamh an Choláiste féin.  Ní mór dúinn dul amach agus áit cheart lena aghaidh d'fháil chun é a bhunú i gceart. Cosnóidh sé airgid é a chur ar fáil, ach ba cheart dúinn é a dhéanamh mar gheall ar chomh tábhachtach agus a tá na rudaí seo.</P>
    <P>Chosnóchadh sé cuid mhaith airgid a leitheid de Mhuséum a chur ar bun. Ach is dóigh liom go dtiúrfadh a leithéid de Mhuséum a lán airgid isteach sa tír agus go n-íocfadh sé as féin i gceann tamaill.  Is maith liom go mór spéis a bheith ag an Aire sna sean-nithe seo agus ba mhaith liom go dtúirfaí faoi deara go bhfuilimid ag fuagairt an spéis atá againn sa stair agus go bhfuil tuiscint againn ar chomh tábhachtach agus atá na nithe seo.

      <P>Táim ar aon aigne leis an Seanadóir Ó Buachalla. Séard a bhí beartaithe agamsa i dtaobh rud amhain adúirt an Seanadóir go mbeadh an musaem so i mBaile Átha Cliath in ionad bheith i nGaillimh ach do bheadh sé fuirist an cheist sin do réiteach ar ball.</P>
      <P>This is a very desirable Bill.  The Principal Act was good enough at the time.  Some difficulties have been found in connection with it.  The real difficulty is not so much the administration of any Act of this kind but the purposes with which the Commissioners of Public Works will be animated. They have done a great deal of good work.  In view of the amount of money which would be available for this purpose, the Minister was, of course, absolutely right when he said that we cannot preserve all our ancient monuments as we would like.  May I say on this point in relation to what Senator Ó Buachalla said, when concluding, that this matter of the preservation of ancient monuments is not only a question of sentiment?  People who have no care for the past can have very little hope for the future.</P>
      <P>We should endeavour to preserve all our past without making a choice merely of things that are Gaelic.  We should preserve the beautiful objects of any of the peoples who came here whether as invaders or otherwise.  A choice must be made as the Minister said and it is not always easy to make that choice.  The Principal Act and the Bill itself provide that the choice should be made by the people who can give the best opinion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this whole question is one of arousing interest and that interest should be aroused by teaching as far as possible local history in the schools.  The people who lived in this country and who never heard of constitutions, laws, parliaments or republics for the matter of that were very patriotic but their patriotism was of a different nature from the fashionable patriotism of the moment.  They lived and loved their own districts, not their own <Col N="226" /> counties.  They knew the name of every field, hill, stream and cliff in their own area.  The decay of the Irish language has meant the decay of that knowledge has lead to a diminution of love of the land.  The money spent on matters of this kind would not be wasted.  It would have the effect of improving national morale and possibly would have important economic effects as well.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a special plea for one particular scheme associated with a particular building.  The Royal Hospital at Kilmainham is the very best 17th century building in this island.  I happen to have some knowledge of it because as far back as 1923 a proposal was made to move the Oireachtas to the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. At that time, therefore, I had to make considerable acquaintance with the building and I learned that it was a very beautiful building and I got to like it both inside and outside.</P>
    <P>At the moment, I understand that there is dry rot in the roof.  I do not know precisely what expenditure we will require to make that right but I would like to suggest to the Minister that since it is actually Government property and the land surrounding it is also State property it would be a great shame if this building were allowed to fall into decay.  I should like to make a proposal similar to that made by Senator Ó Buachalla.  It is a great reflection on us that we have nowhere in this country an open-air folk museum.  Indeed, I should have said a folk museum because when properly run and managed one may not only require a considerable space outdoor but also buildings for the exhibits which must necessarily be indoor. The suggestion I was going to make was that if the Royal Hospital were restored it could be used to house folk material.  It is a very beautiful building.  You would also have available about 40 acres for the display of everything connected with the life of Irish country people.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ó Buachalla has said, there are museums of this kind in Sweden.  The one in Stockholm attracts <Col N="227" /> 1,000,000 visitors a year, and therefore, it must have a considerable income because a charge is made for entry.  I would propose also that there should be a charge for entry here.  There is a fine folk museum in Holland.  There is also a folk museum in Wales, in Cardiff in a building donated by a nobleman there.  A folk museum is planned for Edinburgh and also for Belfast so that it might happen in this country that if you want to know how the Irish countryman lived, what tools he worked with, what kind of a bed he slept in or what kind of a house he lived in, you would have to go to Belfast instead of Dublin or Galway to find out.  The position here is that this particular building, the Royal Hospital&mdash;when I was a youngster it was called the Old Men's House&mdash;has a wonderful situation.  It is actually within the City of Dublin.  It has splendid views and there is plenty of land attached to it, so that nothing at all would have to be done from the point of view of purchasing either a building or ground.</P>
    <P>Immense changes have taken place in this country in my lifetime.  I am constantly in touch with very young people, and I find that things that were quite common to me, a person born and reared in Dublin, are now quite unknown to them.  I found lately, for instance, that out of 22 people only one had ever seen an earthen floor.  The Irish language should certainly be used for the purpose of showing people what Irish country people were like.  It is essential that that should be done through the language.  There is a new generation growing up, some of them who never saw the inside of a thatched house, who never saw a forge and who think that the shoemaker is a person who stands up with rivets in his mouth and hammers them into a shoe on an iron last.  They do not know the meaning of the word gréasaí in Irish or shoemaker in English at all.  They have never seen a man making a shoe.  That applies to the ordinary trades and crafts, apart from basket-making and boat-making which might be regarded as important but perhaps unusual.</P>
    <P>In this country we have records of the history of Irish chieftains, of <Col N="228" /> Gaelic aristocrats as well as a good deal of history about Anglo-Irish nobles and English Queens and Lords Lieutenant, but almost nothing at all about the Irish countrymen who bore the brunt of all our history and who, up to the 19th century, fought all our battles.  It is quite clear that whatever happens the Irish language, Irish folk life is bound to go.</P>
    <P>No one wants to stop people getting better houses or from using machinery instead of hand crafts, but the State certainly should do everything that possibly can be done to preserve a picture of what Irish life was like a 100 or even 50 years ago.  The changes during the last 30 or 40 years have been at an extraordinarily fast rate, so that before it is too late I think exhibits should be collected and set out in an appropriate place.</P>
    <P>The place that I suggest is the Royal Hospital with local museums in other places.  If you had something of that kind it would prove very attractive to our own people because they cannot love their country unless they know something about it, and the most important part of it I think was life in rural areas.  It would also, I think, prove attractive to tourists because what tourists like most when travelling is to see what is most native and most peculiar to the particular country they are visiting.  It would be possible to set all that out in an attractive manner and to get a considerable sum of money from visitors if we were able to show them all those things which were so characteristic of the life of the country and which are now disappearing&mdash;the work of various people like blacksmiths, wheelwrights, basket-makers, saddlers, coopers, sieve-makers with a general collection of their tools and implements.</P>
    <P>During the war, for example, people discovered that a sleán was used for cutting turf, but how many knew that the word had 20 or 30 different meanings&mdash;that there were different sleáns in different areas.  The same thing applies to turf ricks, hay ricks and to houses.  Anyone travelling northwards will notice the change in the style of houses when he crosses the Boyne. <Col N="229" /> One of the advantages of the proposal which I should like the Minister to consider carefully is that if you had a building like the Royal Hospital you could put into it domestic features such as a kitchen, a dairy and bedrooms. That would obviate the necessity of building an outdoor erection. I think it could become a centre of folk life and of research with prints and pictures of country life.  All that would provide a picture of what the country was like 100 years ago.  A great deal of that is disappearing daily before our eyes.  I think that before it passes we should make a determined effort to see that we preserve it for future generations.  Not only would it be good from the national point of view, but it would be a duty fulfilled, and we would reap economic advantages from it as well.</P>
    <P>I have here a handbook of the National Museum of Wales at Cardiff and it defines pretty well what a folk museum is.  I might read two sentences from it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A folk museum represents the life and culture of a nation, illustrating the arts and crafts, and in particular the building crafts, of the complete community, and including in its illustration the activities of the mind and spirit&mdash;ceremonial, drama, dance and music&mdash;as well as of the hand.  Such museums are in two parts: a building for the systematic display of the materials of life and culture, where the research student can study the details of folk life in exhibits emphasising the evolution and distribution of types, their chronology and many other problems. The environment of the national life is presented in the open-air section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is something which concerns by no means research students only.  Here we have folk life and folklore which are of very great interest to continental scholars and students.  Apart from this altogether, it would be a wonderful thing for our young people to be able to see how the Irish countryman lived and worked.  The Minister will have accomplished a great deal in his time if he can do two <Col N="230" /> things.  One of them is the preservation of a very beautiful 17th century building&mdash;though by the way, the site has historic associations going back to early times&mdash;and Bully's Acre, a burial ground where it was thought for a time that Robert Emmet's body rested.  It has an historic association that would capture people's imagination and if it could be preserved, it would have not only an effect upon ourselves but would be money well spent&mdash;money which might bring in an unexpected return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Professors are naturally interested in the preservation of the past&mdash;or some of them at least.  Some of us would be out of our jobs if the past were not preserved and if it were not worth preserving, so I may be forgiven if I make some remarks on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the suggestion by Senator Hayes in connection with the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham.  It is a magnificent building and very greatly deserves preservation and restoration.  Also, his suggestion of a folk museum is most desirable.  I have seen something of the kind elsewhere. It is certainly a blot on our national life at the moment that we have no such museum.  Senator Hayes makes the point that we should be interested in all buildings that are of beauty or of national interest.  I would underline that.  I think the best way of ensuring it would be to watch the constitution of the Advisory Committee suggested in Section 15.  It is important that in constituting that committee there should be representatives on it interested in all periods of our history&mdash; not only the pre-Christian periods, the Early Christian period, the Norman period and the later times, the Tudor period, the Stuart period&mdash;the Royal Hospital is a Stuart building&mdash;the Georgian and even, I venture to say, in special circumstances the early Victorian period.  Already some historic Georgian houses have been allowed to fall into ruin.  We have heard how Grattan's house at Tinnahinch, County Wicklow, has been allowed to become a derelict ruin. Similarly, Coole House, which was a centre of the Irish literary revival, is now not even a ruin: I understand it <Col N="231" /> has been pulled down and the materials used to build other houses. That was a house where Yeats and other great figures of the national literary revival lived.  It was the house that led to the great success of the Abbey Theatre, which brought great fame to our country.  It is very sad that houses of historic importance like that Georgian house are allowed to disappear.</P>
    <P>We must face a prejudice here.  I think there is a prejudice in the case of these later buildings, that is, say, those later than the 15th century, that they carry with them a certain aura of taint, should we say, of landlordism; and, consciously or unconsciously, that affects our national attitude to them. However, I think this is something that is passing.  There was a similar situation in France shortly after the French Revolution.  Then the magnificent chateaux of the aristocrats were regarded as symptoms of tyranny and landlordism.  But it was not very long before the French people began to see them in another light; and now, with a few exceptions, these chateaux are cherished and are a source of pride in France.  I suggest that our Georgian houses should be cherished in the same way.  As far as this Bill is concerned, a good way to do this would be to see that some of the members of the Advisory Committee are interested in the later periods of our national history.  Senator Hayes has very rightly said that all buildings, if they are beautiful and of historic interest, should be preserved.</P>
    <P>There is a second point which I would like to mention on this Bill. There is need for increased co-operation with our tourist organisations on matters of this kind.  I think, for example, of a magnificent site and a magnificent building in County Cork&mdash; Charles's Fort over the harbour at Kinsale.  In my opinion, it is one of the finest pieces of architecture of its kind in Western Europe.  It commands a magnificent panorama of the Bay of Kinsale.  As far as I know, nothing is done to develop it as a tourist site or as an historic monument.  As far as I can see, it is neglected for all publicity <Col N="232" /> purposes, when it could be one of the show places of County Cork.</P>
    <P>Again, there is another magnificent castle to the north-west of Dundalk. Its name escapes me at the moment, but many will recognise it by the description.  It is about ten miles to the north-west of Dundalk.  There is a great Norman keep on a high hill looking north-west to the Gap of the North, on one of the finest sites for a castle I have seen anywhere.  It is falling to pieces.  No one seems to go there.  The cattle graze through the walls, and there it lies&mdash;yet if the tourist organisations took an interest in it I believe it could become famous in Western Europe.  Quite close by is Cuchullain's birthplace, and not more than five or six miles away is the place where Edward Bruce was crowned, I think, during his invasion of this country. There is a triangle about six miles in extent, where you have three extraordinarily interesting national manuments, monuments that have a wonderful geographical site and yet they are neglected as far as I can see. I suggest that although the tourist organisations are doing very much they should do more, and I recommend to them in particular these two striking buildings.</P>
    <P>The third point is in connection with restoration.  It seems to me that we could do more restoration of our national buildings.  There is a tendency to leave them alone.  Perhaps we still suffer from the romantic fallacy that a ruin is more picturesque than a natural well-preserved building. An experience I had in Athens just before Easter is relevant.  I found both on the Acropolis and in the Agora that Athenian craftsmen were working away every day at the restoration of those buildings.  Here a second point becomes significant; the craftsmen were working there.  As has been suggested in the Dáil, very rightly, on this Bill, we must preserve our tradition of native craftsmanship in stone-working. It can die very easily and unless the Board of Works does something to preserve that tradition it will go completely. If you walk down Kildare Street you will see on the Kildare Street Club some of the last specimens <Col N="233" /> of free carving in the City of Dublin. It may be that throughout the country there is very little more hope for free carving unless that craftsmanship is preserved and encouraged.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Board of Works should do more restoration, that they may learn also from the Athenian politicians and architects to use these restorations as living museums.  For example, the American School of Archæology in Athens is restoring in white marble the ancient Stoa of Attalus, over 2,000 years old.  They are going to use that as a museum.  It will be one of the finest museums in the world, both for its merit as a building and, secondly, for what it contains. I suggest we could do something in that way.  Restoring our buildings would exercise our native craftsmen in stone work and we could use the restored buildings as museums.</P>
    <P>These are three points in connection with the working of the Bill.  I come to the fourth, in which I venture to suggest a possible improvement in the Bill.  The reason I suggest this is something that happened very recently in our country.  In one of the midland towns there is a very fine round tower. Quite recently a hideous garage was built right up in front of that tower. Also, on one side of it a shop has been built, not merely beside it but actually round it.  It has been built so close to the tower that it takes the contours of the tower to make use of all available space.  The result is that that tower is ruined from the æsthetic point of view.  It has become spoiled completely by these monstrosities that have been put up beside it.  It is a desecration of a national shrine.  I venture to suggest that we could do something to prevent a recurrence of that kind of thing.  I think that possibly an amendment might be introduced to the Bill something on these lines: the Minister should be empowered to define a controlled area around national monuments under State care and within this area no new development should be allowed without his consent.  He might be given, perhaps, town planning powers in the matter to prevent the desecration of national monuments.  The details would have to be considered but the extent <Col N="234" /> of the area might be limited to approximately 100 feet from any particular monument.</P>
    <P>Under present legislation, I understand there are three forms of preservation. There is preservation under the commissioners; there is guardianship; and there are preservation areas.  We have provision in this Bill for preservation of historical monuments.  But under present conditions if there is a single-storey house close to a national monument, the commissioners have no power to prevent the people from rebuilding that house to any height that they might wish.  It is not always desirable to step in and take over land surrounding national monuments in fields, but something should be done to prevent any undesirable new development in the immediate vicinity of a national monument.  The round tower which I have mentioned is a case where the commissioners were unable to prevent a national monument from being surrounded by unsightly commercial premises.  There is a provision, I understand, similar to that which I have suggested in the French Historical Monuments Act, and the French are people who know well how to preserve their monuments.  I can see objections to these proposals, and I would make them myself, if they proposed any infringements on the rights of property, but I do not see that they are doing anything unfair in limiting the distance to 100 feet.</P>
    <P>If these historical buildings were occupied by some person, the law of ancient lights would prevent people from putting up a large building nearby.  There are other provisions to prevent people in occupation from being upset by developments in surrounding areas.  It does seem right and reasonable to respect that right in regard to buildings where we may imagine the spirits of our historic dead to be living.  I do not believe in interference with the rights of private persons. But there have been large-scale interferences in one form or another. There has been confiscation of lands when we wanted to build an aerodrome or when we wanted to run a road through a certain place.  I am against this interference with private property and with private rights as a whole but, <Col N="235" /> in this particular case, I think that some interference would not be unfair. I would like to point out that it is not intended in my suggestions to prevent any development of the area nearby. That would be a hardship in many cases, but my aim would be to prevent unsuitable and unsightly development in the immediate area of a national monument.</P>
    <P>My further suggestion is that it would be at the Minister's discretion to control these matters.  If we look at Sections 3, 4, 5 and 8 of the Bill we see that there is already certain interference with the rights of private property.  I suppose the rights of property are involved in allowing or not allowing a building to fall down. Now if the State decides that it should be built up and repaired, it will be built up and repaired.  Therefore, I suggest that the infringement on the rights of property in the things I have advocated is small and because of the historical monuments involved, it would be justifiable.  I do advocate the granting of these powers to the Minister.  I think the suggestion is a reasonable one.  I would ask the Minister in the interests of the monuments to introduce these powers or to consult with those concerned and to give his views at a later stage in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would urge that we are not likely to have a Bill of this kind soon again. This probably is the last Bill of its kind which we will have for many years and we should take steps in it to prevent the development of unsightly buildings in the vicinity of our national monuments.  I hope the Minister will agree to some amendment towards this end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the provisions it contains and, in doing so, I would say that there is nothing further from my mind than the suggestions made by Senator Hayes. Notwithstanding that, I think I should say that I am 100 per cent. in agreement with his suggestion.  I happen to know the Royal Hospital.  I have been in and out of there a few times and, though I cannot say that I ever thought of it as a national monument, I think <Col N="236" /> it is a very beautiful building.  Nobody could look on that square and the building surrounding it without getting that impression.  As to the condition of the roof, I imagine it is pretty bad but it could probably be reroofed.  I believe that the buildings are of very excellent quality being made of heavy cut stone and in those circumstances I think there would be every justification in reroofing the entire buildings now known as the Royal Hospital.  I think the suggestion of Senator Hayes that it should be reconstructed is an excellent idea.  In matters of this sort we are far behind people whom we regard as primitive in so far as we make very little attempt to hang on to the ideas of the past and to preserve the things of the past for future generations.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes amazed me when he suggested that out of 22 buildings in Dublin only one building had a clay floor.  That is incredible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have since learned that there is one in Ranelagh with a half-door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is an exaggeration.  I know several buildings in the city with half-doors.  It is a little astonishing to find so few buildings nowadays with clay floors since it is only a few years ago that the clay floor was a common thing in houses in rural Ireland.  I have on a number of occasions myself slept in bedrooms with clay floors and, while there was a smell of damp in certain cases, generally speaking the clay floor was not a bad floor if it was properly laid down.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes has stated that we do not have any products of the wheelwright. That is work that is passing out in this country and we are reaching the position where we will have no man capable of producing a wheel.  The same applies to the blacksmith.  That is work that is rapidly passing out and we have been reaching the stage for some time now where no man will be able to take on the work of conducting a blacksmith's premises.  We have reached the situation where there are many people in rural Ireland who have never seen a blacksmith turn out a shoe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> Blacksmith's shops are going to ruin all over the country, possibly because horses are passing out of use.  This, to my mind, is also a great mistake, as far as this country is concerned.  The fact is, even now, horseshoes are being imported, ready-made, into this country. It is a sad state of affairs that a trade of that kind, which, in the past was so important, should be allowed to die.  It is more regrettable that people should be left in a position where they would not have an idea of what the trade was like, or what the work was like in the horseshoeing industry.</P>
    <P>We might also have an example of harvesting methods used in the past &mdash;100 years or 200 years ago&mdash;and it would not be out of place for an exhibition to be held showing the reaping hook and the kind of work done by it, and by the scythe, and with the mowing machine, and I think if we are to judge by the experience of this harvest, many of the implements then used, could have been used this year.  There are, as I say, several other things which should be installed in a building of this kind, and it would take a building, such as is now known as the Royal Hospital, to house all the things which Senator Hayes and myself have in mind for such a proposition. We are far behind people whom we regard as primitive in those matters.  I have travelled amongst Indian tribes on the American Continent, and down into Mexico, and there is no place where one does not find, on a small scale, something of the kind suggested by Senator Hayes. In practically all those areas they carry on work in silver ornaments. We ought to have at least as much sense as they have, and do our best to preserve the arts and crafts, so that succeeding generations might know what their forefathers have been doing.</P>
    <P>With regard to monuments, as such, unless we are going to take this matter seriously we will be accused by future generations of gross negligence. I am glad to see that in this Bill provision is being made in Section 3 to step in, and repair any building which is in serious danger of decay. The section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" />&ldquo;(1)  Where it appears to the commissioners, on a report made by the advisory council or otherwise, that a monument which in their opinion is a national monument is in danger of being or is actually being destroyed, injured or removed, or is falling into decay through neglect, the commissioners may by order (in this Act referred to as a preservation order) undertake the preservation of such monument&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very important section, and that we should take it seriously.  If we look around the country, we find there are important national monuments being allowed to go into decay, into a state of dilapidation, and unless something is done within the next number of years, many of those monuments will be gone.  We are all conversant with cases of old castles which through the ravages of time, storms and bad weather, are regarded locally as dangerous.  I believe many of them are dangerous because they are likely to topple over at any time.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw particular attention to one of those monuments which I regard as the most important monument in this country&mdash;the Rock of Cashel.  No man, I do not care who he is, can go into the cathedral in the Rock of Cashel and fail to be impressed. I have seen people from various countries, people who could not talk our language or were not our colour, impressed.  I believe that steps should be taken immediately to restore, in so far as it is possible to do it, that magnificent building.  I would go so far as to say that we should restore it to the extent of reroofing it, and furnishing it in the same manner as when it was occupied.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely necessary for me to tell anyhere here the history of the Rock of Cashel.  We know that it dates back to the dawn of christianity, and that it has housed some of the most important people that this country ever produced or ever will produce. Its associations with Ireland, and with christianity, stand out over and above any other building in this country.  From the point of view of its <Col N="239" /> magnificence and its size, I do not think any of the other buildings could compare with it.  Reroofing and furnishing would cost a lot of money but it would be worth it as it would become the centre of the tourist interest of the world.  Even as it is to-day, with practically no publicity, we find a little picture of the Rock of Cashel on the top corner of some tourist magazines, and it is simply amazing the number of people who visit it, and the great interest taken in it by people of foreign countries.  I believe that we should carry out this work, because we should realise that every year, considerable damage is done to walls, which are in no way preserved.  Some attempt was made years ago&mdash;a very weak attempt&mdash;to preserve certain sections, and I think we should now seriously consider putting plans into operation to restore it.  I believe it would meet with the general approval of people who have any interest whatever in the national monuments of this country.</P>
    <P>Another national monument, Cormac's Chapel, has stood the test of the years.  The fact that it is roofed with stone is in itself a matter of great interest.  An attempt should be made to restore the other buildings to as good a condition as the latter.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Stanford's worry about confiscation of property, I think it is all a matter of what word one selects, to deal with matters of that kind.  If we use the word &ldquo;acquire&rdquo;&mdash;if we had to acquire some land on the way into a building of that kind, and if we told the people that we wanted to acquire a passage into a place of national interest, it would not sound quite so good, if we told them we were going to confiscate it.  I think every national monument should be preserved, and I think that people will not fall out with me as far as the Rock of Cashel is concerned.  In addition to the rock, there are other abbeys, such as the Holy Cross Abbey, without going outside Tipperary.  There are several monuments of that kind in the country but the one that stands out, and is the most important, is the Rock of Cashel, and I make an appeal to have that monument dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I think that everything I was going to say has already been said, and I am not going to go through tediously some of the points that I had in mind.  I would like to say that I welcome support for this Bill if it means we will preserve our national monuments.  We all know that there are historic, æsthetic, national and even commercial reasons why these things should be restored, and, as Senator Quirke has said, if something is not done about some of them soon, there will be nothing left of them. We have already lost large numbers of our monuments which have been completely swept off the face of the land and others are in a very bad state. The task is an enormous one, but under this Bill we have the power to do something towards going about the job of restoring some of these monuments.</P>
      <P>There is one factor, however, which has not been mentioned yet.  It is a factor which I know will be of particular interest to the Minister in charge of the Bill&mdash;the question of money.  It is going to cost an awful lot of money to do these things and I should like to hear from the Minister from what source we should get the money to do the job that has to be done and the extent to which it would be possible to get money.  We have general agreement amongst all Parties as to necessity for doing the job from a national, historic and aesthetic point of view and no Government could put up the argument that the Opposition would be against it.  We could get agreement on a matter like this and it ought not to be very difficult in these circumstances to find the money, if we could only decide how much we could afford.  The next question then would be to see how best to spend the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Stanford has referred to the large Georgian buildings and I am a great admirer, as we all are, of the Georgian period and the great mark it left in parts of our country and cities.  Although we are at present losing some very important Georgian houses through demolition, there is on the whole a comparatively good representation in the country of 18th century buildings and art generally, but we are <Col N="241" /> not so well served so far as the period previous to that is concerned.  Indeed, the castles, the Norman castles, the castles of Irish families and the churches of the earlier period are the things which are in immediate danger.</P>
    <P>They are ruins and I have heard some people speaking of ruins as something aesthetically good, which should be left in ruins.  I have heard people in archaeological societies arguing that it would be desecration to do anything to a ruin, that it should be left as a ruin, but that is the old romantic idea that it was picturesque to preserve these ruins as ruins.  All an artist had to do was to paint, no matter how badly, an old cottage with a thatched roof, with water coming into it and with an old woman at the door and it was supposed to be a very nice picture. We have got past that idea nowadays, and, in all forms of art, it is accepted that a picture should be clean and that these buildings should be put into good condition and into the state in which they were originally.</P>
    <P>In the same way, I feel that, in relation to our churches, they should be restored to be living things and these little chapels and abbeys, large and small, all over the country should be roofed over, even if it is done only as a temporary measure with corrugated iron to start with. That may seem a rather startling suggestion to some, but it is better to have them roofed with corrugated iron than not at all, until such time as we can do a proper job on them.  I notice some Senators laughing, but I think it is a sensible suggestion, because these sacred buildings and national monuments generally are deteriorating every day and their restoration is going to cost more money every day and there will be less of the original building left.  They should be restored and they should be made not only monuments in themselves, but they should be made to live as well.</P>
    <P>They should be restored to their original purposes or, if not, made into local museums.  There is scarcely a town or village in the country which has not adjacent to it some building of historic or artistic interest, and, if each of these little places were <Col N="242" /> restored and filled with items of local interest they would provide something which would be of immense importance to the people living near them.  The children and the people in these places would then have something which would stimulate them nationally and aesthetically and which would be as well tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>We know that when people come to visit this country&mdash;I find it day in and day out&mdash;the first thing they ask is what there is to be seen.  I answer that question every day of my life and luckily in Dublin we have a large number of places of historical interest which we can show these visitors and to which they can be directed.  I am sorry to say, however, that down the country the most we can show them in some cases is a very battered old ruin, the approach to which is very difficult and which may involve walking through long grass and climbing railings and barbed wire.  There is a lot in the suggestion made by Senator Stanford as to the necessity for the preservation of the surroundings of these buildings.  Even in Dublin, we have in the Casino at Clontarf an artistic structure, but unfortunately the surroundings are not at all in keeping with it.  Steps should have been taken long ago to provide for a decent space around that building to put it in its proper setting.  It is rather sad to see it in its present surroundings. It has been pretty well kept by the Christian Brothers, but certainly the surroundings are not at all in keeping with the building itself. It seems to suggest to visitors that we in Ireland are not aware of how important that structure is and have no knowledge of the setting in which it should stand.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the Advisory Council.  It is a matter which I will bring up on Committee Stage, but I hope that, when the Minister is appointing the Advisory Council, he will see that people are appointed who have a professional knowledge and interest in archaeological matters, rather than people who have administrative qualifications.  I have much pleasure in supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to say that I join in welcoming this <Col N="243" /> Bill.  Secondly, I want to say that after so many eloquent addresses, concerning not only such national monuments as the Rock of Cashel, but turf cutters' implements, half-doors, clay floors, and a good many other things which cannot be described as national monuments, it may seem somewhat pedantic to get to the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>I should like to raise one or two points which I hope the Minister will consider.  They are points which can be discussed better perhaps on Committee Stage.  The first refers to Section 9 which sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the Commissioners are the owners of a national monument as defined in sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the principal Act they may, if they think it desirable to do so, remove the monument to the site of such other national monument as they may think fit and approve.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister would consider inserting the words &ldquo;or to such other suitable site&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;monument&rdquo; in line four, because the section as it stands restricts the removal of a monument by the commissioners to the site of another national monument.  It seems possible that the commissioners at some time or another might think it desirable to remove a national monument under their control to another site which was not a national monument site, so that it might be desirable to consider the inclusion of these words.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to Section 16. I should like to see the wording of that section changed in order to admit the possibility of emergency excavations. At present, somebody who wants to carry out an excavation may be 100 miles or 200 miles away from the source of authority in the matter, and, by the time written permission is got to excavate, it may be too late.</P>
      <P>My third point is a matter raised by Senator Stanford.  I think his suggestion is an excellent one, but I doubt the advisability of pressing it at this stage.  It would involve such a wrangle about private property that it would hold up the Bill.  It would be more desirable to put through the Bill now and take up this matter later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the Seanad but there are certain points which have been raised upon which I would like to lay emphasis.  I was glad to see there was such unanimity about this measure that all the things we wanted to say were said already.</P>
      <P>I want to support Senator Quirke with regard to the Rock of Cashel.  The Rock of Cashel ought to be something in the nature of a national shrine.  It should be the duty of the State to restore it fully.  Senator Stanford referred to craftsmen.  The men who succeed our present craftsmen should be trained so that they would be able to restore historical buildings of the type mentioned in this debate.</P>
      <P>Restoration work of this sort is all important on the continent.  When in Toledo last year, I saw buildings, erected in the third and fourth centuries, being restored and repaired. The same thing was being done in Salamanca.  The university there will be at the end of this century one of the finest pieces of architectural art in Europe.  The Escorial accommodates monks.  The first monks were put in there by Philip the Second.  That building has been preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we should be given power in this Bill to hand back to the monks places like Holy Cross.  At least one such abbey in each province should be handed back to the monks.  Let us hear again the chanting of the monks in Jerpoint Abbey and Holy Cross. The Minister would not have power under the laws as they stand to hand over these buildings, but if they were handed over by some means adequate safeguards would be given that the spiritual descendants of the monks would maintain the building for posterity. That would remove from the State the annual cost involved in maintaining these abbeys.  In England the Benedictines went back to Buckfast Abbey.  I believe we could do the same thing in this country.  I think it is the desire of each and every one of us that something along these lines should be done.  The castle of Kilcash should also be preserved.  The famous lament of Kilcash is associated with our literary heritage.  The castle was at <Col N="245" /> one time a Butler stronghold looking down on the homes of Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Someone should be encouraged to use it and it should be preserved.  We should have regard to the past in order to encourage those who come after us to emulate earlier generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister must marvel at the fact that a Bill presented by a Minister for Finance should have been received so properly, and rightly so.  I am sure it is rather an occasion for him.  As far as the Advisory Council is concerned, I agree with what Senator Maguire said.  I would appeal to the Minister and to the officers responsible for this Bill to associate themselves as far as they possibly can with local historical, antiquarian and archaeological societies.  In connection with the working out of these Acts it is not always easy for the administrators of the Acts to work in close collaboration with such local societies.  Senator Quirke stressed the importance of local people who have local knowledge.  The local people have done great work in connection with the preservation of monuments.  The small societies have worked without funds out of pure love of country and they deserve any recognition that can be given to them under this Act by associating them with the work now undertaken and defined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Might I make a plea for a wider conception of what a national monument is?  I do that with sorrow when I think of Lady Gregory's house at Coole having been scrapped.  It cradled the Irish literary movement and was associated with great poets, litterateurs and dramatists.  I would have thought that such a house would have been preserved as a national monument. I hope the house of Maria Edgeworth is being preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I say that since the 1930s we have a lot of new national monuments. We have one, the Martello Tower, immortalised by Joyce.  I hope that the Commissioners of Public Works will put some commemorative tablet on that tower so that the memory of Buck Mulligan will live in the minds of the generations to come.  One thing is <Col N="246" /> being done very quickly.  They are creating a national monument in this House itself.  I saw on my way in that the porticos are being removed.  There is work in progress apparently on portion of this House.  I doubt whether the Board of Works will be sufficiently equipped to give back to that portion of the House where they are building at the moment the quality which the rest of the House possesses.  When one comes in through the main gate one is convinced that national monuments are being created all round us.  Whatever is taking place between the two pillars on the right-hand side of the House will tend to make the House more of a national monument than it is at the moment.  I understand new premises are being built.  I cannot understand how new additions to that portion of the House can add to the quality of the remainder.</P>
    <P>I want to make a further appeal to the Minister.  I do not know whether or not it comes under the control of the commissioners.  There is quite a number of buildings under State control in this city which are rapidly approaching national monument status. That would apply even to this House itself in the sense that I do not know when the front of it was last cleaned. I think it should get some attention. There are other properties under State control at the moment which should get some attention to save them from being classed as national monuments before their time.  When these national monuments are being tabulated, I suggest, if it be possible, that another Government Department should consider giving an instruction to our transport companies to establish tours of historical interest in the City of Dublin.  What I want to see done here is what is done for tourists on the Continent.  We have a great number of buildings of historical interest. The transport companies should not only arrange tours but should provide people equipped to tell tourists the history of our historic buildings.  I suggest that if something on these lines were done it would have great value from the tourist point of view. It would be of help to tourism in this country and would enable us to sell something to people abroad so far as <Col N="247" /> our antiquities are concerned.  I hope that something will be done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the discussion on this Bill, and the general interest it has aroused, will direct more attention to what the Bill is trying to do.  I support the Bill.  I feel, however, that we want a little bit more force behind the national monuments' preservation movement.  When this legislature was first constituted there was a Minister for Fine Arts, a very distinguished Irishman.  He with various friends, surveyed parts of the country and took a personal interest in all these things.  Now, we have no Minister.  There ought to be some individual who would make a tour from time to time and submit a report on our national monuments.  Under the principal Act, the definition of the term &ldquo;national monument&rdquo; is very extensive.  I think it included even a cave.  I should like it also to include beauty spots such as the Bride's Glen, near Bray.  It was one of the beauties of my childhood days, but now it is being mutilated and cut down in a horrible way.  I should like to see the term extended so as to include all these things of beauty and of historic interest in our country.  In Section 3 of the Bill, we find the following words: &ldquo;Where it appears to the commissioners, on a report made by the Advisory Council or otherwise.&rdquo;  Are not these words rather vague?  We have an Advisory Council adumbrated, but I suggest that the wording of the section is rather vague.  The Advisory Council is to include the representatives of three very learned bodies, and the Minister is being given power to nominate other members to the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope he will nominate some live wires, and in saying that I am not suggesting that the admirable representatives of the Royal Irish Academy are not live wires.  The instance which I have just given of the type of thing that is happening in the country is not the sort of thing which could conceivably interest the Council of the Royal Irish Academy or other bodies, unless they happened to be in the vicinity. Take as an example Monkstown Castle <Col N="248" /> which, to a certain extent, is preserved, but which is being surrounded by an outcrop of new buildings.  I think that where old structures of that sort are being gradually encroached on by present day civilisation, the opinion of the commissioners should be invoked.  I do not quite see, however, who is going to invoke the powers of commissioners.  There was, for example, the removal of the market cross at Blackrock.  Was there any report made to the commissioners about that?  That is an example of the kind of thing to which the attention of the commissioners should be drawn. When the market cross was removed there should have been some mark put there to indicate where it was, so that if one were trying to reconstruct the position it had occupied one would be able to pick it out by reference to a map.  My view is that where old monuments are displaced, the commissioners should have power to give some indication of what had been removed and a record made of it in that way.</P>
    <P>I think that in discussing this Bill everything circles back to the point which was made by Senator McGuire and that is the question of money.  If we had the money, I suppose we could do wonderful things, but how are we going to get the money?  One way, I suggest, would be the issue of a series of stamps that would show the real beauties of our country.  As an elementary stamp collector, I realise the gorgeous stamps that are turned out by some European countries.  These stamps illustrate aspects of these countries which are no more beautiful than we have to show.  The U.S.S.R. for example, got away with a wonderful series of pictorial stamps of the Crimea.  We could do wonders with Killarney and these various historical sites we refer to, like the Rock of Cashel, for instance.  We could produce a series of stamps from time to time that would have a sale and that would advertise these things.  That would help the revenue and help the long-suffering Minister to put up with the numerous suggestions we have been making as to the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel that the commissioners want something more than a report made <Col N="249" /> by an advisory council.  There should be someone going around the country. They have their inspectors, inspecting after the report has been received; but I feel that something very violent is required.  Otherwise, these things quietly happen and it is not noticed until afterwards that they have happened. Apart from that, I support this exemplification of our respect for the great past in the shadow of which we live.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider in Section 14 giving representation to the National Trust on the council.  The National Trust is a voluntary body and contains a number of very enthusiastic people who have been endeavouring on very scanty means to do what they can.  Possibly it is a body which could be included.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly support the Bill, but, arising out of what Senator Quirke has said, many of us must feel that a ruin such as the Rock of Cashel should be restored not merely as a monument but for the purpose for which it was built, that is to say, as a national cathedral.</P>

      <P>We had certainly on this Bill a most interesting discussion, a discussion which was quite a natural one but which perhaps did not advert to the fact that the Bill is more an enabling one than a direct method of dealing with the problems which were mentioned.</P>
      <P>The main difficulty in regard to our national monuments is, of course, as Senator McGuire said, one of money. It is natural enough for the members of this House, on a subject on which they have strong views, to advocate as strongly as they can the expenditure of money from the Central Fund on the objects of their interest.  We would all like to be able to do very much more for the preservation of our national monuments than we are able to do at present and have been able to do in the past, but unfortunately in all spheres of life we must cut our coat according to the cloth and we have that difficulty in regard to the expenditure on national monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is that about £25,000 a year is being spent on such preservation, quite apart from the <Col N="250" /> moneys that are spent on the provision of the inspectorate and other staff in the Board of Works.  Some of the work being done by the commissioners has been well worth while.  The suggestion that was made by Senator Hayes in respect of the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham and supported by other Senators is one worthy of consideration, but again it is one on which it is impossible to express a final opinion unless one could tell exactly what would be involved from a cost point of view.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford mentioned something of which I have a little knowledge myself and he was followed by Senator O'Donnell&mdash;that is, the tragedy of Coole House having been pulled down, a tragedy that is far worse when it is remembered that it was done by a State body, by the Land Commission.  It was a pity that something could not have been done there to preserve the foundation of the Abbey movement.  I find some difficulty in some of these suggestions put forward by Senator Stanford in regard to making what would amount to a sterilisation order around some of our national monuments.  It would be an undesirable power for the Minister to have.  I might have my own views on what was in keeping with the monument there, but I would certainly not set myself up as a person suitable to judge the artistic merit or demerit of any building which was to be put up in the neighbourhood of a monument, nor would I think it desirable that the Minister should be put in that position, unless there was at the same time some method of having an appeal and of inserting compensatory provisions. As regards the case that Senator Stanford mentioned in Tipperary&mdash;which I believe occurred in the town of Roscrea&mdash;I am at a loss to understand why&mdash;if the circumstances are such as the Senator mentioned, and I agree they are&mdash;the local authority did not move under their powers under the Town Planning Acts.  I presume the Town Planning Acts have been brought into operation in North Tipperary, and if so it would have been necessary for the people who were erecting the garage and shop to have sought permission from the local <Col N="251" /> authority.  If that is the position, then it would seem that the local authority, the local county manager acting for council, did not consider, nor did his advisers consider, that the buildings that were to be put up would be of damage to the monument.  It may be that what one person considers a monstrosity another considers beautiful. I had my own views, and have them still, about the erection that was put up by Dublin Corporation on O'Connell Bridge over the Liffey.  I presume someone must have thought it was a nice erection to put there, but I have yet to meet that person.  It is, I suppose, a matter of opinion.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke suggested that he should be considered as an ancient monument at one stage, when he was speaking in a lighter vein.  Without any such suggestion about any member of this House, I think we have here some work that has been done towards the preservation of something that was worth while&mdash;and done extremely well by the Board of Works&mdash;and that is the ceiling here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>

    <P>There are provisions, of course, for local advisory committees under the 1930 Act and, as the result of an amendment suggested by Deputy Doyle in the other House, we have extended the membership of these committees; so that a local authority can now put more people on those committees and in that way keep contact between the members of local authorities and persons with archaeological interest in the various countries.  I said in the other House and would like to repeat here that it is eminently desirable that we do everything we possibly can to encourage local interest in our monuments. Without local interest, anything <Col N="252" /> that might be done by the Central Government would be really of little value.</P>
    <P>Many interesting suggestions were made during the course of the debate and I will take an opportunity between now and the Committee Stage to consider those of them that are appropriate to this Bill.  The real trouble in regard to doing as much as we would all wish to do to preserve the evidence of our historic past is that, unfortunately, these things require money and often require substantial sums of money.  In every sphere, interests are always anxious to advocate the expenditure of money by the State; but when it comes to raising the money necessary we are all rather shy of making any suggestions that might affect ourselves.  We all hope that whatever suggestion is put forward the provision of the funds will affect someone else rather than ourselves. That must be borne in mind, of course, in all these things.  I will consider the suggestions between this and the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill, but at the same time a very important Bill.  It proposes the total repeal of the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, and of the enactments applying that Act in a full or modified form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1893 Act has over the years been severely criticised and I doubt if very much need be said to justify its repeal. Under its provisions, a person suing the State or a local authority has to bring proceedings within six months of the act, neglect or default complained of, and not within six months of the date the cause of action arose.  The period of six months is, of course, far too short and cases have arisen where a person could not bring his action <Col N="253" /> because the damage caused to him did not manifest itself in time.</P>
    <P>A second objectionable feature of the 1893 Act is that a public authority gets specially favourable treatment as to the costs.  An unsuccessful plaintiff is liable to pay solicitor and client costs instead of party and party costs.  Even a successful plaintiff is liable for solicitor and client costs in some instances as, for example, where the court is of opinion that he did not give the public authority sufficient opportunity to make an offer for settlement.</P>
    <P>The new Act is expressed to come into operation on the 1st January next. Under sub-section (4) of Section 2, the repeal of the 1893 Act and the repeals of the other enactments will not apply to any proceeding if the cause of action arose before the 1st of July of this year.  This provision is designed to prevent stale claims being brought against public authorities and is a reasonable provision.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. It provides a highly desirable and long-needed piece of law reform.  There is really no valid reason why public authorities should be placed on any different footing from private persons or from public companies like C.I.E. to which the Act does not apply. Senators may consider that extending the period of limitation to six years, as the Bill will in effect do in most cases, is going too far.  The point is, of course, that six years is probably too long a period for anybody, whether public authority or ordinary citizen.  We hope, however, at no far distant date to have ready for discussion a Statute of Limitations Bill which will deal with the periods of limitation for all legal actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express agreement with this measure.  I think everyone will agree that it is very unfair to the ordinary citizen to be debarred from taking action against a local authority if a period of six months has elapsed.  In many cases it may happen that the citizen may not be aware that he has a claim against the local authority for a period of six months; and by the time he is aware of it the period may have <Col N="254" /> expired and he may suffer thereby very considerable injustice.  I quite agree that there is a good deal to be said for the suggestion that six years appears to be a rather long period, particularly if a claim brought by a citizen is a very large one and if the local authority concerned is a very small one, as in the case of a small urban council or the town commissioners of a comparatively small town.  Their resources would be rather limited and in the course of six years very considerable claims could accumulate against them which it might be very difficult to meet.  I accept the Minister's statement that the whole question of the Statute of Limitations is under consideration and I think we can await the Government's decision in that matter.  It might be desirable to have a shorter term or to have the term limited in a way that would affect different interests in different ways&mdash;for example, in the case I have mentioned, of a very small local authority which may have to meet excessive claims.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill is generally acceptable. A proposal for such legislation was discussed in the Dáil some time ago, when a much shorter extension of time was suggested, but the matter was deferred.  On the whole, I think it desirable that the citizen against whom claims could be made and the local authority should be put on exactly the same footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill, but it occurs to me that the Minister might consider whether the technical wording might not be improved.  It seems to me as a lawyer that some confusion may arise as between sub-sections (1) and (5) of Section 2.  Under sub-section (1) the existing Act of 1893 is repealed, but sub-section (5) says that this repeal is not to affect any action or prosecution arising before 1st July, 1954.  It seems to me that it might be better drafting to say that these other Acts are repealed except as regards matters where the cause of action accrued before the 1st July, 1954.  If the Bill is passed in its present form, a court might find itself in rather a difficulty.  Under sub-section (1) it is being told the Acts are repealed, yet <Col N="255" /> sub-section (5) is not very clear as to the effect of the repeal.  The Minister might consider whether the wording might not be happier than it is. Subject to that, I approve of the Bill. I think it is long overdue, and I am very glad to hear that there is general assent to it.</P>

      <P>While supporting the Bill in general principle, I would like to have from the Minister some guarantee that in the new measure that he proposes to introduce, the period of years will be a much shorter one. We all agree that a local authority should be put on a par with private citizens.  While that may be so in general principle, the local authority is entirely in a different category.  The local authority has to strike a rate for its requirements for the year.  We can foresee a set of circumstances where there may be legal actions taken and suspended for a number of years and that local authority at the end of six years might find itself having to meet these demands, at the end of the six year period.  While we all agree that six years is too long a period I think we would be in agreement in meeting the point by making it at least three years.</P>
      <P>I am not entirely in agreement with those who suggest that a local authority should be put in the same position as a private company or a private person. If the local authority estimate is to mean anything, if the rate that they strike over the year is to be the correct demand for the year, then some indication must be given to the local authority as to what that demand might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can foresee a number of persons who suffered at the hands of a local authority over a period of years, making a demand at the end of the six-year period, a five-year period or whatever the period might be.  That would make a very serious demand on the rates for that particular year.  I do not think we should allow that position to arise.  Therefore, I think that on the Committee Stage that is one of the matters we might go into in more detail.  We should take all the <Col N="256" /> precautions we possibly can to ensure that such a situation does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Hawkins in suggesting that the period of six years is unduly long in the case of a local authority.  It is unlike a private individual.  In the case of a local authority the preparation of the defence of the action is carried out by an official who treats it from an abstract point of view.  It may well encourage the plaintiff to delay in taking action against a local authority until such time as the officials who had been dealing with the action had resigned, had been transferred, suspended, or had died.  For that reason the liability or the potential liability, which would accrue to the local authority, may not be known for several years after the local authority has struck the rate.  It may mean, as a Senator has already remarked, that the period of liability in the case of a small local authority, might be very much extended.  There might be an accumulation of a number of these actions which would fall due in one particular year.  I think instead it would be desirable if the judge had a discretion, as he has in a case of workmen's compensation, where the action must be brought within six months, but in any case it should not be a bar if the failure arose from a mistake, absence from the country, or other reasonable cause.</P>
      <P>I think if there was a provision whereby the judge would have discretion, and the period was extended to two or three years, it would be sufficient.  When one considers the number of actions, which are very limited, in the case of death, where the action must be brought within 12 months from the date of death, one realises that this has been a source of tremendous hardship on occasions. There are other limitations for different other actions in tort, for instance, two years in the case of assault, and four years in the case of trespass.  I think, therefore, that the Minister should consider, at an early date, putting local authorities on a definite period, and that that period should be less than the period for ordinary civil action in the case of individuals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a very long period public bodies have been taking advantage of the Statute of Limitations against persons who might not be able to prove a cause of action until after seven or eight months.  I have known of public bodies in the case of workmen's compensation to take advantage of the Statute of Limitations to deprive a man of his compensation. The ordinary citizen or business man would not be in that privileged position. When the Act was passed in 1893, this limitation was necessary because public bodies had to make their estimate for their demands within a particular time.  Since the employees are covered by insurance, local authorities have power even to bring in a supplementary estimate.  The principle of the Bill is that the local authority should not be placed in a better position than anyone else.  The existing Public Authorities Protection Act does not apply to contracts generally, but to what is known as tort.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that a Bill will be introduced to deal with the Statute of Limitations.  I understand that in the County Management Bill there probably will be a section which will shorten the period of six years.</P>
      <P>In connection with Senator Cox's point about Section 5 I shall have to consult the draftsman and ascertain his opinion.  I can tell the Senators that the public authorities are not alarmed about this Bill.  They recognise that they should not be placed in a position different from an ordinary business man.  We had a very important case where a small shopkeeper whose house was damaged by a steamroller did not realise until six months afterwards that the steamroller had damaged his house and had cracked the walls.  The Circuit Court maintained that action should have been taken within six months from the date the steamroller passed not from the date that the damage was discovered. I think every Senator will agree that an Act that gives a public body certain advantage over a poor person should not be allowed to operate.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue in force the Rent Restrictions Acts, which otherwise would expire on 31st December, for a further period of one year.  It has been common policy not to allow these Acts to lapse until the Oireachtas has had an opportunity of dealing comprehensively with the rent control problem.</P>
      <P>A commission under Judge Conroy's chairmanship presented a comprehensive report in 1952 on all the many aspects of rent control.  Since then the recommendations in the report have been subjected to a thorough examination by the Departments concerned, and my predecessor and I have received representations from the interests affected.  The main proposals in the report are now being considered by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government are very conscious of the importance of these proposals, some of which raise fundamental issues, and they will give them the careful consideration they deserve. When the Government have made decisions, the work of drafting the necessary amending legislation can be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the introduction of comprehensive legislation should not be unduly delayed.  Every effort will be made to have proposals ready for introduction next year, but it seems to me that, owing to the complexity of this legislation, the period of one year for which the Acts are being extended will not prove to be too long.  Of course, if some particularly urgent problem should arise during the coming year, I shall not hesitate to bring in an amending Bill.  I think the necessity for this Bill will be generally recognised and I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>While we welcome the decision of the Minister to extend the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act for a further period of 12 months, we cannot but express our regret that he has been unable to present us with a comprehensive Bill based on the report of the Conroy Commission.  This is a matter of very urgent importance, not alone to those people who might be classified as landlords, those people in possession of flats and housing accommodation for letting, but to those people who would be accepted as tenants.  The withholding of certain safeguards from these people must be a very serious matter.  I should like the Seanad to direct its attention in particular to the importance of the part played in the past by those people whom we might now classify as landlords. They are not landlords in the present meaning of that word.  They are people who have acquired property and who are making that property available for the accommodation of our people whether it be a flat or a house. I suggest that failure to provide some safeguards for those people must in general retard the provision of housing facilities.  In my opinion, the many Rent Restrictions Acts that we have passed over the years have contributed to a reduction in the facilities that would otherwise be available for those who would like to avail of housing accommodation.  That, I think, is putting it very pointedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a person who invests his money in an industrial undertaking and, on the other hand, the person who is prepared to invest some money in the provision of houses for our people.  I think that the State must assure to the latter that he is entitled to get from his investment in the sphere of social activities the same remuneration as he would get if he had invested the money in an industrial undertaking.  To my mind the Rent Restrictions Acts since 1914 have retarded or influenced people against investing their money in the provision of houses for our people.  On the other hand, we have passed that burden over to the local authorities which, at the moment, are our biggest landlords.  I do not think that is a thing we should <Col N="260" /> encourage.  I think we should encourage the building of houses by private enterprise.  People who are prepared to invest their money in that way should be assured of the same remuneration as if, instead, their investments had been in an industrial undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not agree with my outlook on that.  He stated here to-day, and earlier in the Dáil, that this was a temporary measure.  He has asked for the indulgence of both Houses so that he may be in a position to introduce a comprehensive measure within 12 months.  The Conroy Report has been before the Government for quite a number of months.  In view of the representations which were put before the committee presided over by Judge Conroy, I think it is only reasonable that we have an assurance from the Minister that within 12 months he will be in a position to put before us a comprehensive Bill.  While we ask for that assurance, we are prepared to give the Minister the Bill that he has introduced this evening.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that his comprehensive Bill must have regard to the responsibilities of those people who are prepared to provide housing facilities for our people as well as the capabilities of the people themselves to meet the obligations which they will thereafter be under.  If the Minister, or the Government, is not prepared to do that, there is only one alternative, an alternative which has been exercised to a very great degree, in the past, namely, that there are very few private individuals who to-day, are prepared to undertake the building of houses for letting purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate, but, in view of Senator Hawkins' surprising attitude, I think I might say a word on this matter.  Apparently Senator Hawkins is of the opinion that the shortage of houses which is pressing on this nation for some years past, is due to a certain extent to the fact that people with money are not encouraged to invest that money in the building and letting of houses.  With my limited experience, I should have thought that the shortage of houses, at least in the last 15 years, was due more to the shortage of materials for a certain length of time, and now in some places to a shortage of suitable sites.  If there is money that can be used for the provision of houses, I would have thought that Senator Hawkins' Party would be in favour of that money being lent to the State for investment through the local authorities in providing houses at a reasonable rent for the tenants rather than the private enterprise building, where the unfortunate tenants can be exploited purely for profit.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am wronging Senator Hawkins in my summary of his statement, and perhaps he was intimating that it would be desirable that a certain amount of private building should be encouraged.  But are we not already doing that in a far more desirable way by encouraging people to build and to own their own houses?  Surely, their money is being invested in their own property and that is far more desirable in the long run, I suggest, than that these people should put up a row of houses and simply do so for the purpose of making as much money as they could from the tenants because of the present shortage of houses.</P>

      <P>This Bill must obviously go through and there is not very much that can be said about it. In the other House reference was made to a certain group of interested people and I think it our duty to refer to it, too.  Those people are the owners of houses who are suffering from the Rent Restrictions Acts of the past.  I imagine all my colleagues here in the Seanad have received pathetic notices from some of these small-holders&mdash;as <Col N="262" /> they are, in a sense&mdash;and I must say my heart was moved by one signed &ldquo;One of the Sufferers&rdquo; and by other stories I have heard from people who are depending on the rent of one or two houses for almost their total income. These people are becoming almost desperate.  They cannot raise the rent, they cannot do the necessary repairs in many cases and they are hoping against hope that legislation will go through soon which will relieve them.  They see their tenants enjoy 1954 salaries and wages and cheap rents: their only hope of income is the rent they get from a few houses and that is at a 1914 level in many cases.  I do not want to labour this point, but I would urge the Minister to do all he can to put through comprehensive legislation which will take into account the needs of these small-holders.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins in the Lower House referred to these owners of property and said they are not getting a fair crack of the whip in relation to the amount of increases which they are entitled to put on the rent when repairs and improvements are carried out.  I hope the Minister will do all he can to give them a fair crack of the whip and I hope that any prejudice against landlordism&mdash;it is a dying prejudice&mdash;will not influence him or his colleagues in the matter.  They are not an influential group in the country, but some of them are starving, literally, because they cannot raise their rents to a 1954 level.</P>

      <P>In the Lower House, the Taoiseach referred to the fact that in a contractual tenancy where the tenant died intestate, a notice to quit could be served on the person in occupation, which would terminate the tenancy.  He suggested that one way out of that would be for the tenant, prior to his death, to make a will.  The section does not apply to a statutory tenant but it was stated that approximately 90 per cent. of the tenants were contractual tenants.  As most people in the country would be unfamiliar with the position and would not take an opportunity of making a will bequeathing their tenancy interest in the house, it would appear that the landlord can <Col N="263" /> now avail of the position under a recent Supreme Court decision and serve that notice.  To my mind, that is a very serious matter and I would ask the Minister to take steps at the earliest possible moment to rectify the position.  Formerly it was regarded that under Section 9 of Decies Act the person in occupation&mdash;for instance, a widow&mdash;could be regarded as the personal representative until a grant of administration was taken out; but apparently that is not the position now as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to take steps as early as he can to rectify the position which arises now.</P>

Often they are widows&mdash; defenceless people like that&mdash;who had some old property given to them and the rent to-day is only a tithe of what it was.  If the Minister brings in his new Bill, I believe he will give those people substantial justice as far as he can.  They have no voting power, no one to speak for them.  If the Minister follows some of the recommendations in the report, he will give justice to them.  An effort was made a few years ago to enable them to put on substantial increases for the first £100 of repairs.  That gave them some relief, but I know&mdash;and I am intimate with this problem&mdash;that in many case when the local authority asked these people to do the repairs they had not the money to do them.  Therefore, they are between the devil and the deep blue sea&mdash;they have to do the repairs that the local authority wants and they have no way of raising the money.  No bank or anyone else will advance money on property like that.  If the Minister brought the law up to date, these people would be able, with the higher rent, to borrow money from the banks, as it would be a better investment and then they could do the necessary repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the property is becoming derelict and more of it will tend to become so in our towns and cities. <Col N="264" /> Some of those houses are very good and it is going to cost the State a great deal of money to replace that property if it is left in a state in which it has to be demolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to impress on the Minister the necessity to bring in a Bill to cover all the cases that we have in mind.  I would like to mention a particular section of the community that is victimised by higher rents.  I have in mind the speculative builder who was very active in the past six or eight or ten years and who built a good many houses. The men who went into them as tenants are charged £2, £2 10s., £3 and £3 5s.  If there is anyone creating an agitation for the Bill we are looking for, this is the class of people.</P>
      <P>I hope that this Bill will not be an excuse for delaying the Bill that is necessary to meet the hardships of the people I have mentioned.  I am not objecting to a fair rent, but do not forget that all the increases of rates are going on the rent, the landlord is not paying any increases in rates.  That is happening to the tenants and they have to pay the extra rates.  I would impress on the Minister to have some definite Bill before us soon to deal with cases I have in mind.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with the points made by Senator Stanford and Senator Burke. I think it is true that there is hardship upon a certain category of small property owners but there is a principle enshrined in most of these Rent Restrictions Acts.  That is the principle of greater hardship.  I am in greater sympathy on that account with what <Col N="265" /> has been said by Senator Hickey.  I think it would be a great mistake to interfere with legislation because it inflicts a certain hardship on a certain section and by so interfering inflicts a far greater hardship upon a larger section of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some experience of the working of the earlier Rent Restriction Acts in Dublin. I can think of a case which was taken to the courts in connection with a house in Mountjoy Square.  This particular case concerned one of the tenants.  Those of us who were interested in investigating the case, taking it up and defending it&mdash;it was a rent case&mdash;found&mdash;I suppose this would be seven or eight years ago&mdash;that this house contained 11 tenants.  It was a big house and it contained 11 families representing 54 people.</P>
      <P>There were two water taps in the house and two lavatories for 54 people, including a large number of children. The rooms were big and the rents ranged from 11/- or 12/- upwards.  As far as my memory serves, I do not think the highest rent was over 18/9. I remember the total amount of rent collected from that single house in that condition.  It was £386 per year.  The outgoings on that house in rates and ground rent amounted almost exactly to £90.  My recollection is that it was £44 for one and £46 for the other.  The outgoings were about £90 per year and the income from rents was £386</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet the landlord who was doing quite nicely out of this property was not even complying with the Dublin Corporation by-laws in that he only had two lavatories where there were 54 people.  The by-laws, if I am correctly informed, laid down that there must be one lavatory for every 12 persons in the house.  That is the kind of landlord I think of when I think of the poor landlords unable to spend money on repairs.  It emerged in the course of the case that this particular landlord had, in fact, acquired the property only three years before.  It emerged further that the sum of money he had <Col N="266" /> paid for it was £900.  He had spent £900 to buy the property three years before and he was making what must have been practically a net profit of nearly £300 a year out of it and he spent, so far as our investigation could show, not one penny.</P>
    <P>When that particular rent case was tried in the court, the judge went so far as to express from the Bench that he was quite sure the rent was exorbitant but that he was powerless to act because the house was decontrolled on the technicality that it fell within the landlord's sole possession.</P>
    <P>Although there are regrettable hardships inflicted by the Rent Restrictions Act, I have very genuine sympathy with the very small householder but I am afraid that if we start tampering with this Act in a piecemeal way because we feel sorry for a small landlord we may find that we are letting a very big fish get away.  It is to catch that that this particular net is devised in my opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>If any Government was justified during the past three months in delaying bringing in a comprehensive measure this Government is.  I think the case made by the different Senators who spoke justified the delay, justified the caution to ensure that there would be no injustice done to any section of the community.  My desire is that the Bill will give justice to all sections.  Senator Hickey desires certain protection for one class and Senator Hawkins suggested that we should bring in a Bill for the protection of the landlords.  I can assure the House that the Bill which is at Government level will give justice to all parties.  I do not expect that I will be able to satisfy the wishes of every section.  Senator Hawkins complained in regard to the delay about bringing in Judge Conroy's report into a comprehensive measure.  I am only three months on duty in office and it would have been impossible for me in that time to recommend a comprehensive measure to the Government having regard to the fact that my predecessor was two years considering the matter carefully.  Surely the Senator would not expect me to do in three months <Col N="267" /> what my predecessor&mdash;I am not criticising him; he knew the complications &mdash;did not do in two years.</P>
      <P>Senators will agree that it is necessary to give due weight to all sections of the community.  The points raised by the Senators will assist me when I am considering the recommendations which will be submitted to the Government for a comprehensive Bill.  I do not expect that the House would expect me to tie myself to a certain date because I might find that for some unforeseen reasons I would be unable to fulfil my promise.  I will do everything possible to have a Bill which I believe will do justice to all sections of the community.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Hawkins when he points out that the Rent Restrictions Act prevents the erection of houses.  Judge Conroy's report did not agree with him.  He agreed that with the high cost of building material and the cost of houses at the present time the builder must dispose of his houses to get finance.  He finds great difficulty in some cases because the tenants are unable to pay the high rents expected at the present time having regard to the cost of houses. I do not want to go into that point now as there will be another discussion with another Minister on that point.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that I am interested in this question of house building.  I have 33 years' experience and in my own area we built more houses for the poorer sections of the community than any other county in Ireland having regard to the population. That is a record that we can be proud of.  I can assure the House, therefore, that I will do everything I can to have the Bill next year if I possibly can with the approval of the Government.</P>

    <Title>Arbitration Bill, 1954&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="268" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will supply a long felt want in our law in that it will provide a modern and effective law of arbitration. The Bill deals with four types of arbitration.  Firstly, it will provide for what is called voluntary arbitration, the essence of which is that the parties to some dispute refer that dispute to a tribunal of their own choosing instead of a court of law.  Secondly, the Bill deals with statutory arbitrations, that is to say, arbitrations by tribunals constituted under statute to settle particular types of disputes which arise as a result of statute.  Thirdly, the Bill covers references to arbitration by the High Court, where matters of account arise in cases before that court.  Finally, the Bill provides for the enforcement of foreign arbitration awards.  I shall deal with these four types of arbitration separately.</P>
      <P>Voluntary arbitration has been recognised by all developed systems of law.  Unfortunately, the law in this country has remained unchanged for almost 100 years.  It is not, therefore, surprising that our law is defective in many aspects.  One of the main defects is that an arbitrator has no power to award costs, so that a successful party has to pay his own costs and the fees of the arbitrator or arbitrators in order to take up the award.  As these costs and fees may often amount to more than the amount in dispute, there is in many instances little point in going to arbitration at all.  Another important defect in the existing law is that the authority of an arbitrator may be revoked by either party unless the arbitration agreement contains a provision that the submission to arbitration is to be made a rule of court.</P>
      <P>The Bill remedies these two defects and provides, in Part II, for various matters which arise in voluntary arbitration under arbitration agreements. The provisions in that part of the Bill are designed to give what may be called judicial cover to voluntary arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with statutory arbitrations.  These are arbitrations under various statutes where disputes arising under the <Col N="269" /> statutes are settled by particular persons designated by the statutes themselves.  Senators will be familiar with cases where the value of land acquired for public purposes is settled by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of what are known as the Land Clauses Acts.  The provisions of Parts I and II of the Bill, with the exception of certain sections, which are not pertinent, are applied to statutory arbitrations.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with references by the High Court of matters of account arising in any particular case to an arbitrator who is deemed to be an officer of the court. This part of the Bill will re-enact and bring up to date existing provisions of the law.  This type of arbitration is known as compulsory arbitration.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill concerns the enforcement of foreign arbitration awards made in pursuance of an agreement, to which the Geneva Protocol of 1923 applies, between persons subject to the jurisdiction of States which are parties to the Geneva Convention of 1927.  The protocol and the convention are set out in the First and Second Schedules respectively. This country is not a party to either the protocol or the convention but this will be remedied when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>So much for the main outlines of the Bill.  I should now like to refer to some specific provisions.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4 the State will be bound, and this is a reasonable and proper provision.  Section 5 excludes arbitrations under agreements relating to the terms and conditions of employment. These are not arbitrations properly so called at all as the arbitrator has no power to make a final enforceable award, nor do the parties to the arbitration intend in any way that he should.  Such arbitrations are informal matters.  The arbitrators are really mediators who make recommendations and it is up to the parties to accept these recommendations or not to accept them as they so think fit. If, in any instance, the parties want the new Act or any of its provisions to apply to the arbitration, there is, of course, nothing to prevent them doing so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> I hope I have given the House a clear picture of what the Bill involves. Arbitration may have advantages in the settling of disputes, particularly where technical knowledge or special skill or training is required.  It is regarded as cheaper than law as a general rule and it is less formal and usually more expeditious.  The proposals in the Bill have been placed before the various bodies interested and their suggestions for improvement have, where possible, been incorporated.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are generally on the same lines as the relevant British and Six Counties statutory provisions.  The advantages of this to everybody concerned, and particularly to the business and commercial community, are obvious.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. It is a technical Bill which may not easily be followed in detail at first glance, but any difficulties or suggestions can be dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which I think is a very desirable one.  The only matter I would like to refer to is the question of the court that should have jurisdiction under the Bill. According to the Bill, the function of the court means the function of the High Court.  Might I suggest to the Minister that it is only right that the Circuit Court should have jurisdiction in so far as the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court goes?  The Circuit Court jurisdiction has been considerably increased in the last few years.  It was increased from £300 to £600 in matters of tort and was considerably increased in the matter of probates.  I suggest then, that the Circuit Court should have jurisdiction under this Bill when the matters concerned could come within the ordinary jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An arbitration proceeding is less technical, less formal and less frightening for witnesses than court proceedings. In addition matters could be discussed privately and for that reason an arbitration proceeding should in my mind be the most appropriate type of <Col N="271" /> proceeding in many cases.  Furthermore arbitrators themselves would have a better knowledge of local conditions and accordingly would be more expert than would be the judge.</P>
    <P>In Section 49 of the Bill it is set out that in the case of dispute about any matter, the court may at any time order the whole case or any question at issue on the facts that arise to be tried by an arbitration court.  If this is going to be limited to the High Court, it means cutting out the possibility that the Circuit Court could refer the matter to the county registrar or other official to take action.  He is precluded from doing so in that the High Court only has jurisdiction and power to do that.  As a person familiar with the conditions in rural areas, I would appeal to the Minister to include the Circuit Court in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. A. Cox Mr. A. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>As a lawyer I also welcome this Bill, which is long overdue. The only Act we have in this country in the matter of arbitration is an Act passed in 1857, which is completely out of date.  There was an Act passed in 1893, but for some extraordinary reason, which nobody understands, it did not extend to Ireland, and we have carried on since with our completely obsolete Act of 1857.</P>
      <P>I think legal practitioners will all welcome the Bill.  As regards the references by Senator Walsh to the courts, that obviously is a matter which should be considered.  I think there may be a good deal to be said for retention of the High Court because many arbitration matters arise under contracts which might possibly be contracts with English firms or foreign firms generally, and I rather think that the High Court will probably be the most convenient and expeditious tribunal to decide such matters. That, however, is a matter for discussion on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I just wanted to know whether arbitration arising out of breaches of contracts with people of other countries will be affected by the terms of this Bill.  What I am referring to is that very often there is disagreement between exporters and <Col N="272" /> importers and these disagreements are quite frequently referred to the chambers of commerce who act as arbitrators in these matters.  I do not know whether the chambers of commerce as such will be disfranchised or not from that duty under the Bill.  I would like if the Minister would advise me as to whether the chambers of commerce will still have the right to act as arbitrators where a dispute arises in such matters.</P>
      <P>Because in chambers of commerce, at any rate, we have to go to the courts for decisions upon matters of minor importance, which would create tremendous difficulty, particularly with those who are interested in the export trade.  I am not clear about a matter, and I would like to be assured that at least the faculties which are at present exercised by the chambers of commerce in the arbitration of those difficulties, will not be affected in this Act, in any event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to amend in certain respects the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts, and, in addition, proposes to incorporate in permanent legislation <Col N="273" /> some existing provisions under Emergency Powers Orders.</P>
      <P>Premises at which cattle, sheep and pigs are slaughtered for export have to be registered under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, 1930 to 1938 and have to conform to certain standards before they may be so registered.  Under the 1930 Act provisional registration of slaughtering premises might be granted within 12 months of the passing of the Act, this period being extended to 18 months under the 1931 Act.  The purpose then was to give time to the proprietors of premises which did not fully meet all the requirements of the 1930 Act to improve their premises up to the necessary full standard.  At the time of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 1941, when exports of live stock had to cease and exports in carcase form only were possible a number of slaughtering premises not ordinarily engaged in the meat export trade had to be registered to engage in that trade.  The power to grant provisional registration was accordingly reintroduced by an Emergency Powers Order.  It is now proposed in Section 2 of the Bill to continue permanently the power to grant provisional registration.  In addition to being available to meet contingencies in the future, this power will be useful in connection with efforts to improve standards at premises in the light of modern developments in the meat industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the emergency when the canned beef export trade developed it became necessary to permit beef-canning firms who were not themselves the proprietors of registered slaughtering premises, but whose cattle were slaughtered at registered premises for them, to export the offals from the cattle slaughtered for such canning.  The Fresh Meat Acts were accordingly amended by an Emergency Powers Order to enable special export licences under these Acts to be granted to firms holding manufacturing licences for meat-canning under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts.  The Emergency Powers Order also provided for the grant of special licences for the export of livers in a benign <Col N="274" /> condition which were suitable for use for pharmaceutical purposes but which could not be permitted for export for edible purposes (these livers have been distinctively dyed before export to ensure against their use for edible purposes).  It is now proposed to incorporate the provisions of the Order in question in permanent legislation (Section 3 of the Bill).</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides (Section 8) for the salvaging, under supervision, of these livers in a benign condition, which should ordinarily be denatured. During the emergency a trade developed in such livers which although unsuitable for human consumption were fit for use for pharmaceutical purposes.  Provision was made by an Emergency Powers Order for the salvaging of these livers under suitable supervision and this arrangement is now being put on a permanent basis. As already indicated, inedible livers are distinctively dyed before export to ensure against their use for edible purposes.</P>
    <P>Under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930, certain fees are payable by carcase meat exporters in respect of the veterinary examination of the animals slaughtered by them for export.  The fees at present payable are cattle 1/- per head, sheep 1½d. per head and pigs 3d. per head, and as matters stand these rates of fee cannot be altered in any way. The Pigs and Bacon Acts provide for charging of a veterinary examination fee not exceeding 6d. per pig in respect of pigs slaughtered at bacon factories and a fee of 5d. per pig has been charged under this authority since 1936.  It is now proposed (Sections 4 and 6 of the Bill) that the rates of fee under both sets of Acts may in future be fixed by Statutory Regulations made by the Minister.  Any such regulations will have to be approved by each House of the Oireachtas before becoming operative and the Oireachtas will accordingly have an opportunity of considering any proposed alterations in the fees before the alterations come into effect.</P>
    <P>A manufacturing licence under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts is required in respect of the manufacture <Col N="275" /> of canned meat products and certain other meat preparations.  At present the conditions attached to manufacturing licences can only be modified by revoking the existing licences, in each case after a month's notice.  It is proposed in Section 5 of the Bill to take power to alter the conditions attached to a manufacturing licence by serving notice of the alteration on the licence holder; this power to modify the licence conditions in a less cumbersome manner is required to meet changes decided upon in consultation with the meat canners generally or necessitated by the requirements of importing countries.  Any change would, of course, apply to all manufacturing licences and would not be confined to the licence held by a particular canner.</P>
    <P>It was provided by an Emergency Powers Order in 1943 that certain classes of casualty pigs, viz. pigs that had been purchased by a bacon curer but died on the way to the factory or that died, otherwise than by slaughter, after arrival at a factory, would qualify for compensation out of the Insurance Fund under the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  It is now proposed (Section 7 of the Bill) to include this technical amendment of the Acts in permanent legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the statement of the Minister, I welcome this Bill which is based on the necessity which arose during the emergency for a number of Emergency Powers Orders.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, to be quite clear, is to embody in permanent legislation Orders that were made during the emergency, to do the things that they were designed to do during that period.  The Bill is one which we might consider more in Committee, and I would like to have an assurance from the Minister particularly in relation to Section 5 which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2a) The Minister may, by notice in writing given to the holder of the manufacturing licence&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) attach to the licence,&rdquo; etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have an assurance from <Col N="276" /> the Minister, particularly in regard to this section, that there is not going to be any alteration in the licence given to a particular holder, except when it is an agreement made or arrived at in consultation with licence holders in that particular business.  I think that is what the Minister has particularly in mind.  I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that that was the real purpose of this amendment; otherwise we could have a position in which quite a number of organisations would be engaged in this particular activity, and where there could be some demand made on a particular associate, of the particular organisation, which would not be made on A or B. I want an assurance from the Minister that where a demand is going to be made, it is going to be, as it were, universal, and that it is not going to be applicable to any particular firm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider one or two suggestions I have to make on this Bill. It deals with inspections and the conditions which will have to obtain in all factories, and I suggest that he might take powers to provide that his own officials will be sufficient to carry out these inspections.  What takes place under the Fresh Meat Act at present is that these officials lay down the conditions on which a licence will be granted and plans have to be submitted to and approved by the Minister's officials.  Very regularly&mdash;at least twice per year&mdash;these factories are inspected and if there are any things which require to be done, these officials point them out and they are attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is what strikes me as rather an anomaly in that these meat factories are also inspected by officials from the Department of Industry and Commerce, from the Department of Health, and from the Department of Local Government.  The standards required by the Minister's Department are far higher and more stringent, and I think it is unnecessary that a meat factory, which is so efficiently taken care of by the Department of Agriculture, should be inspected by these <Col N="277" /> various other Departments.  The Acts under which the Department officials work in relation to these factories are Acts which have been enacted later than the Factories Acts, and I think it is a point the Minister should consider because there is a good deal of unnecessary overlapping.</P>
    <P>A very good job is being done, I believe, in these meat factories, and to-day I was speaking to some insurance brokers who told me that they believe that next year the insurance rate in respect of Irish fresh meat being exported to Britain will be in the neighbourhood of 2/- per cent., which is a risk of 1,000 to one. That is the strongest proof that these factories are doing a very good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why object, then, to so much inspection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to it. The Minister's officials are doing this inspection and doing it well.  They are officials trained for the job and they make a study of meat factories all over the world.  They insist on very high standards, but the officials who come in after them do not insist on standards nearly as high, but they are required to come in there because it is so provided in Acts passed before the Fresh Meat Act was passed in 1930. They are there as a residue, so to speak, of past Acts of Parliament which insist on factory inspection.  We have reached the stage at which much of that inspection is unnecessary and the rate of 2/- per cent. gives an indication that a good job is being done as a result of the co-operation of the proprietors of the factories with the officials of the Department.</P>

    <P>Perhaps the Minister might consider bringing the representatives of the trade and of the processors of pigs and meat in some advisory capacity under a Bill which he might frame.  The farmers and the producers of meat have no way of meeting in common and putting their views to the Minister and it might be desirable to set up some form of body, a consultative council or board, which might help the Minister in framing policy and sometimes in <Col N="278" /> explaining to the trade, the producing and processing end of it, the reasons for certain ministerial policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes power to increase fees and I am the sort of person who, when he sees someone taking power to increase fees, says: &ldquo;I hope he does not increase them too much.&rdquo;  However, the Minister will have to lay them before both Houses of the Oireachtas to get them confirmed.</P>

      <P>The only comment I have to make on this Bill is that it is again another example of legislation by reference to Acts which the majority of us know nothing about.  I always think that, when a Bill of this nature is introduced, a White Paper should be circulated explanatory of the various references.  In sub-section (2) of Section 4, there is a provision which defeats me.  That sub-section sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where regulations are proposed to be made pursuant to paragraph (a), paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of Rule 2 of the Schedule to the Act of 1930, as amended by sub-section (1) of this section, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know what paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Rule 2 of the Schedule to the Act of 1930 are, and, if I am agreeing to the Bill as presented, I am agreeing to something of which I am entirely ignorant.  I think that, when Ministers bring forward legislation of this nature, instead of covering it <i>in globo</i> by a sub-section of that sort, we should get some explanation of the references because these are outside the Bill and I do not know what the effect of them may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know also whether the draft regulations which shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas shall be so laid only once or whether they shall be laid each time a regualtion is altered.  I understand that it is possible that a case might arise where a new regulation would be necessary.  Is it proposed <Col N="279" /> then to submit both regulations to the Oireachtas and does the Minister interpret these regulations before their application by the Civil Service?  I ask that because it may arise on another Bill which we will be discussing later.</P>

      <P>I have great sympathy with Senator O'Donnell's difficulty in the matter of these Bills by reference and I have often had experience myself of the very same difficulties with which the Senator now finds himself contending.  I tried in so far as I could to anticipate his difficulty in the introductory remarks I made relevant to the Bill, when I informed the Seanad that it is now proposed in Sections 4 and 6 that the rates of fee in both sets of Acts may be in future fixed by Statutory Regulations made by the Minister.  I went on to say that these new regulations will not have effect until they have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and approved by both House of the Oireachtas.  The regulations referred to by the Senator are the regulations dealing with the fixation of fees payable by bacon curers and fresh meat factories in respect of the actual volume of trade they happen to do.</P>
      <P>Every regulation or an amendment of a regulation, will have to be laid on the Table of this House and of the Dáil and approved of before it becomes operative.  I am proceeding backwards and so Senator Hawkins will excuse me if I deal with the point raised by him last.  Senator Burke raised some points which I should like to refer to briefly.  He said he thought it would be advantageous if it were possible for me to meet bodies representative of the trade from time to time and to discuss with them policy matters relating to the trade.  I do.</P>

      <P>Well, very often, I think arrangements of that kind work better without any machinery of that kind, but I have never had any difficulty either with the fresh meat industry or <Col N="280" /> with the bacon curers.  I have always found them ready and willing to meet me in a representative capacity, and that is a degree of co-operation which I&mdash;and I am sure my predecessors in office&mdash;greatly appreciate.  It is not set in any rigid form, and I really think it is no worse for that.  We do not feel reluctant to work with one another or to debate any matter very fully.  I am not aware that any misunderstanding has ever arisen between these trades and the Department of Agriculture that has not been readily resolved by consulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to be in a position to endorse what Senator Burke says about the excellent reputation of our Irish meat exports, fresh and cured.  It is largely with a view to maintaining that very high standard that all these Acts are enacted.  I would ask the Seanad to remember this, that while in respect of probably 90 per cent. of the exporters of fresh and cured meat from this country supervision of this kind would not be required at all, it is in respect of the 10 per cent., where such supervision is required, that this whole system of supervision has to be established, because it has to be borne in mind that one unsatisfactory consignment of fresh or cured meat from this country can reflect on the whole output.  It is the painful experience of us all that while there may be hundreds of tons of meat of first class quality passing into the market without comment, if one hundredweight of bad quality could be made the subject of complaint by jealous competitors abundant publicity will be forthcoming to describe that one unsatisfactory hundredweight while the hundreds of tons of first class meat will pass uncommented on into consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy with Senator Burke when he feels that there is undue inspection.  On the subject of inspection, I have had that feeling <Col N="281" /> from time to time, but I am, however, in a position to assure him that every reasonable precaution is taken to prevent undue duplication of inspection. I think it is true to say that where the officers of my Department inspect a bacon factory or a fresh-meat factory and certify that the conditions there are satisfactory, the Department of Health will accept our certificate in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to the duplication that I object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we are trying to avoid duplication between the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, but there are certain aspects in regard to factories which may not come within the ambit of our inspection at all: where it is necessary for the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce to inspect a factory for the enforcement of the Factories Acts such as dangers to employees, conditions and so forth which are not properly taken into consideration by the officers in my Department at all.  I can conceive a situation arising in which inspectors in the Department of Local Government may inspect a factory at the request of the local authority which alleged that there was some nuisance originating in the public sewerage system from some effluent from the factory. So far as we are concerned in the Department of Agriculture, provided the factory is in the condition in which it ought to be, provided the meat is handled properly and provided the place is kept clean and according to the standards which we set, it is not our function to determine what becomes of the effluent, provided it is satisfactorily removed from the factory premises. But it is not impossible for a local authority to complain that a factory is committing a nuisance and that they were unable to control it, and so would invoke the assistance of the Department of Local Government.  That may account for their intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last matter mentioned by Senator Hawkins was one which I tried to deal with in my introductory statement.  I gather that Senator Hawkins' solicitude is this, that there <Col N="282" /> should be do danger of an amendment of conditions attaching to a manufacturer's licence in the future which will not be of universal application.  The Senator may be assured that there is no such intention whatever, and I doubt if there is the power.  There is no intention of attaching a condition to any manufacturer's licence which is not a universal application.  I think the Senator did ask me that no new condition would be applied without the agreement of the licence holder.  That is a promise I could not make because conditions can arise in which a licence holder may very vigorously resent a condition which it is my duty to attach to his licence, but the Senator can rest assured of this, that if a condition is attached to his licence it will attach to every licence held by every other citizen of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="Minister for Defence (General MacEoin) Seán (Major-General) Mac Eoin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill, as its Long Title suggests, is to enable, so far as this country is concerned, effect to be given to and advantage taken of certain provisions of the Geneva Conventions signed on behalf of Ireland on the 19th December, 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conventions, of which there are four, were drawn up at a diplomatic conference held in Geneva in 1949, at which this country was represented. Two of the conventions, the Geneva Convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field, and the Geneva Convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war, replace the Geneva Conventions of 1929, regarding respectively the relief of the wounded and sick in armies in the field and the treatment of prisoners of war and bring them up-to-date to meet modern requirements.  Another of the conventions, the Geneva Convention for the amelioration of wounded, sick <Col N="283" /> and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea, replaces the Tenth Hague Convention of 1907 for the adaptation to maritime warfare of the principles of the Geneva Red Cross Convention of 1906.  The fourth convention, the Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war, is an entirely new convention.</P>
    <P>So far as we have been advised of the position, 43 countries have ratified the 1949 Conventions and 25 countries, including this country, have not yet ratified them.  In accordance with the normal practice followed in this country in such cases it is desirable that the necessary domestic legislation to give effect to the conventions should be enacted before the conventions are ratified.  The present Bill is the first of three measures which, it is expected, will be necessary before ratification.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Red Cross Act, 1938, was enacted so as to enable effect to be given to and advantage taken of certain provisions of the Geneva Conventions of 1929.  The 1929 Conventions referred to &ldquo;armies&rdquo; in a narrow sense as applying to the armed forces proper.  The 1949 Conventions referred to &ldquo;armed forces,&rdquo; and this expression covers, in addition to armed forces proper, several classes of persons such as war correspondents, supply contractors, etc., who accompany, with authorisations, the armed forces without actually being members thereof.  Similarly, the 1949 Conventions regard as &ldquo;prisoners of war&rdquo; all those who come under the category of &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; and who have fallen into the power of the enemy.</P>
    <P>The change from the term &ldquo;armies&rdquo; in Section 1 of the 1938 Act to &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; is effected in Section 4 of the Bill which sets out the primary objects of the Irish Red Cross Society.  Section 4 contains also a new primary object, namely, the furnishing of relief to civilians who are protected persons within the meaning of the Civilians Convention which, as I have said, is a new convention.</P>
    <P>Advantage is being taken of the present opportunity to amend the Red <Col N="284" /> Cross Act of 1938, so as to authorise the Irish Red Cross Society to engage in any activities of a humanitarian character which are considered suitable and to make charges in respect of such activities.  In Section 5 of the Bill which deals with this matter specific reference is made to authority to carry on a preventorium.  The society has been operating for some years children's hospitals at Ballyroan, County Dublin, and Montenotte, Cork, for the prevention of T.B.  The intention behind the provision in Section 5 is to remove any possible doubt that this good work can be continued by the society.</P>
    <P>Specific reference is also made in Section 5 to authority to provide an ambulance service and to make charges for such service.  I think it would be well to explain in some detail the considerations which led to this provision. As Senators are aware, the Red Cross Act of 1938 provided for the establishment and incorporation in Ireland of a Red Cross Society.  The Irish Red Cross Society was established by an Order made by the Government under that Act, and there is, I think, no need for me to stress the excellent humanitarian work which the Society has since then carried on with unremitting endeavour.</P>
    <P>For some time prior to 1945, the Irish Red Cross Society, through its branches, operated an ambulance service and made charges for the service.  In 1945, however, a High Court judge, in proceedings instituted by the Attorney-General, interpreted the 1938 Act as not giving power to the society to hire out ambulances. Since then, the society has discontinued to make charges for its ambulance service, which has been operated to a very restricted degree free of charge.  The peace-time activities of the society include the maintenance of an ambulance service for training purposes on the grounds that the most satisfactory and most thorough training in ambulance service work can be obtained only by actually operating such a service for the carriage of patients.  The existing ambulance service operated by the society is regarded as insufficient to provide <Col N="285" /> adequate training for its members.  I might say here that adequate training in ambulance service work is very desirable if the society is to be in a position to fulfil its mission, under the Geneva Conventions, to assist the medical service of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new in the operation by a Red Cross Society of an ambulance service on a hire or repayment basis.  Such a service is carried on by Red Cross Societies in a number of other countries, e.g.  Britain, Italy and Portugal and in the opinion of the International Red Cross Committee, the hiring of material by a National Red Cross Society would not be in any way incompatible with the Red Cross spirit and the Geneva Conventions. Any other society in this country such as the St. John Ambulance Brigade or the Knights of Malta is quite free to run such a service and it can be argued that it is unjust to maintain a discrimination against the Irish Red Cross Society in the matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that it is not, and, indeed, it never has been, the aim of the Irish Red Cross Society to run ambulances on a profit-making basis. This was exemplified when, in the course of the High Court proceedings in 1945, it was pointed out that in the period of about four years ended on the 30th April, 1945, the society received £5,500 for hiring charges but expended £8,100 in respect of the running, maintenance, etc., of the ambulances.</P>
    <P>Manned as it is by purely voluntary workers, the society's ambulance service could not be anything in the nature of a full-time service.  It has only a total of 18 ambulances, four of which are located in Dublin.  The society considers that it cannot, therefore, ever become a serious threat to any commercial firm operating a full-time service.</P>
    <P>While I have considered it essential to state fully the society's position in relation to this matter, I am also fully alive to the necessity for ensuring that there should not be cause for complaint that the society is interfering with any commercial ambulance concern. I propose, therefore, to issue directions under Section 6 of the Bill <Col N="286" /> which will preclude any such complaint of competition with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>For the information of Senators, I might say that it is intended that those directions will be on the following lines:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The society shall not ply for hire of its ambulances.  It shall not by advertisement, circular, or in any other way offer the services of its ambulances on hire.  Ambulances will be used on hire only on request and then subject to the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, those responsible for authorising the use of the society's ambulances will permit an ambulance to be used for hire only where:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  they are satisfied that efforts have been made on the patient's behalf to obtain a commercial ambulance but have been unsuccessful, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the patient's medical adviser certifies that the patient's condition is so dangerous that he cannot wait until a commercial ambulance arrives.</P>
    <P>(2)  A Red Cross ambulance may, however, without question be sent, on request, to convey victims of accidents to hospital.</P>
    <P>(3)  If any charge is made for the use of an ambulance in the circumstances already mentioned, it shall not be lower than the comparable rate for commercial ambulances.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the attendance of the society's ambulances is requested by the promoters of sports fixtures, race meetings, etc., to stand by in case of accident they may be permitted to do so and any gift or donation proffered by the promoters of such events in consideration of such attendance may be accepted by the society.</P>
    <P>(5)  Nothing in these directions shall be construed as preventing the society from using its ambulances free of charge where it considers that the humanitarian principles which govern all of its activities demand such action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> As an added safeguard so far as this House is concerned, any directions under Section 6 will be by way of an Order which must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and be capable of annulment by resolution within 21 days.</P>
    <P>In order to give effect to Articles 26 and 27 of the Wounded and Sick Convention and Article 24 of the Maritime Convention, provision is made in Section 7 of the Bill, empowering the Government:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to authorise voluntary aid societies (including the Irish Red Cross Society) to render assistance to the Army Medical Corps;</P>
    <P>(b)  to consent to a recognised society of this country, when neutral, assisting a belligerent, and</P>
    <P>(c)  to give official commissions to hospital ships which might be used by the society.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the 1938 Act protects from abusive use the emblem of the Red Cross on a white ground.  It is necessary in accordance with the Wounded and Sick Convention to place on the same footing as the Red Cross emblem, the emblems of the red crescent on a white ground, used by Turkey and other countries, and the red lion and sun on a white ground used by Iran as the emblems and distinctive design of the medical services of their armed forces.  Any rights acquired through the use of the emblems of the red crescent and the red lion and sun for trade or other purposes prior to the enactment of the present Bill will not, however, be disturbed. These matters are covered in Section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Wounded and Sick Convention provides prohibitions of a more absolute nature relating to the use of the Arms of the Swiss Confederation than were contained in the 1929 Convention on which Section 5 of the 1938 Act was based.  The 1938 Act provisions are now brought up to date in Section 9 of the Bill.  In pursuance of a reservation by this country to the 1929 Convention, provision was made <Col N="288" /> in sub-section (5) (3) of the 1938 Act preserving the rights of proprietors of trade marks registered before the 19th June, 1931, and containing the Swiss Arms.  As the 1949 Convention was not the subject of such a reservation by this or any other country, sub-section 5 (3) of the 1938 Act is being repealed.</P>
    <P>I think that what I have said gives a general picture of the nature of this Bill and the necessity for having it enacted.  The Seanad will not, I feel sure, have any difficulty in accepting the measure.</P>

      <P>We welcome this measure.  We approve of the proposals contained in it and we should like to avail of this opportunity of paying a particular tribute to those people who, particularly during the emergency years, joined the Irish Red Cross Association.  We were then a very new unit of the International Red Cross Association.  Since the formation of this body in Ireland, we have contributed our share to its development. It is one of these voluntary associations to which the Oireachtas should pay a particular tribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a voluntary body.  It has done very much and there is a very wide field for its future development.  In that regard, I would say that the field is particularly wide from the point of view of instilling into our young people a sense of citizenship and a sense of their responsibilities.  It is by being a member of an international organisation of this kind that we can get the best from our people.  As I say, we welcome the measure.  It is more or less one of these measures that we may have something more to say about on Committee Stage.  It is a further demonstration of our status as a sovereign and independent nation. As such, it is an organisation that we should encourage our young people to take an interest in.  This interest can only be engendered by pointing out to them the responsibilities and the obligations entailed by being a member of such an organisation.  Because of what it entails, I think we on this side of the House are prepared to <Col N="289" /> welcome the measure and give it our support.</P>

It is always difficult to keep voluntary societies of this nature going at full pitch during times of peace.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity of saying how much we in the City of Cork and neighbourhood appreciate the efforts of this society in running the preventorium for T.B. at Montenotte.  It is really a remarkable effort and it is a particularly remarkable effort on the part of the medical staff who, together with everybody else concerned, gave their services free since the preventorium was established.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Long Title of this Bill is &ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the Cork Fever Hospital Acts, 1935 and 1938.&rdquo; It will be of assistance to Senators in considering the measure if I review briefly the broad provisions of those Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1935 Act, which was amended slightly in 1938, authorised the replacement of an old fever hospital situated at Richmond Hill in Cork by a new infectious diseases hospital.  The Cork Corporation was charged with the building work which was to be financed mainly from the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  It was the intention that when the new building was ready the committee of the old hospital, which includes representatives of the Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, would hand over its administration to a new board.  That board would have <Col N="290" /> consisted initially of five representatives of Cork Corporation, five of the county council, and five elected by the old committee.  As members of the latter group disappeared, by death, resignation or otherwise, they would be replaced by representatives of the two local authorities.  In time, therefore, the new board would have been itself a local authority.  The staff was to have been taken over by the new board on their existing conditions of service.</P>
    <P>Those then were the terms of the 1935 Act and they seemed wise and prudent provisions until subsequent events made them out of date.</P>
    <P>A site for the new hospital was chosen at Gurranebraher and development work started in 1940.  This took four years to complete but, happily as it transpired, emergency conditions delayed the erection of a new hospital.</P>
    <P>A significant and sustained decline had in the meantime been noted in the incidence of infectious diseases and by the time building work could commence it was evident that fresh consideration must be given to the proposal to proceed with the building of a new hospital for that specific purpose.  For example, the number of cases of diphtheria in Cork City and County fell from 186 in 1935 to 22 in 1950 and of typhoid from 57 in 1935 to one in 1950.</P>
    <P>This meant simply that so many less beds were needed for the treatment of infectious diseases.  Over the whole range of infectious diseases there was a welcome falling off in demand for hospital treatment, a falling off which modern treatment procedures emphasised and increased.  This desirable and wholesome trend called for a general review of the hospital needs in the area and led to the conclusion that the expected future requirements in Cork for infectious disease accommodation could be met by existing institutions, thus releasing the Gurranebraher hospital for other use. There are in the area an insufficient number of beds for the treatment of orthopaedic defects and it was agreed with the Cork Corporation that the new hospital could best be used as an orthopaedic hospital.  The incidence of orthopaedic defects is remarkably high <Col N="291" /> and the 133 beds in the Gurranebraher Hospital will be fully utilised.  The Bill now before the House will permit this change to be made.</P>
    <P>It is not now considered necessary to set up a special board for the new hospital as the 1935 Act contemplated. Instead, it is proposed to hand over its administration to an existing joint board, the South Cork Board of Public Assistance, which consists of members of Cork Corporation and Cork County Council.  This board is already administering St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork, and district hospitals in Bandon, Kinsale, Macroom, Midleton and Younghal.  The board of assistance and the committee of the old hospital agree with this.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about the position of the existing paid officers of the old hospital.  The Act of 1935 provided that they should be taken over by the authority administering the new hospital on the same tenure of office and rights as they previously had.  This still holds good although, of course, the authority will now be the board of public assistance.  The provisions of the 1935 Act regarding the superannuation of such officers have been added to in order to take the later provisions of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, into account.</P>
    <P>The committee of management have, I am glad to say, agreed to the present proposals.</P>
    <P>I have paid tribute to them before and I do so again for their long and faithful work in the public service.  I know that the people of Cork appreciate the services given to them by the committee who have now placed in the competent and able hands of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance responsibility for the hospital treatment of infectious diseases in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my approval of this Bill.  Its necessity arises because of the very good news conveyed to us by the Minister that the incidence of infectious diseases such as diphtheria and typhoid in Cork City and County is now almost <Col N="292" /> nil, thank God.  This Bill seeks to convert what was originally intended as the Cork Fever Hospital into the orthopaedic hospital.  I think we should at this stage join with the Minister in paying tribute to the committee and staff of the Richmond Fever Hospital in Cork who throughout the years gave such unselfish and faithful service to those suffering from these dreadful diseases.</P>
      <P>It is a great source of satisfaction to the committee and staff to know that the incidence of these diseases has been reduced almost to nil.</P>
      <P>I regret the report of the increased incidence of orthopaedic ailments in Cork City and County, and to hear that in that respect the position is not so good.  Unfortunately at the moment we have in the city and county a waiting list of 200, or perhaps more people awaiting treatment for this ailment. This hospital will, I understand, be ready for opening probably early in the new year.  We in Cork feel that every day on which it is not available to the people is a day too long, in bringing relief to those suffering from orthopædic ailments and waiting for hospital treatment.  I trust that, please God, when this hospital is fully equipped, and working satisfactorily, in a few years' time we will have the same good news from it as we have had from the Richmond Hospital &mdash;that it is no longer required for its purpose.</P>
      <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that in Section 6 of the Bill it should be no longer necessary to refer to it as the Cork Fever Hospital Bill, or Act, when it is passed, and I would suggest that the title be amended from Cork Fever Hospital Bill, 1954 to the Cork Orthopaedic Hospital Bill, 1954.  There is surely no necessity to have the word fever any longer associated with that hospital.</P>
      <P>I wish to commend this Bill to the House and I trust that it will have a speedy passage and that the arrangements will be made before the end of the year, if possible, to open the doors of this hospital to the very large number of people who so urgently need treatment for orthopaedic ailments.</P>

      <P>May I, as a Corkman, say how gratifying it is to know that the Cork health authorities have by their efforts nullified the necessity for additional accommodation for infectious diseases.  I am sure the Minister must be very pleased to see the success which has attended State medicine in its preventive aspects, and like the other speaker I certainly trust that the public health authority in Cork will have as great a success in the curative aspect of public health as they did in regard to the prevention of infectious diseases.</P>

      <P>I want to endorse the statements of the two Senators who have spoken, and to express pleasure that this hospital in Cork is going to be opened soon to fill a very long felt want in the city and county.  When we hear of the increase in the orthopaedic ailments and the large numbers waiting for hospital treatment, I would be rather inclined to suggest to the Minister that so far as the health of children is concerned there are other things beside hospital treatment which mean much.</P>
      <P>We talk too much about health, while we hardly ever speak about the root causes of ailments.  I think that ailments in young children are due to the lack of sufficient food and nourishment. We talk about the health of the people, but I believe we should pay more attention to prevention rather than cure, because in the case of the fever hospital that is a question of prevention and having attention paid to sanitary conditions.  I think, however, as regards the increased number of children awaiting treatment in the new hospital, that is due also to lack of sufficient food and nourishment.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the House for the co-operative manner in which they have received this Bill.  It is a great pleasure to me as Minister for Health to have co-operation in a matter of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new hospital in Cork which will deal with orthopaedic ailments will, of course, take on a big task in the beginning. The question of dealing with orthopaedic defects and providing an orthopaedic service is, of course, going ahead at the moment and has been for <Col N="294" /> some time past.  One reason why there is such a large waiting list in Cork, and indeed elsewhere, is the development of a fine diagnostic service for these ailments.  More orthopaedic cases are being discovered nowadays and are being rightly regarded as cases for hospital treatment.  Formerly, they were not discovered and in fact it let to persons being made permanent invalids. Now, with the development of the orthopaedic service, more cases have been discovered, and therefore there is a waiting list, for instance, in Cork and the new hospital will have to discharge that waiting list, but I believe that, once it is opened, it will gradually be able to deal with the needs of Cork City and County, and also with the needs of nearby regions.</P>
    <P>I agree with what has been said by Senators with regard to the need for preventive medicine and that has always been pressed forward by me and by my predecessors.  It is an old saying that prevention is better than cure.  We have to cure, but we should also aim at prevention.  A very good example of the success of preventive medicine is found in the need for this Bill.  The development in this country over the last 30 years of our public health services dealing with diseases has brought about a remarkable change in the incidence of diseases here.  The development of immunisation against diphtheria, smallpox, vaccination and other preventive measures of the kind has brought a situation in this country to-day when diseases and fevers have ceased to be a serious menace.  There is, of course, a danger that a feeling of public complacency may arise.  Since fevers are no longer commonplace, people may regard them as not dangers.  For that reason, in recent health conferences which I had with different health authorities, I appealed to public representatives to help to inform public opinion and to continue co-operation with immunisation schemes and other branches of preventive medicine.  They have succeeded, but it would be very regrettable if that very success caused such a public complacency that these voluntary preventive services were no longer availed of. If that happened, fevers could again <Col N="295" /> become a social menace and indeed we might be looking for further fever hospital accommodation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan mentioned the Title of the Bill.  The reason the Bill is entitled the &ldquo;Cork Fever Hospital (Amendment) Bill&rdquo; is that it is designed to amend the Cork Fever Hospital Act of 1935.  Indeed, if it were called, as the Senator suggested, the Cork Orthopaedic Hospital Bill, I think it would be necessary for myself or some future Minister to come back to the Oireachtas and ask it to change the Title of the Bill to enable the hospital to be used for some other purpose.</P>

    <P>That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation <Col N="296" /> (Amendment) Scheme, 1954, made by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be confirmed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation by reference has got a bad name and the documents usually cause very great irritation. Superannuation schemes, at any rate, are a supreme example of that particular type of irriation and may not be easily understood at first glance.  The document before the House contains a few very simple ideas.  It arises out of two things: (1) the decision by the Government in August, 1952, to give <i>ex gratia</i> payments to certain teachers who had gone on pension before 1st January, 1950, and (2) some matters relating to the superannuation scheme for secondary teachers which were settled by conciliation machinery in March, 1952.</P>
      <P>Paragraphs 5 and 6 deal with the <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  From 1st January, 1950, secondary and primary teachers became entitled to a gratuity on retirement. Teachers who retired before 1st January, 1950, did not come under any scheme that had a gratuity payment, and, in August, 1952, the Government decided that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment would be made to teachers who had not the benefit of the scheme that came into operation from January, 1950.  The payments have already been made to the primary teachers, but the payments for gratuity and superannuation to secondary teachers come from a superannuation fund and until there was statutory authority for paying any moneys out of the fund, the payments could not be made.  The payments to the national teachers were paid, I think, in three lots, but, in view of the time that has elapsed since it was decided to make this payment, it is proposed that the payment of gratuity to the secondary teachers will be paid in one sum and I hope, getting this scheme through the Seanad to-night, to be in a position to make the payments within the next week or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed that secondary teachers who were on pension on 1st January, 1950, will get a gratuity based upon their pensionable salary, the salary upon which their pension <Col N="297" /> was based, and the payment that will be made to them will be one-thirtieth for each year of service in respect of the years from 1st January, 1935, to the 31st December, 1949, and further, in respect of any service from 1st January, 1905, to 31st December, 1934, at the rate of one-hundredth for each year of service.</P>
    <P>In planning the scheme of payment of gratuity, cognisance had to be taken of the general pattern of the superannuation scheme and the gratuity scheme for secondary teachers, and, in accordance with that pattern, which is the pattern of a superannuation scheme which is based on contributions, for the period from January, 1935, to December, 1949, there will be a deduction of 1 per cent. of the amount payable.</P>
    <P>The secondary scheme was not actually decided until about July, 1950, and a certain number of people may have retired between January and July, 1950, who got a gratuity under the current superannuation scheme.  If by any chance the <i>ex gratia</i> payment now proposed in connection with this scheme would have been greater than the gratuity they got in going out between January, 1950, and July, 1950, the difference will be made up to them.</P>
    <P>The rest of the provisions arise out of conciliation arrangements made in March, 1952, and one of the principle decisions then taken was that the salary upon which the pension would be based, instead of as it was before March, 1952, the average of the salaries paid for the three years before retirement will be the salary at the date of retirement.  Paragraph 7, therefore, provides that anybody who retired after 12th March, 1952, will have his pension and retiring gratuity based upon the salary he enjoyed in the year before retiring, and not on the average of the three years before, and any payments that have to be made to people who died in the meantime will be paid to their legal representatives.  All the scheme is changed permanently for those who are at present teachers.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 9 and 10 make provision that if a teacher who is pensionable passes to employment which is also pensionable in one particular period of <Col N="298" /> service, he will not be regarded as pensionable under both schemes.  The period will come in for pension or gratuity purposes only under whatever scheme is the appropriate scheme for it.</P>
    <P>Paragraph II recognises certain service in the Defence Forces as service for pension and gratuity purposes.</P>
    <P>When the 1951 amending scheme was introduced&mdash;the 1951 amending scheme which was, in respect of some minor matters, amended in 1952&mdash;it added to the general pension scheme retirement gratuities, marriage gratuities for women who retired for marriage purposes and disablement gratuities.  As a result of the introduction of these additional benefits into the superannuation scheme, there was an inducement to teachers who had given service either to come into the scheme, or, if they had come into the scheme after they had spent some years in the teaching service, to antedate their service for pension purposes back either to the begining of their service or, at any rate, to some date in the past.</P>
    <P>The scheme provided that arrears of contribution would be payable in order to allow them to have some of their past service included in the scheme. Senators will be interested to know that, as a result of the additional benefits and of the facilities given, by the payment of arrears of contribution, for teachers to come in, whereas there were only about 500 teachers in the superannuation scheme in 1951, there are now about 2,000.  A certain period was arranged over which they could pay their arrears of contribution.  It was fixed at something like five years. Paragraph 12 proposes to extend the period of payment from five to ten years because it was found in certain cases that there was a certain amount of hardship in requiring that all the arrears would be paid up inside five years.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 15 makes a concession. The original scheme provided that when a woman retired for marriage and got a marriage gratuity, the marriage had to take place inside three months from retiring.  This not only extends that period to four months, but opens the door a little more and gives <Col N="299" /> the Minister power in special circumstances to decide that the question of time need not necessarily arise at all.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 16 makes provision for service before 1929 which is not contracted for in any way by any kind of contribution.  Teachers in reckoning their time of service for pension can count for their lump sum a period before 1929 at the rate of one-hundredth of their pensionable salary for each year.  These are the main provisions, and they are in the language of the Statutory Order.  That is what the effect of the Order is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most of the provisions in this motion are based on agreed recommendations and are acceptable to the secondary teachers. There is just one point that I should like the Minister to consider.  It concerns paragraph 5 of the amendment and it is briefly this: the secondary teachers' scheme has been a contributory one since 1929, and the members are now eligible for <i>ex gratia</i> payments. They paid contributions for the five-year period from 1929 to 1934. Secondly, the adoption of the year 1934 is a point of demarcation.  It means that they do not benefit at the full rate for those five years which were years of great hardship for many teachers. Could they not be given a further five years, in addition, at the full gratuity rate?  That is the only point that I should like the Minister to consider in relation to the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme follows, in the main, on the lines of the scheme adopted in the case of the national teachers, and, as such is subject to the same critism and the same disabilities. I might mention that national teachers, unlike civil servants and other public servants, up to the year 1950 got a pension without any lump sum.  As Senators know there was an agitation for many years in respect to their pensions&mdash;that they should be treated in the same manner as public servants under the local authorities and as civil servants are treated.  Eventually following the report of the Roe Commission about 1950 the concession was granted that a lump sum, in addition <Col N="300" /> to the pension at the rate of half salary, would be given to teachers on retirement; but for some reason that I, personally, could never understand this provision was to apply only to those who were in the service in 1950.  Those who retired on the 31st December got no gratuity of any kind whatever although credit was given to the existing teachers for their years of service prior to 1950.  Those who retired in 1949, as I say, got no gratuity although they had served during all those years. It was just luck, in the case of the others, that the Act came into operation on that particular date.  An aggitation was naturally carried on to have that matter put right, and in 1952, as the Minister has pointed out an ex gratia payment was made, but not at all to the extent required to meet the case of the teachers who retired before 1950.  It was much smaller grant&mdash;I forget the details of it&mdash;than what a teacher would have received if he had got his gratuity, but worse than that it was paid in three annual instalments. Indeed some of the poor pensioners who had retired for many years before 1950 had gone to their eternal reward long before the second or the third instalment was paid.</P>
      <P>The Minister is now dealing with secondary teachers on the same basis. I object, of course, to that procedure being followed because I do not think it is fair to the secondary teachers any more than it was fair to the national teachers.  I hope that in the near future the Minister will look into this question again and see whether those who retired before the 1st January should not continue to suffer from the disabilities to which they have been subjected.  After all, they are a rapidly diminishing number.  The cost would not be very much and would gradually disappear.  I hope that the Minister and the Government will look into the matter both in the case of the national teachers and the secondary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Senator McHugh say that the scheme now before us was acceptable to the secondary teachers.  It has the same disabilities as the one which applies to the national teachers, and I am surprised <Col N="301" /> that the secondary teachers have agreed to it.  I trust that, in the case of both bodies of teachers, the disabilities which are there will be removed in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going into the details of the scheme, there is this to be said.  Any scheme at all of pensions for secondary teachers is a substantial improvement.  Every Minister for Education inherits a great deal of history, and schemes of pensions particularly, become very complicated. The points which Senator O'Connell made with regard to dates are always points of difference between teachers' organisations and the Minister for Education.  It should be remembered that it was, I think, the present Minister when he was Minister for Education in the first inter-Party Government who introduced the idea of the gratuity and the payment of a gratuity, and it is perhaps asking the Minister too much to ask him to solve at one stroke all the problems which have accumulated around this question of pensions through the various periods of history.</P>
      <P>There is one other point about it.  The Minister for Education may consider this matter.  As a Minister for Education, I gave some consideration to matters of this kind myself, but, looming in the background, there is always the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Finance rarely regards teachers in exactly the same terms, or sees them through the same spectacles, as the Minister for Education sees them, so that while the Minister for Education may give consideration and may do his best, he is not, in the nature of things&mdash;whatever Government is in office&mdash;able to accomplish everything which he wants to accomplish.</P>
      <P>I think it is fair to say that a great deal has been done.  That this scheme is not perfect is, of course, correct. This question of where you mark the line of demarcation, whether you make it 1940, 1950, or 1952, is always a bone of contention in schemes of arbitration. This scheme, presumably, will improve things until we get the perfect scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator McHugh I would like to say that it is not correct to state that the teachers between 1929 and 1934 paid 1 per cent.  Up to the time of the 1951 scheme there was no gratuity at all. There was no 1 per cent. deductable in respect of gratuities, and therefore, there is no overlapping.  This is just part of the structure of the contributory scheme and contributory system that is here.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator O'Connell's points, I am afraid that my difficulty in the Department of Education is that my face is turned very much to the future, and if it would not turn, naturally, that way it is being forced by faces being twisted towards all the problems that are looming ahead.  Any one who was in on the discussions that took place when the scheme that came into operation from the 1st January was introduced must be fully aware of the difficulties that faced anyone moulding a scheme at that time.</P>
      <P>It would have given me great satisfaction if I had been able to deal with the teachers who had gone out on pension at that time.  It did give me a certain amount of satisfaction that my immediate predecessor, Deputy Moylan was able to get a certain amount of money to apply to the distresses and the difficulties of the teachers who had gone out that time. What is being done now in relation to secondary teachers is what was done with regard to national teachers, that is national teachers who had gone out before the 1st January.  I am not able to add anything more that would bring immediate comfort to Senator O'Connell, but I appreciate the points which he has made.  I am glad that the secondary teachers are able to get something analogous to what the pre-1950 national teachers got.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann requests the Government to initiate proposals for legislation in the Dáil or in the <Col N="303" /> Seanad to provide that all elected parliamentary representatives of the people of the six occupied counties of Ireland will be given a right of audience in the Dáil or in the Seanad or alternatively requests the Government to submit this question for the decision of the Irish people by means of a plebiscite.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion, I am conscious that it is very necessary to give definite reasons for proposing it, because a similar motion has been defeated in the Dáil and it was stressed there again and again that even one reason that could afford a hope that the solution of partition towards the solution of partition would cause the Government to accept it.  Consequently, I have thought out my reasons carefully and I advance them as clearly and as cogently as I can.</P>
    <P>First of all, I advance the reason that the moral force of this resolution would have a tremendous effect in unoccupied and in occupied Ireland, because it offers an alternative to Irishmen who are at present forced into the position of having to take an Oath of Allegiance to a foreign monarch and to a foreign Constitution, an Imperial Constitution, in order to represent their constituents.  This, remember, was once the case in the Twenty-Six Counties and it caused disunity here.  References were made in the Dáil debate to the fact that the Nationalist representatives in the North were disunited.  No wonder; when an Oath of Allegiance was forced upon us here, there was disunity here.  That disunity largely disappeared only when the Oath of Allegiance was abolished.  Therefore, I would appeal to those who supported the view in the past that taking the Oath of Allegiance to a foreign monarch was a bitter pill which had to be swallowed in order to serve one's constituents at all, to support this motion because it will help to overcome that objection.  I think they are certain to realise from their own experience that it would remove a definite cause of disunity in the Six Counties just as it formerly removed it in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> I would appeal to those who assisted in abolishing that Oath of Allegiance to support this motion.  They must realise that in this respect the problem of Nationalist representatives in the six occupied counties is the problem that those men themselves faced here and faced for the sake of unity.  I would appeal to those who had nothing to do with the acceptance or rejection or abolition of an Oath of Allegiance in the Twenty-Six County Parliament, to those who without being concerned in these things are now reaping the benefit, because they can be democratically elected to a free Parliament without taking any such oath I give them credit for being unselfish enough and altruistic enough to want to extend this freedom to the Nationalist representatives of the Six Counties. I do not think it could be argued that there is no moral force in a resolution designed to counter the immorality of forcing an oath to support an Imperial ruler and an Imperial Constitution upon Irishmen who are opposed to both.  That is why my first argument is on the moral force of this resolution. That moral force is bound up with my next reason for proposing the motion.</P>
    <P>The motion, to my mind, represents a correct use of or an attempt to use correctly, existing democratic institutions to extend the principle of democratic rights to Irishmen at present denied those democratic rights. Now, much of my ammunition here is provided by An Taoiseach in the Dáil debate and I would like to quote one or two phrases.  He talked of &ldquo;flagrant breaches of elementary justice,&rdquo;&ldquo;the mockery of democratic institutions,&rdquo;&ldquo;distorted electoral areas,&rdquo;&ldquo;denial of the right of peaceful assembly.&rdquo;  He said it is our duty and our right &ldquo;to expose these abuses and to rouse public opinion against them at home and abroad.&rdquo;  He said further: &ldquo;We in the Fine Gael Party and in other Parties which now form the Government, made it absolutely clear to the young people that the ways of living for Ireland and working for Ireland were through the democratic institutions.&rdquo;  In short, his main argument, on this point of democratic institutions, was that proper democratic representation and procedure is denied in the Six Counties <Col N="305" /> but is operating here.  I say that it is very difficult to show how the young people can be convinced of what he hopes they will be convinced about, if we deny Irishmen, laid under disabilities in one part of our country, the use of the democratic institutions flourishing in another part of the country.  It is very difficult to see how better we can expose these abuses to which the Taoiseach referred in the Dáil debate than by saying to those representatives in the six occupied counties: &ldquo;All right, you are denied a democratic hearing in Stormont; we will give it to you here in the Dáil or here in the Seanad.&rdquo;  As for the young people, possibly like myself some of the Senators present attended that Dáil debate and they may have raised their eyes to the gallery and may have seen the number of young people who were interested in the motion proposed by Deputy McQuillan.  I think they would have noticed, too, their disappointment when the motion was rejected.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, this is a practical measure. There is no constitutional barrier in the way of its acceptance.  Some years ago in a Dáil debate the Attorney-General gave it as his opinion that there was nothing unconstitutional or impossible about giving a right of audience to Six County representatives. I was surprised when the Taoiseach referred to constitutional and legal difficulties against it, but this does not particularly affect the matter, because he went on to say.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Lord Brookeborough and some of his colleagues expressed the smallest desire to have a right of audience in the Dáil ... we could immediately take steps to amend the Constitution or to pass any necessary Act in five minutes to let them come down here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is no practical constitutional difficulty in the way of granting a right of audience to Six County representatives.</P>
    <P>I say in moving this motion that there is a practical advantage as well as a moral advantage.  It is that urged already in the Dáil by speakers of various Parties, by Independent Deputies, by Labour and Clann na <Col N="306" /> Poblachta Deputies.  It is the practical advantage of providing a democratic link and a means of continuous discussion with the Six County representatives upon legislation affecting the Six Counties, as much Dáil legislation is bound to do.  It has the further practical advantage of helping to end disunity among the Six County Nationalists.</P>
    <P>I will try to anticipate some other objections that may be raised to this motion.  I take it that some of the objections raised will be those argued in An Dáil.  I was not impressed by the Taoiseach's objections.  He first stated his willingness to welcome Lord Brookeborough and he went on to say that he would not welcome Nationalist representatives.  His reasoning, though somewhat difficult to follow, may be followed by the Minister for External Affairs.  In case it is, I wish to make these points.</P>
    <P>First of all, the Taoiseach argued that there was disunity among the Nationalists and that, therefore, they should not be given right of audience, but there is also disunity amongst the Unionists whom he is prepared to welcome. We frequently read in the papers of these Unionist splits.  If we give right of audience to all representatives of the six occupied counties, there is a hope that some of the discontented Unionist members may turn up to state their grievances against other Unionist members.  That would be the beginning of the wedge that would be hammered in the Unionist Party before very long.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it was argued that no single member of the Six County Parliament had written to the Taoiseach since last June, when Deputy McQuillan's motion was tabled to ask him to support such a measure.  I should like to point out that Mr. Liam Kelly has been elected by his constituents on the understanding that he would sit only in a Republican Parliament. He is now here, I am happy to say, and he will be able to tell the Seanad whether my view of conditions in the Six Counties is right or wrong. Mr. McGleenan was elected by his constituents in South Armagh on a similar undertaking that he would take his seat only in a Republican Parliament, <Col N="307" /> that he would abstain from Stormont. Still more recently, Mr. McAteer has written to the Taoiseach asking to be heard on this question of the right of audience.  He has been turned down on the basis of the Dáil discussion which involved the Taoiseach saying that he had not heard from any Six County representative asking for right of audience.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it was argued that if the Nationalist representatives were admitted to An Dáil they would want to become Deputies and, having become Deputies, they would advocate the use of force to end Partition elsewhere. The Taoiseach stated that there was perfect freedom within the State to advocate a war policy in a constitutional way.  This, I think, is very confused. First of all, there is no evidence whatever that if Nationalist representatives are given the right of audience they will wish to become Deputies. Certainly, if they are democratically elected and democratically entitled to advocate a war policy in a constitutional way, how can they be denied the right of audience on the basis that they would then seek to exercise a democratic right?</P>
    <P>Above all, I cannot understand the objection made by the Taoiseach when he said there was a danger that, first of all, the representatives would want to become Deputies and, having become Deputies, they would interfere&mdash; that was the word he used&mdash;in the politics of the Twenty-Six Counties. That, I feel, like certain references made to Northern Ireland, displays a Partition mentality.  These are not outsiders intruding or interfering or asking to intrude or to interfere with the affairs of the nation.  They belong to the nation and if they are denied justice in one part of the country we can at least offer them justice in another.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera's cranky query as to what was the point of people coming in here to discuss Partition reflects the same mentality and tends to produce the impression of vested political interests on this side of the Border who do not want any interference with the <i>status quo.</i>  This proposal is a practical <Col N="308" /> one and none of the objections made to it already can stand analysis. There is no constitutional objection to it and it does offer certain practical advantages.</P>
    <P>I come to my last reasons.  First, why was this raised in the Seanad? The Seanad is often denounced as a place where the crack of the Party Whip can bring Senators to heel as in An Dáil.  I do not believe that.  I do not know, as I have not been long enough here, but at least I am giving Senators credit for the ability to make up their minds and vote according to their own consciences.  When it came to a vote in the Dáil, the Party Whip was cracked and Deputies walked into the Division Lobby not in accordance with their consciences.  Here is a chance of showing that we can take an independent line upon a motion.</P>
    <P>I should like to say further that this motion provides a means of ascertaining people's wishes because it has been argued already that the measure would not be a popular one.  Well, at least the motion gives us a chance to find out by a plebiscite.  It was either Deputy Desmond or some other Labour Deputy who said in the Dáil that the issue was not beyond doubt in the country itself.  I believe that.  I believe it is not beyond doubt in the country.  I believe there is a great volume of opinion swinging behind our allowing Six County representatives to express their views here.  We may take it for granted that they will not simply give us rhetorical speeches about Partition.  We have had enough of these.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to the Senate which, after all, was altruistic enough to help to elect Liam Kelly, to show that the members can rise above Party and act as Irishmen.  They can remember the words of Tone.  They can remember the ancient and what is to a large extent the modern ideal of Irishmen, to abolish the memories of past dissensions and honour the common name of Irishman.</P>

      <P>The Senator will observe that there are three amendments to the motion in the name of Senator Sheehy-Skeffington.  Senator Sheehy-Skeffington will move these amendments now and a discussion on the amendments will be taken in conjunction with the discussion on the motion.  If necessary, at the conclusion of the debate a decision can be taken on the various net issues raised by the Senator.</P>

      <P>I accept, of course, the ruling that my speech is to be made now in proposing the amendments, since it would be impossible really to speak upon the amendments and not upon the motion itself.  While making my main speech now on the main issue, in proposing these amendments, I should like, nevertheless, to reserve, if I am permitted to do so, under Standing Order 29, the right to speak at the close of the debate in reply, if I desire to do so I am in the hands of the Chair. I do not insist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling.  I now beg to move these amendments.  Amendment No. I is to delete the words &ldquo;six occupied counties of Ireland&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 2 is to delete the words &ldquo;in the Dáil&rdquo; where it secondly occurs. Amendment No. 3 seeks to delete all the words after &ldquo;Seanad&rdquo; where it finally occurs to the end of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of these amendments is to simplify the motion and, in my opinion, put it into a form in which it would be unreasonable to vote against it.  My contention is that it is not at present in such a form, for three <Col N="310" /> reasons.  I will deal with amendment No. 3 first.  I consider that this, and I submit it for your consideration, is not a matter for a plebiscite.  If the Dáil decides by 100 votes to 21, and after a discussion in which all Parties took part, to reject such a measure, I suggest that the size of that majority is such as not to justify the whole procedure that would be required for a plebiscite.  I am in favour of representative Government, and unless you have a very close vote on an important issue, I do not think that a case can be made for a plebiscite, and that is the point of my third amendment.</P>
    <P>The second amendment follows on the result of the debate in the Dáil, and since the Dáil has rejected this suggestion, it seems to me to be more fitting if you were to invite the Northern representatives to the Seanad.  The Dáil has specifically stated that they do not want to hear them.  I feel that it would be more suitable for us to say, if we want to: &ldquo;We would like to hear you.&rdquo; Also I think, in addition, that it can be properly said that we are more a deliberative and consultative Assembly than the Dáil, and it might be more fitting in general that if they are to be invited here they should be invited to this House.</P>
    <P>The next amendment I want to deal with is in fact the first of my three proposals, and is the one which I think will give rise to an amount of discussion. I want to explain why I want in the motion the words &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;The Six Occupied Counties of Ireland&rdquo;.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;occupied&rdquo; could only mean occupied or held against the will of the inhabitants of the area.  It would be true, I think, to say that certainly two counties of the six&mdash;Tyrone and Fermanagh&mdash;are in fact so held.  They never asked to be separated from the rest of Ireland.  They have consistently voted in a majority ever since with the nationalist point of view, which means joining with the South of Ireland.  I think it could quite legitimately be said about them that they are occupied or held.  Some would hold that other areas of the remaining four counties, such as Derry City and one or two others, are occupied. <Col N="311" /> It is not, however, true of the whole area, the whole, either separately or collectively, of the four counties, and consequently this &ldquo;occupied Six Counties&rdquo; is a phrase used as a propagandist cliché and emotive phrase, and is not in fact a true description of the position.</P>
    <P>The true position is, if you talk about the six counties, that there is within these six counties something like 62 or 64 per cent. of the inhabitants who desire to remain joined to the United Kingdom.  I believe that that fact is not universally recognised.  I know the arguments and sympathies with which that will be met, that we, as the Irish nation, have the right to decide as a nation.  Nevertheless I hold that the people of the Six Counties, &ldquo;the Occupied area&rdquo;, as a majority have voted for the position, and to suggest that it is held against the will of the inhabitants of that area is not substantially true.  What it is true to say is that it is held against the will of the Irish people as a whole; that this area was part of Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <P>My main intention in suggesting this matter is this.  If we really do want, as I take it the proposers of the motion do, to invite all the Northern representatives here, Unionists, independents and so on, in addition to the Nationalists, we must realise the position.  We may not believe that they will come if we decide to invite them, but I suggest that it is not a good preliminary to the extension of an invitation to them to spit in the faces of the Unionists first, and to tell them that the only reason they are there at all is because of British power.</P>
    <P>I think that it is quite true that if both Unionists and Nationalists were to come down here, the gap between the Twenty-Six Counties and the Six Counties would be appreciably narrowed.  Would that be the case if we invited the Nationalists to come down alone?  That seems to be the more likely event if we pass this motion and the Government initiates legislation, though it is possible that occasionally Independents, or even independent Unionists, might come down. However, suppose that only Nationalists <Col N="312" /> came down, would it serve any useful purpose at all?  It might, on the contrary, be even widening the gap between the two peoples.  On balance, and I think it requires careful thought, I believe that such an eventually would be a good approach.  I believe that an invitation couched in moderate terms would be a good one.  How are we to know if it is feasible, technically, for us to say to the representatives of the North-Eastern counties: we will hear you?  I would say that from the realistic point of view, I am not convinced that a real purpose would be served by hearing them, but I do not find it in myself to say that no purpose would be served.</P>
    <P>I would say that it will be up to these representatives of the constituencies in the Six Counties who do come down, if any, to see to it that their speeches are of such a kind that we do not find ourselves in the position of saying secretly: &ldquo;Thank Heaven for the Border.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would now like to address myself to the main motion which I hope, for the reasons I have given, to see amended and improved.  I would issue a warning at this juncture to point out that I have not a little to say.  The aim of this motion I take it is not merely to embarrass the big Parties.  I take it there is the general intention, as Senator McHugh has told us, to be constructive and that this is not just a piece of political manoeuvring, to cause embarrassment.  I take it that the aim of the motion is to provide at least a step towards the ending of Partition, and I would say if it were a generally accepted step&mdash;but it is not in my opinion and I propose to develop that later&mdash;it would be a considerably better step than organised murder by political forces arising out of such methods.</P>

      <P>First of all, might I say that I do not believe that Partition is the most important problem in Ireland to-day.  I believe that it is a secondary problem.  I do not think that it is a primary problem at all.  I believe that the whole issue <Col N="313" /> of Partition is merely something that is being shamelessly used by Irish political parties to evade the more important problems of poverty, living conditions, disease, housing and education.</P>
      <P>Having stated that, I recognise the fact that Partition is for us a problem, but what special methods have been put forward or what suggestions have been made for the solution of the problem?  I think that there are three possible remedies: the first is the method of physical force; the second, the method of mutual agreement, and the third is the method which consists of taclking the Irish problems of poverty, disease, education, and seeing to it that there is a just distribution of wealth: tackle these problems and let Partition settle itself in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I examine each of these three possible remedies, I should like you to look at the situation in partitioned Ireland to-day, north and south.  In the north what is the position?  What is the position in the Six Counties?  As I see it, and I think everybody will share my view, there exists in the Six Counties a very great degree of political and religious discrimination.  There is no question about that: that Nationalists and Catholics in the Six Counties are discriminated against.  That goes not only for the politically active, the organised, those who may be in Parties.  I would say it is almost universal, that this discrimination on a big or small scale exists.  I shall take a few examples.  You have, in local elections in the Six Counties, a ratepayers' restricted franchise.  The British Labour Government, I think in 1946, altered the law, which had been long since altered in this part of the country, whereby you had to be the occupier of a certain holding in order to have a vote in the local elections. Stormont, which boasts of a step-by-step policy, took action to see to it that their law was not brought into line with British law.  By so doing, they opted out of the United Kingdom, and they refused to allow British writ to run, by refusing to have what would seem to be a common element of democracy: <Col N="314" /> universal franchise in relation to local elections.</P>
    <P>The other matter is the example of the Mater Hospital, one of the biggest and best hospitals in Belfast, a hospital which I have been through, and which compares very favourably indeed with many of the hospitals in this part of the country.  In the British House of Commons, when the various health measures were being introduced, it was found necessary to introduce a section dealing with Northern Ireland, which seemed to some of the Irish members there, to contain dangers.  So it was that on the 27th June, 1947, Mr. Mulvey proposed an amendment to a clause which was being discussed.  The amendments was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that where the character and the association of any voluntary hospital are such as to link it with a religious denomination, all necessary attention should be paid in the general administration, and in the making of appointments to the board of management to preserve the character and the associations of the hospital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That amendment was in fact almost word for word a repetition of Section 61 of the English Health Act, and of Section 60 of the Scottish Health Act.  Mr. Chuter Ede said in relation to that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As far as the amendment is concerned, I understand in North of Ireland the Government desires to follow Section 61 of the English Act which incorporates the principle enunciated in the amendment.  I hope, with that assurance, my honourable friend, the member for Fermanagh and Tyrone, will withdraw the amendment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Mulvey did in fact at once withdraw the amendment, on that understanding. When it came to the implementation of what was virtually a promise by a British Minister in the House of Commons, Stormont went back upon the word tendered on their behalf, although Mr. Connolly Gage had spoken in the House of Commons on the same occasion, and had supported the interpretation offered by <Col N="315" /> Mr. Chuter Ede. Despite that fact, Stormont went back on that, and decided to operate a discrimination against the Mater Hospital, such as was not operated against similar hospitals with religious associations in Scotland.</P>
    <P>There is another point in relation to local elections, and that is the often-mentioned gerrymandering.  There is no question, and one does not have to prove it here, that local elections in the Six Counties have their constituencies so arranged that a minority of the electors, in a great number of areas, have a majority of the seats on the councils.  I would say at this juncture&mdash;if I may say so in parenthesis&mdash; that I think there is perhaps a misunderstanding and ignorance among many well-meaning people, as to just what has been done by gerrymandering in the North.  I would say that it applies almost entirely to local elections. It is true there is a very odd constituency such as Derry City, where it applies in relation to general elections, but if a fair vote was taken throughout the Six Counties, without any alteration of the constituencies, or under any system you care to devise that would be regarded as normal, the results of the general elections, either for Westminster or for Stormont, would hardly vary so much as two or three seats.  I say that here, because I get the impression, in discussing this with many people, that they think that Lord Brookeborough is Prime Minister at Stormont simply by reason of of fact that he has rigged the elections, whereas in point of fact the pro-English majority in the Six Counties, taken as a whole, is certainly not less than 62 per cent., and perhaps several per cent. higher.</P>
    <P>There are other things which I think should be mentioned in speaking about discrimination in the North&mdash;for instance the banning of the use of the Irish Tri-Colour&mdash;which seems to me to be a small and petty measure.  I am familiar with the kind of defence that is put up for it, but it seems to me that the banning of the flag is indefensible.  It seems to me the more <Col N="316" /> indefensible, as I remember occasions upon which mere speech was banned in the Six Counties.  I remember as a small boy going on a visit to Belfast with my mother, to my grandfather, who was an Ulsterman.  She was served with a notice of expulsion at Belfast station, because she was a &ldquo;dangerous person&rdquo; for the well-being of the Six Counties.  She was not, in fact, going up for political purposes at all, though she frequently did so both before and after the Deportation Order.  I remember, some members of the House may remember, that she spent many weeks in Armagh Jail in 1933 for the crime of speaking the truth, as she saw it, in the home county of her late husband, my father.</P>
    <P>Consequently, this banning of free speech, and banning of flags and processions, and so on, quite unnecessarily in my opinion, constitutes a form of discrimination, and therefore in the Six Counties as we look at them to-day, there is a deep, genuine, and perfectly understandable feeling of frustration on the part of the Nationalist and Catholic section of the community.  They are kept out of, or kept in a small minority on, the local councils, corporations, Government boards, commissions, and so on.  They are, in short, excluded from the councils of the community; their opinion and their advice is not wanted, and the Government makes no bones about indicating that fact to them.  By a variety of discriminatory techniques, they are prevented from playing a part in the affairs of the community proportionate to their numbers.  This is unjust; it is indefensible, and it is highly dangerous, because from such frustration springs resistance and violent measures, of which I personally cannot find myself approving.</P>
