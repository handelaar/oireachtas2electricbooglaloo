    <P>The proposals contained in this Bill have been framed with the object of creating a fund fed annually by levies on exports of salmon and on salmon rod licences, the produce of which can be applied for the conservation of the stocks of salmon on which the salmon fishing industry depends for its prosperity. It is hardly necessary for me to say that this industry is an extremely valuable one inasmuch as it produces an exportable surplus valued at close on £750,000 yearly, and also offers highly enjoyable sport both to our native anglers and to a growing body of visitors to this country.</P>
    <P>The duty of protecting and conserving stocks of salmon is placed by statute on boards of fishery conservators who are provided by law with two main sources of income, namely fishery rates and licence duties.  Proprietary fisheries are already bearing a very considerable burden of rates in contributing a total of some £26,000 annually to conservancy funds, and the licence duties on rods and on the various fishing engines used for commercial capture of salmon bring in another £15,000.  In the past few years, with salmon commanding unprecedentedly high prices, there has been added incentive to the capture of fish in season and out of season and whether by fair means or foul.</P>
    <P>The conservators have done all that is possible within the resources at their command to strengthen their protection services and to meet the <Col N="489" /> growing demand for better pay on the part of their hardworking protection staff.  The majority of boards find themselves committed to spending in excess of their statutory revenues in order to maintain a minimum protection service, and steadily increasing provision has had to be made in the Vote for Fisheries for the payment of grants to boards which find themselves in this position.  A sum of £8,000 which was provided for this purpose in the present financial year did not, in fact, suffice to meet all the calls for financial assistance which, on the information available to me, as to deficiencies in staffing of protection services, I should have felt fully justified in meeting had the necessary funds been at my disposal.</P>
    <P>It might appear that this shortage of funds could readily be met by increasing the statutory revenues of the conservators but as I have already said, fishery ratepayers are already bearing a very heavy burden, with the rate in many cases standing at a higher rate per pound than that for local authority purposes.  If an increase in licence duties were to be relied upon, nothing less than 100 per cent. increase all round would be worth while and this I am satisfied, would not result in an equitable distribution of the additional burden particularly for the working fisherman who would have to find double his present licence duty before the season opens, irrespective of whether the season should prove to be a good one or whether the particular fishery in which he plies his trade enables him to sell on the early market or only in the late summer when prices have fallen on arrival of the grilse run in our waters.  To meet such a variety of conditions, it is obvious that the contributions by the fishermen using the commercial methods is best secured on a pay-as-you-earn system.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill providing for the imposition of the two forms of levy call for little elaboration. Section 2 provides for the making of Orders requiring the payment of levy on all salmon proposed to be exported. and Section 3 provides for the fixing of the rate of levy from time to time.  By <Col N="490" /> sub-section (3) the rate is subject to a ceilling of 2d. per lb., which may be lifted only if an Order is made prescribing a higher rate and is confirmed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas, in accordance with sub-section (4).  On the basis of exports of the volume experienced in recent years, it is expected that adequate revenue will be brought in by levy at the rate of 2d. a lb. on exports up to the end of May in each year, and 1d. per lb. from 1st June onwards when fish of the grilse type form the major portion of the catch and market prices are correspondingly lower.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the payment of levy on salmon rod licences at a rate which is not to exceed one-half of the licence duty.  This provision will apply to the present £2 rod licence for a whole season in any fishery district and to the short-term licences issued at £1 each by certain boards for 14 days or for a period after 1st July in any year.  As provided in sub-section (4), no levy will be chargeable on the 10/- endorsement fee payable by a rod fisherman to the board of conservators for each additional district after the first in which he proposes to fish.  As at present advised, I consider that a levy on salmon rods at the rate of one-fourth of the licence duty will correspond in a rough and ready way with the rates of levy on exported salmon.  I may say, however, that this is based on a very conservative estimate of anglers' catch for which we must rely on statistical returns furnished by the rod fishermen themselves.  We have allowed for an average annual catch of only five fish per rod and, in these days when there are so many professional anglers and when even the sportsmen are becoming increasingly interested in the commercial value of their catch, these ideas may have to be radically revised.</P>
    <P>The only other matter of principle to which it seems necessary to refer is the fact that Section 7 provides for the making of grants or repayable advances into the Salmon Conservancy Fund out of voted moneys.  This is purely a precautionary measure as I see no reason to apprehend that at any time in the foreseeable future the revenues coming into the fund should <Col N="491" /> be insufficient for the purpose intended save, perhaps, in the event of exceptional circumstances when advances might be required to make good some temporary deficiency due to a poor salmon-fishing season.</P>
    <P>I may say that the principle underlying this Bill, namely that the funds required for the better protection of salmon should be found from within the salmon-fishing industry itself, is one that has been discussed fairly widely, and I know of no reasoned case which has been made against it.  If any additional information is required to enable the House to appreciate the necessity for this measure, I shall be very happy to afford it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I must oppose any attempt to impose a levy on the export of fish.  I take it that what is comtemplated by &ldquo;export&rdquo; is export from this country, not, say, from one county to another.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will make that clear to us.</P>
      <P>Not very long ago, it was suggested here that a levy or tax should be imposed on cattle leaving the country. That was very strongly opposed at the time and the suggestion, when made, was immediately suppressed.  We never heard anything more about that.</P>
      <P>The levy of 2d. per lb. proposed to be imposed on the export of salmon&mdash; with the right, on approval by both House of the Oireachtas, to increase it&mdash;may not appear very great.  I think I may concede straightway that it is a small tax.  However, I thoroughly dislike the idea of taxing any export of ours.  I fear it may open the door for this suggestion that was made some time ago that cattle being exported from the country should be taxed.  If only for that reason, we should oppose the proposal to levy a tax on salmon which is being exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not hear the Parliamentary Secretary say what amount it was expected would be realised by this imposition.  I do not know if the Minister's expectancy in regard to this amount will be fully realised.  The imposition of the levy may start <Col N="492" /> another industry and the Minister may not be able to collect any money at all.  The new industry that may be started, following the imposition of this levy, will be the illicit export of salmon with a view to avoiding payment of the levy.  I thoroughly oppose the levy for the reasons which I have stated.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary what effort is being made to deal with the poaching of fish?  I understand that poaching has increased very considerably in recent years.  I learned not long ago that there was not the co-operation that we might expect between the boards of conservators and the Garda Síochána.  If that information is correct, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to do what he can to ensure that there will be complete co-operation between the Garda authorities and the conservators, with a view to preventing poaching.  I think that poaching has proceeded recently on a very extensive scale, with very great damage to fishing both from the point of view of those commercially engaged in it and from the point of view of those people who take a rod and line to fish by way of sport.</P>
    <P>For the reasons which I have indicated, I think we should oppose this levy on exported fish.  I think it is all wrong that we should impose that levy.  I find it difficult to believe that the Minister could not raise the funds otherwise than by a levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us whether he has been in consultation with fishery associations on this matter and what the reaction is?  I understand from friends of mine who are interested in deep-sea salmon fishing in the Donegal area that this levy will be a very serious deterrent to them in the development of their fishing.  The majority of people operating in that area are people of small capital and limited means.  If it were necessary at all to finance a board of conservators to help them to combat poaching or to protect the fisheries, it would be more desirable that some <Col N="493" /> other source should be found for the provision of this money.</P>
      <P>The Donegal fishermen tell me that though it might appear a small amount, it can have a very severe effect on them.  It is a haphazard life and very great risks are involved. There is an increasing capital expenditure accruing from day to day.  They look on this as a sort of thing that would drive them back to the limits of their endurance and endanger their survival as fishermen.  There is more involved than the mere provision of the money for a certain purpose.  The majority of the men who are deep-sea fishermen belong to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. Anything we may do which might injure the inhabitants of that area should be very carefully considered. If the Parliamentary Secretary had asked for a sum from the Central Fund he would have had more ready approval.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from that point, this principle of the introduction of a levy on an export article is a rather unsound one and it is rather unfair, except in times of emergency or where it is in the national interest that no goods should be exported, particularly anything that is native to the country. Senator Hearne shakes his head, probably as disagreeing with me, but I can see no reason why, when times are normal and when trade is being sought for through the ordinary channels, an export levy should be imposed on any export article&mdash;except where it is being exported to the detriment of the national interest.  The Parliamentary Secretary cannot say that the export of salmon&mdash;of which he said there was a considerable export surplus last year &mdash;is doing something against the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real trouble about salmon is that the ordinary people cannot afford to buy it.  It is priced out of the market. It seems to be one of the luxury articles for which we have succeeded in finding a market abroad.  We should be careful now about doing anything which may damage that market&mdash;apart from the effect it may have on the lives of people in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht who are fishermen by tradition and who are living upon the fringe of near <Col N="494" /> starvation.  No one knows that better than the Parliamentary Secretary himself, who comes from the area and knows I am pleading for people of his own kith and kin.  I am sure he would be the last to impose this levy if there were any other means of doing it.  I suggest he might reconsider the method employed and the principle involved.  It is sure to have a bad effect on these people and also it is creating a precedent in the export of goods.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which strikes me.  I am not quite clear as to how it will affect the single rod angler.  It is obvious that if there is one thing that can be sold here as a tourist attraction, it is above all others the art of angling.  We have been blessed in Ireland with a number of rivers where there is fine fishing accommodation and fine fish.  Anyone in touch with anglers knows that for the past few months, since the fishing opened on the 1st February, there is abundant evidence that the sport of salmon fishing is one that should be developed in every way. There is nothing which would react more unfavourably on private angling &mdash;apart altogether from the principle of increased charges&mdash;than a levy of this kind.  It should be carefully avoided by any Government.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we have the Minister for Industry and Commerce coming here to tell us all the good things we have and all that Fógra Fáilte and the Tourist Association are doing.  Probably there is no attraction in which there is more enjoyment or more in which there is material benefit than that of angling.  If this Bill is going to react upon anglers we ought to view it from that aspect.  I see Senator Dowdall here and I think that she in another capacity might be able to see that point.  Anything that would damage private angling should be avoided.</P>
    <P>My primary consideration is for the fishermen, for those living on the fringe of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht area. They tell me at least&mdash;I do not know what they told the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;that this levy, small as it may be, will make things difficult for <Col N="495" /> them.  We know how these things work and how State officials, when they get in the thin end of the wedge, can increase this levy more and more.  This is an intrusion on the livelihood of people for whom we are passing money under other heads in this House to aid their survival.  Nothing makes their survival more difficult.  This Bill creates a precedent in the charging of a levy on these exportable goods, and on that principle alone I would oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Government considers the establishment of this Salmon Conservation Fund as necessary for the encouragement and preservation of what should be a very important industry and what should bring in an amount of capital into the State.  Senator O'Reilly referred to the incidence of poaching. I confess that I have some kind of sympathy for poachers.  Many stretches of our salmon and trout rivers are under the control of vested interests&mdash; people who are not racy of the soil, who have inherited these rights from an alien Government.  If it were possible to put the preservation of our rivers under popular control I believe that a large amount of the poaching and illegal fishing would be avoided. I am told that the co-operation at present between the Garda and the water bailiffs is not what it used to be before we secured our independence. I hope that at some future time some Minister will take the courage in his hands and try to get rid of these vested interests.  By putting these rivers and this industry under popular control he would create a feeling of pride on the part of young people in the development of this industry and that would prevent a great deal of the illegal fishing going on now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the Bill, from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said about it.  I understand this levy on exports is for the purpose of providing money for the boards of conservators, to enable them to protect the salmon fishing.  I know very little about fishing, but I understand this Bill is very necessary as the <Col N="496" /> poaching has developed to such an extent that it may destroy the industry. It will require to be put down if the industry is to be preserved.  For that reason we should be quite satisfied to impose the levy, seeing that it is for the purpose the Minister has stated.  I always heard that this salmon industry was capable of very great development. Very many years ago before the Shannon scheme was started there was very good fishing there, but I understand that the Shannon scheme had a drastic effect on fisheries in the Shannon. I suggest that as this industry is capable of great development, for which there is a good and enduring market and a profit to the producer, every possible step should be taken to develop it to its fullest extent.  It might be better to set up a Government company such as has been established for other things, in order to undertake the export of salmon.  Though I make that suggestion I am not sure if it would be the right thing to do.  The industry should be developed to its fullest extent for the general good of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should deal with the point of principle which has been raised by Senator P.F. O'Reilly and Senator O'Donnell.  Senator P.F. O'Reilly has made a comparison between a levy on exported salmon and a levy on cattle.  I think that such a comparison will not bear examination at all.  When one considers the very large sums of public money which are provided so that farmers can rear their stock to the best possible advantage, can have the best breeds, can have made available to them knowledge as to the best kinds of feeding, and when the country is dotted all over with stations which provide scientific aids and helps to the farmer and when there is an army of officials helping the farmer in respect of every detail of agricultural produce, so that his losses will be reduced to a minimum and his produce will be of the best marketable kind on foreign markets and then considers that none of that work is necessary in relation to fish, that Almighty God Himself has done in relation to fish what the State and taxation are trying to do for the farmer, I think one will realise that the comparison is demolished straightway and that this cannot at all be established as a matter of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activity in relation to the protection of salmon comparable with what I have indicated in the agricultural field is exactly what we are now doing.  The fish are there&mdash;nature provides them&mdash;and all we want to see is that nature gets a fair run.  If nature gets a fair run, the commercial fisherman and the sporting fisherman will be able to get the fullest possible sport and profit from the industry and that <Col N="498" /> condition of affairs will continue if we can reduce to the minimum the unfair methods&mdash;the unnatural methods, I might call them&mdash;which alone limit the profits which the netsmen in the estuary and the rodsmen on the river can get from the lordly salmon. Therefore, I think there is no comparison at all between a levy on agricultural produce and a levy on fish, because nature takes a hand in the matter which it does not take in the same way at all in relation to agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell asked me if I had consultations with the people who would be best able to advise on this matter.  I should like to tell him that, a year ago, I attended the annual meeting of the National Salmon Anglers' Federation in Clonmel, and, while no formal decision was made while I was present, both I and the Civil Service head of the Fisheries Branch, who accompanied me, came away with the impression that not alone did the Salmon Anglers' Federation support this but they were enthusiastic about it&mdash;even the part which imposes an excise duty of 10/- on themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position of the deep-sea fisherman?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the advice I got in favour of this, let me continue and say that I have had the same sort of advice also from boards of conservators and from smaller groups than the National Salmon Anglers' Federation around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the netsmen, I might, perhaps, throw light on the matter for Senator O'Donnell best by telling him that, in the Cork area, the netsmen, some years ago, submitted themselves voluntarily to a levy of 6d. per lb. for this very purpose.  They appreciate, and nobody appreciates more realistically than the netsmen, the necessity for better and more constant protection of the narrow waters in which the great damage is done. Anywhere I have gone amongst estuarine fishermen, they have all insisted on this one point: that the salmon they go out to catch have a pretty good chance of escaping their nets. <Col N="499" /> They usually fish in estuaries which are fairly wide and the salmon gets a fair run, so to speak; but they have always pointed out to me that when the salmon escape their nets and get into narrow waters in the remote stretches of the rivers, the salmon have no chance, and they have always insisted that better protection should be provided in these more dangerous waters, as they describe them.  That, I am certain, will be accepted by all Senators as being the truth of the position.</P>
    <P>The question, therefore, that seems to me to be resolved is the source from which this money is to come.  We have only two sources from which it can come and we did not toss up a coin to choose which of them we would adopt. We examined each of them thoroughly and exhaustively and on the result of that examination we decided this was the better method, the other being that the general taxpayer should foot the bill.  If we are again to apply principle to the question I do not think I would have any fixed or firm opinion that it should not be done by way of putting a levy on the general taxpayer who never handles a rod, who has never seen a salmon net and who, as Senator O'Donnell indicated, has never tasted a bit of salmon in his life because it is too deal and beyond his reach.</P>
    <P>As I say, I would not have any objection to doing that on principle. I think at the same time that if one applies a sense of fair play and equity to the matter there was not any choice but to decide that the people who followed fishing as a sport should really pay the piper in the matter.</P>
    <P>There are 7,000 people who get the whole or part of their livelihood from salmon fishing either as netsmen or as employees of boards, et cetera.  Last year there were, I think, in round figures, 6,000 licences.  All these people are not Irishmen but I take it that nobody has an objection to foreigners coming here and paying their licence and fishing wherever they can get salmon fishing here.  Here is a total of 13,000 people who are intimately interested in salmon fishing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> I think it is true to say that all the people who take out rod licences are not now angling for salmon purely for sport.  We know that some of our rodmen&mdash;it gratified me to hear it, in any event&mdash;were making a very considerable sideline from their salmon rod licences.  It is not, I think, an exaggerated statement to say that many of them would earn an income of £100 per year from legitimate salmon angling.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, statistics available to us of the amount of salmon captured by the various methods.  By statute it is mandatory to supply statistics of all salmon and white trout taken.  On the basis of these statistics, it has been worked out that the average rod catch, taking the country as a whole&mdash;I am not breaking it up into its various fishery districts&mdash; is from four to six salmon per year. The value of that catch is estimated to be between £10 and £13.  That is an average.  If you take some districts you will find that the average varies. Take the district of Ballina.  The average there would be about £20 per rod.  The extra 10/- which the rodman has now to pay should be examined, I think, in the light of the value of the average rod catch.</P>
    <P>Back in 1925, when 20/- was more valuable than it is now and when the salmon rod licence was £1, the licence was increased to £2.  I suggest that an increase of 100 per cent. in 1925 was a much taller order for the salmon angler than is 25 per cent. of £2 in 1954.</P>
    <P>We do not propose to add anything to the endorsement licence of 10/- as provided for in the 1925 Act, but the increased duty would apply to the short-term licences which are made available by some boards after 1st July for visiting anglers.</P>
    <P>Matters with which this Bill does not deal have been referred to, and while I have no objection to giving as much information as is available to me, I am sure Senators will realise that information will not readily be available in regard to matters on which I have not been briefed.  On the question of ownership referred to by Senator An <Col N="501" /> Seabhac and Senator Ruane, I would say that the 1939 Act provided for the acquisition of the estuarine fisheries.</P>
    <P>The emergence of the war situation prevented that particular part of the 1939 Act from being implemented.  It is so framed that a considerably long period of observation will have to be undertaken before, in fact, acquisition of any such fisheries could be completed. I feel that because of the long delay which has already taken place it is undesirable that we should proceed to implement that part of the 1939 Act as it stands and that some more expeditious method of securing the acquisition would have to be worked out.  I can tell the Seanad that a suitable amendment of the 1939 Act for that purpose is being given attention at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Branch is one that does not take a prominent place among the Departments of State, but I want to tell the Seanad that I discovered the amount of work which the Fisheries Branch does bears no relation at all to the smallness of the number of its staff.  The amount of routine work which is placed upon them has prevented them from giving the attention to this very important matter of ownership which it should be given.  When I discovered that position, I made suitable representations.  I have succeeded in securing for Fisheries Branch some extra help which will be applied very effectively for the purpose to which the Senators referred.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Senator O'Reilly what efforts we were making to check poaching.  All I can say is that this Bill is the answer to his question.  We want more money for this purpose.  I do not want to be taken as promising that we will eliminate poaching entirely. I think Senators knows as well as I do that that is impossible.  If we reduce it to manageable dimensions, we will secure that the stocks in our rivers will be adequate for the future operations of both the sportsman and the netsman.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don chaint a rinne an Seanadóir MacPháidín.  Arís ba mhaith liom a rá leis nach raibh agam ach an dá <Col N="502" /> rogha.  Theastódh uaim an teacht isteach do mhéadú fá dhó mar tá fhíos ag Seanadóirí íocann lucht na n-eangach £4 ar cheadúnas sar a mbéarfaidh siad ar bhradán ar bith. Leis an méid chéanna airgid a fháil chaithfinn luach an cheadunais sin a mhéadú fá dhó i riocht is go mbeadh ar an iascaire £8 a íoc in ionad £4. Is dócha go bhfuil fhios ag Seanadóirí, mar tá fhios agam féin, fá iascairí an iarthair, gur minic a chaitheann an t-iascaire an t-airgead sin d'fháil ar iasacht agus gur minic nach mbíonn rath ag an iascaireacht.  Bíonn difríocht ins gach inbhear.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh rath aír in inbhear amháin agus i gceann eile nach mbeadh rath ar bith léi.  Mar sin, bheadh a £8 caite sa pholl ag an iascaire bocht sin. Chaitheann sé an £4 a íoc ar aon chaoi.</P>
    <P>Sa chás seo nílmíd ach ag iarraidh air go n-íochfadh sé do réir mar a shaothrós sé agus dá mhéid a shaothrós sé sea is mó a íochfadh sé.  Ceapaim go bhfuil sin an-chothrom ar fad.  Is féidir le duine £10 a íoc do réir a chéile bhféidir nuair nach bhféadfadh sé £1 amháin a leagadh síos.  Bhí sé sin ar intinn agam nuair a bhíomar ag ceapadh amach an bealach ab fhearr chun an t-airgead a fháil.</P>
    <P>Táim ag ceapadh gur thug mé freagra i mBéarla ar an Seanadóir, An Seabhac, fé únaereacht agus ní dóigh liom gur gá é a rá i nGaeilg leis.  Pé scéal é, ba mhaith liom a innsint dó gur rud an-tábhachtach linne an cheist sin agus go bhfuil an oiread deifre orainn le deireadh a chur leis an sean réim agus tá air féin.  Is mian liom a chur in iúl dó, áfach, go raibh fadhbanna agus deacrachtaí le fuascailt sa scéal agus táimid ag iarraidh réiteach a fháil ar na fadhbanna sin.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I have answered all the points that were made and if there is any question of special importance which any Senator thinks I have not dealt with adequately I will be only too pleased to answer further questions.</P>

      <P>I shall try to give the full information I have at my disposal. I did not suggest that nets fishermen or even rodsmen are enamoured of the taking of more money from them.  What I do suggest is that the netsman who is now asked to pay the additional money which we want from him according as he earns it would choose that method rather than being asked to pay £8 down, as compared with the £4 which he now pays, before he can cast a net or before he can catch a salmon. Senators, particularly from the West of Ireland, know that pretty often the netsman has to borrow the £4 to pay for the licence and if he has a bad year he cannot make very much on it.  I had to bear that consideration very much in mind in deciding as to which method would be adopted and it seems to me that £8 would be rather much to ask a netsman to pay at the beginning or a incur as a debt, running the risk as he always must that he might not earn £8 worth of fish.  I thought that even if he had to pay the greater sum over the season&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Might I again appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, before he gets this Bill, that he might consider the adoption of some other method of doing the work he wants to do?  I quite agree with Senator Hearne that there is no use in holding up the Bill, because it is quite obvious I am in a minority of one in this matter.  However, I am still thinking of the fishermen and of the workers in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  Despite the arguments of the Parliamentary Secretary, I believe there are other sections of the community who could carry this burden better than the net fishermen. There are many other Bills passed through this House in connection with which the money comes out of the Central Fund.  If you take old age pensions, which is in itself a sort of subsidy to live, that is a levy, as it were, upon the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider some other method of securing the moneys which he desires, and which I think are desirable, for the purpose which he has in mind?  I do not like the principle of a levy on exports.  It is creating a precedent which may have very peculiar repercussions on our whole trade position. <Col N="505" /> I cannot see any justificable reason under normal conditions why a levy of this nature should be imposed upon any particular section of the community. We, in this House, are not so much a constituency-minded assembly and we should take every opportunity to look at matters broadly.  This is a matter of national prestige, and we should not easily pass over and accept such words as &ldquo;levy&rdquo; because it seems desirable in certain circumstances. I would again appeal that the Parliamentary Secretary would try and discover some other means of doing the work he wants to do&mdash;and which we all approve of.  We object to the levy.  It should come out of the Central Fund, and I oppose the section for that reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Donnell has often entertained this House by woolly thinking, but I have seldom heard him as woolly as he has been just now.  To compare this with the old age pensions allocation is something that does not demand even a sensible answer.  To suggest that what he calls &ldquo;a levy on export&rdquo; is wrong in principle is entirely foolish.</P>
      <P>This Bill purports to preserve and extend the rights and benefits that salmon fishermen have at present and that we hope they will have in the future.  One of the greatest proofs of the efficacy of what Senator O'Donnell calls &ldquo;a levy on exports&rdquo; in a particular industry is the voluntary levy that the Harris tweed manufacturers themselves impose.  It ranges from 3d. to 6d. per yard on Harris tweeds.  That is put into a fund similar to the fund which it is proposed to set up here. That fund is used for the purpose of advertising all over the world the merits of Harris tweeds.  As a result of the intensive advertising campaign, particularly in America, Harris tweeds enjoy a market of which we would be very glad to enjoy even 10 per cent. If Senator O'Donnell deplores that, then he should take an active part in ensuring that a voluntary organisation of tweed manufacturers in Donegal will be prevented from following on the lines of the Harris tweed manufacturers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Hearne has to say about the Harris tweeds has no relation to the point which I raised.  Senator Hearne is talking about a voluntary fund.  That is the main and fundamental difference between us.  On the Second Reading this afternoon I asked the Parliamentary Secretary about the attitude of the deep-sea fishermen in this connection. In the course of his reply, the Parliamentary Secretary said that they were friendly towards it and that the single-rod angler was friendly towards it.  However, at a later stage he said that nobody wanted to pay money out of their own pockets.  I have no objection if Senator Hearne and the Parliamentary Secretary say that this is voluntary and that it was asked for by the deep-sea fishermen and the single-rod anglers to protect them.  I understand that it is not voluntary and my point therefore is that this is a levy which is imposed by a Government on an exported article.</P>
      <P>Senator Hearne mentioned Harris tweeds.  I suggest there is no analogy whatsoever there.  This levy is imposed by a Government on a group of people who, as far as my information is concerned, have not agreed to it, and for that reason I object to the section.  I think it should be possible to devise a better method of raising the same money than by affecting the lives of people who live on the fringe of the Gaeltacht.  I realise that the Parliamentary Secretary is as sincere as I am about the protection of the Gaeltacht. We passed the Undeveloped Areas Bill in an effort to help the Gaeltacht areas.  We are constantly hearing that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht is dying.  This Bill will affect the lives of the people there much more so than any other Bill which has come before this House, and we should be careful that we do not do anything which will have an ill effect on the livelihood of our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

      <P>Earlier this afternoon, Senator O'Donnell told us that salmon is beyond the reach of the vast bulk of the people here at home.  Judging from the very large volume of our exports, I am inclined to think, in any <Col N="507" /> event, that the English market eats more Irish salmon than the Irish consumer does.  I believe the reason which Senator O'Donnell adduced for that state of affairs is probably the correct one, that is, the price factor.  The demand for Irish salmon is so keen in England that they are likely to continue to get the bulk of it for a very considerable time to come, because our salmon compares with the best on the English market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is true to say that the considerably large number of licensed exporters whom we have in the country are very keen to get the largest possible quantity of Irish-caught salmon for export.  These two factors lead me to the conclusion&mdash;I do not want to be positive about it&mdash;that it is the English importer who will pay this 2d., not the Irish fisherman or even the Irish exporter.  The commodity we are now dealing with fetched 1/6 to 2/-per lb. for a very long number of years until war inflation years set in.  It is now 7/2 per lb.  When you consider that the income from licence duties has been static over a period of more than 20 years, in spite of the fact that the commercial value has gone up three and fourfold, I cannot see how any justifiable case can be made for not asking the people who are making these increased profits and much enlarged incomes from the same activities and the same initial cost for a meagre 2d. out of the 7/2 per lb.  I can see no case for not asking that a small portion of these very much increased incomes from salmon should be given up by the people who are getting these profits, either from the rod or the net, rather than burden the general taxpayer who, Senator O'Donnell says, cannot afford to eat a bit of salmon.  I think all the equity is on my side, and that none is on Senator O'Donnell's side.  Let Senator O'Donnell ask the average man in the street, who, he says, sees salmon only in the shop window, if he is prepared to pay taxation so that those profits will go into other people's pockets.  If he asks that question, he will get his answer.  I think my method is essentially fair.  If I were to put it to any group of Irish citizens for a decision on it, I am quite <Col N="508" /> satisfied they would support what I am doing as being essentially the equitable thing.</P>

      <P>I take it I can speak in a general way on the Army now, at short length.  I would like to make some remarks about the Army in general.  It holds a very important position in our national life and I feel that ever since the inception of this State it has not got proper consideration and proper respect from the ordinary citizens.  It is almost like an unwanted child.  A lot of people go so far as to ask why we need an Army at all.  Of course, that question is a ridiculous one.  Everything possible should be done to make the Army attractive and to make it popular and respected.  In order to achieve that, people should be told, first of all&mdash; though I do not know why that should be necessary&mdash;what the Army is for and why it should exist, even if we never had to fight a war.  Everyone should know that it is necessary as the ultimate resource of the State in the event of failure of the police and other civil authorities in their efforts to enforce law and order.  It is an essential even if we were never to have a war. It is essential, even from a disciplinary point of view, as something in the country that should give an example of order and discipline not only to the youth but to all citizens.  That is one of the points I would like to talk about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a friend of the Army and as one closely associated with it during the emergency, I would like to make some constructive criticisms.  I do not think the Army to-day is the kind of force that we can really be proud of.  Why that is so I do not know.  I would like to say that conditions in the Army should be attractive, the food for the troops should be good and the clothing should be good.  I think those conditions are fairly well fulfilled and I see that recently the Minister has made some provision for improving the housing of married serving soldiers. That is all to the good.  I have seen the Army from the inside, and I know it is good, and that they are good men and the best soldiers in the world, but I think the external appearance of our troops in the street is not a credit.  I do not think their bearing, their carriage, is good.  I do not think they are properly dressed when appearing <Col N="510" /> in public, and altogether, they give a very slovenly, untidy appearance. Some people may not attach a lot of importance to external appearance, but I attach an enormous lot of importance to it and I know, from mixing around with people and hearing their comments, that the appearance of our soldiers in the streets is not good.  The uniform is not well designed and even the new walking-out uniform cap is much too big and looks much more like the cap of a third-rate commissionaire in a cinema than a smart soldier's military cap.</P>
    <P>It is well known that when a man gets into uniform he looks much better than he does in mufti.  A man may look very slovenly and untidy in mufti.  In the case of the R.A.F. or any regiment in England, that man looks a different man when in uniform.  He is then something to be looked up to by the citizens, by the girls and by everyone.  Everyone who has been in Irish Army uniform knows that you look much worse in uniform than you do in ordinary clothes.  It is only a little point but an important one, as it is the external thing that everybody sees.  In other words, I feel that for some reason there is a lack of &ldquo;spit and polish&rdquo; in the Army.  That applies not only to the turn out of the men on their appearance in the streets but to everything else, including official duties.  I have seen sentries being posted in a most slovenly and careless way, even in front of the Oireachtas buildings, which is something to be ashamed of.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have ever seen an Army vehicle&mdash;a lorry or even a motor cycle&mdash;that looks as if it had proper attention for ages&mdash;except on the parade on St. Patrick's Day or something like that, when we have the wheels all blancoed and looking as if they were turned out for the one day, like a person who would wash his face every Christmas day to go to Mass. That is not right.  It points to inefficiency behind the scenes.  I know this because I have been in association with the Army and I run a business myself.  I know it is no good being tidy for one day in the year; you must have a regular routine, day in day out.  That may seem superficial, but it applies to everything, besides the uniform.  If the <Col N="511" /> lorries and motor cycles and other things are not properly done, all day and every day and at all times, the same inefficiency creeps into the training of the troops, from the earliest point of the T.R. manuals right up to the section, company, battalion and other exercises in the Army.  If you are going to have slovenliness in the early stages, you are going to have it in all the stages right up to the top.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that anything I say is said in a constructive way.  It is something which needs to be said and should be said and I propose to say it. If these things are not set right it is not alone bad for the morale of the Army but bad for the citizens, because the Army is something which we should look up to and be proud of, and these are the things that make us proud of our Army.  I feel that the necessity for the Army is not understood, and, for some reason or other, we are always afraid, and were afraid even during the emergency, to make people realise that not only has the Army something to do with them, but they have a lot to do with it.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why military service is not made compulsory in this country, if not in the Regular Army, at least in the F.C.A.  I know the F.C.A. and I knew it during the emergency when thought the danger of invasion was imminent it was not possible to get people to turn out. People joined and were gone in a few days and you were lucky if you had 30 to 40 per cent. live strength in those days.  I know the F.C.A. is in a much worse position to-day and we are only fooling ourselves and wasting public money in having an Army if we are not going to do things properly.  Not only from the military point of view but from the disciplinary point of view, every young man in Ireland should at some time serve in either the Army or the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>The general standard of deportment, of good manners and of dress in this country, speaking generally, is not good.  Our young men do not know how to stand up straight or how to answer a superior officer or an executive <Col N="512" /> in business.  They will say &ldquo;O.K.&rdquo; when you ask them to do something and they have no idea how to answer properly or how to stand on their own feet and look in a dignified way at the people over them.  I feel that, if people were given a military training, the boys would learn how to stand up straight, how to be upright and be disciplined. If one goes to England and goes down to Euston Station, it is almost true to say that one could pick out the average Irishman by the way he slouches.  It is really deplorable, and that should not be the situation because we have the very best material&mdash;fine, well-built men&mdash;but they have never been taught any discipline and if for no other reason than that, there should be compulsory military service.</P>
    <P>That is purely from the physical and good deportment point of view, but there is also the psychological point of view of the effect of people getting together in the Army which breaks down all sorts of barriers.  It is the one thing in the country in respect of which we can get above politics and religion and have a sense of unity.  It has a very great unifying influence, as was the experience of anybody in the Army or the L.D.F. during the war. Bitterness of politics, bitterness of religion and all that sort of thing disappeared completely when you were in camp or on parade with fellow-Irishmen, no matter what creed or politics they professed.</P>
    <P>Having said these rather hard things, I should like to say that there are good points about the Army.  We all know the wonderful military college we have at the Curragh.  It is second to none and I know, from experience and from having seen what happens there, that it is probably one of the foremost military establishments, not only in Europe but in the world.  The type of officer produced by that college is a credit to Ireland and would be a credit to any country. If only the spirit and standards that prevail there were only made to prevail right through all the barracks and all the units of the Army, we would have the kind of Army which I have said we should have.  I know the great interest the Minister takes in the <Col N="513" /> Army and the long period for which he has been associated with it, and I feel that if the points I have made are accepted in the spirit in which they are given&mdash;a spirit of constructiveness &mdash;we would not only have a different Army but a different attitude on the part of our people to the Army.</P>

      <P>With much of what Senator McGuire has said I am in thorough agreement, but I am certainly not in agreement with his suggestion that we should have conscription in this country.  Whenever an emergency arose in this country, or whenever the safety of the country was threatened, either from without or within, there was never any dearth of volunteers, and one volunteer at any time is worth 50 conscripts.  For that reason, I should not like it to go forth that the Seanad is in any way unanimous about the securing of the building up of our Army by means of conscription.  I would not stand for that for a moment.  I know quite a number of young people who have many happy recollections of the Army and I know they feel the same as I feel.</P>

      <P>With regard to the summer camps for the F.C.A. it has happened in my end of the world that for the past few years the F.C.A. have gone to Youghal for the summer camp. That was particularly suitable because the largest number of people in the F.C.A. are people who have to work during the year and who use their holiday fortnight to attend this summer camp.  This year I understand that they are to go either to Kilworth or Templemore, and I should like the Minister to bear in mind that these people I speak of, people who work in factories, shops and so on, take their wives and families to a place like Youghal and in the evenings, when their training, which is very severe, is over, they all get together and have their regular summer holiday; but if the camp is to be held in a place like Kilworth or Templemore, that family holiday may not be had.  If it is possible at all to avoid a change from the <Col N="514" /> seaside, in view of the type of people in the F.C.A., it should be avoided.</P>
      <P>Senator Ruane disagreed with Senator McGuire on the military service angle and agreed with him on the other.  I would reverse that position. I think Senator McGuire is perfectly correct in his attitude to this question of military service.  I feel that some form of military service is definitely required, even from the point of view of deportment which he mentioned.  We have some of the finest men physically to be found in the world, but you see them slouching along, as Senator McGuire has said, when they are not in the Army.  I must say, speaking of a town in which there is a military group, that not only are the soldiers very highly respected in the town&mdash;so much so that the troops like to come to the town of Clonmel which I think is a sign that they have gained the respect of the people there&mdash;but, in the streets and particularly when marching, they present a very fine appearance.</P>
      <P>So far as dress is concerned, I should not like to be critical of the hat.  I do not know much about the details of things, but the battledress seems to me to be excellent and the walking out dress a vast improvement on anything we have previously had in the Army. While there is nothing like looking for improvements, it is bad to condemn the position as it is.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGuire that better provisions for soldiers with families are most desirable.  The Minister should receive every encouragement to provide the Army with the very best possible conditions.  As far as an Army in Ireland is concerned it is very difficult to keep soldiers content in it because we cannot send them abroad for variety or experience.  They are confined sometimes to very remote places and have all kinds of disabilities to suffer.  To offset that we should do everything we can to make it not only worth while for a young man to join the Army but to make it so that it would attract people who in other spheres of life might enjoy reasonable security, reasonable comforts and a reasonable measure of enjoyment.</P>

      <P>I quite realise that the references made in the course of this debate are fully intended to be helpful and in many respects to be expressions of approval for the manner in which the Army is being conducted.</P>
      <P>I do feel that some of the remarks made by Senator McGuire will react in the form of a cold shower on some of the officers who are doing so much to create the very right impressions which Senator McGuire seems to think are entirely absent.  I suppose it would be true to say that the cloth from which the uniforms are made does not lend itself to that neat, tidy type of uniform that we see worn by soldiers of other nations.  Whether there is anything in that or not is, perhaps, debatable.</P>
      <P>As most Senators will remember, the cloth is a thick, woolly material, but it is Irish manufactured cloth, and it is only natural that we should insist upon it being Irish manufactured.  I am afraid that the walking-out uniform which we are providing is not being produced as quickly as we would like to have it produced but, nevertheless, we are having it produced.  Every week, month and year the total number of these uniforms issued is increasing. Unfortunately, we cannot issue them in as great numbers at a given time as we would like to.  If we were able to do that, perhaps, the soldiers the Senator might see in the streets at the end of the day would, from that aspect alone, look much neater, fresher, tidier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator should remember that even he himself at the end of a long, tiring day would not look any fresher than these soldiers.  A large number of Senators have some idea of the internal arrangements in these military barracks.  For instance, before a man leaves the precincts of the barracks he is compelled to stand in front of a full-size mirror and examine himself to see if his uniform is correct in every detail. A senior N.C.O. is also present to see that the soldier leaving the barracks is in order.  At the moment of leaving the barracks&mdash;I am sure that the Senator will agree with me in this&mdash; the soldier is a smart, neat, tidy and efficient man.  If he goes home or goes to the cinema or the theatre or <Col N="516" /> indulges in some other form of recreation, like any of the rest of us, he will not look so fresh at the end of the evening.  Whether we see him at the end or at the beginning of the evening we must keep these facts before our minds.</P>

      <P>The soldier who lives at home has also to leave the barracks. He may have a residence and if a single soldier he may reside with his parents.  The same considerations apply here.  If he is a married man&mdash; and we hope he has a residence of his own&mdash;he is probably not seen on the street in uniform as he will probably change into mufti in the evening. However, the remarks made by Senator McGuire and other Senators will be helpful and will be brought to the attention of the military authorities.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion by Senator Ruane, I feel pretty certain that what Senator McGuire referred to was not compulsory service in the sense of conscription.  We regard conscription as something foreign to this nation, something we would be prepared to fight and resist.  Military training is a totally different thing. What Senator McGuire had in mind was something in the nature of national military training which, in my opinion, would be of outstanding benefit to the youth of this nation if ever any Government had the courage to face the situation and ensure that every young man at some period of his life would devote some portion of those years to training himself to be fit to defend the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two valuable assets that are secured there.  There is, first of all, that which Senator McGuire was looking for and that is the brightening up of the individual and the discipline which is inculcated in him as a result of his training.  Then there is the fact that he will be a valuable asset to the <Col N="517" /> nation in any time of serious emergency.  It is because it is known as conscription and because we have resisted it as a nation ourselves that we would be always prepared to resist it in the case of a foreign nation endeavouring to enforce it on us. Military training would be worthy of consideration at some time.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that more than 5,000 have joined the Army in the last three years and every one of these young men will be better men in the future as a result of having had two years' military service to their credit.  They will have had the benefits of the training provided by the way of athletic exercises and the equipment provided for their participation in these exercises.  They will have benefited not only physically but mentally and will be a finer asset to the nation in the years to come than the fellow who never gives any service to the nation but who stands around and does little or nothing and who is of very little value.  I agree with Senator Ruane that in time of an emergency the manhood of this country have always been only too anxious to give their services.  Unfortunately, as he knows himself, it is very often that type of untrained, undisciplined service which it takes so long to turn into the valuable asset that it should be.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of Youghal, we had a very fine training camp there but the building which we occupied was a very old building, well over 100 years old and it was completely and entirely unfitted for use in these modern days.  It was with regret that we had to give up the building and at the same time give up the camp.  It is intended to go now to one of the more modern barracks that we have available and, unfortunately, vacant and it will be there in future that we will have to give to the F.C.A. the training we were giving them formerly in Youghal and in some of those other seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the remarks which have been made.  I think this makes a record because it is the first time we have ever had a debate on this Temporary Provisions Bill in this <Col N="518" /> House and I can honestly say that I think it will have served a very useful purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased generally at the way in which this Bill was received, but I would like to point out that it was originally intended not to make very many changes in the present Act. When I brought the Bill in first, I was providing £2,000 for the widow.  That was in or about the value of the £500 under the 1890 Act.  The method of valuing real property did not suit the present time&mdash;it was 20 times the poor law valuation&mdash;and we decided to make it the market value.  It was also provided that in the case where a person died without next-of-kin, instead of the State taking a share of the residue the widow gets all of it.  That is all we intended to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the other House, it was pointed out that £2,000 was not enough, that it ought to be £4,000, and I gave way there.  I have gone as far as I think I ought to.  The idea is that where a childless widow is left she ought to enjoy moderate comfort and that is about all £4,000 would do.  However, if a person wants to leave her everything he can make his will.  If he does not make a will we can assume that the husband wished to consider other relatives.  If he is a young man he might have a mother in very necessitous circumstances or an invalid brother or sister.  He could have provided for them in his will if he wished to do so, but we assume he knew what the law was.  If he made no will, we assume that he did not wish to leave the other persons out.  There are 40 per cent. or more people in this country who do not make wills at all. <Col N="519" /> They do not all do it through carelessness. A great many do it because they know exactly what the law is and what is likely to happen if they die.</P>
    <P>In the debate, we had two almost opposite points of view.  The majority of Senators thought that the widow should get everything.  That was, more or less, the point of view of the urban people but we had the rural point of view expressed by Senator O'Dwyer, Senator Hartnett and a few others.  They thought that once the widow got the life interest in the farm that that was really all she ought to get and that the farm should go to the husband's people on her death.  I do not think that would be fair either, because in the case of a small farm there would not be very much value in a life interest.  What we decided to do was to give the whole lot to her if the farm was valued up to £4,000.  But that is a big improvement on what the position was.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that if the wife dies the husband gets all her estate.  That is not fair either.  If one gets the benefit of it the other should get it also.  However, that is another day's work, to make it the same for the wife as for the husband but in this Bill we are only dealing with childless widows.  I do not think we ought to go any further than we have gone in this matter.  I suppose we will have amendments and we can debate them. However, this is working for about 60 years now and there have not been very many complaints as far as I know about the way it operates.</P>
    <P>A few questions were asked by Senators.  Senators O'Reilly asked two questions.  The first was whether the values mentioned in Section 4 (2) were gross or net values.  The answer is that they are net values as have been judically determined and as expressed in the Act of 1890.  This is a very difficult legal question.  The other question was what was the meaning of the expression: &ldquo;the gross amount of any mortgage.&rdquo;  The gross amount of any mortgage is the principal, interest and charges, in other words, the amount that has to be paid to redeem the mortgage.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop raised a question <Col N="520" /> about life interest.  The only life interest that is referred to in this Bill is another life.  A person might have the lease of the life of another person, perhaps some important person like a young prince in England.  If someone had a life interest in that, it could survive after the person who had that interest; what would happen then would depend on the settlement after the wife's death.  The only life interest referred to here is another life, not the life of the widow.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purpose of this Bill is to increase the financial provision available to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. When the institute was set up in 1946, the legislation provided for a fixed annual grant of £15,000 to meet its day to day expenses.  Having regard to changes in money values since then and to the desire to extend the scope of the institute's activities, it is now proposed to raise that limit.  In future, however, it is not intended to finance the institute by means of a fixed annual grant.  This Bill proposes that an estimate of expenditure will be prepared each year and, on the basis of that estimate, grants not exceeding £35,000 per year may be made to the institute.  That change in procedure may require a little explanation.  When the institute was set up it took some time for it to get its organisation established, staff recruited, apparatus purchased and the library service inaugurated.  During the earlier years of its existence the fixed annual grant of £15,000 was, in fact, more than it was able to spend and the institute accumulated a reserve fund of £29,000 which was available to it to spend at its discretion.  That reserve fund now stands at about £27,000 but it will be <Col N="521" /> appreciated that the institute could not extend its activities on the basis of any long-term plan merely because of the availability of that money, knowing that the statute limited its future drawing from the Exchequer to £15,000 per year.</P>
      <P>With the change proposed in this Bill, the institute will be free to plan developments involving a higher annual expenditure in the future than in the past but, in fact, it will continue to receive for the next year or two only the £15,000 which it has been receiving heretofore, drawing on its reserve for any supplementary amounts it may require until the reserve fund has been reduced to £10,000 per year. It is intended that it will remain at £10,000 per year so that the institute will be able to finance there from any special investigations it may wish to undertake.</P>
      <P>The institute may, of course, also be given grants from the Exchequer to meet the costs of special investigations, such special investigations being defined as those which involve the institute in the purchase of apparatus which they would not otherwise require and in the employment of temporary staff in excess of its normal needs.  The institute can also be given and has, in fact, been given capital grants for buildings and the purchase of apparatus.  As Senators may be aware, a proposal to make a contribution of £130,000 to the institute from the American Grant Counterpart Fund is amongst the proposals which have been submitted for approval of the United States Congress.  When these proposals are approved, that further capital sum will be available to the institute for the provision of additional laboratories and apparatus&mdash;particularly, I hope, apparatus suitable for the testing of the qualities and materials used in commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill is enacted, the position in future will be that the institute may develop its activities to an extent that will involve it in an annual expenditure of £35,000, but the actual amount which it will receive in any one year will be the amount voted by the Dáil on the basis of a budget prepared by <Col N="522" /> the committee of the institute.  The institute is governed by a council, which is an advisory body, which meets once a year.  It consists of about 50 people who are prominent in academic and business circles.  There are also two committees&mdash;a committee of industrial research which, apart from directing the research activities of the institute, is responsible for its general management and a committee of standards which is concerned only with the preparation of standard specifications.</P>
    <P>The institute may also undertake work for private firms on a fee basis. However, the amount of money it has received from that source in the past has been inconsiderable and it is not likely to expand to the point at which it will make substantial difference to the institute's position.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that, even within the limits of the additional money now being provided, the work which the institute can do in the matter of industrial research is small in comparison with the more substantially endowed institutes of other countries.  Nevertheless, we believe it can make a useful contribution to the solution of various industrial problems.  The institute has available to it the researches carried out elsewhere and, from many points of view, the most important function it serves in Irish industry is represented by its library service.  There is available there a great deal of data secured from research bodies in other countries.  An arrangement is contemplated under which it can have research work desired by industrial firms undertaken by other research organisations in circumstances in which its own equipment and resources do not enable it to do it.</P>
    <P>The institute is also responsible for the preparation of standard specifications for goods and processes used in commerce.  A number of standard specifications have already been formulated and others are in course of preparation.  However, the output of new specifications is rather low and we have a long way to go before we will have built up a whole series of standard specifications comparable <Col N="523" /> with those operating in other countries and such as we desire to have.  With the additional resources made available to the institute as a result of this measure it is hoped that the output of new specifications may at least be doubled.  The importance of these specifications to people engaged in industry making contracts involving delivery of goods of specified quality is obvious, and it is hoped that, in time, the number of specifications applying to consumer goods will also increase and that they will operate in conjunction with the standard mark to enable consumers to protect themselves when making purchases of such goods.</P>
    <P>The other changes proposed in the Bill are comparatively minor ones. When the 1946 Act was prepared, it was decided to deal with the question of formulating standard specifications by the procedure of having them prepared by the committee of the institute and then brought into effect by Order of the Minister.  Experience has shown that it is more appropriate that specifications should be declared to be standard specifications by the institute. It is, therefore, proposed to repeal the appropriate section of the 1946 Act and replace it by Section 2 of the Bill, which provides that the institute, may, with the consent of the Minister, declare specifications to be standard specifications.  In future these standard specifications will be published and placed on sale by the institute&mdash;which, apart from any other advantages, will I hope avoid delays which have occurred in that connection.</P>
    <P>Another change proposed relates to the standard mark.  When a standard specification is made, any manufacturer who is making goods conforming to the specification is entitled to apply for a licence to use the standard mark on those goods.  I have been endeavouring to encourage manufacturers to adopt the practice of using the standard mark both as a guarantee of the quality of their products and as a means by which the members of the public can become familiar with the mark and its significance.  I stated in the Dáil that I was disappointed at <Col N="524" /> the extent to which the standard mark is being used.  There have been improvements noted in the last year and some manufacturers are now using the mark more extensively and advertising in the Press that their goods are of standard specification and bear the mark as proof of that.</P>
    <P>The procedure in that connection may have been a little overelaborate and it is proposed in this Bill to simplify it.  Up to the present, whenever a standard specification was made, the Minister for Industry and Commerce made an Order prescribing the mark to be used in connection with a standard specification.  In future it is proposed to have the one standard mark, which may be used in connection with all commodities, processes and practices for which there are standard specifications.  An Order will be made under this Bill prescribing that mark and it is provided that it may be used in connection with a commodity for which there is a standard specification, in conjunction with a serial number assigned by the institute to the standard specification for that commodity. Of course, it will still be the position that standard marks may not be used except under licence from the Minister.  The relevant provisions of the 1946 Act are not being changed in that respect.  The responsibility for seeing that the mark is not misused will still rest upon the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another matter which affected the work of the institute arose from the provisions of the 1946 Act regarding the recruitment and remuneration of staff.  That Act provided that the numbers, grades, pay and tenure of office of members of the staff of the institute should be determined by the director of the institute with the approval of the Minister, given after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  That approval was not required for temporary staff employed for periods of less than 12 months.  It was found that there were no investigations for which the institute might require temporary staff, which could be completed in 12 months, and also that it was difficult to get competent persons for such investigations on that basis.  Section 10 will alter that period <Col N="525" /> of 12 months to three years.  The institute will be empowered to employ temporary staff on such terms and conditions as it may think proper, without ministerial approval, for periods of less than three years.</P>
    <P>So far as the permanent staff are concerned, discussions have been taking place with the institute, with a view to giving them as much freedom as possible in the recruitment of staff. While the final arrangements have not yet been made, I think that when the discussions are completed the institute will be in a position to recruit quickly the permanent staff it requires.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other changes of minor importance to which I must refer.  The Act of 1946 gave the Committee of Industrial Research the power to determine the remuneration of its own members and also the remuneration of the members of the Standards Committee.  The view taken was that as the institute got £15,000 a year it could use it at its own discretion, appropriating such part as it thought desirable to the remuneration of the members of these committees. The committee have, however, urged that it is invidious that they should be asked to determine the value of their own services and the services of the Standards Committee and they have asked that the legislation be changed in that regard to provide that the remuneration of the two committees will be fixed in future by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Finance and Section 8 of this Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>One other change relates to the filling of casual vacancies on the council. The council is an advisory body which meets annually.  The original Act provided that vacancies on that council should be filled on the recommendation of the Industrial Research Committee with the approval of the council.  As the council meets only once per year, the filling of vacancies is ordinarily considerably delayed.  Under this Bill casual vacancies may be filled, if the Industrial Research Committee feels they should be filled, by the Minister on the recommendation of the committee. These are the only changes <Col N="526" /> which this Bill proposes to make in the Industrial Research and Standards Act. The Principal one is that affecting the finances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say that this is a Bill for which there seems to be general approval and I have pleasure in welcoming it.  I wish to make a few general remarks on this whole question of standards of products, which comes into the work of this Industrial Research and Standards Institute.  It will be agreed generally that the change of the sum available to the institute from £15,000 to £35,000 &mdash;that is, that they may use up to £35,000&mdash;is commendable and it will be agreed to by everybody.  The work of this institute is of major importance, not only to industry but to the whole economy of the country.  The whole of Irish industrial development depends, in the long run, on the standard and the quality of the goods that are produced.</P>
      <P>In the beginning, when Irish industries were being set up and were in their infancy, we were all prepared to put up with a certain amount of makeshift and to allow for a certain amount of amateurishness; but now that we are well advanced along the road of industrialisation I think it is realised by everybody, including the manufacturers, the industrialists and business people themselves, that it is necessary that we should now set ourselves proper standards.  No business will continue to prosper unless it sets itself high standards in respect of goods and service, and in this institute we have something which will set standards for our industries.  I feel that, as the Minister said, anybody producing anything in this country should not only be encouraged but in some cases actively urged to recognise the necessity for producing commodities of high standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the Dáil that he had requested the institute to prepare standard specifications for not less than 60 commodities and that the institute had not been able to get down to work on them because of lack of funds, and I am glad that this Bill makes provision whereby this work <Col N="527" /> can be gone on with.  There was some criticism recently in the Press of this institute and the question was asked why did we need to spend this money and why could we not use the results of the research which had taken place in other countries.  The Minister has answered that query in his opening remarks. Apparently the institute is leaning on the work done by other institutes, which is only reasonable, and making the results of such research available to our people.  Presumably, they will only engage on work that is necessary; in other words, they will not be covering ground covered by somebody else.</P>
    <P>Apparently there are two functions in connection with this institute.  One is the making of standard specifications and then, when these have been made, accepted and abided by the issuing of a standard mark.  In the past, 54 standard specifications were made and 60 are apparently waiting. A standard mark has been issued in respect of 46 commodities and, considering the number of commodities being made, we would like to see many more people utilising the standard mark.  There seems to be an idea prevalent that a standard mark is issued only in respect of something which is of the highest quality, that, when used on woollen goods, for instance, they must be all wool.  That apparently is not the case.  The standard mark is merely issued, as I gather, in respect of a commodity which is what it purports to be.  In the case of blankets which are of wool, a standard mark will be given to say that they are all wool.  In the case of cotton blankets, a standard mark will be given to say that they are all cotton, and, in the case of mixtures, it will be set out that they contain a mixture.  I am not sure whether the label on the goods should bear some indication of what the standard mark covers and it would obviously be advisable that, if there is a standard mark in connection with a particular commodity, the label would bear some sign of what the product contains, as in the case of medicines at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was very desirable <Col N="528" /> that everybody should use the standard mark, so that the public would be aware of what they are getting and would have some warranty that the goods were reliable.  I agree with that and I think it is a good idea, but there is something else which must be borne in mind.  The use of a standard mark is not quite so attractive to manufacturers as it would appear at first sight to be.  We hear a lot nowadays about prices and, since the war, we have had all this emphasis on price control.  The whole emphasis nowadays is on the price of commodities, the argument being that prices are too high, and so much attention is focused on prices that quality is often, and in fact nearly always, forgotten.</P>
    <P>It seems to be forgotten that, in any commodity, there is an endless range of quality and that it is very hard to compare like with like.  The price criterion is not enough, but unfortunately, if goods are marked with this standard mark, these very goods are the goods the unscrupulous price cutter will want to use to advertise himself in a dramatic way and he will then use goods which are not so marked and in respect of which he cannot be caught out to get his real profit.  In the end, it will mean that the man who has products of good quality will find it very hard to sell his product through distributors, because there will be such price cutting going on that it will be no longer remunerative for the distributive trades to sell his goods and they will buy unmarked goods which cannot be detected.  That is something which will have to be borne in mind by any price tribunal or by the Fair Trading Commission.  If the market is to be left wide open to indiscriminate price cutting, it will be impossible for anybody to conform to this ideal we would all like to see being achieved, of having a standard mark.</P>
    <P>A particularly important need for high standards in goods exists in relation to the export market.  We all know how important it is for us to have exports, not only agricultural exports but industrial exports as well, and it is in the export field, above all, that it is important to have high standards and that goods should conform to a high standard before being exported.  We <Col N="529" /> all know the headlines given recently to one small item which was found to be deficient in England.  There were headlines in all the papers and mentions of it in the British Parliament, but do we ever hear of mentions in Parliament or see headlines in the papers about the high quality goods we send out of the country to the value of millions of pounds every year?  In other words, bad products, especially in the sphere of food, make the headlines, but good service is not news.</P>
    <P>It is very important, not only in connection with food but in connection with any product going out of the country, that we should maintain high standards.  I know from experience that one of the greatest difficulties in dealing with an export market is to get goods manufactured here that will maintain regular and even standards. You may submit a sample of a particular item, but when it comes to delivering the goods in quantity, it is very hard to see that a standard up to that of the sample offered will be maintained. That is one of the most difficult problems we have to deal with and it is one of the matters in dealing with which Córas Tráchtála could help a lot.</P>
    <P>We have been making quite a good name for ourselves recently in connection with certain textile exports and fashions.  One of the troubles in connection with the export trade is that certain people who would go into the world markets, make a good name for Ireland and do a good job of work are very often followed by people with inferior work who want to cash in on the good name of those people.  I do not see at the moment how that can be prevented unless we let it be known abroad that we can only stand over the products of those people who have this imprimatur from the institute.  That is the only way to frustrate those people who are not a credit to Ireland, whose goods are not a credit to the country and who can often do a lot of harm even to our good exporters.</P>
    <P>Following up that line of thought, I do not see any penalty clause in this particular Bill.  I think the Minister said in the Dáil that if people abused or violated the use of the standard mark they would be liable to prosecution <Col N="530" /> and, if necessary, imprisonment. I think it is very important that there should be some way of dealing with people who can do a lot of harm to manufacturers who are making a good article and doing a good job of work for the country.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to refer in connection with this particular Bill.  It seems to me that when a Bill is introduced on any particular subject it refers to a lot of other Bills.  If one wanted to know what all this particular Bill was about you would find yourself being referred to two or three other Acts.  You are told that things are deleted, or repealed and inserted elsewhere.  In some cases such things would run into 20 or 30 pages but, where no more than one or two pages would be involved, it would be desirable that Bills would be read as one with all the relevant points in one particular sheet. I think that would be a very desirable thing and would be welcomed by everybody who has to read these Acts and interpret them.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I welcome this particular Bill.  I think it is something which is very badly needed for industrial and commercial advancement in this country.  I hope it will get all the money it wants and that it will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  I feel that the work of this institute on behalf of the industrial community cannot be measured in terms of the money we now seek to make available to it.  Having said that, it would be a pity if the work of the institute itself was restricted because of the reaction on it of legislation already passed.  There is not the slightest doubt at all that in business circles generally there is a widespread feeling that price maintenance cannot be divorced from the maintenance of standards of value and quality.  Yet in so far as we are able to interpret the minds of the members of the Fair Trade Commission from the rulings already published they seem determined, in so far as they can, to make price maintenance of itself an evil thing, something that cannot and will not be tolerated in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> My criticism and statement in that regard is entirely friendly and is in no way hostile to the Minister or to what he has in mind, but he should know that business circles are perturbed at the framing of these rules in this little country, immature in industrial activity. We seem reluctant to learn from those big industrial countries with generations of industrial experience behind them.  Price maintenance was ruled out in the United States a few years ago.  After a while, it was reintroduced and legalised with greater effect legally than before and why? Because, during the period in which there was no price maintenance, quality went down.  There was no guarantee that you got value for money for the article you bought.  It was realised that if you want to have standards of quality and value produced by responsible manufacturers prepared to stand behind the things they make, those manufacturers must be permitted&mdash;I use the word very deliberately&mdash;to apportion a price, a guarantee and a set of discount regulations to govern the article they create.  I feel safe in making that statement.</P>
    <P>If you view the articles on sale in the world to-day the branded article as such&mdash;by brand you obviously mean standards&mdash;is giving greater value for money than the unidentified article because the article that is sold at any price is generally dearer at any price.  You do not know the name of it.  The person just produces something to sell quickly at any price to give him a profit no matter how scant.  In the long run that article is not economical buying.  Because I feel so strongly on this matter and because I am interpreting the feelings of the people with whom I am associated in the various industrial organisations of which I am an active member, I say to the Minister that we wish him well with this particular Bill. We should like to see the scope of this institute extended, but we do hope that nothing that this other commission is doing will damage the work of the institute and make industrial manufacturers generally reluctant to <Col N="532" /> go near it, because the acceptance of a standard might involve them in something which they could not maintain because of their inability to control its price.</P>
    <P>I heartily endorse Senator McGuire's statement that at this particular juncture of our industrial activity it is more than ever necessary that we should try to establish the highest possible standards of quality for any article we produce.  We cannot always compete entirely on price but there are many articles in this country that can be sold in the world because of their novelty and originality.  There is the feeling&mdash; I would not be fit to be in this House if I did not express it to the Minister&mdash; in the minds of many men engaged in manufacture that there are too many things happening to limit the control of a man in his own business.  The Minister has often stated that this is a free enterprise country.  We want something more than lip statements to prove that.  We want to ensure that manufacturers are not put under greater burdens than their competitors from other countries are labouring under. We are all for standards and to make the fullest possible use of this particular institute.  We want to see a progressive increase in the quality and design of the article made.  We also want to see a lessening of those outside influences that interfere with the free exercise of a man's ability and responsibility to run his own business.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Minister will take what I have said in the spirit in which it is intended.  My suggestions have been constructive, not destructive, but the Minister may take it as definite that if it is sought to establish price maintenance as an evil thing, then this particular institute will never function or develop to the extent we wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators McGuire and Summerfield in welcoming this Bill.  I daresay it is rather unusual for a Minister to find such perfect accord and welcome for a Bill.  This Bill, which is an amending Bill, is entitled the Industrial Research and Standards (Amendment) Bill and I presume because of its title I would be in order in referring to the research <Col N="533" /> aspect.  I would like the Minister in the course of his reply to tell us as much as he possibly can of the development that has taken place in research since the institute was founded and particularly in so far as use of Irish raw materials can be adapted to new purposes is concerned; and even where there are no new raw materials for new purposes could he tell us in what way the institute has worked to make scientific research into the use and adaptability of old native raw materials to modern ones?</P>
      <P>I would clarify my question in this way.  The Minister is as well aware as I am that there is a considerable import of woollen tops into this country. We have established in Tullamore and elsewhere new factories for the conversion of these woollen tops into yarn of a certain type which is described as botany.  I may be talking of something which it is not possible to do, but when I learn that such firms as Dupont, in America, can create from an artificial fibre a synthetic article which has all the qualities of wool in absorption, heat and appearance, I oftentimes wonder why it is not possible for us to use the very fine cloths and wool we have here and convert them by chemical processes into a semblance, at any rate, of botany wool.</P>
      <P>I am certain that neither myself nor the Minister has sufficient scientific knowledge to argue whether such a thing can be done, but it seems to me that if the institute is formed for any purpose, one of its primary uses should be the conversion of native raw materials to act as substitutes for imported raw materials as far as possible, and also to replace and create new articles of consumption from these native raw materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other aspects of research which are not quite of the same genil as the one to which I am referring, which is the raw materials itself.  There are, as we know, mills of various types in this country adaptable for all purposes, both destructive and otherwise. I would be glad if the Minister would enlighten us as to the extent to which research work has gone, what form it has taken and what results have been <Col N="534" /> achieved.  I do not know, under the Bill, whether I am entitled to ask these questions or not, but if the Minister does not want to convey the information I will take it with the greatest indulgence.</P>
    <P>Apart from the standard mark and the necessity for a standard specification, there is another type of work which the institute could very well do for us.  Quite a lot of industry here&mdash; I am referring particularly to the textile industry&mdash;is of a secondary nature. I would like an industry to be capable of establishing some sort of a mark of creating some form of examination of articles which are composed of materials which were produced elsewhere and are converted here into a wearable article.</P>
    <P>If I might narrow it down further and refer to my own case, as a manufacturer of shirts I oftentimes have to import most of my cloths.  If my supplier on the other side is not living up to his contract, I have no means of checking on the composition of his cloth without sending it outside this country.  I wonder if the Minister would make available to manufacturers, mainly of secondary articles, some system whereby they could check up on the raw material not only so that people could see that they are getting what they bought but that the public are getting what these people say they are getting.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that some manufacturers have advertised the standard mark, I would suggest that the standard mark is not generally known. It might be advisable to create a national consciousness of that mark and to advertise the fact that goods bearing that mark have at least received the imprimatur of the Institute of Research and Standards.  That would, of course, primarily be the duty of the persons or firms who have obtained that mark but although the Minister has told us that certain firms have advertised that they have received such a benefit, the people generally are not aware that that mark is in existence. That is a standard mark and a guarantee of at least a certain kind of excellence.  I go no further than that because, as Senator McGuire has said, a standard can apply to certain things <Col N="535" /> in so far as they are excellent in their own sphere but that may not be the ultimate standard.  Nevertheless, the mark should be widely advertised so that people will be aware that the goods carrying the mark have at least some standard behind them.  Would the Minister consider the advisability of advertisement to some extent?</P>
    <P>Under Section 5 of the Bill the institute may, with the consent of the Minister, revoke or amend a standard specification but, as far as I can see, it does not say in the Bill, unless it is in the Bill of which this is an amendment, that the Minister or the institute have the power to revoke a standard mark.  If they have not such power I would suggest that there should be continuous examination of goods which adopt that standard.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire spoke of the price factor in relation to goods and said that certain types of distributors stress the price factor in order to create a bigger market.  He stated that articles bearing a standard mark may be bought by a person and sold at cut prices which may have an effect on the generality of distributors.  This is a very contentious matter and depends entirely on the turnover of the particular distributor concerned; some distributors can sell goods at lesser prices than others.  I am of the opinion that it is a good thing for manufacturers generally that goods bearing the standard mark should get the widest distribution and consumption possible even at a lesser price than some persons can sell them.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senator McGuire that quality is not sufficiently stressed and that the price factor is to some extent overshadowing the necessity of producing goods of quality.  I often consider that we should follow the Swiss model in this regard.  When it comes down to the industry and the goods to be produced, we should produce them up to a standard and not down to a price.  The tendency of certain industries is to produce goods down to a price rather than up to a standard.  I realise that that is an arguable matter.  Where purchasing power is not in the hands of people who <Col N="536" /> produce goods up to a price, you may deprive people of certain goods to which they would be entitled.  I am talking generally of where there is an effort to supply everybody in the country.</P>
    <P>Our more general effort should be to produce goods of quality up to a standard and not down to a price.  Particularly in regard to textiles, there should be a sort of standard: I do not know how you would define it, whether as a mark or a specification.  There is that intangible thing which is evidenced by the work of fashion artists such as Sybil Connolly and others which is known as style, finish and quality.  In themselves, they are not tangible, but they are of visible importance.  Consider, for instance, the cut of a lady's coat or the style of a lady's frock.  These are points which do not quite come within the skill of making the garments and yet they are worthy of recognition by our State as being of top quality.  They represent in a measure the creative aspect of Irish life.  If the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards were satisfied that these goods were worthy of a mark or some recognition, I should be glad if it were done.</P>
    <P>In general, of course, the use of the mark is for goods of a nature where durability is of first importance. Judging from the marks issued at the moment, they apply to goods which are, in the main, of a durable type&mdash; articles such as cement, steel goods and so forth.  I have not seen many marks applied so far to articles where durability in itself would not be the final test.  Whether the mark is to be applied to these, I do not know.  For many years the Federation of Irish Manufacturers have been asking for the establishement of a mark of this nature, and we were very pleased when in 1946 the Minister introduced the standard mark.  I must join with others in deploring the fact that the manufacturers did not avail of this mark as much as they might have done.  The reason for that may be that they have not been educated to its value.  That may be taken as saying to the Minister that he might try to get his mark sold in a more vigorous fashion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> I understood from what the Minister said in the Dáil that there would be closer association between the members of the institute&mdash;both the working members and the members of the council&mdash;and manufacturers and others generally, and I should be glad to see this development because only in this way can we get our manufacturers to realise that the mark is of great importance both from a national and a selfish point of view.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell the House what has happened to research. I hope he will tell us that he will try to make the work of the institute better known to manufacturers.  I join with Senator Summerfield in saying that there is not much use in asking Irish manufacturers to produce goods up to a standard if in any way they are going to be pilloried, even by implication. I am not blaming the Minister for this.  God knows, he is being blamed for enough.  However, a heading appeared in a certain newspaper: &ldquo;Profit to 53½ per cent.&rdquo;, which had an immediate effect upon the purchases of that particular commodity. Irish industry owes a great debt to our present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Nobody has done more for it in this generation than he has. However, I feel that, not through his fault but through unforeseen occurrences, a new inquisition has its reactions upon industrial productivity here which he never envisaged.  I am only mentioning this in connection with the mark.  There is not very much use in our putting a mark on an article if, after doing so, we are then told how we are to distribute it, to whom we are to sell it, and so forth, so that we are to have absolutely no control whatsover over that article after it has been produced.  That has happened in some cases.  I realise that the Minister is as well aware of the pitfalls as we are and that when we are speaking to him on this subject we are speaking to a person who is just as anxious as we are to see progress in Irish industry.  I give my full support to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who is not an industrialist in any sense of the <Col N="538" /> word, I also would like to support this Bill very strongly.  My only criticism is that I regard this sum, even yet, as extremely small for the one institute of this kind which we have to cover the whole country.  I hope that, in a very short time, the work of this institute will so develop that the Minister will have occasion to come before us again to have this sum substantially increased.</P>
      <P>As we know, this institute covers two functions&mdash;research and standards. From the industrial point of view, I am sure it is a very good thing to have standards well defined.  That has been emphasised by previous speakers.  I am very interested in the research side of this institute and I should like, when the Minister comes to exercise the function which is given to him under this Bill of allocating a sum between research and standards in the activities of this institute, that the research side will be developed as much as possible. It has a very wide implication for the country in general because an institute like this is not only of use just to the particular body, say the particular firm, that uses it for the time being: it is of use to every scientific activity in the country.  It would, in time, form a pool of expert scientific technical knowledge and personnel. It would be a centre where young scientists could gain experience and training.  Consequently, it deserves every encouragement and it should be properly developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to see that the industrialists are being encouraged to use this institute to help them in the development of their various enterprises. I hope they will do so because it is only by such encouragement that the natural development of such a thing can take place.  If it is not used, it remains in a kind of hot-house, supported by ministerial grants, and so forth.  If it is to become part and parcel of the life of this country then it should be used by the firms both on the standards side and on the research side.  I should like to see its existence and its usefulness more widely advertised. I agree with Senator O'Donnell in that respect.  I think the Minister should encourage propaganda to make <Col N="539" /> widely known how this institute can take part in the industrial life of this country.</P>
    <P>I have very great pleasure in supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGuire referred to the fact that the output of standards specifications has been comparatively small.  That is undoubtedly the case.  Under the new situation following the passage of the Bill, I hope that the output of standards specifications will increase considerably and that in the course of a short time the institute will catch up on the number of requests I have made to them for the preparation of these specifications.</P>
      <P>I think some Senators misunderstand somewhat the purpose of a standard specification and a standard mark.  It is desirable that that misunderstanding should be removed.  A standard specification is not intended either to fix a high standard of quality or a minimum standard of quality.  It is intended to be a reasonable standard of quality prepared by the institute in consultation with manufacturing industries here, a standard of quality which manufacturers should be able to achieve consistently.  No manufacturer is required to use the standard mark; no manufacturer is required to produce goods to the standard specification. If, however, he does so and is prepared to commit himself to continue doing so, he can apply for a licence to use the mark and to attach it to the goods, to give his customers an assurance as to the quality of his products, an assurance which it is assumed would have commercial value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main use of the standard mark should be by members of the public. I agree that if we are to achieve our aims we must eventually succeed in educating the public to understand the significance of the mark and to develop the habit amongst the public of giving preference to goods which bear it.  Up to date, however, the great majority of standard specifications made do not relate to consumer goods at all.  Out of 54 Orders made to date, less than ten relate to consumer goods.  All the others relate to goods used in the constructional trades or in manufacture. <Col N="540" /> In relation to those goods, the purpose of the standard specification is to convenience people who are entering into business contracts.  If I place an order for a supply of cement or paint or some other building material, I want to be assured that those goods will conform to the quality I require.  In the absence of a standard specification, I would have to specify the standard of quality myself which might be a difficult matter and might lead eventually to litigation if any dispute arose.  By utilising a standard specification, by just entering it as a condition in the contract that the goods supplied will be of the appropriate standard specification, I save a great deal of trouble and avoid the possibility of a misunderstanding between myself and the other party to the contract as to the type of goods to be supplied.  Most of the specifications made to date are for the purpose of facilitating business contracts.  Some of them are designed to ensure uniformity of size.  There is a standard specification relating to sparking plugs. It is obviously desirable that all sparking plugs should be manufactured of the same size so that one may transfer them from one car to another.  Many of the specifications made will be designed merely to ensure that goods are interchangeable, that common dimensions are adopted by different manufacturers, so that the public will not be inconvenienced by finding that the goods they purchased are not usable with their existing apparatus. That would apply to electrical equipment of every kind and the importance of having a uniform size in the production of electrical equipment will be easily appreciated.</P>
    <P>In relation to all classes of goods, whether they are goods used in constructional activities or for manufacturing purposes or goods sold direct to consumers, standard specifications are there as an indication of what constitutes reasonable quality.  The specification means nothing unless a manufacturer decides to avail of it to the extent of applying for a licence to use the standard mark on his products, thereby getting the confidence of his customers as to the quality of his output. Certainly, there is nothing in <Col N="541" /> this measure which requires the maintenance of minimum standards in goods exported.  If it were desired to establish minimum standards for exports, there would have to be separate legislation for that purpose. The only use which the standard specification would have under this Bill and the appropriate standard mark would have in that connection, would be precisely the same as in internal trade &mdash;an assurance to the customer that the goods are of known quality.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell asked about the revocation of a standard mark Order. I cannot conceive circumstances in which a standard mark Order would be revoked so long as the standard specification is in existence.  I think he has in mind the revocation of a licence to an individual to use the mark.  I mentioned already that the Bill makes no change in the provisions in that regard and the penalties prescribed in the original Act for the misuse of the mark remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield did not speak about this Bill at all.  I do not think his remarks had any relevance to it and a large part of Senator McGuire's remarks came into the same category. This Bill has nothing to do with price cutting, price maintenance or the Fair Trade Commission or any of these matters which the Senators mentioned. The attachment of a standard mark to any class of goods for which there is a standard specification is an assurance that the goods conform to that specification&mdash;and nothing else.  The manufacturer does not even have to put his name on the goods if he does not wish to do so, provided he understands that if the goods do not conform to the specification, then by attaching the mark to them he leaves himself liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill has no relationship with the work of the Fair Trade Commission or with any of the matters we discussed here when the Restrictive Trade Practices Act was under discussion, I would not like the occasion to pass without saying to the Seanad that I am perfectly satisfied with the work of the Fair Trade Commission and that it certainly has not developed in a way different to what I envisaged. Senator Summerfield said that I am <Col N="542" /> always talking about free enterprise and he wants something more than lip service given to it.  I want those who are themselves engaged in business and always talking about free enterprise to do something more than give lip service to it.  That is the purpose of the Fair Trade Commission.  I do not see any advantage in wiping out Government regulation of trade if the result is to leave the way free to some private group of people to impose their own regulations for their own benefit.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is true to say that people in industry are perturbed over the activities of the Fair Trade Commission.  If so, I can only say they are squealing before they are hit.  No one has been hit.  Those familiar with the Restrictive Trade Practices Act know that nothing can follow from an investigation of the position in any trade by the Fair Trade Commission until legislation has been enacted here.</P>
    <P>The most satisfactory thing of all is the number of trades which voluntarily dropped practices which were restrictive and anti-social and have applied to the Fair Trade Commission for the preparation by it of voluntary fair trading rules to which they have undertaken to conform.  The great achievement of the Fair Trade Commission up to date has not followed from their public inquiries: it has followed from the acceptance by manufacturers and traders that anti-social and restrictive practices can no longer be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I would not like to attempt to give a complete account, as Senator O'Donnell asked, of all the research activities carried out by the institute since it was established.  There is published every year a fairly full report of the work of the institute and Senators interested in what it is doing should, I think, be referred to these reports.</P>
    <P>A large part of the work of the institute has been directed towards the solution of specific problems which are peculiar to ourselves or which had some special feature in this country.  Part of their work was directed to the problem <Col N="543" /> of the deposit left in flue liners by turf fires and they have published a report in that regard.  When the manufacture of seaweed meal was begun in the West of Ireland, there was a prospect that the seaweed was being gathered at such a rate that it would disappear after a time.  An investigation was carried out into the rate at which the seaweed reproduced itself, so that a proper harvesting programme could be prepared.  When difficulty arose with regard to the utilisation of concrete pipes for land drainage, the institute carried out an investigation of the soils in which concrete pipes could be used.  These were the type of investigations that were carried out.</P>
    <P>It is true that the institute at present has not got a great deal of apparatus or very large staff to undertake very elaborate investigations, but I am hopeful that, as a result of the allocation of funds from the Grant Counterpart Fund and of the increased provision under this Bill, a considerable extension of the work of the institute in the matter of industrial research will be possible.  I am particularly anxious to see them equip themselves to undertake the testing of commodities used in trade.  That is a part of the work of the institute which has not developed very rapidly yet, but to which I attached great importance when introducing the original Act in 1946.</P>
    <P>That Act protects the institute from any legal consequences of the publication of analyses of goods tested by it and any trader who has a doubt as to whether goods supplied to him are in accordance with the quality specified in his contract or in accordance with a standard specification should be able to go to the institute to have a test carried out, subject to the payment of a reasonable fee, although it will be appreciated that there are private people engaged in the business of chemical research and it would not be desirable that the institute should interfere with their normal activities.</P>
    <P>The institute has nothing whatever to do with mineral research.  There is a separate organisation for that, and it would be only in the event of some <Col N="544" /> chemical problem arising in the working of the minerals that the institute would come in.  The actual investigation of the mineral resources of the country is being proceeded with by another organisation.</P>
    <P>So far as treating native wool to give it the same qualities as botany wool is concerned, I doubt if that would yield very substantial results. There is no reason that I know of why we should not grow botany wool in this country, except that our farmers think it is far better to breed the sheep for his meat than for his wool.  I think that on the whole they have taken the right decision.  The Irish wool, which is a short fibre wool&mdash;that is the main difference between it and botany wool &mdash;is useful for various industrial purposes, but it will not produce the same type of cloth as the long fibre wool will produce.  The institute has not done, and is not likely to undertake in the early future, any research into synthetic fibres.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Jessop that the amount provided even under this Bill for the institute is too small.  I should like to see it considerably increased. We have a special problem in this country in that most of our industrial units are small and they cannot themselves undertake the industrial research which the much larger industrial units in other countries do on their own behalf.  To that extent, they must combine their efforts through some organisation as this, and I would have little hesitation in going to the Government at any time to ask for a further amount to meet the annual costs of the institute, if I could show to the Government that industrial firms were in fact bringing their problems to the institute in greater number and utilising the undoubtedly valuable services the institute can make available to them.</P>

Orders made under the Act of 1920 have to be confirmed by resolution and the Wexford Gas Company sought and obtained an Order under that Act, the primary purpose of which is to empower the company to secure additional capital for the reconstruction and modernisation of its plant and equipment.  The Order authorises an increase in the share capital of the undertaking from £20,000 to £40,000 and raises the company's borrowing powers from £10,000 to £20,000.  The Order also authorises the company to purchase, or take on lease, houses, cottages or other buildings for use as offices or housing accommodation for their employees.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is twofold; firstly, to continue for some time the operation of the General Cattle Diseases Fund established under the Diseases of Animal Acts and secondly, to extend the power of making Orders under those Acts to <Col N="546" /> enable the export of live pigeons to be controlled.</P>
      <P>The General Cattle Diseases Fund is used to effect a more equitable incidence among local authorities of the cost of performing their functions under the Diseases of Animals Acts.  Its income is derived from three sources: (1) local rate assessments, (2) contributions from the Exchequer equivalent to one-fourth of the compensation paid by local authorities for animals slaughtered under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order of 1926, and (3) fines for certain offences against the Diseases of Animals Acts.  The maximum contribution to the fund from local rate assessments was fixed in 1894 at 1/2d. in the £ at any one time, subject to a maximum total of assessments of 8d. in the £, which was subsequently increased by a number of amending Acts to 1/8 in the £.  This total amount has now been assessed and as the fund is nearing exhaustion, further increase of the maximum total of assessments by 2d. in the £ is proposed under Clause I of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Payments out of the fund to local authorities comprise half of each local authority's expenditure under the Diseases of Animals Acts.  The main items of such expenditure are (1) the salaries for duties under the Acts of local authority veterinary inspectors, (2) compensation payments under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order of 1926, and (3) expenditure in connection with sheep dipping.</P>
      <P>The local authority veterinary inspectors, most of whom are part-time, are employed for public health duties in relation to meat and milk hygiene as well as for duties under the Diseases of Animals Acts but only expenditure in connection with the latter duties comes within the scope of the General Cattle Diseases Fund.  Over the years, the functions of local authorities under the Diseases of Animals Acts have gradually tended to become the responsibility of the central authority and while it would not be appropriate to abolish entirely the local authority veterinary services under the Acts they may be expected to continue to diminish as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing local authority veterinstructiona <Col N="547" /> ary arrangements, however, need some reorganisation as regards the extent and grouping of individual districts, the salaries attached to the posts, etc. This reorganisation is at present being carried out by my Department as far as circumstances allow but it will be some time before it can be completed throughout the entire country, as the existing tenure of posts in many cases makes immediate reorganisation rather difficult.  Part-time local authority veterinary inspectors may, of course, engage in private practice and an important effect of the reorganisation should be to bring about a better distribution of veterinary surgeons in some counties, particularly in certain counties on the west coast where the reorganisation measures will involve an increase in the number of local part-time inspectors.</P>
    <P>With regard to expenditure by local authorities under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order of 1926, the position has been that three-fourths of such expenditure is met from the Exchequer.  The number of animals slaughtered under the Order in recent years has, however, been very small, less than 1,000 per annum.  As I have already announced, I propose to introduce before long a comprehensive scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. Proposals for obtaining some money from American aid grant counterpart funds in connection with initiation of the scheme were submitted early last year to the American authorities whose approval it is hoped to obtain shortly.  The Government fully appreciates the importance of taking steps to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and I can assure Senators that the proposed comprehensive scheme will be introduced at the earliest possible date.  The intention is that the scheme will provide for intensive eradication measures in one area with less intensive measures for a start in the rest of the country.  The scheme will commence in each area on a voluntary basis but will have to be made compulsory when the proportion of farmers participating in it warrants such action.  The administration of the Bovine Tuberculosis Order will, of course, need to be reviewed in connection <Col N="548" /> with the initiation of the comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the administration by local authorities of the sheep-dipping requirements, the number of outbreaks of sheep scab has been declining in recent years and is now very small.  With the full co-operation of sheep owners there is no reason why sheep scab should not be entirely eradicated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed extension of the power of making Orders to enable the export of live pigeons to be prohibited except under licence the position is that since 1950 the export of live pigeons has been prohibited by an Order made under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Acts but this control will lapse when the supplies and services legislation will expire next year.  There is a possibility that in the course of return flights to this country racing pigeons may introduce poultry or other animal disease.  It is essential that there should continue to be power to regulate the export of such pigeons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, consisting of two clauses, does not convey much to the average member of the Seanad or the average member of the public who would read it but the explanatory statement of the Minister gives us a very wide field for discussion. As far as the two clauses themselves are concerned I doubt that an extra 2d. in the £ in the rates levied by local authorities will achieve much to implement this scheme which is a comprehensive and an immense one if we are going to realise its objects satisfactorily.  The first impression I would get is that this 2d. represents a very small amount and being taken from the local authority rates instead of being provided by the central authority will be of little assistance apart from the suggested fund that is referred to later in the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is practically no effort being made towards the eradication of bovine tuberculosis because what we call the Bovine Tuberculosis Order of 1926 was really a public health Order for the safeguard of the human population <Col N="549" /> rather than the animal population. The net result is that through these years the amount of effective work done under the provisions of the Order of 1926 was negligible.  The Minister mentioned some 1,000 cases in which animals were slaughtered under the Order but many animals are dealt with under the Order without being reported to the local authority.  They are simply dealt with by the veterinary staff of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The reporting matter is important because it means that nothing has been done unless a farmer sees that his animal is in decline or is a piner. In order to save whatever little money he can he reports the animal to the local authority to be dealt with under the Tuberculosis Order and thereby salvages some of the loss.  Of course, what he is paid under the Tuberculosis Order is not the market value of the animal, which would be very small, and depends on the amount of T.B. which is in the carcase on post-mortem examination.  Some of the animals can pine from causes other than T.B.</P>
    <P>The Bovine Tuberculosis Order, although not exactly a public health Order, was an Order to safeguard the human population rather than the animal population because one of the clauses under which an animal can be taken up under the Tuberculosis Order is a case where the beast is suspected of suffering from T.B. of the udder. Having dealt with many of these cases, I can say that one feels a sense of having done something important for the community as a result of detecting one of these cases of T.B. of the udder and taking appropriate action. There is a percentage of animals in the country suffering from this form of T.B. and disseminating in the milk T.B. bacilli with which adults and children in the community may be infected. I do not want to be misunderstood because a large proportion of the milk in the City of Dublin, at any rate &mdash; I do not think there is any pasteurisation in Cork &mdash; is pasteurised, thereby rendering it safe as far as T.B. bacilli are concerned.  However, milk with this infection is generally consumed throughout the country and <Col N="550" /> many members of the human population are affected with T.B.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that the veterinary profession has been far kinder to him than the medical profession has been to his colleague, Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Health, and to other Ministers during the past 20 years because over 20 years and more the Veterinary Medical Association has been urging the Department of Agriculture to initiate a scheme for the total eradication of bovine T.B.  I remember suggestions were made to deal with areas like Clare, Galway, and Kerry where the traffic of cattle is entirely outward and there is no traffic inwards.  In that way, generally, our country is far better situated for the surrounding and elimination of this disease because there is no through traffic which is so common in Great Britain &mdash; cattle coming from this country and cattle being shifted within the country itself. Here we have the traffic from the farms bar those small animals which are bought as calves and transferred to parts of the country until finally they reach the pastures of Meath.</P>
    <P>In the main, however, districts can be taken where the animal traffic is mainly outward.  You would have a chance there of getting a district and being assured that you will not have animals which are affected with T.B. coming into it from an outside area. That was suggested down the years but we never got much help.  We also suggested it before the Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy Committee who reported in 1944.  The Veterinary Medical Association then put up a comprehensive scheme &mdash; the word &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; is used pretty frequently to-day in &ldquo;comprehensive schemes&rdquo;&mdash; in an endeavour to pave the way towards this attack towards the eradication of animal diseases. The committee did not adopt those recommendations from the Veterinary Medical Association in their entirety. They suggested regional operations.  I am sorry that Senator Johnston is not in the House now because he was a member of that committee.  There were several minority reports as well as the majority report.  However, in <Col N="551" /> the main, they suggested regional operations and regional laboratories to deal with this attack on animal diseases.</P>
    <P>I criticise the present project of trying to bring within the central authority all the work connected with the eradication of animal diseases, or practically all, if that is the intention. In his speech, the Minister mentioned more or less &ldquo;eliminating&rdquo; or &ldquo;eradicating&rdquo; local authority inspectors.  The local authority veterinary inspectors throughout the country have dual functions to perform: they have functions under the Ministry of Health and they have functions under the Ministry of Agriculture.  You will find that to effect that supervision by using any other means from headquarters will be far more difficult than effecting the subdivision through the local men who are in contact with the local people and who know their difficulties.  I have often heard it said that the man from Dublin or the team from Dublin who come down to visit an area will not be as effective as the co-operative movement by men who are known locally and who have constant contact with the farmers and owners of live stock in the local areas.</P>
    <P>I will say this from this bench for the Minister's sake that, as far as whole-time officers of the local authorities are concerned, in the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 1941, beginning here and spreading like wildfire through Dublin, his central authority staff would be in a very dangerous position and would not have dealt as efficaciously with the disease in Dublin but for the assistance of the whole-time staff of the Dublin Corporation.  Therefore, local authority inspectors and officials, whether they be part-time or whole-time, serve a function and I would feel disappointed if it were to be absorbed into a central authority machine where, possibly, there would not be greater cohesion but they would have their finger in headquarters on what is happening throughout the various areas.</P>
    <P>The Veterinary Medical Association's recommendations were that each county should be a unit and should have its <Col N="552" /> own veterinary staff to enforce and transact all business in connection with diseases of animals and public health work and other relevant enactments of the Oireachtas.  That was not adopted. However, I will say in favour of it that animals can be disposed of very quickly in Dublin where the local authority can function with its own little laboratory and diseased animals are removed from premises not alone within 24 hours but within 12 hours.</P>
    <P>With regard to the work throughout the country under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order, as I see it, the scheme will continue to operate and the scheme will mean that samples of milk will have to be sent from West Cork or from Galway to a central laboratory, let it be in the vicinity of Dublin or in Abbottstown, and with the delay there, it will certainly be at least a week before you will have the results. Similarly with samples of sputum.</P>
    <P>The Bovine Tuberculosis Order deals with T.B. of the udder in the heading, that is, examining the milk, and the next heading is a chronic cough. In the case of a chronic cough in a cow, the sputum would be examined for bacilli.  That sputum could be examined within half an hour and, if found to be positive, the animal could be slaughtered within six hours.  If we send these samples away for examination, and have to await their return, it means an immense delay.  So far, my remarks have dealt with the Tuberculosis Order, as such.  I hope that the Tuberculosis Order in future will just be by-passed.  It must be by-passed if we are to make an effective step towards the eradication of disease.  That means that the animals will have to be tuberculin-tested and every animal which reacts must be removed.</P>
    <P>Some people may think that this will cost a lot of money, but I do not think it will.  The price of an animal, post-mortem, at present is practically as good as the price of milch cows that were bought some years previously. It will be seen, therefore, that the salvage after slaughter in most of these cases will recoup to a wonderful extent the amount that has to be paid in compensation in respect of animals that must be removed as <Col N="553" /> reacting.  Many of these animals which react will have more or less local lesions and that would not entail the condemnation of the total carcase. Only in very bad cases would the entire carcase have to be condemned. I believe, therefore, that there will be a considerable salvage and that, to a large extent, that salvage will compensate for a number of animals that would have to be removed.</P>
    <P>I hope that the scheme will be implemented without further delay.  I had an idea that the utilisation of portion of this grant from the Grant Counterpart Fund was suggested for years.  Unfortunately, we had not got the American Government to give us the final &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  If we had, we could say to the Minister: &ldquo;Go now, or we will be shouting at you.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, he has that excuse still, but I hope he will not have it for very long.</P>
    <P>The single dipping scheme in the treatment of sheep scab has had tremendously satisfactory results, and a case of sheep scab now is a rarity. If we had the complete co-operation of the farming community and the sheep owners, sheep scab could be wiped out in a year or two.  The incidence of it has been reduced enormously in the past ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been remarkably free from the virulent contagious diseases that have afflicted the Continent and that have been afflicting even our neighbours, the British.  They have been subject to attacks of foot-and-mouth disease, and even now there are such outbreaks from day to day in different parts of Britain.  We have been lucky, by God's goodness as well as by the assistance of the veterinary section of the Department, to have escaped those outbreaks.  When the fowl pest came to the country some years ago&mdash;it is prevalent still in England&mdash;we succeeded in eradicating it without too much difficulty.  Therefore, as a country Ireland is in a remarkable position in regard to freedom from disease.</P>
    <P>Bovine T.B. is the main problem now.  The British have been going ahead for several years and have reached the stage where 50 per cent. of the cattle are guaranteed free from <Col N="554" /> T.B. Those steps mean that a screw can be put on us to ensure that all our cattle going through are free from T.B. The Danes are free from it, and even during the German occupation, they succeeded in going ahead with the eradication of T.B. Therefore, there is no excuse for us to say we could not do it.  We must go ahead and we must make progress from month to month and from year to year in eradicating this scourge from our cattle.</P>
    <P>In regard to the discussion we had in the Seanad, when the Minister himself was not able to come here, on a, motion at the end of February or the beginning of March, the Seanad unanimously adopted the request to the Minister to take effective action to prevent the warble fly infection.  This is the period again when the Minister and his staff should do everything possible to ensure that the ravages of the warble fly are minimised.  I am not going over ground covered then, as I am sure the Minister is conversant with the position.  We have to depend as much as possible on the publicity to farmers' clubs, Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tire, to obsess them with the idea that it is in the national interest to prevent the ravages of this fly.</P>
    <P>It does not require any inspections, any supervision by veterinary staff or other staff.  It simply requires the farmers' own co-operation.  If they cooperate, we will be rid of this affliction. Unfortunately, if you have three farmers agreeing to dress their cattle every month while these warbles are coming in, and you have the fourth or fifth man who will not do it, the warble fly does not mind over whose fence he flies or whose gate he goes through, and without this communal co-operative attack, while you may not Fáil, the efforts are not as effective.</P>
    <P>The importance of clean wool has been dealt with in the Press fairly well quite recently.  Last year there was an effective campaign of advertising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that point.  It was dealt with in publicity <Col N="555" /> quite recently.  Finally, while Clare, which is to be the focal point, may be a hard county to work from, the incidence of T.B. is not too high there, compared with some of the dairying counties and it should be easier to deal with.  There are other counties where the traffic is outward and if we had good dairy stock of different breeds in those areas we could be assured of buying tubercular free cattle for our herds, as well as having tubercular free cattle for export to foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the Bill, which is trying to rid the cattle of the disease of T.B., especially in view of the situation in England, where the market will probably be lost if we do not succeed in doing it.  I suggest that a first step would be to pasteurise the separated milk.  We discussed this in 1938 at the Agricultural Commission.  We found that there was a number of cows suffering from tubercular udder and this tainted the milk.  In the farmyard or in the course of transition, these bacilli multiplied at an enormous rate. The separated milk comes back to the farmer, the calves drink it and get the disease also.  I have heard accounts of experiments where calves which were not fed on contaminated milk were free from disease, while the others were not.  That has been the means of spreading the disease, especially in the dairying counties. The first step towards dealing with that would be to pasteurise the separated milk.  It was done in Northern Ireland years ago and I think it should have been successful.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator O'Donovan's point, that you have to get local help, I suggest that co-operative societies and public bodies should deal with this matter.  If the aid of the co-operative societies could be enlisted, they could enlist the support of the farmers and the whole thing could be done not only cheaply but effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of this matter which has not been mentioned is the question of T.B. in fowl.  The evidence we got at the Agricultural Commission was that <Col N="556" /> fowl were responsible for half the T.B. in pigs and it is a matter which requires looking into.  Much of it arises from want of proper houses on the farms and the fact that fowl and pigs are allowed to mix together.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the reaction test. I have heard that in several cases cattle which reacted to the test, on further examination, failed to react, and I suggest that, in cases in which cattle do react, there should be a second examination before they are condemned.  Otherwise, a great number of cattle may we lost, with consequent cost to the State, perhaps without any necessity for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator O'Donovan on his very lucid speech on this very important matter, a matter which concerns everybody in the country, regardless of whether they live in town or country.  It has frequently been stated that the welfare of our entire nation depends on the prosperity of the rural community and the steps the Minister proposes to take now will help materially to add to that prosperity.  As Senator O'Donovan has pointed out, people need not be scared of the cost because the salvage of animals that would have to be destroyed will, in a great many cases at all events, go a long way towards paying the major cost of the compensation to which the farmer whose animal has been slaughtered will be entitled. Years ago, I had an opportunity of acquiring a good deal of information on this subject in relation to our cattle population, and I felt, and have often felt since, that the sooner a scheme of this nature was introduced, the better for everybody in the country and particularly the youngest members of the population who depend so much on milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Dwyer referred to another important point with regard to the spread of T.B. &mdash; the dissemination of the germs through the creameries. That also, I understand, is being taken in hands by the Minister under another measure and I understand also that many, if not all, of the creameries are installing pasteurisation plant which will go a long way towards <Col N="557" /> eliminating tuberculosis among the pig population, as well as among the human population, because the feeding of non-pasteurised milk containing germs of T.B. to pigs is bound to spread the disease.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Senator O'Donovan that he need have no worries about the working of this scheme in Clare.  I know Clare fairly well and the people there are anxiously looking forward to the implementation of the scheme.  The sooner the Minister is in a position to go ahead with it, the better pleased the people down there will be.  I feel, however, that Senator O'Donovan may be just a little jealous that the scheme was not started in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly disappointed that the Bill does not go far enough in certain directions.  Take the case of a poor person on a mountainside, with one or two cows.  If one of those cows does show itself to be a &ldquo;piner&rdquo; to a certain extent, and if he reports that cow and it is slaughtered, he does not get sufficient compensation to replace it.  Therefore, because of poverty, that cow is kept on.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that he proposed to bring in a comprehensive Bill in the near future and I hope that Bill will provide terms whereby such a poor person will get the full value of the slaughtered cow; that, in other words, he will get sufficient money to replace the slaughtered animal.  I have no hesitation in stating that, if that were the position to-day, there would be requests for examination of thousands of cows down the country; but, as things are, these poor people know that they will only get a certain percentage of an animal's value.  As I say, I am very glad the Minister proposes to bring forward a comprehensive Bill and I give my wholehearted support to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some misconception about this Bill because some of the speakers have spoken of it as if it were a comprehensive Bill for the eradication of T.B.  It is <Col N="558" /> nothing of the sort.  The Bill is designed for the purpose of enabling county councils to get an increased levy in order to build up the fund which is there for the purpose of paying the salaries of the part-time, and in some cases, the whole-time, veterinary inspectors in their employment, for paying a fair measure of compensation under the 1926 Bovine Tuberculosis Act and for making provision for inspection and the carrying out of the duties appertaining to sheep dipping.</P>
      <P>This scheme was introduced back in 1894 and at that time the limit under which a county council could raise money was 8d.  At no time was a council permitted to levy more than ½d., and, as the years went by, the original sum was exhausted and it was necessary from time to time to increase the levy.  As a matter of fact, in 1949, it was increased by 2d., and it is now necessary to increase it further. There are some counties where 1d. in the £ brings in a very small sum, and it is most unfortunate that it is in these counties that there is the highest percentage of losses due to T.B. and possibly sheep scab, and it may be necessary to have more veterinary inspectors or to give them increased duties.  It is scarcely necessary for me to mention these counties which bring in very small sums on the basis of 1d. in the £, but Leitrim and Longford are two I have in mind.</P>
      <P>There is also Kerry, where compensation is pretty high, but I can say that for the country a levy of ½d. in the £ brings about £27,000.  At no time will councils be asked to provide more than ½d. in the £.  That sum should be sufficient to enable the scheme to be carried on.  I said that compensation was paid for 1,000 cattle last year.  That was the number of cattle reported.  If we were to accept the suggestion made by Senator Tunney that people should be compensated in full, then it would not be ½d. in the £ we would be asking county councils to subscribe but possibly about 1/- in the £.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it would be money well spent, but, as I pointed out, I am coming forward with a comprehensive scheme to deal with the eradication of T.B.  The Bill now before the House is to enable county councils to make their contribution to the fund to carry out the present scheme under the 1926 Act so long as it may be necessary to carry it out, to pay part-time inspectors and also to deal with sheep-dipping regulations.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan mentioned veterinary services.  At the moment we are engaged in reorganising the veterinary services in the country.  There are difficulties to be overcome.  For instance, in some of the cities you have whole-time veterinary surgeons. Throughout the country we have about 131 part-time veterinary surgeons.  It is my intention to have as far as possible permanent veterinary surgeons in many of the counties.  Even up to the present, where we are able to go ahead with the scheme, that is, where we had not the difficulty of having a permanent man employed in any particular county without encroaching on his territory, we have succeeded in filling three posts in Clare, one in Tipperary, three in Galway, one in Cork, two in Offaly and two in Waterford. Proposals have been drawn up in respect of three in Monaghan, three in Louth and one in Meath.  The position in regard to other areas, where there are opportunities for reorganisation, is being examined.  We have made an additional permanent appointment in Galway for Connemara district and two in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the comprehensive scheme dealing with T.B., I pointed out in the other House that we are awaiting approval of the American Congress to use part of the moneys from the Grant Counterpart Fund.  It is our intention to start with the scheme in Clare.  At first, it will be voluntary and, if necessary, compulsory. Then the scheme will be extended to the remainder of the country.  We have asked the American authorities to approve of the spending of £1,250,000.  We know that is not going to eradicate T.B. in this country but it is a start.  As time goes on we will have to ask the taxpayer to contribute <Col N="560" /> the money that will be necessary to conduct the scheme and eradicate T.B.  We are only waiting for the approval of the American Congress. The plans are ready waiting for the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  I hope that word is going to come in a very short time.  We will ask the co-operation and help of the farmers of this country to put it into effect in order that we may be able to deal with this dreadful disease in the quickest possible time.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to the question of the warble fly.  I suppose it would be no harm to say a few words about it.  When the motion was before the House I was not available.  I am at the moment actively engaged on an intensive campaign throughout the country to encourage and advise farmers to dress their cattle.  I am asking the co-operation of Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre and other such bodies to help in the drive we are making.  It is very necessary because the loss to the country amounts, I understand, to something like £4,000,000.  Again, with the co-operation and help of the farmers, I think that money can be saved for the national benefit.</P>
    <P>I have on many occasions mentioned to people connected with the cattle industry, live-stock salesmen, cattle producers and various consultative bodies with whom I have had dealings that at fairs farmers should be advised.  I suppose the only way in which they can be advised is by showing them that there is some compensation for carrying out action in connection with the warble fly.  The farmer could be compensated who had a clean beast.  In other words, he would be compensated for the beast not affected by warbles.  Buyers attending fairs can do a lot in that connection.  If we had the co-operation of all people engaged in the cattle trade, including the farmers themselves, we would in a very quick time be able to eradicate that trouble also.</P>
    <P>When I introduce the comprehensive T.B. scheme for the country, the duties of veterinary surgeons and inspectors throughout the country will decline from the agricultural point of view. Actually, we will only have sheep dipping regulations, visits to fairs, etc.  At <Col N="561" /> the same time, it will be necessary to retain the services of these veterinary surgeons because, as their duties diminish on the agricultural side, they will increase on the health side, so that a local authority will still be compelled to have the veterinary surgeons as they have them at present.  Any moneys I ask for now will be devoted solely for the purpose of paying for duties carried out on the disease side on behalf of the Department of Agriculture. In every case we have a veterinary surgeon appointed by the local authority.  He has certain duties on the disease side under the Department of Agriculture and also other duties in connection with health.  The fund will bear the disease part of his salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann deplores the action of the Government which has resulted in the raising of the loan charges on small dwellings by 2 per cent. with the result that many persons endeavouring to provide their <Col N="562" /> own homes will now be prevented from doing so, and that Seanad Eireann, therefore, demands that the Government reconsider their decision so that loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts may be granted at the old rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Although this is a very important motion I understand it is desired to take another motion, and I shall be very brief.  Before I refer to the motion, I would like as a member of the House to utter the strongest possible protest against the treatment that this and other motions have received. At the time this motion was tabled last May it was a very important motion.  It was a question that affected thousands upon thousands of persons in this country, yet it was not reached until the following February. I took it that it was the right of any Senator, who so desired, to table a motion here, but there is certainly not very much incentive if you have to wait 12 months for an opportunity of having it discussed.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will be unanimous in support of this motion because not alone does it seriously affect many of the present citizens of the country but also our future citizens.  I am one of those who believe that if you are going to build a nation you must give as many people as possible a stake in that nation, give them something in which they will have an interest.  To increase the loan charges under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts was a grave injustice.  We have reached the stage now when instead of giving encouragement to people to own any property and to provide their own homes, we are giving them every encouragement to own nothing.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a person who sets out to provide his own home &mdash; I assume that it will be the same down the country as in Dublin.  They first of all purchase a plot of ground on which they are prepared to pay ground rent. The average cost of the house is about £1,500 and the interest alone on that in repayment of principal is something like £75.  With the interest, the ground rent and the rates as they are now, the total expenses must amount to over £2 a week.  The majority of <Col N="563" /> people who are providing these homes are industrious and enterprising and deserve every encouragement.  I am very much in favour of local authority services.  I believe everybody in the country should have a house but I would like to warn everybody concerned that you will never build a nation around local authority houses.</P>
    <P>The person who is prepared to provide a plot of ground in order to build a home, to become a ratepayer, to pay income-tax on the ground rent and be responsible for the repairs of the house for all time, is putting a burden on himself.  It is his duty to provide a home but greater assistance should be given to him.  On the other hand, let us consider local authority houses. I am sure other Senators who are members of local authorities realise as well as I do that repairs are becoming a cruel burden.  In County Dublin alone, £250,000 has been spent on repairing local authority houses.  The people who are seeking a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts will be responsible for their own repairs, they are increasing the valuation of whatever county they reside in and they are making for better citizens.  There is no greater bulwark against Communism than that provision should be made so that everybody would own something.  If you want to kill Communism, you should try to give everybody some little stake in their own country.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would not be in order to say that, apart from increased loan charges, there are also the increased professional charges, both legal and other charges.  I appeal to the Minister to reduce the loan charges to at least what they were.  If the position is allowed to remain as it is nine out of ten of those people with small dwellings, in Dublin City and County at any rate, will eventually have to go back to seek local authority houses.  As their family grows bigger, they will become entitled to a local authority house.  I have given you the figures for the Dublin County Council in connection with repairs but it would be interesting to know what the Dublin Corporation figures are for repairs.  I <Col N="564" /> believe that the system is wrong where you provide, say, a painter with a house and send in another painter to paint it.  Where you have a painter or any other tradesman who is willing and anxious to provide his own home, to pay rates and ground rent and be responsible for his own repairs, he should get special treatment.  Instead of increasing the loan charges by 2 per cent. if I could help it I would reduce them by 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>County Dublin is, of course, out on its own as regards the provision of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act &mdash; we have given more than any other county&mdash;but since the loan charges were increased the number of applicants has decreased to an abnormally low figure.  The majority of people who seek such loans are people with salaries of from £8 10s. 0d. to £10.  They are unable at the present time to take the responsibility of building a house.</P>
    <P>Then, again, you have the question of employment.  If you give loans at a reasonable rate of interest many people will be enabled to provide homes for themselves and, in so doing, employment will be given to labourers and tradesmen.  We have experience of the Government allocating, and rightly so, large sums of money to help to provide employment.  This is one way in which the Government could help in a sound and practical manner.  We would be building up the nation and at the same time reducing the number of people who are unemployed. I hope every member of the House will agree that this motion should be passed unanimously and that the Government should reconsider their decision about the increased loan charges and bring them down to the rate which operated before they were increased.  I know many persons who got loans at the high rate of interest. Not having had previous experience, they were unprepared for ground rent and rates.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is a two-thirds remission of rates for seven years on their property but, even with that two-thirds remission, they are finding it extremely difficult to meet the outgoings.  The poor law valuation <Col N="565" /> of the majority of the houses I have in mind is about £20.  What will happen when these people will have to pay the full rates, I do not know, seeing that many of them are unable to meet their present liabilities.  I will go so far as to prophesy that, should the cost of living remain at its present high level, all those people who got loans at the high rate of interest will be unable to hold on to their houses because of their great difficulty in meeting their liabilities.  For these reasons, I earnestly appeal to the House, to the Minister and to everybody concerned, to reduce the loan charges to their former rate.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that increased building activity, which would come about as a result of lower loan charges, would provide a great deal of employment and that would help to do away with slowness.  I am a worker myself and I do not wish to cast any reflection on workers: as a matter of fact, I am strongly swayed in the opposite direction.  I hold that we would have far better nation building if, in every scheme and every area, we had a certain number of people who owned their own homes.  By their thrift, industry and example these people would encourage other people who live beside them to raise themselves up to their standard.  That is a point which is deserving of every consideration.</P>
    <P>My last word is that I feel that to increase the loan charges on a person who is trying to provide his own home is a national crime and that it should not take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcCrea" hpid="Mr. McCrea Mr. McCrea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCrea</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion. Perhaps some remarks which I made here yesterday were responsible for the fact that this motion was brought before this House so quickly.  While I hope I am not causing too much inconvenience to the Minister, I hope, at the same time, that more notice will be taken of motions that are put down on the Order Paper by members of this House.  After all, when these motions are first put down they are of current and topical interest and that is the time when they should be dealt with. The procedure here has been, during <Col N="566" /> my term in the House, that the Leader of the House gives out the business of the day and usually tells us that the motions will not be taken.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the reason which is given is that the Minister concerned cannot be present.  After all, they are our Ministers also.  I think they spend an hour every day in the other House answering questions that are placed on the Order Paper.  If they spent a short time here with us they would find that the atmosphere here is just as pleasant as it is in the other House, and as pleasant as anything they could hope for in the other House.</P>
      <P>This motion has been lying in cold storage for so long that there is very little that one can say about it now except to repeat what has been said in every county council chamber in the State and in every other chamber where people meet who are charged with housing our community.  In Wicklow, we are very perturbed about the increased loan charges.  Lying, as we do, beside Dublin City, and having adopted the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts many years ago, numbers of people working in this city acquired sites and slowly but surely built up the northern end of our county.  The county council gave them every encouragement and placed no obstacles in their way.  Loans were placed at their disposal with as little delay as was humanly possible.  It meant a lot to the Wicklow County Council for the reasons that it did not cause any hardship to the ratepayers, it increased our population and certainly it increased considerably the valuation of the county.  Therefore, we were very perturbed when the loan charges were increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were also concerned about our rural housing schemes &mdash; labourers' cottages.  I do not think any other county in Ireland, in proportion to its population and wealth, built more houses than the Wicklow County Council.  I may say that these houses were the cheapest which were built in the State.  We built them by direct labour.  The highest rent charged is 4/- a week and that is in respect of a small number of cottages only.  We had a scheme for 400 cottages practically ready to send to the Department of <Col N="567" /> Local Government but when the engineers told us that the rents of these houses would be in the region of 7/6 to 8/- a week we did not proceed with the scheme.  For that reason, there has been a general slowing down in house building.</P>
    <P>Another matter we are very concerned about is that, under the 1950 Housing Act, county councils were given power to build better-class houses in non-municipal towns.  We immediately made a survey of every non-municipal town in the county and we prepared schemes in that connection. In my own town, as a first instalment, we had ten applications.  We had plans prepared.  We purchased a site and were ready to submit a scheme to the Department of Local Government&mdash; and then these increased loan charges were announced.  The approximate rent was to be about 24/- a week.  When the increased loan charges came into operation the rent was pushed up to 33/- or 34/- a week and we had to drop the scheme.</P>
    <P>I would impress upon the Minister and the Government the necessity to reduce the loan charges to local authorities for the housing of the people.  There has been a definite slowing down and unless something is done about it I am afraid we will come to a standstill so far as our housing work is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all agree with the complaint made by the mover and seconder of the motion.  We must sympathise with them in not having a discussion on this motion, which has been on the Order Paper for over a year.  It is difficult to discuss it now, when the immediate matter with which it was intended to deal has become a matter of past history.  In the case of housing loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, anyone could agree that it would be better if house owners in the country could get lower rates. However, we must look at this in a common-sense way, from a practical point of view.  The Government cannot manufacture money.  The money that is made available to local authorities by the State has to be got somewhere.  It has to be got from the people by means <Col N="568" /> of national loans.  I should have thought it was a self-evident fact that if the rate of interest on such loans goes up the rate of interest to house purchasers also has to go up.</P>
      <P>The suggestion might be made that the last two national loans were issued at too high a rate of interest.  I cannot see any evidence to support that suggestion, if it were made.  The National Loan of 1952 was issued at 5 per cent. for £20,000,000.  That sum was obtained and a bit more besides &mdash; the total was about £21,250,000.  That is 5 or 6 per cent. above the amount that was required.  It is not a substantial difference.  It is clear that any lowering of the interest rate at which the loan was issued would result in not filling it.  The last national loan was issued at 4¾ per cent. for £20,000,000, and of this only £15.3 millions was obtained.  It cannot be said that the rate of interest was too high.  The State gets the money at the cheapest rate it can from the people, from our own people who have money to lend. That rate regulates the rates under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. That is the only answer to the motion and it is a perfectly sufficient and satisfactory answer.</P>
      <P>It would be desirable to reassure the proposer and seconder with regard to the results which the increase in the interest rate has had.  Apparently, they are under the impression that there has been a considerable reduction in the number of persons applying for loans.  The facts show that the very opposite is the case.  In the financial year 1950-51 the number of loans sanctioned for the whole country by the Department was 2,181.  In the financial year ending 31st March last, the number was 3,052, an increase of nearly 50 per cent.  The amount of money went up from £2,250,000 to £3,750,000. That is not the picture which we have been given by the proposer and seconder of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed to hear Senator Tunney pointing particularly to County Dublin and saying that he knew as a fact there was a great decrease in the number of people applying for housing. The most recent figures I have been able to get relate to the first six <Col N="569" /> months of the present financial year, from April to September, 1953.  During those six months, taking the City and County of Dublin together, more loans were sanctioned under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts by the Department of Local Government than in any previous 12 months' period.  In other words, in the first six months of this financial year the rate at which housing loans under these Acts were being sanctioned by the Department was more than double that in any previous year.  That is not the picture put before us to-day.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made by the proposer and seconder that there has been a great slowing down in housing. Here, again, the facts show that this is not a correct estimate of the position.  Some 50 local authorities have fulfilled their housing needs, which they had estimated in 1947. Under those circumstances one must expect to have a gradual slowing down in the rate of local authority housing. As against that, there has been a considerable increase in the number of new private houses and these are not referred to in the motion.  In the calendar year 1950, the total number of houses built or reconstructed was 13,759; in the calendar year 1951 it was 14,088; in 1952 it was 15,565 and in 1953 it was 15,555.  These figures show that, while we must all sympathise with people who have to pay a higher interest rate than others paid a few years ago, it is ridiculous to suggest that this has caused a great decrease in housing or in the number of people applying for houses.  That is simply not so.  I think that is the answer to this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figures that Senator Yeats has quoted to refute the statements by Senators Tunney and McCrea, but there is a much more fundamental problem involved than that covered by those quotations.  He bases his assumption on a greater demand &mdash; but there would have been a still greater demand had the interest rates been lower.  He justifies the high rate on the ground that the Government had to get money at a higher rate.  That brings us down to the question as to who controls <Col N="570" /> credit and the creation of credit.  We go on with a never-ending increase in the cycle of charges, just because through national State loans we can get money only at an increased rate of interest.  I am sure the statistics Senator Yeats has quoted are correct and that he has verified them, but there are poor people without houses and suffering privations, as the result of a higher interest rate than can be argued for in this House.  The interest rate follows willy nilly the interest rates laid down by the Bank of England. I would like the Minister to justify the creation of any banking monopoly or any credit creating monopoly and to justify such a policy.</P>
      <P>I have referred already in another sphere to interest rates charged by banks to traders and manufacturers&mdash; an interest rate which in itself amounts to an annual profit on a percentage basis.  Here again you have, coming down the line to the ordinary workers' cottages, the same interest rate.  Does Senator Yeats really think that there can be national development to supply the needs of the people for this type of house, on that rate of interest?  Is he defending the banks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to understand the Senator's attitude.  He refuted the statements of Senators Tunney and McCrea by saying that there has been an increased demand and consequently the rate of interest is justified.  He said it is justified also because State loans must be made at a certain rate of interest and those supporting the loan are lending the money at that rate.  What I want justified is the rate of interest, generally speaking, for and long-term loans, as approved of or accepted by the Government at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that I am arguing for the machine production of money.  It has been a constant sneer that nobody dare dispute the rights of a banking monopoly or credit control monopoly to control our rates of interest and our issues of money.  In a country which is fundamentally wealthy &mdash; I am talking about real wealth, and not in <Col N="571" /> terms of financial wealth &mdash; in a country which would have all the essentials of life, even if you erected a 30 foot wall all round it, a country which is a rich country in the fullest economic sense, would the Minister say why it is necessary for us to keep on basing our currency and credit values on those of an outside country?</P>
    <P>Why does our so-called Central Bank not recognise the fact that developments are necessary here which have been made impossible by the high rates of interest?  Where is the profit going to eventually?  Will the Minister explain for me that extraordinarily inexplicable thing described in the Bank of Ireland accounts as &ldquo;the rest&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Senator Yeats gave figures which show that Senator Tunney's fears about a decrease in the rate of housing are without foundation.  I can support those figures from the knowledge I have and the statistics of house building over the past few years, and also the statistics of the amount of money that has been issued from the Local Loans Fund for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Undoubtedly, we and could have issued this money for the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act at a cheaper <Col N="572" /> rate of interest, but the rate of interest charged was just what the Minister for Finance paid for public loans. When the rate of interest on the public loan was 5 per cent. &mdash; all of which money was got from the public, none being got from the banks &mdash; the interest charged for issues from the Local Loans Fund was 5¼ per cent.  A few months ago, after the recent loan at an effective 4¾ per cent., the interest rate on advances from the Local Loans Fund was decreased by ¾ per cent. Are we going to subsidise still further the people who are getting the facilities of drawing 95 per cent. of the money from public sources for the building of their own private houses? At one time, the only people helped in housing were the very poorest sections of the community, but at the moment a person who has a little money and wants to build a house for himself can get a grant of £275 from the State.  Where certain local authorities supplement that State grant by a grant from the local auhority, he can get additional grants ranging from £92 to £275, and, on top of that, he can get, in Dublin County and Cork suburbs, a loan of £1,800.  In other parts of the country, he can get a loan of £1,600.</P>

      <P>We will come to the percentage.  The only condition in respect of issues from the Local Loans Fund is that the person must put up at least 5 per cent. of the money, excluding from that calculation any sums which come from State grants.  I should like to know in what other country at any time could an individual get a sum of £1,800 on loan, plus a grant of £275, the only security to be put up being a sum of 5 per cent. of his own money.  Even in the boom period in America, when all sorts of banks and lending institutions were looking for people to give money to, a person would have to put up at least 50 per cent. of his own money before getting a loan.  Here all he has to put up is 5 per cent. and the State and the local authority give him £275 free grant, perhaps another £275, plus a loan of up to £1,800.</P>

      <P>The only condition in respect of loans from the Local Loans Fund is that the borrower must pay at least 5 per cent.  A local authority may demand somewhat more from place to place, but that is a handsome handful of money &mdash; up to £1,800 loan and these grants.</P>
      <P>Let us come now to the rate of interest.  That rate of interest from the Local Loans Fund at the moment is 4¾ per cent. for this purpose.  The local authority adds a slight service charge in order to cover itself against bad debts and for administration purposes. In most of the country at the moment, outside Dublin City, which raises its own capital, the rate of interest charged is 5¼ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many places on the Continent of Europe if a man was lucky enough to get a loan even of 10 per cent. of the value of his house he would have to pay, according to the country, anywhere from 5 per cent. to 12 per cent. for the money.  A lot of them would, indeed, think themselves lucky if they could get even 20 per cent.  of the cost of a house at 7 per cent.  or 8 per cent. There is no use blinking the fact that we, as a nation, have done a tremendous amount for housing in the past <Col N="574" /> 25 years.  We have done it at a tremendous cost to the taxpayers.  It was a job of work that was well done and well worth the cost in my opinion.</P>
    <P>We started off 25 years ago when we were probably the worst housed white race in the world.  At the moment, we are among the first few of the highest and best housed nations.  The Local Loans Fund which we are discussing played its part in that because, in addition to the many millions and ten of millions given by way of grants to local authorities to rehouse the people, there was over, £11,000,000 issued from the Local Loans Fund for this particular activity, the making of advances under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have anything to be ashamed of as a people.  In fact, we have every right to be proud of the way in which we tackled this job of rehousing and how quickly the problem was overcome in a great part of the country.  Senator Yeats very properly pointed out that quite a number of local authorities has already completed their rehousing programme.  They have abolished the slums and have provided decent housing conditions for the people at reasonable rents.</P>
    <P>We would all want to see the rents lowered on some of the houses, but it is better to have a reasonably good houses at even a fairly high rent than to have a wretchedly unhealthy dwelling at a middling rent.  When we started off you had, with the famine for houses, people paying more for one room in an insanitary building than they are now paying for a four or five-roomed house with bath and every other accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am glad the situation is not as represented by Senator Tunney.  Even in the last year or two people have been taking full advantage of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act. They have been putting down a little of their own money, obtaining Government grants, in some cases grants from the local authority and, in addition, obtaining loans up to £1,600 and, in some cases, £1,800.  I agree with Senator Tunney, of course, that to the extent people build for themselves it relieves the job of the public authority. <Col N="575" /> In fact, only they did so relieve the public authority there would be no excuse for giving the money on these terms.</P>
    <P>Some people who might get money from the Local Loans Fund could very well look after themselves and would look after themselves if there was no such fund to draw upon.  There is a necessity to get up the total number of houses in the country and for that reason local authorities do not turn anybody down because he has too much money.  They are glad to get a person who is solvent and who is good security for the money.  They are more than anxious to give him the money because they know they have a better chance of getting it back than they have of getting it from people who are very much less well off.</P>
    <P>Senator Tunney pointed out that this motion was out of date and, indeed, it is.  As I pointed out, the rate of interest has recently dropped ¾ per cent.  If the rates of interest drop further in the immediate future &mdash; and we all hope they will &mdash; I have no doubt that that will be reflected in the rate of interest for the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Yeats is not correct in his figures.  He may be correct in one direction.  He mentioned that there were more loans sanctioned last year than any other year.  That may be.  If Senator Yeats will come with me to the Dublin County Council I will guarantee that if the loans were sanctioned applications were made for them before a certain date.  The Dublin County Council has given out in loans &mdash; I am speaking subject to correction &mdash; more than half a dozen county councils in this country.  The applications dropped because, to start off with, hundreds were cut out from being eligible.  There was a time when a person with £7 per week could get a small loan of £700 or £1,000, but immediately the housing director, with the approval of the county council, cut out these people you could not accept an application from a person who would not have at least £2 per week more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that every word the Minister said is true and correct.  This <Col N="576" /> and every other Government has done a lot for the housing position which was deplorable and a disgrace some years ago.  A person in the gallery listening to the Minister speaking in connection with loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act would imagine that they were giving something for nothing.  He mentioned that the person received £1,800 as a loan but the person who gets that amount repays over £3,000 plus what he pays in rates which helps to increase the valuation of his county.  The average rates are now £32 to £40 on these houses.  Therefore, these people are not getting as much as the Minister would make one believe.  It boils down to the point that was raised by my friend Senator O'Donnell, that it is wrong that people should be allowed to profiteer in money as in anything else.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House. I appreciate the way the Minister has received the motion, and I would like it to be on record that the House accepted the motion.  The proof of the genuineness of the motion is that at the time it was taken we asked for a reduction of 2 per cent.; in the meantime there was a ¾ per cent. reduction. I would appeal to the Minister to go the whole distance and give us the other 1¼ per cent.  In that way he would be doing a good day's work.</P>

      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that the services provided by the Health Act, 1953, should be put into operation without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I think it is fair that I should thank the Senators who had signed their names to other motions <Col N="577" /> for having consented to give my motion priority in the order of business. I have no doubt they did that realising the importance of the topic it is proposed to discuss, than which, in my view, there is no more important topic which could be discussed by either House of the Oireachtas, the provision of better health services for the community.</P>
    <P>Having said that I feel I must comment on the curious absence from the House to-night of Senators who are doctors.  It is rather a pity that the House should not have the benefit of the views of Senator Professor Cunningham, Senator Professor Fearon and Senator Doctor Barniville.  At least two of these Senators have been stern opponents of the Minister's policy in reference to the provision of a new pattern of health services.</P>

But, of course, I have to accept your ruling, Sir, that I am wrong, though I do not agree with it.  Since the passing of the Health Act of 1953, and during the long interminable debates that led up to the passing of the Health Act of 1953, the ordinary people of this country have been looking forward with eagerness and the keenest anticipation to the benefits which they expected would flow to them from the health policy of successive Governments &mdash; that is, of the last Government, until they abandoned it, and of the present Government.

This House has a great tradition.  If a man is not abusive and if he keeps, even narrowly, within the terms of a motion or the terms of an amendment to which he has put his name, this House has a tradition of listening to him without interference from one side or the other &mdash; and especially without interference from the Chair unless the Chair feels so sure of its position that the Chair must intervene and intervene very severely.  A Leas-Chathaoirleach, I ask you to maintain the tradition of this House.  You have presided over it before and you are presiding over it to-night.  Members of this House have a right, within reason, to express their point of view.  We may agree or disagree with it but they have the right to express that point of view.</P>

If the Senator is not satisfied with the Chair's ruling, then he has an alternative and I should like him to make a move on that some day.  As far as the mover of the motion is concerned, the Chair is prepared to give a hearing &mdash; as I have, I hope, on all occasions &mdash; within reasonable limits, all the time.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelHartnett" hpid="Mr. Hartnett Mr. Hartnett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to proceed.  It is very difficult to know the precise point which I was discussing, after the lengthy interruptions which have occurred.  However, I do not want to tire or bore the House unduly, and I will do my best to get back to the point with all possible speed.  The people of the country are now wondering why the services provided for them in the Act passed by the Oireachtas are not flowing to them.  I know only what the man in the street knows about what has happened since the Bill became an Act.  I think it is proper that I should ask the Minister for Health to give an explanation to this House of the Oireachtas as to why greater progress is not being made in providing these services.  I thank the Minister for having observed the best democratic principle in having come into the House to listen to such criticism as I have to offer and, I have no doubt, when the time comes, to answer it.</P>
      <P>It was assumed at the time the Bill became law that those who had opposed it would respect the will of the people and would say: &ldquo;We wanted a different type of Bill but, now that the people's representatives in Parliament have spoken, the Health Bill has reached the Statute Book and it becomes our duty as good citizens to assist the Minister in making the best possible success of the machinery provided by the Act.&rdquo;  That is what would have been expected.  It would have been expected particularly that members of both Houses of the Oireachtas would have taken that view.  It would, I think, be regarded as a very serious matter that members of the Oireachtas should inculcate disrespect and disregard for their own legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what has happened since?  It <Col N="583" /> is now the end of February &mdash; four months after the Bill passed into law. Apart from a few administrative provisions and the introduction of the maternity cash grants on the 1st January last, the Act in its main provisions is, up to the moment, stillborn. The public have no indication as to when they can expect to see the administration of the hospital services, maternity services, infant welfare services, the improved dental services or the rehabilitation services, including the allowances for disabled persons. There has been no definite indication from the Minister as to when he can provide those services.</P>
    <P>I cannot make myself conversant &mdash; I have no means of doing so &mdash; with what happens between the Council of the Irish Medical Association and the Minister.  All through this controversy leading up to the passing of the Health Bill, 1953, and subsequent to it, the council has been adopting what I can only describe as Prussian methods. They have been playing a game of trick-of-the-loop.  I would like the Minister to take note of these statements. I venture to conjecture that the Minister has met representatives of the council and that they have told him: &ldquo;We will not discuss it; we will not co-operate&rdquo; or, to put it colloquially: &ldquo;We are not going to play ball.&rdquo;  They have every right as a trade union &mdash; just like the Federation of Rural Workers, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, the Workers' Union of Ireland or any combination of workers, for their own benefit &mdash; to endeavour to secure for themselves the best possible pay and working conditions.  I do not quarrel with that.  If their attitude were that they would go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Here is the Act passed by the Oireachtas; we suggest that in schemes which you draft pursuant to this Act you should do so and so and so and so, and we feel that the doctors who have to work under the scheme should be amply remunerated and we suggest a figure of £x for those services or for this or that service,&rdquo; that would be perfectly reasonable conduct and perfectly in accordance with democratic practice and with trade union practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> Is that the case?  Is that what has been transpiring in the conversations which have taken place between the representatives of the Irish Medical Association and the Minister?  I very much doubt that it is.  On the 28th January last there was published a resolution of the Council of the Irish Medical Association which ran in the following terms.  I have taken it from the journal of the association&mdash;and from a study of the terminology of the association you will see I buy the journal certainly not for its literary value.  The resolution reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council of the association, having already decided that the Health Act, 1953, is fundamentally defective, now consider that the proposals received from the Department in connection with the intended implementation of certain sections of the Act, are repugnant &mdash;</P>
    <P>whatever that may mean &mdash;</P>
    <P>and unacceptable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So now we know that the Bill, which we in this House helped to pass into an Act, was fundamentally defective. We are receiving instruction on this matter from the Council of the Irish Medical Association.</P>
    <P>There is just another little undertone which I would ask those members of the House who are interested &mdash; and they are not many, perhaps, on that side of the House &mdash; to note.  The report of the meeting of the association at which this resolution was passed contained references to the payment of staffs in voluntary hospitals, and states that &ldquo;all members were of opinion that the question of adequate remuneration, which had been engaging the attention of the voluntary hospitals and associated specialist groups for a number of years, should be considered and dealt with entirely separate from any proposals in connection with the recent Health Act.&rdquo; The Health Act is &ldquo;fundamentally defective and unacceptable&rdquo;; but if the Minister is prepared to make any grants or contributions which are connected with the Act, all contributions will be thankfully received.  That is, to put it mildly, in my respectful submission, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, <Col N="585" /> insolence &mdash; insolence which is out of tune and out of temper with all democratic practice.</P>
    <P>If this headline is to be set up by the Council of the Irish Medical Association, see to it that it is not followed to-morrow, or next year, or the year after, by some other body of people who combine for the purpose of securing their own interest.  See to it that you are not sowing the wind and will not reap the whirlwind.  It may well be that the headline now being set will be copied next year or the year after, and that a body of workers will turn to a democratic Government in this country and say: &ldquo;We do not care a crack of our fingers for your Act. We will not work it.  We have no respect for Parliament, and, if the Act is being discussed in Parliament, we will tell the workers' representatives to remain out of the House, perhaps tell them to go dining and wining elsewhere, when the Act and matters relevant to the Act are being discussed in Parliament.&rdquo;  That would be a sorry state of affairs indeed, and I am sure it is a state of affairs which nobody in this House would or should wish to bring about.</P>
    <P>I want again to put a question to the Minister.  I know what the attitude of the Council of the Irish Medical Association is.  They have told me in the resolution I have quoted to this House, but is that the attitude of the ordinary general practitioner throughout the country?  Is that the attitude of the hard-working dispensary doctor, the hard-working general practitioner in Dublin and in the rural parts of the country?  I do not know. I do not know how far these people's claim to represent the medical profession as a whole is accurately based. I may quote from a letter dated 15th February, 1954, which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 17th of this month. It is headed &ldquo;Irish Medical Association Council Decision&rdquo; and reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir,</P>
    <P>The daily papers have given wide publicity to an editorial in the February issue of the Journal of the Irish Medical Association.  This editorial mentions certain documents <Col N="586" /> marked confidential which were explanatory of proposals made by the Minister for Health regarding the implementation of certain sections of the Health Act, 1953.  It goes on to state that: &lsquo;At the most recent meeting (January 28th) of the council of this association his proposals, having been examined by the representatives of every group and branch within the association, were, without one dissentient voice, declared to be repugnant and unacceptable.&rsquo; As a result of this and of newspaper comments thereon, I find that many members of the public are under the impression that the proposals were examined by the branches of the Irish Medical Association prior to the meeting of the Central Council.  As a rank and file member of the Association, I feel that it is necessary that this should be corrected and to state that copies of the proposals were first issued from the headquarters of the Irish Medical Association to its members on February 12th and that it is only since then we have had an opportunity of reading the proposals which were dealt with and rejected by our council at its meeting on January 28th.</P>
    <P>The resolution to which I have already referred the House was, as stated, passed on January 28th and the proposals were released to the branches by the Central Council of the Irish Medical Association on the 12th February.  The medical profession is a scattered profession.  Its members, the general practitioner group, work very hard, and they are generally not very vocal &mdash; regrettably not very vocal.  I think they dislike having to come out in public and perhaps contradict what are said to be their views by the Council of the Irish Medical Association. I would say this to the Minister, and I would say it to him on the best authority I have got from various parts of the country &mdash; I made it my business to get it and I ask him please to bear this in mind and to note it &mdash; that his views and proposals are being grossly and fantastically misrepresented to branches of the Irish Medical Association throughout the country, that there <Col N="587" /> is a scandalous whispering campaign being carried on, that the dispensary doctor is being told that the Act represents ruin for him and that the general practitioner is being told that the Act represents ruin for him.</P>
    <P>That is, in my respectful submission, a contemptible misrepresentation, and, in order to correct it, I think there is only one expedient open.  It is that the Minister should suggest to the Council of the Irish Medical Association that they call a convention in Dublin of delegates from each branch of the association, and that that convention be given an opportunity of hearing the Minister's explanation of the proposals he is making pursuant to the Act and that there be a full and free discussion on the whole matter. I think that suggestion should be made.  If it is made, I can see no reason why it should be rejected.  It is wrong that a democratic Minister should be imposed upon and I am suggesting to the Minister that he is being imposed upon.  He is a man notoriously of a kind and tolerant disposition and the game is being played with him &mdash; you will permit me to say this in passing &mdash; which was played with his predecessor.  The game is this: &ldquo;Keep on stalling.  Tell him that we will meet him.  When we meet him, tell him that we have nothing to say, that we will report back to our members, that we will get their suggestions and that when we have their suggestions, we will meet him again&rdquo; and thus it goes on &mdash; a perpetual game of trick-of-the-loop. And the only sufferers are the people who would benefit by this Act and the services to be provided by this Act, if there was even the slightest degree of co-operation forthcoming from the medical profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been tolerant from the introduction of the White Paper up to the present day and they play on his tolerance with the purpose of defeating his proposals.  What lies behind it?  Again I will tell the Minister what lies behind it and I have this on very considerable authority, which, unfortunately, I am unable to designate because it was given in a confidential way.  The consultants who constitute the Council of the Irish <Col N="588" /> Medical Association have been told: &ldquo;Well, you do not like this Health Bill.  Keep on stalling and if you keep on stalling long enough there may be a change of Government.  Of course, if there is a change of Government, back you go into the Customs House and you can have any Bill you like at any cost you like and people will not be consulted.  You will be able to arrange things for yourselves in your own way.&rdquo;  Again, as I have said, the consultants, just like the general practitioners, are very hard-working people.  They accept this.  They feel it is possible that if you stall long enough there will be a change of Government.</P>
    <P>I would ask them to go into the look-out of their ivory towers and from there survey the political situation. They will see how vain is that hope now.  I would ask them to consider that.  I would put this to members of the House who are representatives of the Irish Medical Association.  There is quite a number, but the only one who has done us the honour of being present is Senator Jessop.  I would ask him to convey to his fellow members of the Council of the Irish Medical Association that it is foolish of them to delude themselves with the possibility of a change of Government, that the people who have conveyed that to them and the people who are impressing on them that that is the right technique to adopt are deceiving them.</P>
    <P>What they hope to do is this.  They are not interested in the medical profession as such.  What they are very interested in is in discrediting the Fianna Fáil Party and discrediting the Minister.  If the Minister does not provide the services, the Council of the Irish Medical Association will say: &ldquo;But this is utterly unreasonable.  He will not have any discussions with us. When we went to him we told him that we would have to get the views of our members.&rdquo;  They will not say this was put up for the 30th, 40th or 50th time. They will not say in dealing with the Minister that he showed, forbearance more than human in his dealings with them.  In return they show for him a contempt which Senators of this House, members of the Council of the Irish Medical Association, have shown for <Col N="589" /> this House by boycotting this sitting to-night.</P>
    <P>I would not blame them if they felt like not having any desire to hear what I have to say but surely they are interested in hearing what the Minister has to say?  In the little game which they are playing the Minister is a very important person but they are shirking debate.  They shirked debate on every conceivable occasion.  They do not want debate.  I ask the Minister what he proposes to do in this context?  I ask him if he is going to allow the trick-of-the-loop to go on indefinitely?  I ask him whether, if this attitude continues, he has any proposals to make to provide the people with the services Parliament provided for them?</P>
    <P>When the Public Health Services Bill was introduced in Britain, the men at the head of the British Medical Association showed opposition.  The service went through and the British Medical Association said they would not co-operate but they went to the Minister and did their best to help and assist him.  Now very many of them admit quite frankly that they were quite wrong in their opposition and that the scheme, costly though it may be, is producing what it was intended to produce&mdash;a vast improvement in the health of the main body of the British people, surely a consummation devoutly to be wished in any country.</P>
    <P>We have a native Parliament now for a considerable time and it appears that there are some people who still display a high-handed attitude towards it.  I would not have blamed the Irish Medical Association for taking the attitude they did, but I do blame them now for inculcating disrespect for the Legislature.  I say to the Minister that if he tolerates it and submits to it he will be, as I said already, setting up a headline which may have very grievous consequences in the future.  You cannot permit doctors and a privileged class to do what you are going to deny to other classes in the country.  If you permit it to the doctor you must permit it to the farm labourer, plumber and carpenter.  Senator Yeats says &ldquo;and the lawyers.&rdquo;  I would say, in <Col N="590" /> passing, that a man does not have to go to law, but he cannot help being sick.</P>

      <P>It probably cures him and he will never go again.  It has that good effect any way.  There is quite a number of points I want to make.  I have no doubt that somebody in the House will accuse me of attempting to bedevil the situation as between the Minister and the Irish Medical Association. Some Senator will stand up wringing his hands and declare unctuously that I am doing a grave disservice by ventilating this matter through the medium of this motion to-night. I will be told that the matter was just on the point of settlement.  I frequently meet members of the Council of the Irish Medical Association. I know them personally.  They are very, very decent people like many members of this House outside the House.  Outside the council chamber, they are very decent people.  Each one of them assures me that he is completely reasonable but that the other fellows are unreasonable.  But if the Minister waits with the patience of Job his good reason will prevail over the unreasonableness of the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry, Sir.  I have not endeavoured in any way to try to evade the ruling you gave.  I know you will permit me to say that I regret I was unable to put this matter in the perspective of the last ten years.  However, you have so ruled and I accept that, of course.  It is an attitude which cannot be maintained for the next ten years.  They are hoping that they will be able to maintain it until by some &mdash; to them &mdash; lucky fluke there comes a change of government which will result in their restoration to the Minister's seat in the Custom House, when the Ministry of Health will be put into committee, the committee <Col N="591" /> being the Council of the Irish Medical Association.  That is not, in my view, democratic practice.</P>

      <P>The Senator said there was nothing wrong with such a hope.  I know he meant that seriously and I will deal with it seriously. There is nothing wrong with such a hope provided it does not result in the people who, through shortage of money, are unable to avail of the services which I read out at the start of my speech in moving this motion, being denied access to these services. If it does, it ceases to be a hope and so becomes a dangerous delusion which every care should be taken to banish. There are many other aspects of this with which I would like to deal and I trust I shall not be boring the House in doing so.</P>

      <P>Apart from the resolutions passed at the meeting of the Council of the Irish Medical Association on February 28th, which I have quoted to the House, there have been other statements which I have collected. In the August, 1953, issue of the journal of the Irish Medical Association (page 27), the address of the new president of the Irish Medical Association, Professor W.P. O'Donovan, Cork, at the annual general meeting in Waterford, on the 1st July, 1953, contains the following statement: &ldquo;The Health Bill has been <Col N="592" /> modified by several amendments.&rdquo; It was then, I think &mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; on its long and tortuous passage through the Dáil through members of the Opposition holding it up, no doubt, with a view to improving it (I trust the stenographer will, in brackets, note my sarcasm).  What does Professor O'Donovan state?  &ldquo;The Health Bill has been modified by several amendments. What is our reaction now? The same as before.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask in all sincerity what does all this mean?  Does it mean that the Irish Medical Association take upon themselves the right to flout the will of Parliament?  They cannot be coerced to work, and it would be wrong that they should be coerced.  They can, like the members of trade unions, withdraw their labour.  They can refuse to work unless they get proper wages and proper working conditions. I do not deny that right but health is an essential service.  Health is the most essential service in the country and if the people have decided that they want a certain pattern of health services is it democratic that the medical profession should say: &ldquo;The people may want it but the people can go and whistle for it.  We are the only people who can provide it and we will not do so.&rdquo;  That, of course, is not the attitude of the ordinary doctor; that is not the attitude of the ordinary general practitioner or of the ordinary dispensary doctor.  Everyone in the House knows how they work, particularly in rural areas, for their patients, some of them with very little reward or remuneration.</P>

      <P>Certain people in Dublin, who have &mdash; if I may use a colloquial expression &mdash; developed swelled heads, certain people who may be mighty big in the institution to which they belong and who may be able to strut along as little gods through the wards and along the corridors of hospitals must realise that a line must be drawn to their conceit. They must realise that a time will come when people will say: &ldquo;We have had <Col N="593" /> enough of it&rdquo;, and I am asking the Minister to say that now.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister may criticise me, that he may tell me I am unduly impatient or that I am a bit of a crank. I do not care about that.  I am warning the Minister of what I conceive to be very real dangers in the situation and I want to tell the Minister this, in case he does not know it already, that the views I am expressing to-night, I am positively convinced, are the views of 90 per cent.  of the people of this State, and the more would they be the views of the people of this State if the people were satisfied that there is a sectional group trying to hold the Minister up to ransom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not need to remind the Minister of his Irish history.  The Minister knows that groups who have tried to do that in the past, whether the remote or recent past, failed in their <Col N="594" /> attempts to do so and failure will now descend on the efforts of those people. I am sorry I am unable to deal with the vast amount of material which I have here, mainly statements from propagandists in the battle.  It is, of course, relevant to the discussion and in my submission it is proper that it should be on the records of the House. This is a matter which from being a mole hill may grow into a mountain. This from appearing to be a mere minor controversy may become a question which embraces the whole of our democratic practice and procedure. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
