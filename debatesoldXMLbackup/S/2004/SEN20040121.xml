	<P>I have received notice from Senator Kitt that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P  LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to appoint education welfare officers to the towns of Tuam and Ballinasloe, County Galway.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Title>Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>All Members of the House wish to sympathise with the family of Mr. Pat Joe <?_ch?>Reynolds. A former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, he had a long and distinguished career in the D&aacute;il and at one time served as a Parliamentary <?_ch?>Secretary. His career was crowned with his term as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Reynolds family is much connected with democratic politics. Its members have known the heat of the sun and endured many difficult situations. On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I extend <Col N="2"/>our sympathy to Pat Joe's wife, Tess, his sons, Gerry and Peter, and his daughters, Ita and Regina.</P>
    <P>When we express sympathy with the family of Pat Joe Reynolds, we think of the Reynolds family and what it has contributed. His father, Paddy, as he was known, was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1927. When he died in tragic circumstances in 1932, his wife, Mary, took the seat and held it for 29 years. We talk about female participation in both Houses. It was remarkable that Mrs. Mary Reynolds held that seat for such a long time. The family gave 75 years of unbroken service to the Oireachtas. That is a great record of commitment to politics.</P>
    <P>I knew the late Pat Joe Reynolds well because my brother, the late Brian Lenihan, shared the same constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim for a number of years. One of the warmest expressions of sympathy we received as a family when Brian passed away was from Pat Joe Reynolds and his family. It was touching and evocative and I never forgot them for it. He gave great service to the people of his constituency and to the GAA. His family were huge players, literally, on the field and in the council chambers of the GAA. We all know Gerry, who was an esteemed Member of the other House.</P><Col N="3"/>
    <P>I know you, a Chathaoirligh, have memories of him, which I am sure you will share. He was a fair Cathaoirleach. He expressed the wishes of the people and he had dignity and bearing. He carried out his functions with great dignity and aplomb. Thank God he lived to the good age of 83. He died in the bosom of his family. It is truly memorable that his family gave 75 years of unbroken public service in both Houses of the Oireachtas. It is not something we are likely to come across again.</P>
    <P>To his wife, Tess, his two sons, Gerry and Peter, and his daughters, Ita and Regina, I, on behalf of my party, express our sympathy and friendship to the Reynolds family.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Leader in expressing sympathy to the Reynolds family. She indicated that the Reynolds family was steeped in a strong political tradition which straddled more than 75 years. Gerry Reynolds, who succeeded Pat Joe Reynolds, held the seat from 1987 to 2002. I did not know Pat Joe Reynolds, as he preceded my time in the Oireachtas. However, I have heard much about him.</P>
    <P>He represented the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim where he was highly respected. He was a great family and community man. He was involved in many organisations throughout Leitrim, particularly in the Ballinamore area. He also had strong business links with the Ballinamore area and he was a prominent employer. I read recently that he attended many funerals during his time because he knew the community well. I understand it was a huge funeral because many people who identified with and respected him attended it. The Reynolds family made a significant impact on the business and political life of the area.</P>
    <P>I join the Leader in expressing sympathy to his wife, Tess, his two sons, Peter and Gerry, his two daughters, Ita and Regina, and his extended family.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I was privileged to serve in this House with Pat Joe Reynolds for many years. He was not only popular, but principled. He was almost rigid in his adherence to those things in which he believed. He was a traditionalist, although some would say a conservative. However, he was humane and sincere and not prone to bending his opinions with the fashionable winds of the time. This was most potently illustrated by his stance on violence. He came from the Border counties where in the 1980s and earlier, some people came under pressure to be softer on terrorism than others but Pat Joe Reynolds never yielded to that and unambiguously supported the forces of those who opposed terrorism without any ambiguity. That is not intended as a veiled criticism of anyone. It was not easy at the time to do that but he did it with immense courage. We should acknowledge his role and that of others in doing so at the time.</P><Col N="4"/>
    <?oasys _dc20-?><P>He was an excellent Cathaoirleach. His successors could take a leaf from his book in that his way of dealing with those who grew too hot under the collar about certain issues was to laugh at them, and he would do so from the Chair. It was very difficult when one felt strongly and emotionally about an issue to hear the Cathaoirleach laugh at one and move on to the next business. One could not engage him in the row and, as everyone knows, one of the great skills of parliamentary debate is to engage the Cathaoirleach in the row. If one cannot do that and he or she laughs at one it is very difficult to be taken seriously. He always defused those difficulties with great charm and style. We should be proud that he was a predecessor of the present Cathaoirleach and a fine Cathaoirleach in his time.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <P>I have one other anecdote which I like because I held Pat Joe in great affection, as did others who knew him. One day he said to me "I hear you are a great one for night-clubs." This was a long time ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Senator Ross qualified that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It was many years ago. He asked what they were like and I told him I would take him to one. We went to a night-club in Baggot Street or Leeson Street and I never saw a man's eyes pop out of his head so obviously as Pat Joe's. He was fascinated. It was a world to which he was not accustomed and we left at a very early stage. Nevertheless, he told the story afterwards and repeated many times in Ballinamore that he had once been to a Dublin night-club and that it was not a place to which he particularly wanted to return.</P>
    <P>He was a wonderful man with a great sense of humour and innocence. I join with everyone else in this House in expressing my sympathies to his son Gerry, his wife Tess and his entire family.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Ross, I had the good fortune to be a Member of this House when Pat Joe Reynolds was Cathaoirleach. I had the misfortune perhaps to be suspended under his auspices on at least one occasion. When one considers what Senator Ross has just said I must have severely provoked the man and while I cannot recall the circumstances of my suspension, I am now certain that he was right and I was wrong. Pat Joe was all that Senator Ross said and there is no point in my repeating his comments. My memory of him is very similar to that of Senator Ross, of joviality, good humour and a capacity to generate affection. We all have our ups and downs in politics but one had affection for Pat Joe Reynolds and would always be delighted to see him on his occasional return visits to Leinster House after he had ceased to be involved in politics. He also had the dignity and seriousness that goes with holding a high office of State and the integrity to stand up for issues in which he believed. He often spoke of his bewilderment as many of the intricate issues connected with the <Col N="5"/>first pro-life amendment were debated here in almost clinical anatomical detail. He talked of his own bewilderment at some of the material being debated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann. Bewildered he might have been, but he was never out of control. He was a dignified, effective, efficient Cathaoirleach of this House, for whom I always had great affection and great respect, in spite of my occasional clashes with him. I personally regret his passing and on behalf of my colleagues in the Labour Party, I pass on our sympathies to his family and particularly to Gerry, whom I knew very well. A good person is gone from us, a good politician who brought dignity to this House, and we all deeply regret his passing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I wish to be associated with the other groups in the House in extending our sympathy to the wife and family of the late Pat Joe Reynolds. He had a remarkable long life of public service to the State and to the people of Leitrim. His family's continuing service to the State since its foundation is very noteworthy, particularly in the circumstances of his father being assassinated. It is easy to talk about democracy, but when it is tested to that extent, it is a tribute to the Reynolds family and to Pat Joe Reynolds that they persisted in their defence of democracy over that extended period. He had a long and successful life and his record stands in this House as Cathaoirleach and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the days when we had Parliamentary Secretaries before Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>When he was re-elected in 1973, Pat Joe Reynolds played a crucial role in returning Fine Gael to Government. That party clearly owes him a particular debt of gratitude. He was a very loyal Leitrim man, very committed to his community of Ballinamore and to the Gaelic Athletic Association, and he made a considerable mark. We extend our sympathy to his wife Tess and in particular to his son Gerry, who has served in both Houses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach and to the Leader for allowing me to make a brief acknowledgement of the enormous contribution made to politics in my native county by Pat Joe Reynolds and his family. I could not help but reflect that there were two Pat Joes. Speaking well of the dead is a great Irish trait, but we do not always speak well of people while they are alive. Senator Ross used the word &ldquo;innocence&rdquo; when talking about Pat Joe Reynolds, which did not strike me as a word I would have used in the context of my knowledge of him. I assure the House that he certainly was not innocent. He was one of the old ward bosses in the best traditions of the term. He ran the Fine Gael organisation in Leitrim with a ruthlessness that we all envied and admired. As Senator Dardis said, the contribution he made and which his family continues <Col N="6"/>to make to public life in Leitrim and nationally is immense.</P>
    <P>In doing research some years ago for the book, <i>Women in Parliament, Ireland: 1918-2000,</i> I discovered some details about Mary Reynolds. The Leader rightly made a glowing reference to Mrs. Reynolds, widow of the late Paddy Reynolds, for her service of 29 years in the D&aacute;il. She holds the record for the longest serving woman in Parliament since the foundation of the State. In our research we found that she did not make a great many speeches, but she was very effective in doing a great deal of work in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency as it was then.</P>
    <P>The Reynolds family and mine were very greatly intertwined and I will surprise some people by telling them that the intertwining was not just personal but political. My grandfather, whom I did not know, had been a member of Cumann na nGaedheal and fought numerous elections, both selection conventions as well as general elections, with the Reynolds family, who lived only some 12 miles away. I have grown up with this very strong tradition of the impact of the Reynolds family on politics in Leitrim, which is continued by Gerry, currently a member of Leitrim County Council.</P>
    <P>Pat Joe had some wonderful qualities and was the quintessential politician at local and national levels. While I was not a Senator when he served as Cathaoirleach, it is obvious he had mellowed considerably in political terms by the time he arrived here. This view is widely shared by many people in County Leitrim, of all parties and none. The contribution the Reynolds family has made since the foundation of the State and continues to make is immense and admired by everybody.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross is correct in that Pat Joe Reynolds was unbending in his political views, one of which was the strong constitutional position he adopted at a time when the troubles in Northern Ireland were spilling across the Border into Leitrim. It is interesting that there is a public monument in Ballinamore to the late John Joe McGirl, a politician who also made an immense contribution in his own way but who did not take the constitutional path, yet there is no monument to Pat Joe Reynolds who stuck rigidly to the constitutional path. The legacy he, his father, mother and grandfather left is one we enjoy today. Sometimes we forget that they lived in difficult times.</P>
    <P>I convey my sympathy to Tess, Gerry, Peter, Ita and Regina, all of whom are good friends of mine. The Reynolds family has always been and will remain good friends of the Mooney family, irrespective of politics. That was what was great about Pat Joe Reynolds and his family. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to join in the tributes to the late Pat Joe Reynolds as we both served together in Seanad &Eacute;ireann. As has already been said, following distinguished service as a Deputy and Parliamentary Secretary, Pat Joe was elected to the Seanad in 1977, the same year I was first <Col N="7"/>elected. Elected Cathaoirleach in 1983 he was, as has already been mentioned, notably by Senator Ross, a very good Cathaoirleach. His successors will have reason to remember his fairness, in particular, and his impartiality.</P>
    <P>Despite political differences over the years, Pat Joe and I became very good friends, perhaps due to our association with the GAA. I deeply appreciated and treasured our friendship. I participated in Interparliamentary Union delegations led by Pat Joe, who was a great ambassador for Ireland. He was also widely respected nationally and in his native Leitrim and this was evident in the large attendance at his funeral in Ballinamore. To his wife, Tess, sons, Gerry and Peter, and daughters, Ita and Jenny, I extend my sincere sympathy on their very sad loss.</P>

   <?oasys _dc20-?><Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a sessional order, as agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to be taken without debate; No. 2, statements on the report, Review of Access to Mental Health Services for People with Intellectual Disabilities, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5 p.m., with the contribution of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, those of all others not to exceed eight minutes,  Members may share time and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 16, motion No. 24, to be taken from 5 p.m to 7 p.m.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <P>On a point of information, the House will not sit tomorrow until 11.15 a.m. because of a ministerial commitment, rather than at 10.30 a.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Some time ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, stated that he was extremely concerned about criminal activity funding a political party. He was referring specifically to Sinn F&eacute;in and was basing his concern on Garda intelligence. There is much concern about Sinn F&eacute;in and the political network it has built up. Many people appear to be working on a voluntary basis in consistency offices. If there is credibility to what the Minister has said, it behoves him to call in the Criminal Assets Bureau to identify whether there is a link and to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to come to the House to explain what is happening in regard to Aer Rianta. He had ambitious plans and he is almost like the sultan of spin as far as the newspapers are concerned in regard to the breaking up of Aer Rianta. I do not know the level of consultations the Minister had with the trade unions preceding the proposal to break up Aer Rianta. The threat to Aer Rianta, Dublin Airport and the other airports is like the sword of Damocles hanging over the issue of their <Col N="8"/>closure. I am extremely concerned about the image it projects of this country at a sensitive time when we are hosting the EU Presidency and when the ten accession states are to join. I would like harmonious discussions to take place and the Minister to come to this House to explain what is happening in regard to the dismantling of Aer Rianta as we know it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to raise that issue, although I do not believe it would be helped too much by the introduction of the Minister at this stage. I have previously asked for debates on industrial relations. Something sad has happened to this country in recent times. If any of us faced a situation where our job security or that of our children, friends or neighbours was suddenly undermined, we would fight for protection and security of tenure in a way that was fully understood by all. That is all that is being done by these workers at the airport. They are not trying to hold the country to ransom or to close down Aer Rianta or the airport. They are not trying to embarrass the Presidency; they are trying to protect themselves and their duty and responsibility to their families, children and so on. Perhaps criticisms could be made as to how people go about doing that. However, I recognise that the Minister has at least tried to meet their needs, inform them of their rights and give them that sense of security. I hope that is happening today, namely, that those two issues are being bridged.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we have reached a situation where the national newspapers day in, day out consider with contempt the idea that people would want security of tenure in their employment. If any of us in any job &mdash; apart from our current job &mdash; were told our jobs were at risk, whether they were or not, one could imagine the fear and shock it would create. I ask for understanding in that regard. It may well be that people have other things to say about Aer Rianta but what the workers have asked for, that is, security of tenure and understanding of the business plan for the future, is reasonable. The Minister has responded positively and I hope both sides can bridge that gap and sort the matter out. When that is out of the way, I would like the Minister to come to the House to talk to us.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we having a debate on this? It is extraordinary.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

   </Speaker><Col N="9"/>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise another issue. As somebody who does not depend on local authority members for support, I regard the recent comments made about hardworking, decent and poorly rewarded Dublin city councillors as objectionable. I seek nothing from local authority members&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to today's Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a duty &mdash; this has nothing to do with the party opposite &mdash; to attract people into public life. I would like to acknowledge and affirm the decent work done by people who are not rewarded. We should convey that view to them.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business, has there been any progress on Committee Stage of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002? This extremely important legislation has been on our Order Paper for so long that, if it were a Private Members' motion, it might almost have dropped off by now. There are also several other pieces of legislation which have not yet been introduced or debated on Second Stage. I would be grateful if the Leader could let me know about them.</P>
    <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">3 o'clock</TimeSt><P>Following on Senator O'Toole's contribution, last week Eircom yet again increased line rentals, giving an increase of 25% in 12 months. I do not know with any certainty the intricacies of what is now a very secretive and private company. However, I <?oasys _dc20-?>know that, if it were a State-owned company, it would not have increased its line rentals by 25% in the past 12 months because of the political pressure that would have been exerted. It appears that the privatisation of Eircom has been a monumental failure in that its primary objective was to provide people with a better service than that which had been available. There is now a considerable case for leaving Eircom wherever it is but returning the telecommunications infrastructure to public ownership, which it should never have left as it is a natural monopoly. Quite clearly, this natural monopoly is ruthless. It has been spending more on dividends for the owners than on investment in telecommunications infrastructure by a factor of two to one over the past 12 months. There is a considerable case for examining that.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <P>In this context, notions about how to reorganise our airports which are not based on practical information to demonstrate that they would be better are ideologically driven and therefore inherently threatening to the public good. I still wish that we might have a debate in which the reasons for a particular decision being taken might be articulated to us. I hope the reasons are more than the Minister simply feeling it was a good idea.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the House's attention briefly to the following matter. A whole list of papers was introduced because we were missing for a while, one of which is the annual accounts of a univer<Col N="10"/>sity for 2000. Another four constitute the annual accounts of a major health board for 2001. I do not know how either of those institutions can be regarded as being able to explain where money is going if its accounting is so out of date that we are talking about papers from three and two years ago respectively. Speaking as one who believes in public bodies, enterprise and money, that is wrong.</P>
    <P>As Members know, I withdrew from the Sub-committee on Seanad Reform. I did so because, perhaps sentimentally, I believe this House of the Oireachtas is very important. When major decisions about how this House conducts its business are taken outside this House, it makes a mockery of Seanad reform. Membership of the Oireachtas Commission should have been decided by discussion with and the agreement of Members of this House. That this did not happen is a travesty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot reopen that discussion now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not be involved in pretending to reform a House that is so ignored by people with more power than it could ever imagine.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if that is right, Senator. The members of the commission to which he refers were appointed by a resolution of this House unanimously passed on 19 December last.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no debate on that resolution. It was a Government proposal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not my fault that there was no debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was passed without debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was passed unanimously. If the Members here agreed to pass it unanimously on that occasion, we cannot have any further discussion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last point, without reopening the debate, perhaps I might say that it was done without debate by agreement. I am confident the commission was established under statute and that the statutory provisions relating to its establishment were complied with in full.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That has been decided. We do not want any more comment on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important the Seanad takes cognisance of the fact that Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Union and I wish the Taoiseach and the Government well in that onerous task as did the leader of the Opposition in the D&aacute;il. This is the appropriate House in which to debate some of the issues arising from the comprehensive programme for the Irish Presidency. The Seanad is well equipped and should be the <Col N="11"/>forum in which European matters are debated in full. This document gives us much ground for debate. Therefore, I recommend that the Leader arranges an early debate on the future of Europe, enlargement, the Convention and the Irish Presidency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the House adjourned, there has been a spate of adverse publicity regarding the huge hike in prices to the extent that we now find ourselves perched at the top of the league of costly countries in Europe and it is doing enormous damage. In a year in which we are supposed to have an increase in tourism revenue, this type of publicity is doing huge damage to the reputation of the country and it must be tackled.</P>
    <P>A good illustration of how serious is the situation is that last year there was a mass exodus of people to do their shopping across the Border in Northern Ireland. Senator Ryan has already referred to the 25% increase in Eircom rental charges. At a time when international oil prices are down, our oil, petrol, diesel and home heating oil prices have risen. This is a huge problem. The T&aacute;naiste has said she is concerned about the matter. She stated that competition is the answer and urged us to shop around. However, this is not working. We are definitely living in &ldquo;rip-off Ireland&rdquo; and we need to address it as a matter of urgency. In that context, I request an urgent debate on the matter at the earliest possible date.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>As spokesperson on European affairs, I wish the Taoiseach and the Government well over the next six months. I re-echo the points raised by Senator Dardis in regard to how best we can solve the outstanding issues and come to a successful conclusion in six months' time. Will the Leader arrange for such debates since there is no better place than the Seanad in which to outline the position on outstanding problems?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I did some homework during the holidays and I wish to congratulate the Leader and the House because, of the 46 Bills signed into law during 2003, more than half &mdash; a total of 26 &mdash; originated in the Seanad. In that context, I remind the Government that work is being done in this House even without the proposed reforms and I urge it to use this House in the manner in which the Leader has managed to coax it to in the past year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking my cue from Senator O'Toole in reflecting my particular concerns. Will the Leader indicate when the Bill to amend the constituencies will be introduced, following the recommendation of the so-called independent commission which has pronounced that Leitrim will no longer exist as a county? This is a battle we thought had been won, and that the war was over, 20 years ago. However, we have returned to it again as my county has been split geographi<Col N="12"/>cally in order to accommodate some grander scheme of things.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader to use her good offices to ask the appropriate State authority to do more to keep deer in and sheep out. Poachers and bandits have been roaming the countryside where I come from recently and, unfortunately and sadly, they are on the increase. They have been shooting native red deer, a protected species, and using their antlers as trophies&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I would welcome a debate and I seek your guidance, a Chathaoirligh, in this regard. Perhaps the Leader could have a word with the appropriate Minister. I have great sympathy for farmers, particularly around Kilgarvan, whose lands are overrun by the deer but, on the other hand, other farmers have a few thousand sheep where they should not be. This needs to be regularised.</P>
    <P>Many Members have sought a debate regarding planning and An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Leader is anxious to accommodate us. However, the board's independence must not be used as an excuse for the absence of accountability. While everybody accepts the law under which the board can, in its wisdom, disagree with its own inspectors' reports, it should, on each count, spell out why it has overruled the report. In terms of openness and transparency, that has not been seen to be done in at least one recent instance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the threatened strike by Aer Rianta workers tomorrow. I support the <Col N="14"/>calls by other Members for the Minister for Transport to attend the House to debate this issue. Aer Rianta was not established as a job creation or a job retention agency. It was given a management function to look after our airports, a critical part of the State's infrastructure. At a time when record numbers of travellers are passing through our airports and the economy has emerged from a downturn, it is appalling that one union at Dublin Airport can try to hold the country to ransom. I do not mind whether the union calls off the strike tomorrow but I object to it threatening to strike in any event. The Minister should come to the House and spell out what is happening so that we can support his attempts to break up Aer Rianta. Risk takers and investors in Ireland do not have job security but they pay their taxes so that the economy can go on.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House for a serious debate on incineration? It is time for the Government to be serious about waste management and the protection of the environment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>We are serious about it. That is the problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The people need clarity. The Minister for Health and Children is advocating a ban on smoking in public establishments in the interests of health and safety while the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government appears to be committed to managing waste by way of incineration rather than by reducing, minimising and recycling. He is taking the lazy option that will affect the health of the people.</P>
    <P>I support what my colleague, Senator O'Toole, said regarding the remarks of the Lord Mayor of Dublin.</P>

	<P>Arising from a speech made by President Bush on 7 January last about the future of immigrants in the United States, particularly Mexicans, I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on the plight of undocumented Irish people in the United States.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Senator was about to call for a debate on undocumented immigrants here.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>They are going through a difficult time at present. They cannot return to Ireland for funerals, weddings or other family occasions because they are in danger of being stopped at airports when going back. The plight of these people is a serious matter and the House should arrange a debate as soon as possible to discuss the proposals by President Bush and the reaction of the Government and our ambassador in the United States.</P>
    <P>Donnelly and Morrisson visas were excellent and provided security for Irish people in the United States of America. We should campaign to bring about a similar arrangement for Irish people living in the United States of America at present. I call on the Leader to give this matter priority in this parliamentary term.</P>
    <P>We have enormous influence in the United States and we should use it, particularly during the Presidency. On 1 May we will allow ten countries free access to the labour market in Ireland. Surely the United States could help our undocumented emigrants in the United States.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the request for a debate on the possible strikes at the airports. I do not know, nor does anybody in this House, whether they will take place. There is a case to be made for pointing out to those who are holding the nation to ransom that Sustaining Progress promised industrial peace. It seems to me that the Sustaining Progress agreement is only meant to be kept by one side and not by the other and that SIPTU and any other little branch of it &mdash; it may not involve the main union, I do not know about the internal workings of trades unions &mdash; can hold the country to ransom at will.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>You should smile, a Chathaoirligh.</P>

	<P>You are making me smile, Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>My second point is a very serious one. Last May, Senator O'Toole and I introduced a motion calling for an examination of the activities of auctioneers. The Minister came to the House and pledged that a commission would be set up to look into the activities of auctioneers and to make recommendations with a view to regulating the area or introducing legislation. I gather from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform this morning that nothing has been done about that matter.</P>
    <P>No such body has been set up. I ask the Leader to consider making representations to the Department that if pledges of that sort are made to this House, they should be kept and not just put on the long finger.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too wish to join with previous speakers in calling for a debate on the issue of planning which has been requested by a number of Senators over the past 18 months. Week after week there are examples of why such a debate is justified. I agree with the comments made by Senator Coghlan but the crucial point is the discrepancy in the planning system. A planning authority grants or refuses a permission which is upheld by the inspectorate and is in turn overturned by the board, sometimes on the whim of three or four objections made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. A better system is required and we need to return to the principle of the common good. I hope the Leader can facilitate a debate in this term.</P>
    <P>On the matter of waste management, I think we have learned one thing today and we need a debate on the matter if for no other reason than to clarify and explain it to members of the Opposition because obviously they are at loggerheads among themselves as to their strategy. A debate would be a useful exercise.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people who has raised questions both inside and outside this House about the activities of Sinn F&eacute;in and the funding of pol<Col N="17"/>itical parties and I recently called for an examination of this issue by the CAB. I remind Senator Finucane that it is imperative to maintain the independence of the CAB. We cannot have a situation where a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can issue directions to the CAB. We must respect the fact that it is an independent body.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the comments of and the request by Senator Leyden for a debate on undocumented Irish people in the United States. This was a major political issue ten or 14 years ago and was apparently resolved for a few years. There are many indications that the problem has returned to cause grave difficulty for a large number of Irish people in the United States. At a time when the American authorities are examining ways to resolve the undocumented situation in the case of Mexicans and others, we should use our political influence to try to bring some degree of redress to a sizeable number of Irish people in the United States.</P>
    <P>Both the Leader and I spoke on a related issue at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon. The position of elderly Irish people in Britain was the subject of an excellent "Prime Time" television programme before Christmas which showed very clearly and sadly the significant social, economic and health problems faced by a very sizeable number of elderly Irish people in London and throughout Britain. These are people who went to work in Britain in the period from the 1940s to the 1960s. They often have no social insurance records or entitlements and live in very poor economic circumstances. The Oireachtas has a duty to try to respond to the problems faced by those people. It would be helpful to initiate a debate on the subject.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked for a debate on the future of agriculture and the long-term strategy for Irish agriculture. I am pleased that the Minister has put in place a forum to be chaired by a former colleague, Mr. Alan Dukes, but there should be a political input and this House is an ideal forum to debate a long-term strategy to keep the farmers of Ireland farming and to give young people in agriculture some hope that they will have a future there.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Many speakers have supported Senators Finucane and O'Toole in seeking a debate on Aer Rianta. I ask the Leader to schedule the debate so that it deals with the fundamental issues rather than just the strike. It should deal with matters such as benchmarking, where the salaries of people in the public service were brought up to the levels of those in the private sector. Conditions should also apply to the public service as is the case in the private sector. There are no guarantees on jobs or on the performance of a company. These are always subject to the vagaries of trade. There is a need to instil in the public service that efficiency, productivity and <Col N="18"/>customer service are the only fundamental safeguards people have in their employment security. I have considerable sympathy with the Minister for Transport as he has many difficult areas with which to deal. He should be encouraged and complimented for taking the initiative on these matters.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to either broaden this debate or hold a separate debate on competition as it affects the public service. There are many areas in which the State is inclined to buttress the public service to the disadvantage of the private sector. Eircom, which is now a private company, brings with it the culture it had when it was in the public service. The idea of increasing its lines significantly is to enable it to retain customers, which in turn disadvantages other companies that might compete with it to get those customers. The ESB and the area of electricity supply needs to be investigated. RTE now gets 95% of the licence fee. There are some very good broadcasters, which are disadvantaged, and competition may be skewed as a result.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is pre-empting the debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully concur with Senator <?_ch?>Leyden's comments about Irish people of illegal status in the United States. We should play a part in assisting up to 30,000 such people. Given the large number of Irish Americans, we should use every lobby to get these people legitimised.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Bradford's call for support for the Irish in Britain. There has been considerable discrimination over many decades against the Irish in Britain both from the establishment and as a result of the general culture in certain parts of Britain. On several occasions I have heard Senator Mooney raise this issue, which has existed for some time. We should ensure that a concerted effort is made by the Government to assist people who find themselves severely disadvantaged in those areas and this House should give its full backing to some voluntary or State supported initiative to address the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Since we last met the Minister for Education and Science has directed the inspectorate in his Department to adopt an investigative role in that he directed it to check schools on 23 December to see which teachers were present. As a former Minister of Education, the Leader would have valued the advisory and supportive role of the inspectorate at all times. It was a complete departure from precedent for it to adopt this investigative role. In doing this, the Minister has lost the trust of the majority of teachers and boards of management have questioned his credibility. Where is he going and what is his vision of education? He has now embarked on a new vision for education.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="19"/>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am. The Minister has questioned the examinations process. He has called in what heretofore would have been termed the partners in education. He has now told the teachers they are no longer to be at the front of the class. Where are they to go?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>These points can be raised in the debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>At one stage, the Minister wanted to ensure teachers were in class and now he does not want them to stand in front of the class. The Minister's credibility is fading quickly. He should come to the House to outline his vision, if he has any, for education.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Higgins in his call for a debate on inflation, which is important for competitiveness and jobs not least in the context of enlargement. We all welcome the reduction of inflation to considerably below 2%. At the tourism briefings, which have been referred to, accommodation prices are deemed to be pretty competitive. There was a 6% increase in tourism last year, despite all the difficulties experienced. The real problem lies in the area of food and drink. I am also glad that insurance costs are showing signs of decreasing.</P>
    <P>In the context of tomorrow's threatened strike, I hope the constructive principles of social partnership will be applied by all sides. That means that everyone must be prepared to give and take. I accept Senator O'Toole's point that the Minister has given reassurances where concerns existed previously and that this provides a basis for the strike to be called off.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, the CSO published figures for relative incomes per county and region. This information dispelled the myth of the rich south-east. The figure for relative incomes in County Carlow was below those for many, if not all, of the counties in the BMW region. I ask the Leader to make time available for a debate on this issue in order that we might rectify the disparity that exists in terms of relative incomes throughout the country. Perhaps we might address that imbalance when the next round of talks on Objective One status and EU funding takes place.</P>
    <P>I also ask that if the Minister for Transport comes before the House, we be allowed to raise the issue of proper planning in the area of transport. It is proposed to add a new lane to the M50. This work will commence long before it should because those who planned the original motorway and thought it would last a long time were proven totally wrong. We are informed that adding a new lane to the M50 will allow it to last for another 15 years. Unfortunately, the credibility of these planners is at risk. We should debate this matter in order to discover the identities of these experts and the level of accuracy they have achieved in terms of forward planning. Are <Col N="20"/>we making adequate plans for the future or, even with an extended M50, will we be faced with another fiasco in five or ten years?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo calls for a debate on emigration in order to ensure that those who left our shores in the 1950s and 1960s will be looked after properly by the State. Many of these people worked in England and they sent back remittances to their families in this country. In many cases, they endured difficult circumstances including being paid on the lump, with no social security, being obliged to have their cheques cashed in pubs, the landlords of which took a percentage and worked off that evening's or weekend's drink against the cheques they held. These people were left in poor financial circumstances and it is incumbent on us to look after those who were generous to us in the past and who find themselves in difficult circumstances. I would welcome a debate on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The acting leader of the Opposition in the Seanad, Senator 
     Finneran&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Senator Finucane.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right. I apologise, I was thinking about something else. Senator Finucane referred to the remarks of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of funding for Sinn F&eacute;in. I will ask the Minister to clarify those remarks and indicate what he is doing about that matter.</P>
    <P>Senators Finucane and O'Toole referred to the Minister for Transport and the Aer Rianta dispute. I understand that discussions are taking place at present and I hope that they prove fruitful. Senator O'Toole also referred to people's right to put forward their views about their jobs and job security. Senator O'Toole also spoke about the decent work done by councillors throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked about the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill. I inquire about that legislation periodically and, as stated previously, many hundreds of submissions have been received in respect of it. When it reappears, it will be a completely new Bill. However, there is no likelihood that this important legislation will come before us in the short term.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also stated that we are supposed to be receiving better service from Eircom, which is clearly not the case. He went on to talk about the airports and their possible break-up, etc. The Senator also referred to the most recent annual accounts of a university for 2000 and of a major health board for 2001. It is not good enough that accounts detailing the conduct and activities of those bodies in the intervening years have not yet been produced. When he was Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey insisted that State boards and other organisations should submit their end of year reports within six to nine months. The bodies to <Col N="21"/>which the Senator referred must be reminded of their responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has withdrawn from the Sub-committee on Seanad Reform. The sub-committee has done its work and the Senator was there until the end. I thank him for his contribution and I hope he might reconsider his position.</P>
    <P>Senators Dardis and Ormonde expressed good wishes to the Taoiseach during Ireland's Presidency of the EU. I am glad to inform the House that the Taoiseach will be present on Thursday of next week to discuss our plans for Europe and for enlargement. I am sure Senator Ormonde will be my party's lead speaker during that debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins requested a debate on high prices and rip-off Ireland. Members of the Senator's party and Senator Leyden will have a great deal to say on that matter. Senator Leyden was involved in a debate on it on his website. Such a debate should be held. It is amazing that, despite what appear to be price rises, our inflation rate has fallen so low.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Quinn for his compliments about the amount of good work the House did during the last session. Senator Mooney referred to the constituency review. I wish to place on record my opinion that the review is independent.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan expressed concerns about native red deer and the fact that they are in danger. I will endeavour to arrange for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come before the House for a debate on that matter. The Senator also referred to the need to introduce planning reform as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Morrissey referred to Aer Rianta. Workers have a constitutional right to take strike action. I do not agree with the threatened strike at Aer Rianta. However, as a general principle, workers have a right to strike which is enshrined in our Constitution. I hope the talks will be successful and that the strike will not proceed.</P>

	<P>Senator Bannon also requested that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come before the House for a debate on incineration.</P><Col N="22"/>
    <P>Senator Leyden referred to the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US. In light of President Bush's recent initiative and the history of the Donnelly and Morrison visas, which were of great value to Irish people, we will have a debate on that matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross requested that the Minister for Transport come before the House. I do not know whether the Minister could shed much light on the situation because the talks are ongoing. However, a general debate on the proposed break-up would be useful. On foot of the Senator's request, I will inquire about the proposed commission to investigate the activities of auctioneers.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan referred to planning. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is to issue guidelines in the near future. I will inquire about the exact date for the publication. The Senator also stated that the CAB is independent. Senator Finucane also raised this matter in the context that the Minister made a statement about it or commented on it in an interview. Senator Bradford agreed with the remarks of Senator Leyden and also requested a debate on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh requested a debate to deal with issues such as benchmarking etc., and decried the concept that people could hold down jobs forever. The Senator echoed calls for a debate on the Irish in Britain and also sought debates on the ESB and RTE.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke spoke about the Minister for Education and Science, who is seeking contributions to his vision debate on education. It is a good idea. Everyone should contribute to a debate on education, particularly one that has the word &ldquo;vision&rdquo; in its title and which involves looking to the future. I understand the Senator's feelings about the other matter but it is also part of benchmarking. That is what the Minister was upholding.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh supported Senator Higgins's call for a debate on inflation and spoke about seeking consensus on Aer Rianta. Senator Browne asked about the CSO figures on the south-east and wanted to know the identity of these transport experts who are now deciding there will be extra lanes on the M50. Senator Hanafin sought a debate on emigration and on documenting how much emigrants contributed to this country as a result of their work.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for inviting me to speak on the National Disability Authority's recently published report, Review of Access to Mental Health Services for People with Intellectual Disabilities. I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline what the Government is doing to meet these and other needs which have been identified for people with intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>Ireland in recent years has enjoyed increased investment in its health and social care economy, helping it to modernise services, raise standards and extend provision to more citizens in need. Additional funding amounting to &euro;643 million has been invested in health funded support services for people with disabilities since 1997. This includes an additional &euro;25 million in current expenditure which was made available by the Minister for Finance in the 2004 budget for services for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue and capital funding of &euro;370 million has been provided for intellectual disability and autism services since 1997. This has provided approximately 1,700 additional residential places which are mainly based in the community. This figure also includes new residential respite places developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, approximately 465 extra dedicated respite places have been provided. In addition, 2,950 new day places were developed.</P>
    <P>We have also funded alternative placements and an enhanced level of services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism who were resident in psychiatric hospitals or other inappropriate placements. The number of persons accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in May 2003 was 438. This is down from 571 in 2001 and from 970 in 1996. Huge progress has been made in this area and there has already been a large reduction since 2003. The new accommodation provided has included community based homes and a number of residential and day complexes.</P>
    <P>Since 1998, approximately &euro;16 million has been put into the system to enhance early intervention, pre-school and multi-disciplinary support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Between 1999 and 2002, the Department provided additional funding of &euro;11.43 million to enable health boards to put in place a range of support services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism who present with major behavioural problems and therefore require a more intensive level of support.</P>
    <P>Key developments noted in the 2002 report of the national intellectual disability database reflect this investment. There has been a 37% growth in the number of people with intellectual disability living in full-time residential placements within local communities and a 165% increase in the provision of intensive placements designed to meet the needs of individuals with challenging behaviours. This includes individuals whose behaviour may arise as a result of a dual diagnosis <Col N="24"/>of intellectual disability and mental illness. There has been a 47% reduction in the number of people accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and a continued expansion in the availability of residential support services, in particular, service-based respite services, which have grown by 255%, with an additional 443 people reported as being in receipt of these services between 2001 and 2002. There has also been increased provision in almost all areas of adult day services and in the level of other support services delivered as part of a package of day services to both children and adults.</P>
    <P>In the period 1999-2003, additional revenue funding of &euro;78.3 million was provided for ongoing developments in mental health services, to develop and expand community mental health services, to increase child and adolescent services, to expand the old age psychiatry services, to provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and to enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies. Approximately &euro;190 million in capital is being provided over the lifetime of the national development plan to fund the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals, as a replacement for services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. Substantial progress has already been made and 21 general hospital psychiatric units are now operational. It is expected that a further unit will become available to the mental health services in the near future.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in ensuring that those in need of mental health services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting. Health boards have developed, and are continuing to develop, a modern comprehensive community-based mental health service. This has resulted in a continuing decline in the number of in-patients, with a corresponding increase in the provision of a range of care facilities based in the community to complement in-patient services. It is intended to continue to accelerate the growth in alternatives to hospitalisation with the further development of community based services throughout the country. There are approximately 400 community psychiatric residences in the country, providing more than 3,000 places. This compares to 111 residences, providing less than 1,000 places, in 1984. Approximately 200 day hospitals-day centres provide more than 3,500 places. This compares with 39 such centres, providing approximately 1,200 places, in 1984.</P>
    <P>The new Mental Health Commission, established in April 2002 under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001, has an important role to play in improving the quality of our mental health services. The primary functions of the commission are to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected. The Mental Health Commission is now working, along with officials from my Department, to put in place the <Col N="25"/>structures required for its new role. The commission has appointed an inspector of mental health services and the inspector will be required to visit and inspect all approved centres at least once a year. The inspector's annual report and review of the mental health services will be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas along with the commission's annual report.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a significant number of people whose needs intersect both services, those with a dual diagnosis of intellectual disability and psychiatric illness and-or challenging behaviour. The NDA report states that published evidence suggests that approximately 8,000 people with an intellectual disability in the State also have a psychiatric condition. Some 4,500 of these may require some type of specialist assessment and treatment.</P>
    <P>The NDA report states that persons registered with a generic intellectual disability service provider find it difficult to gain access to appropriate mental health services for assessment, treatment or continuing care. In some areas, local informal arrangements exist to provide emergency assessments and treatment, but a defined service appropriate to the needs of the dual diagnosis group does not exist nationally at present. The report of the review group on mental handicap services, Needs and Abilities, which was published in 1991, recommended that people with a mild intellectual disability should not be referred to the specialist intellectual disability services, but should access generic services, including generic mental health services. The NDA report has also outlined some of the reasons this approach is not working for people with a mild intellectual disability as regards accessing mental health services.</P>
    <P>My Department has been concerned about this issue and has endeavoured over a number of years to encourage and assist health boards to put in place arrangements to improve access to services for this group. Two specific initiatives now present my Department with an opportunity to progress this matter. The first is the national policy framework for mental health services. The health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, includes a commitment to prepare a new national policy framework for the further modernisation of mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document, Planning for the Future, and taking account of significant initiatives and policy developments which have occurred in the interim. An expert group on mental health policy was established in 2003 to prepare this national policy framework. It is envisaged that the expert group will examine, among other issues, access to psychiatric care. Last year the group requested submissions from interested organisations, individuals and the public on the issues concerned and more than 140 submissions have been received. Each submission received will be carefully read and considered by members of the expert group and will feed into the group's deliberations over the next few months. It is <Col N="26"/>expected that the expert group will complete its work in 18 months.</P>
    <P>In accordance with a commitment in Sustaining Progress, the social partnership agreement for 2003 to 2005, my Department is required to carry out a strategic review of existing service provision, in consultation with relevant interests, with a view to enhancing health and personal social services to meet the needs of people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities and autism. This review is particularly timely for the following reasons: the period of time which has elapsed since the publication of the relevant policy documents in this area; Government policy in relation to mainstreaming services for people with disabilities; the level of additional funding invested in the services in recent years; the publication in 2000 of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, and the primary health care strategy; the health services reform programme approved by Government and published in June 2003 and the new legislative measures being introduced in the area of disability.</P>
    <P>This review will examine a number of specific areas of service provision, including access to mental health services for people with intellectual disability and those with autism. The strategic review has a similar timeframe to the expert group on mental health services and both groups will take into account the recommendations contained in the report published by the National Disability Authority in terms of their respective services.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in ensuring that those in need of mental health or disability support services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting. However, much remains to be done. I am committed to the provision of quality care in both areas and I will continue to endeavour to secure additional funding for these sectors in the coming years. The active participation of all involved will assist in progressing what is ultimately most important, namely, the delivery of quality and cost effective services to people with a dual diagnosis.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the National Disability Authority on the publication of a timely and informative report. This is one of a number of reports published recently by the NDA. The other two cover the areas of service provision for people with disabilities and further education, training and employment services. I assure those who gave of their time and expertise to enable these reports to be published that they will be of great assistance to the service reviews which are currently underway. I also encourage them to take any opportunities which may arise over the coming months to make further contributions to this process. The active participation of all involved will assist in progressing what is ultimately most important, namely, the delivery of quality and cost effective services to people with a dual diagnosis. It will also guide the planning, development <Col N="27"/>and delivery of mental health and disability support services over the coming years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the opportunity to debate this important report on a neglected area of our health and disability services. Like the Minister, I congratulate the National Disability Authority on taking the initiative in this area and on the production of a report which makes depressing reading for those of us in public life who have a role to play in the development of public policy and services.</P>
    <P>The availability and appropriateness of mental health services has long been a neglected area. One must read the many hard hitting reports of the inspector of mental hospitals in recent years and the appeals made by mental health patient advocacy groups to understand the severe gaps in services throughout the country. This report highlights the enormity of the problem facing a group of people, namely, those with an intellectual disability, who may have experienced inadequate and inappropriate services for many years. According to the national intellectual disability database, 515 people with intellectual disabilities are resident in psychiatric hospitals. Many of those people are inappropriately placed in full-time psychiatric care. However, there are shortfalls in the services for people who may genuinely require psychiatric and mental health services. Almost 34% of people with an intellectual disability also have a psychiatric condition and more than half of them may require assessment and treatment.</P>
    <P>The report was published during the European Year of People with Disabilities when Ireland had the honour of hosting the Special Olympics. On the eve of the publication of the long promised and eagerly awaited Disability Bill, any feel good factor which was generated during the Special Olympics last summer has been diminished by this report. As a society, we are moving away from the paternalistic model of disability and are moving slowly towards a recognition of the human rights of individuals with a disability. The parents, families and advocates of people with intellectual disabilities have driven much of this progress. The approach lays increasing emphasis on the participation of persons with a disability and their representatives in the formulation and implementation of plans and policies affecting them. The current mental health service provision is grossly inadequate. The review underlines the very stark and unpalatable fact that there is incoherence in the strategy of the Department of Health and Children. Meanwhile, in my area, a group of parents of children with disabilities have for many years sought reasonable dental care for their children, to no avail. Several of my Oireachtas colleagues have asked about this in the D&aacute;il. I raised it on the Adjournment here last year and the Minister of State responded, as did the Minister, Deputy Martin, <Col N="28"/>when it was raised with him. The response of each Minister is to pass the responsibility on to the CEO of the Western Health Board yielding no improvement.</P>
   <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">4 o'clock</TimeSt>
    <P>When will people take responsibility? As the group finds it nigh impossible to resolve this issue, which requires limited resources, what hope is there for initiation of the broad framework service envisaged in this report? These difficulties should be resolved here but once again they are passed down through the bureaucracy. There has been no intervention in this area and I ask the Minister of State to intervene as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>People with intellectual disabilities do not enjoy the same right to a range of mental health services as the general population, and community services are virtually non-existent. There is no clear route to support during acute psychiatric episodes for people with intellectual disabilities. While many reports have been published and many policies espoused, there has been little progress due to the lack of leadership at a political and policy implementation level. There are in the State only six psychiatric hospital beds dedicated to the in-patient care of people with intellectual disability who suffer from a mental illness and who are under the remit of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. Far too few psychiatrists specialise in intellectual disability for adults and children. We cannot in conscience allow this to continue.</P>
    <P>I agree with the NDA conclusion that we must act now to protect and promote the rights of all citizens with mental health problems, in particular, a comprehensive mental health service for people with intellectual disabilities must be provided urgently. To allow the current inappropriate and inadequate situation to continue is a denial of human rights. There is a pressing need for provision of primary services and the development of new services with a legislative base and a right to access and standard service must apply. At a departmental level, political and policy leadership is required to promote a national policy statement and service framework for mental health services for the dual diagnosis group. There must be consistency of services throughout the country. Geography must never be used as a barrier to service access as unfortunately is happening in my area. The realignment of the health services promised under the health strategy and the other recent major health reports must take account of these needs. Where possible, services should be provided in the community which will facilitate intervention by multidisciplinary teams during every stage of assessment, diagnosis and treatment.</P>
    <P>There are 50 recommendations in this report covering all action areas. They must be examined, prioritised, funded and acted upon because this report is a wake-up call. There can be no further delay. The provision of appropriate services to people with a disability has been inadequate for too long. Despite investment over the past dec<Col N="29"/>ade, progress is painfully slow. Like the Minister of State, I look forward to the publication and enactment of a comprehensive rights-based disabilities Bill as promised by the Government for this month. Some progress has been made but much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>We celebrated wholeheartedly the Special Olympics as a showcase of excellence, ability and extraordinary talent, and I pay tribute to many of the organisers and those involved over the years, particularly last year. It was refreshing and reassuring to see that spirit of giving. Now that the games are over, we must all work together to build a truly inclusive and equal society where everyone, including and especially those with disabilities, is empowered and enabled to contribute to her or his full potential. It is a difficult area and I wish the Minister of State well. I will support him in any initiative that will help ease these problems.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis as ucht na s&aacute;r-oibre at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; faoi mh&iacute;chumais intleachta. &Eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, t&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; le d&eacute;anamh f&oacute;s. Mar a deir an seanfhocal, &ldquo;T&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre&rdquo;. Since assuming his present role, the Minister of State has been a hands-on Minister and has achieved a great deal but even he must acknowledge there is much more to be done and we all recognise that. I welcome this timely report which affords us an opportunity to review what has been achieved and assess what more needs to be done. I cannot agree with Senator Feighan's statement that progress has been painfully slow. It has not. I am a former psychiatric nurse and in the 1970s a colleague and I carried out an assessment using case notes to establish how many people with an intellectual disability had been admitted to a hospital in the midlands. Arising from that, the Lough Sheever centre was established and at least three wards were occupied by people with an intellectual disability. They received all the services that pertained at the time to their requirements. A similar development occurred at St. Fintan's hospital in Portlaoise when Alvernia House was set up.</P>
    <P>Hearing the statistics read by the Minister of State, we all accept that 438 people in psychiatric hospitals as of May 2003 is 438 too many. However that number is down from 571 in 2001 and 970 in 1996. Can anyone imagine the numbers in the mid-1970s? Great strides have been made since then. Nevertheless, we need to do more. Only six beds are provided in Stewart's Hospital for the specialised treatment of people suffering a psychiatric illness and an intellectual disability. That is the only control which the Inspector of Mental Hospitals holds over those people. During the reigns of successive Governments the inspector has made adverse comments about the psychiatric services with many of which I agree. Much of the publicity around these comments is unfair because the local media give the impression that the medical, nursing and other <Col N="30"/>staff are to blame for the conditions which they are not. We want to place that on the record.</P>
    <P>I had a very pleasant experience yesterday. I was served in a shop in my local hospital by a girl with an intellectual disability. I was so pleased, because she went to school with my daughter. I placed my order, the girl charged me the appropriate amount and I got my correct change. There is no big deal about that as it is what I expected. This girl is not the only intellectually disabled person employed by the Midland Health Board or indeed by other boards.</P>
    <P>While accepting that we have achieved much, there is more to be done. Page 64 of the report refers to &ldquo;community area mental health/<?_jy?>intellectual disability teams&rdquo;. I strongly favour the model proposed by the Irish College of Psychiatrists and I feel sure the Minister of State favours it too. In supplying mental health services to people with intellectual disability, the proposal is that the team should ideally comprise two consultant psychiatrists, four psychologists, four psychiatric nurses, four social workers, four registrars, two occupational therapists, one speech and language therapist and four administrative officers. The registered disability nurses for the intellectually disabled should be incorporated in that team, because we are speaking of an appropriate nursing discipline which should be used.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made in the report to secure units in the community, and this report is valuable because it highlights what is positive and negative about them. The report notes how skilled the staff have become in dealing with people in residential care in these units. That is fine, but it is clinically proven that there can be a downside for the clients.</P>
    <P>To ensure progress, we must devolve additional resources and provide appropriately trained people. I served on a health board for many years and had the honour of being chairman for two years, up to last July. We currently have 943 adults and 470 children on the Midland Health Board's intellectual disability database. Like any community member, people with intellectual disabilities require intervention of the mental health services on an episodic and sometimes continuous basis. The mental health needs of many of these people can be appropriately met by the generic adult and child adolescent mental health services. However, some may require more specialised intervention. In this regard, the Midland Health Board has in recent years appointed a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in learning disability, including autism, and a consultant general adult psychiatrist with similar interests, along with some support staff. The board will continue to augment and develop these services as resources permit. We must put in more resources because the report has identified the appropriate areas and recommendations have been put forward which must be acted on as far as possible. Like all recommendations, they are mainly resource-driven.</P><Col N="31"/>
    <P>The report notes that the board's residential services for adults with intellectual disability were formally de-designated from the mental health services approximately 15 years ago. In recent years the board has invested significant capital and revenue funding to relocate people from large residential centres to more home-based community settings. The report says that completion of this process will be continue to be a key priority.</P>
    <P>The resources devolved to community places have brought a significant improvement for those with intellectual disabilities or psychiatric illness and for their parents. During my health board service, I have seen the great benefit of that, but we must do more to provide appropriate trained nursing and medical staff, along with back-up personnel. Regarding secure or special needs units, recommendations have been made with the support of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the statistics have been given and the cost analysis has been done. Many of the recommendations are well thought out. So far in his portfolio the Minister of State has made very good use of his time, and I know he will consider the positive and well-researched suggestions in the report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister of State to the House to allow us the opportunity to make statements on the very welcome report from the National Disability Authority. It is important that we debate in this House reports which deal with marginalised groups within our society. With previous speakers I compliment those people associated with the compilation of the report.</P>
    <P>By their nature, reports will always bring up positives and negatives. We should reflect on reports in order to see if we are going in the right direction, to note where inadequacies have been highlighted and to see how we can make improvements. In the area of mental health, and the general health services, the fairest assessment anyone can make is that there will always be more to do. It will be the same in 20 years time and was the same 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge our progress in the mental health area over the past 40 years. There has been an opening up of something previously hidden in our society, and that is welcome. This is a two-facet operation. The health providers have a responsibility not to hide behind walls and deal with mental health and intellectual disabilities in that environment. There is also a responsibility among the service providers and public representatives to educate the broader community and society in the needs and advances. We must acknowledge the advances made in diagnostic approaches to mental illness. In the past, the mentally ill were treated as a single body of people and put into mental institutions. We have now broken down the area of mental illness and moved forward in areas such as that of intellectual disability, a term not used 30 years ago.</P><Col N="32"/>
    <P>I acknowledge the funding increase noted in the report. I pay tribute to the Minister for Health and Children for the manner in which he has approached his responsibilities, particularly in securing the additional &euro;25 million required to move to the next level. Having attended public meetings with the Minister, I have seen the way he has put forward the principle of the patient being the most important person, and has emphasised that the services are directed towards the patient and his or her interest. I also acknowledge the relationship he has developed with the various societies and organisations with which he has met.</P>
    <P>I will comment briefly on the area of residential care, particularly care in the community. If we are to make progress in removing the stigma of mental illness and intellectual disability, we must embrace an association between patients, their families, the relevant organisations and the community at large. This has been a successful approach. Reducing the number of patients in institutional care and increasing residential care in the community is a positive step. Unfortunately, however, there have been examples of communities being somewhat reluctant to embrace this approach. While this is to be regretted, our approach to residential care in the community must run parallel to our responsibility to educate the broader community as part of our health strategy.</P>
    <P>We should also acknowledge the dramatic increase in intensive placements, the expansion of support services in the residential area and the provision of day centres. In particular, we must acknowledge the support required by families for respite in all areas of illness. On an occasion such as this debate, we should acknowledge the great service provided by families, carers and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect the traditional State-provided services to work alone in the context of a broad area such as mental illness. We must work in partnership with voluntary organisations rather than regarding them as the enemy. We all have the same objective and these organisations have something to contribute. Working in partnership with them will be the proper way to move forward in addressing this issue.</P>
    <P>I will comment briefly on the establishment of the Mental Health Commission and the inspectorate. The inspectorate is welcome and its annual reports on mental health institutions will afford us the opportunity to set targets, meet shortfalls and address the issues highlighted in the reports.</P>
    <P>It is important that everyone plays a role in developing and addressing the societal changes required if we are to place on a sound footing a proper mental health strategy. Under the leadership of the Minister, we are going about this in the proper way. I congratulate everyone involved in compiling the report, acknowledge its positive aspects and hope we can address the genuine concerns raised.</P><Col N="33"/>
    <P>While there is no doubt that mental health services stood still for a period, since the late 1980s we have made improvements which must be acknowledged, although there will always be more to do in this area. I wish the Minister well in his responsibilities in this regard. I am sure we will continue to see growth and advances in the provision of services in the coming years and, I hope, greater understanding and acceptance by the general population of requirements in the area of mental health. I also hope the approach that medication can solve everything will decline and education of everyone will be enhanced.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. It is timely that we are considering this issue at the beginning of a new year. It is difficult to have a general debate on this issue without people becoming very emotional. Given that most of those involved in this area have personal responsibilities, their views on the issue are understandable. While I do not know the rights or wrongs of dealing with mental health services, we should consider a number of fundamental issues.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that we are dealing with people on two levels, namely, physical disability and intellectual difficulty. At adult level, this now reflects something we, in education, have been trying to cope with for many years. Some 20 years ago, which is not so long ago, special education was a clean-cut issue, divided into nice little categories. We had physical disability on the one hand and various levels of mental disability on the other and never the twain should meet. When we became more expert in identifying problems, it became increasingly common to find that people had a combination of problems. For example, a person with physical disability, perhaps a child with Down's syndrome, may also have had a mental difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am trying to use politically correct terminology in this debate. Many years ago, in my former life, I found it is easier to speak about something as I saw it, rather than trying to go along with the fashion of the times. The various words used to describe ability, disability, handicap and so forth change with fads every ten years. What was acceptable ten years ago, for example, is often unacceptable now. One of the problems is that people attach different meanings to different words.</P>
    <P>As a teacher, I was conscious that parents used to try to decide which school or educational institution was most appropriate for their child. Should their child attend a school catering for mental disability or one for children with physical disability? This resulted in schools becoming increasingly multidisciplinary, with students having multiple handicaps &mdash; excuse the term &mdash; or disabilities. This created all sorts of problems in the Department because it was structured to deal with nice, clean, simple categories of disability, an issue which the Leader and I jointly addressed on a number of occasions. For instance &mdash; the Mini<Col N="34"/>ster of State will bear me out on this &mdash; as recently as 20 years ago I could not convince the Department of Education that there was such a condition as autism and it refused to recognise it. I also had difficulty convincing teaching colleagues that a certain condition led to people finding it difficult to read to the extent that they would read words in reverse and believe them to be real. This has always been a difficulty.</P>
    <P>In the 1950s, one of the reasons Senator Jackie Brosnan, one of my predecessors both in the House and in the INTO, became a founder member of the National Adult Mental Handicap Institute, NAMHI, was to try to create awareness. During that decade, the INTO established a fund to bring British experts in the area of mental health, remediation and the teaching of children with difficulties to various towns here, including the Leader's town, to explain to parents that these were important needs. This was a time when to label a child was almost like pronouncing a sentence of death. We have come a long way since.</P>
    <P>What is being reflected today is an issue the education system grappled with 20 years ago. It would be useful to talk to some of those involved in the administration of special education at the time. They had to come here to tell us that one cannot divide people up cleanly and according to difference because life was not that simple and there were different kinds of disability which had to be addressed together. I ask that Senators consider the issue from this point of view.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to reopen the row about rights-based legislation, I understand both sides of this argument, namely, the view that the State should be prepared to cater for citizens with disability or special needs and the argument made by Governments that to make this a constitutional or legal right would result in the courts becoming clogged up. Both sides are wrong. I do not share the Government's concern in this regard, particularly that of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has consistently taken this position for many years. I have always disagreed with him on the basis of my belief that if one is fair and does one's best, one will succeed. The way to do it is to look after people in this way subject to the State being able to do so. That is what it boils down to. It will always be subject to whatever resources are available. We should be brave enough to say that, which brings me to my next point, which is fundamental.</P>
    <P>In a parallel discussion today, a Member took me to task on what I had said about the workers in Aer Rianta. I will not raise that debate now, so the Acting Chairman should not be worried. Having said how important it was that the Minister took a strong stand with those workers, he went on to talk about the extraordinary difficulties faced by elderly Irish men, in particular, in London. If we take people out of permanent jobs, will we not have to look after them at some stage <Col N="35"/>in their lives? Should we not try to strike a balance? The same applies in this case.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in society that we are not as connected to each other as in the past. When everybody lived in a provincial town, a rural area or even in a small city &mdash; there were communities within small cities &mdash; if there was somebody living down the road who had a child with a difficulty or a special need, everybody on the road was aware of it and everybody helped out and looked out for them. If the child was not fully responsible for themselves, one could be sure that if neighbours saw him or her go beyond the end of the road, they would call somebody. In that way, we all bought into it. That is not happening anymore. It is not that people are more selfish, although that is the way it is often presented in the media. People are not aware of what is going on; they do not have to deal with it themselves and they do not see their neighbours dealing with it. People suffer or conduct their business behind curtains and they are expected to carry on. What is happening as a result is that a person with a disability is becoming an extra tax on his or her parents, family and friends. That is emotive language but that is, effectively, what is happening.</P>
    <P>This issue has always been there but it is a bigger problem now in terms of what we are discussing. Things have moved on. Nature is wonderful; it dealt with this in previous generations by means of life expectancy. In most cases, many of the people who had these types of problems did not have long lives. There is nothing as bad now as meeting the parent of an adult child who comes under the categories about which we are talking today. These parents spend their lives worrying about what will happen to their child when they die. These are the issues on which we need to reassure people, and this could be done through openness. All people want to know is that the community, which means us, will do its best. I do not see this as a party political issue. Those of us on this side of the House should never be happy with how much the Government does in these situations and I do not believe those opposite will ever be happy either. I imagine the Minister of State will never be happy that he can do enough. That is the way it should be and we should apply pressure constantly.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State try to sell this to a cynical public? We need to put more resources into this area. Whatever happens, we must prioritise this issue, and not only when somebody wishes to run out and use the old clich&eacute; about the most vulnerable group in our society, which could be said of approximately 20 other groups. This is a group of people for which we can do something and which we can support in a positive way.</P>
    <P>The most attractive aspect of it is that the more we do for these people, the more they can contribute to society. Many of these people have a contribution to make, which can be positive and from which we can all gain. I have often heard it said by those working with people with various <Col N="36"/>disabilities that the response of people with needs reverberates through the helpers and creates a more open society, makes people feel good about themselves and about society and, consequently, raises the level for everybody. That is important but it must be on the basis of Government subvention and investment. That is the Minister of State's job. He will never do it well enough as far as I am concerned but I will be happy as long as he is not doing it well enough as far as he is concerned and then I will believe people are doing their best.</P>

   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the report of the National Disability Authority and commend the body on its excellent work on behalf of those suffering with disability. It is recognised, maybe not by all sides of this House but by those outside it, that the huge investment of funds by this and the previous Government has gone a long way to lighten and lift the burden of those suffering with disability and their carers. At a time such as this, when we talk about autism, the Special Olympics or any type of disability, I always use my health board area as a barometer. Nationally, that is a good way to go because what is good for the North Western Health Board is good for the boards in the east, west and south.</P>
    <P>Officials and those who have gained from the investments made in the North Western Health Board are delighted with the investment made. An investment of &euro;20 million has been made in learning disability over the past three years. That is a huge investment in such an area. My mind boggles when I ask how much investment has been made in areas outside learning disability. If that is not enough, I was told a half an hour ago that a further investment of &euro;2.1 million was made last July. I say that tongue-in-cheek because the day will come when I will go begging to the Minister of State saying we have no money and he will say I am on record as saying I was delighted with the investment made.</P>
    <P>There are 1,836 people with a learning disability in my health board area. Some 444 are living in Donegal and 892 in Sligo-Leitrim. The majority, 86%, live at home, 19% are in residential services and 12% are in small community home groups. In my opinion, and in that of those availing of the service, the service is running well and has major supports. The supports come in many different forms but there is one which provides support to carers. There are 338 carers in my health board area and they provide 35,000 hours per year of home help and carer support. They go shopping for or to day care with the person they are looking after. The sufferer could not manage without that support which must be acknowledged. We also have two child psychiatrists with a special interest in learning disability and I am told approval for a third is currently being processed. There is a total of ten psychiatrists in the health area, two of whom have <Col N="37"/>a special interest in learning disability or other intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will be interested to hear that some of the investment in our health board area has been used to carry out a review of the learning disability needs assessment, which was touched upon by Senator O'Toole. A plan has been put in place and all those with learning disabilities, their parents, families and carers were interviewed. A plan has now been put in place for their future for the next 15 to 20 years. As Senator O'Toole pointed out, people with special needs or learning disabilities age more quickly than do the able bodied. How many times have we met parents of those with disabilities who live their lives worrying about what will happen to their son or daughter when they die? They feel it is a terrible burden to ask a brother or sister to look after a sibling with a handicap. I know the North Western Health Board is the only one to have carried out such a review. Perhaps it might be looked at and used as a blueprint for other areas. I know it has a plan in place for all its people when they reach the age of 55 and upwards. They will be put into retirement homes. Some of them will be allocated places near where they originally came from and that is also good for people.</P>
    <P>We have 400 dual diagnosis patients, which is 400 too many. Having carried out a little research before I came in to speak today, I feel there is a problem. It has not been highlighted by other speakers. It is almost a blocking point when someone with a learning disability turns up at a psychiatric unit. There is a fear that the person is coming from sheltered accommodation or a residential home and that there may not be a willingness to take him or her out when the person starts to feel a little better. That is only something that I have felt from talking to different people, but perhaps the Minister might examine it. I would hate to think that a consultant or group of consultants were blocking something on such a basis.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the report is for four regional units to be geographically distributed. They must be available to support community teams by providing specialist acute assessment and treatment for the dual diagnosis group. I agree with that and the community and multidisciplinary teams are essential if we are to make progress. However, I fear we are becoming too regional. I envisage in my area that, if our regional unit was based in Galway, someone from as far away as the Inishowen peninsula would have a drive of more than five hours to get there. A person who already has special needs is vulnerable. They have vulnerable minds and one is taking them away from their own setting. I would like more clarification of that point. Otherwise, I can take it up with the people who commissioned the report.</P>
    <P>Finally, as I said before, the Minister is very caring and compassionate and we in the House know that. The report is in his good hands. I ask him to address the needs, particularly those of the <Col N="38"/>dual diagnosis group, because it is at this that the report is really getting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the discussion on this NDA report. It is very important that we discuss it. However, we are discussing it at the first sitting of 2004 and it is a pity that we did not deal with it during 2003, which was the year of people with disabilities. I have two great concerns. As a member of the Western Health Board over several years, I know that tremendous improvements have occurred in terms of resources and additional places. I sincerely welcome those as part of an ongoing process. However, tragically, in the Western Health Board area and at St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe, we have several persons, most of them young, who are literally condemned to a placement which is totally unsuitable for those with special needs. There are people with intellectual and physical disabilities. I can find no words other than &ldquo;criminal abandonment&rdquo; if any structure or system allows that situation to continue indefinitely and especially after the year just gone. Those people will remain there this year, next year and three years hence.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely incumbent on the Minister to examine, within the mental health institutions that exist today, the number of people who are similarly kept in totally unsuitable circumstances. The system that allows that to continue is indicted as a failure. It is my simple plea to the Minister today that he stop that practice. The number of various standard mental institutions has declined. Tremendous work has been done over the years through taking people from institutions and placing them in the community, sometimes in rented accommodation. We must acknowledge the great acceptance by the community at large of this new departure whereby people who were literally &mdash; I hate to use the word &mdash; locked up in institutions are now brought into the communities and willingly accepted in the towns where there were psychiatric hospitals and facilities over the years.</P>
    <P>I know the case of St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe best. It has had a great reduction in the number of patients held in it for treatment. They are getting excellent treatment there. I am not in any way doing down the service provided in those institutions, but it is a welcome development that we are taking people from the institutions and placing them in the community. I am well aware of the fact that there is a solid core of people who were themselves as adults &mdash; perhaps as young adults &mdash; put into those institutions and literally abandoned. Thankfully, that day is now gone and a process is in place where those who need to go there do so, rather than being abandoned for whatever reason, as was the case in the past. My plea to the Minister is that he examine in great detail the number of persons with physical and mental disabilities who are retained within those institutions and have no place to go.</P>
    <P>My other point concerns what Senator O'Toole said about the elderly who have what were chil<Col N="39"/>dren and are now young adults who are themselves ageing. Those elderly parents are in crisis and do not know what will happen to their children when they die. Over the years, they have provided sterling support for them in their homes. I have an example. Many public representatives on tour in my own constituency visited a facility where a mother of about 75 years of age said that she had to drag her young son, an able-bodied person, to the wall so that he could put his feet against it and crawl into a standing position. She felt totally unable to help him.</P>
    <P>While we have such situations in communities, perhaps with people getting only a daily or hourly service of care in temporary centres, there is a great obligation to provide and focus whatever funding may become available. I recognise that it may be scarce, but people are in crisis and shouting for help. They cannot get an answer from anyone. It would be worse were it not for the voluntary effort of parents, as Senator O'Toole said, and many other groups that came together over the years to provide for, recognise and highlight problems in societies, communities and families.</P>
    <P>Until those voluntary groups became organised and made pleas to public representatives, health boards and Ministers over the years, there was no recognition of the plight of families and communities.</P>
    <P>Single parents who have the cross to bear of a mentally or physically handicapped person are forced out to work. They are also faced with a 24 hour care service need for a severely handicapped person. Such people will get respite for just one weekend in four, five or more, perhaps from late Saturday evening when he or she finishes work until late Sunday evening when the person must be collected and taken home.</P>
    <P>While we can mention the impressive global figures to which the Minister of State already referred, I want him to identify the special and specific needs of a hard core which is only represented by a number. The tragedy is that they are neglected. I want the Minister of State to consider the people in our mental institutions today because their case is one of criminal abandonment in a modern society.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the report, its findings and the many challenges it presents the Government. I compliment the Minister of State on the comprehensive report which also outlines past achievements. I have no doubt that, with the Minister of State's experience, his commitment to the health services and his service to the Mid-Western Health Board throughout the years, if any Minister will implement the findings, it will be him. I wish the Minister of State well with his responsibilities in regard to youth and children.</P>
    <P>Yesterday was an important one in Limerick because an eight year old girl was honoured for her bravery by the President, having undergone three bone marrow operations to save the lives of her three brothers. I appeal to the Minister of <Col N="40"/>State to consider the lack of a paediatric immunologist in the country and I have no doubt that with his experience he will have the position filled on a national basis. Each health board may only have to cater for a small number of people but there are 500 sick children and perhaps the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Crumlin Hospital could meet the need. I wish the Minister of State well in the years ahead and ask him to implement the findings of this report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their remarks about the report. As I said, it is a useful report which will be of huge benefit to the Department of Health and Children and those interested in the disability sector. I compliment the NDA and everyone who was involved with the report. In particular, I thank the Senators who have taken the trouble to read the report and present themselves to the House to speak about it even though it was published just a few days ago. This shows their commitment.</P>
    <P>I listened attentively to the speakers and I agree with Senator Ulick Burke's point about figures and the need to remember we are dealing with people who at the cutting edge. We constantly state that in planning for the future of the health services, putting the patient first is the fundamental issue. Nowhere should that be more appropriate than in the disability area.</P>
     <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">5 o'clock</TimeSt><P>I am delighted today's debate has not been political and I agree with Senator O'Toole that this issue never should be political because every side of the House has had a huge involvement and interest in it. Unfortunately over the years, the position of society, not to mention politicians, Governments and the Opposition, regarding service provision for the intellectual disability and mental health areas has been inadequate to put it mildly. This is a societal problem, although this is an easy point to make on reflection because it is not fair to blame certain people.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about the 1950s and he is correct in regard the problems of the health service in coming to grips with autism and so on. Some five or ten years ago I met teachers in training in Limerick and even they had problems with the curriculum in regard to facing up to autism, ADHD and so on, because more and more information about these issues is being published. Therefore, when an organisation such as the NDA goes to the trouble of doing such fantastic work in the disability area, there is a responsibility on policy makers to take it into consideration and it will be of huge benefit to everyone.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. I will never be happy with the health services because no matter what one does, they can always be improved. We must always strive for excellence. While much has been done, more needs to be done, especially in the mental health area.</P>
     <P>I spent three hours last night at a debate in the Royal College of Surgeons about the mental <Col N="41"/>health services. While there have been huge changes in the health service, many consultants and service providers have fears. Part of those fears is the changes the Government will implement in the service area. I have no problem with this and I recognise such fears. One of the problems raised by service providers in the mental health area is that there is inadequate consultation with them. It is a huge omission. One can commission experts to review issues and they hold consultations, but only with a small number of people. They do not consult enough people. It should always be necessary to keep meeting and listening to the service providers &mdash; the people at the coal face.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report because it points out many inadequacies in services for the disabled and I assure the House that the Department of Health and Children will do everything it can to develop policies to fill the gaps in the service. I thank all the Senators who contributed today.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
    <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Government to avail of the opportunity, given Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, and the fact that the accession of new members to the EU will result in a recognition of additional languages in the Union, to have the Irish language recognised as an official working language of the EU and its Institutions.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Seo d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht faoi cheann de na teangacha is sine sa domhan &mdash; t&aacute; s&iacute; 2,000 bliain d'aois.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I am grateful for the opportunity to debate this important issue. I also welcome the all-party support for the motion because this is the first time there has been solidarity and unity on an issue in this Seanad.</P>
    <P>I would like to address what is indefensible about the failure to recognise Irish as an official language of the European Union. It is not excusable that Irish has been ignored for so long. All states that signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and every other state that has signed a treaty of accession since, with the exception of Ireland, have had their official languages recognised as official working languages of the EU. I will not harp on about the mistake made in 1972 but Ireland has a wonderful opportunity, through its Presidency of the EU, to make Irish a formal working language of the EU.</P>
    <P>While preparing for the debate, I initially decided to base my argument on the cultural significance of the language. Irish is 2,000 years old and is the oldest language north of the Alps. It is part of our identity and is central to being Irish. However, as I continued my research, I realised there is much more to this debate. An intrinsic economic argument runs side by side with the cultural argument.</P><Col N="42"/>
    <P>Irish is recognised in the Constitution as our first official language. The decision taken in 1972 to exclude Irish as an official EU language was wrong but we should move on. It is timely to act now. The new accession countries, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, will have their official languages recognised. The population argument is not significant. A total of 38.6 million people live in Poland compared with 380,000 in Malta. Ireland did not object to the recognition of the official languages of smaller member states, where fewer people speak the official language compared to the number of Irish people speaking Irish, according to the latest census figures.</P>
    <P>A justifiable privilege has been conferred on the citizens of the accession countries, which has not been afforded to our citizens. The peoples of these states will have the opportunity to seek employment in the EU institutions and the laws of the Union will be provided in their languages. Their languages will become part of the workings of the Parliament and all other EU institutions. It is time we acted to redeem this inconsistency regarding the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The process of recognising Irish as an official language does not necessarily have to involve an all or nothing scenario nor does it have to be costly. English is the primary language of the Union. The use of Irish must be practical and manageable and could be cost efficient. Eurocrats sometimes do not use common sense but they can avoid going down the road of making this an extremely costly job. Not all EU documents need to be published in Irish. The process of having Irish recognised as an official working language of the European Union is not so complicated. Allowing Irish to be recognised as an official working language of the EU is entirely a matter for the Government. All that would be required would be for the Government to move to inform the European Commission that it wishes to have Regulation 1 of the Treaty of Rome 1958 altered to include Irish as an official working language.</P>
    <P>There would be many advantages for Ireland if Irish were recognised as an official working language. The most obvious, if not the most ideological, is employment opportunities. It is a basic EU requirement for all job candidates to have two official languages. Irish citizens who have two languages, Irish and English, do not even reach the interview stage. This is a discrimination issue and one which should be challenged. If secondary school students in Ireland were aware that it would help them to gain employment in Brussels at Commission level they would have the incentive to learn Irish. There is a growing and dangerous feeling among students and parents that Irish will not get a young person a job. Recognition of Irish would combat this negative feeling that Irish as a subject is useless for employment.</P>
    <P>A further problem relates to Irish MEPs whose first language is Irish or who may wish to speak to the European Parliament in Irish. Fianna F&aacute;il <Col N="43"/>MEP, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Neacht&aacute;in, who was born and lives in the Gaeltacht, needs permission and must give advance notice if he wishes to address the Parliament in Irish, despite its constitutional status as Ireland's first official language. My party colleague, Mary Banotti, was, famously, prevented from delivering her maiden speech in the European Parliament through Irish. This is not good enough. We should be proud of our national language. It is regrettable that those who genuinely want to use it at all levels of the EU are currently prevented from doing so.</P>
    <P>In order to gain promotion in the Civil Service at an EU level one must have three working languages. Some years ago the fact that the EU accepts Irish as a language for promotion was highlighted. One needs three languages for promotion but Irish is not acceptable as a qualification for being employed in the first place.</P>
    <P>As this motion has all-party support I will not raise the matter of broken Government promises. This evening all Members are singing from the same hymn sheet so I will not refer to that in my contribution.</P>
    <P>On 1 May this year, there will be 21 treaty languages of the European Union but only 20 official working languages. Irish will be excluded. This is no longer acceptable. The Constitution states that Irish is the first official language &mdash; in some circumstances this has been upheld by the courts &mdash; and English is the second official language. If we are to follow the Constitution to the letter, Irish must become an official language of the EU. Ireland has more than proven itself since we joined the EEC in 1973. We have worked hard to embrace the ideals of European citizenship which clearly embraces and promotes linguistic diversity. We must now right the wrong done in 1973 and move at once to have Irish recognised as the 21st official language of the EU. Why should Ireland, an integral part of the European family, have a second class status in terms of recognition of our language within the EU?</P>
    <P>The Irish language is 2,000 years old. I live about one mile from the Gaeltacht and spent 14 years trying my best to learn Irish but I still have difficulty in conversing in the language. Recognition of Irish as an official working language would give the impetus back to Irish speakers and would give confidence to our educators, who have kept the Irish language alive. This opportunity could be a watershed for the Irish language and failure to take it could have long-term negative implications which would be insurmountable. My colleagues in other parties will raise the matter with the Minister. It must be given priority during the six months of our Presidency.</P>

Bheadh s&eacute; truamh&eacute;illeach do gach gl&uacute;in a thiocfaidh in&aacute;r ndiaidh d&aacute; mbeadh s&eacute; le tuiscint acu go raibh an seans ann an st&aacute;das seo a bhaint amach ach n&aacute;r baineadh tairbhe as an dea-thoil agus an taca&iacute;ocht a bh&iacute; i measc an phobail chun &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
    <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil na me&aacute;in cumars&aacute;ide tar &eacute;is teacht taobh thiar den iarracht seo chomh maith, rud a chuireann ionadh ar dhaoine. Bh&iacute; eagarfhocal i <i>The Irish Times</i> a bh&iacute; an-l&aacute;idir i bhf&aacute;bhar st&aacute;das oifigi&uacute;il mar theanga oibre a bhaint amach don Ghaeilge san Aontas. Lasmuigh de litir n&oacute; dh&oacute;, agus n&iacute;l m&oacute;r&aacute;n d&iacute;obh ann, n&iacute;l aon fheachtas i gcoinne na hiarrachta seo. An ch&uacute;is at&aacute; leis sin n&aacute; go bhfuil maiti&uacute;rachas ag baint leis an St&aacute;t anois agus go dtuigimid anois, c&eacute; go bhfuil meas idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta orainn mar n&aacute;isi&uacute;n, go laghda&iacute;tear an meas sin toisc nach bhfuil teanga oifigi&uacute;il na t&iacute;re, faoi mar at&aacute; leagtha s&iacute;os san mBunreacht, &aacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id againn. Cuireann sin ceisteanna i measc na daoine eile cad &eacute; ina thaobh go bhfuil an sc&eacute;al amhlaidh. Sin an arg&oacute;int is l&aacute;idre at&aacute; againn, go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar an ch&eacute;ad theanga oifigi&uacute;il sa t&iacute;r.</P>
    <P>T&aacute; rud n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; ag teacht le seo. Bh&iacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn sa Seanad le d&eacute;ana&iacute; ar Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la. Ritheadh an Bille d'aon gh&uacute;th agus crutha&iacute;onn sin go raibh gach &eacute;inne anseo agus sa D&aacute;il i bhfabhar aitheantas ceart a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. T&aacute; s&aacute;r-obair d&eacute;anta ag na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaeilge leis na blianta ach is trua go raibh orthu troid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ar son <Col N="45"/>cearta a ba ch&oacute;ir a bheith ann ar aon n&oacute;s. N&iacute;l t&iacute;r eile ann a rinne &iacute;obairt chomh m&oacute;r ar son f&eacute;ini&uacute;lachta n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, saoirse agus aitheantas c&uacute;lturtha a bhaint amach agus a rinne t&iacute;r seo. Bhaineamar neamhsple&aacute;chas amach sa chuid seo den t&iacute;r agus n&iacute;l aon chomhartha neamhsple&aacute;chais n&iacute;os fearr n&aacute; teanga. Nach gceapfadh duine, ansin, go dtiocfadh gach cabhar agus aitheantas a thabhairt don teanga sin nuair a bh&iacute; &aacute;r Rialtas f&eacute;in againn? M&aacute; fh&eacute;achann duine ar ch&uacute;ige Uladh i l&aacute;thair na huaire, t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil borradh m&oacute;r i dtaobh na Gaeilge. T&aacute; siad ansin ag faire orainn le cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh treoir ag teacht uainne.</P>
    <P>Molaim an seasamh a ghlacann an Seanad&oacute;ir McHugh ar son na Gaeilge. C&eacute; go n-admha&iacute;onn s&eacute; nach bhfuil ach beag&aacute;n Gaeilge aige, seasann s&eacute; agus d&eacute;anann s&eacute; arg&oacute;int&iacute; ar son na Gaeilge i gc&oacute;na&iacute;. Is maith sin mar n&iacute;l Gaeilge ar a dtoil ag gach duine sa t&iacute;r agus t&aacute; muid ag iarraidh an pobal ar fad a mhealladh linn. Caithfidh siad a bheith cinnte go bhfuilimid i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, nach dtaca&iacute;ocht b&eacute;il amh&aacute;in at&aacute; i gceist agus nach bhfuilimid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag r&aacute; go bhfuilimid i bhfabhar na Gaeilge gan rud ar bith a dh&eacute;anamh. Seo seans d&uacute;inn a thaispe&aacute;int n&iacute; amh&aacute;in go bhfuil muid neamhsple&aacute;ch ach go bhfuil muid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin bhf&eacute;ini&uacute;lacht n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta sin.</P>
    <P>Nuair a th&aacute;inig Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Neacht&aacute;in isteach le labhairt linn, cuireadh an cheist air faoi seo agus d&uacute;irt s&eacute; nach bhfuil le d&eacute;anamh ach iarratas a chur isteach. Scr&iacute;obh s&eacute; litir sa nuacht&aacute;n a r&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna. M&aacute;s rud &eacute; go bhfuil sin amhlaidh, ba bhre&aacute; liom a cheapadh go bhfuil muid ag &eacute;isteacht le cro&iacute; an phobail agus t&aacute; a fhios againn c&aacute; bhfuil an cro&iacute; sin. N&iacute; g&aacute; ach f&eacute;ach&aacute;int ar Fhoram na hEorpa. Bh&iacute; gach duine i l&aacute;thair ansin, gach p&aacute;irt&iacute; sa Seanad agus na me&aacute;in cumars&aacute;ide i bhfabhar agus anois t&aacute; seans againne an treoir mhisni&uacute;il sin a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>T&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte nach mbeidh di&uacute;lt&uacute; ann agus go mbeidh staid&eacute;ar breise d&eacute;anta air seo. T&aacute; an feachtas seo ag dul i bhfeidhm ar gach &eacute;inne agus beidh s&eacute; thar a bheith deacair &eacute; a sh&eacute;anadh. T&aacute; seans againn bheith aontaithe ar son na Gaeilge, n&iacute; amh&aacute;in sa t&iacute;r ach go hidirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta freisin. Beidh meas i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; orainn d&aacute; mbeadh an sc&eacute;al amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>N&iacute; bhainfidh m&eacute; leis na ceisteanna faoi fhosta&iacute;ocht agus a dhath mar t&aacute; sin d&eacute;anta ach seo seans le haitheantas oifigi&uacute;il a bhaint amach don teanga agus m&aacute; gcabhra&iacute;onn an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo leis an bhfeachtas sin, beidh s&aacute;r-obair agus &eacute;acht d&eacute;anta againn.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an seans agam bheith p&aacute;irteach sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo. Chuir m&eacute; ceist sa Teach seo c&uacute;pla m&iacute; &oacute; shin conas a tharla n&oacute; c&eacute; a th&oacute;g an cinneadh gan iarratas a chur isteach 30 bliain &oacute; shin agus br&uacute; a chur ar an Aontas le teanga oifigi&uacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh den Ghaelainn. N&iacute; dhearnadh &eacute; an uair sin agus n&iacute; thuigim conas a tharla sin ach n&iacute; bhfuair m&eacute; aon fhreagra. B'fh&eacute;idir go raibh daoine ag f&eacute;achaint ar an &aacute;bhar go praicitici&uacute;il agus th&aacute;inig siad ar chinneadh go <Col N="46"/>mbeadh s&eacute; thar a bheith deacair an rud seo a chur ar f&aacute;il agus nach raibh aon bhr&uacute; ar an dtreo eile.</P>
    <P>I nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re things rested so go dt&iacute; an tr&aacute;th seo. Ag f&eacute;ach&aacute;int anois air, &aacute;fach, is deacair d'&eacute;inne seasamh ar leataobh ag f&eacute;ach&aacute;int ar a tharl&oacute;idh ar 1 Bealtaine, nuair a bheimid ag cur teanga s'againne ag bun na scuaine agus teangacha eile na dt&iacute;ortha nua a chur chun cinn. N&iacute; f&eacute;idir cur suas le sin in aon tsl&iacute;. N&iacute; f&eacute;idir d'aon duine bheith s&aacute;sta leis sin agus sin an spreagadh at&aacute; ann ag an bpointe seo. Ag f&eacute;achaint air go praictici&uacute;il, n&iacute;l a l&aacute;n sa mh&eacute;id seo don nGaelainne &iacute; f&eacute;in, c&eacute; go mbeadh s&eacute; go han-mhaith ag an c&uacute;pla c&eacute;ad duine a bheidh jobs for life acu, something I support not just for airport workers but for muintir na Gaeltachta agus lucht na Gaelainne, ach n&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn cur i gcoinne na harg&oacute;inte gur c&oacute;ir le teanga na t&iacute;re a bheith ar chomhch&eacute;im le gach teanga eile san Eorap. Sin spiorad an r&uacute;in anocht. Caithfear sin a chur ar f&aacute;il d&uacute;inn.</P>
    <P>Ag pl&eacute; an ruda, &aacute;fach agus ag f&eacute;ach&aacute;int ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; bainist&iacute;ochta na hEorpa, beidh s&eacute; dodh&eacute;anta an jab at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l acu le 50 teanga &eacute;ags&uacute;la san Eorap ach that is not our problem today. T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir domsa agus do gach duine eile nach bhfuil an dara rogha againn ach a chur leis an iarratas at&aacute; leagtha amach sa r&uacute;n anocht. Caithfimid taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt d&oacute;, bheith d&iacute;ograsach le br&uacute; a chur ar an Rialtas leis an iarratas a chur isteach agus caithfidh go n-&eacute;ireoidh linn. Beidh me&aacute;n-bhothar ar an rud seo. N&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn protocol a bhr&uacute; ar an Eorap go mbeidh an m&eacute;id sin teangacha ar f&aacute;il i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ach sin a problem for Europe. T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir d&uacute;inn gur seo an t-iarratas a chaithfimid a chur isteach. M&aacute; tharl&oacute;idh s&eacute; de thoradh sin agus de thoradh teacht isteach t&iacute;ortha nua eile go bhfuil s&eacute; dodh&eacute;anta gn&aacute;thobair riarach&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh in Aontas na hEorpa, n&iacute;l aon fhadhb ann nach f&eacute;idir a r&eacute;iti&uacute; agus beidh r&eacute;iteach san Eorap.</P>
    <P>N&iacute;l s&eacute; ann anois, &aacute;fach. T&aacute; s&eacute; dubh agus b&aacute;n faoi l&aacute;thair, we are either in or out, an t-aon rogha eile at&aacute; againn n&aacute; seasamh ar leataobh agus f&eacute;achaint ar teangacha na dt&iacute;ortha eile ag dul chun cinn agus an Ghaeilge ag bun na scuaine. N&iacute; ghlacfaidh m&eacute; le sin. M&aacute; t&aacute; fadhb mh&oacute;r ann mar gheall ar an iarratas seo, so be it. &Oacute; thaobh muintir na Gaeltachta&iacute;, lucht na Gaelainne agus iad si&uacute;d go bhfuil gr&aacute; acu don teanga, caithfimid freagra a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh go bhfuil muid ag seasamh leo ar an bpointe seo. Caithfimid a chur leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; anseo agus br&uacute; a chur ar an Rialtas agus ar an Aontas Eorpach go mbeidh an st&aacute;das c&eacute;anna ag an nGaelainn agus at&aacute; ag gach teanga oifigi&uacute;il eile san AE.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas m&oacute;r ag an Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; Daonlathach an tairscint seo a mholadh. Is trua liom nach mbeidh m&eacute; in ann or&aacute;id ioml&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh as Gaeilge. I am in the same position as Senator McHugh. Having spent several years learning Irish in school and having spent several summers in Corca Dhuibhne &mdash; Senator O'Toole will know Br&uacute; na Gr&aacute;ige in Baile an Fheirt&eacute;araigh &mdash; I still have a difficulty when it comes to being able to <Col N="47"/>articulate properly what I want to say in Irish. Some would say I have the same difficulty in English, but that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>I commend Senator McHugh for tabling this motion and I am delighted that Members from all parties have assented to it. I was very impressed by the presentation made at the National Forum on Europe by An Docht&uacute;ir P&aacute;draig Breand&aacute;n &Oacute; Laighin agus a chairde, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery. I refer to some of the arguments made at that forum which bear repeating. We were fortunate to have aighneacht a leagadh os comhair an Fhoraim N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta um an Eoraip i gCaisle&aacute;n Baile &Aacute;tha Cliath ar 8 Ean&aacute;ir, "I dTreo Aitheantais don Ghaeilge mar Theanga Oifigi&uacute;il Oibre don Aontas Eorpach", which was the document presented to us by An Docht&uacute;ir &Oacute; Laighin.</P>
    <P>The document puts the arguments extremely well. I am sure anyone who wishes to go into it in more detail can secure the document from the forum. While I am not sure if it is available on the website it is certainly available from the secretariat of the forum. Although it is produced in both languages, I will quote from an leagan B&eacute;arla rather than an leagan Gaeilge. The window of opportunity arises because of the enlargement of the Community and what is being done for the accession states, which will become full members on 1 May. Twelve languages will be added some of which are used in small countries. There is a distinction in that we speak English well here &mdash; some would argue we speak it better than those in the country that invented the language. As part of out national identity it is important that we are able to use the language on the occasions on which we chose to do so.</P>
    <P>Irish is of course a treaty language and treaties are required to be translated into Irish. However, until I got this document, I was not aware that it is possible to petition the European Parliament in Irish in writing and an answer will be sent in the same language. I was not aware that the same applies to the Ombudsman. The document states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The following are the institutions (as well as Parliament), and advisory bodies which are referred to in Article 7, and which may be written to in Irish with the expectation of an answer in the same language: the Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers), the European Commission, the Court of Justice, and the Court of Auditors, and the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.</P>
    <P FLI="0">There is an extensive range of areas where Irish can be used. It seems like a short step from that to making it more universally available as a working language. The document also states: "few people would be expected to petition Parliament, or submit a complaint to the Ombudsman, or write to the institutions and advisory bodies of the Union". While this is correct, the right exists nevertheless.</P><Col N="48"/>
    <P>I accept the point referred to by Senator O'Toole. There is a difficulty when it comes to finding the physical space and the people to translate into all the new languages. It would have been a simpler matter up to this point. If Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Neacht&aacute;in MEP is a cainteoir &oacute; d&uacute;chas, he should be able to speak in Irish in the European Parliament. It is reasonable to suggest that he should give reasonable notice of his intention to do so, so that rather than having the translators there on a permanent basis, they can be there when he speaks in Irish. Even if it were never translated he should be in a position to make his contribution in Irish.</P>
    <P>I read the priorities for the Irish Presidency of the European Union yesterday. One of the sections refers to culture and emphasises the importance of cultural diversity. By extension we should state the language should be available as a working language. From that point of view I recommend that the Government should proceed in that direction.</P>
    <P>Another section of An Docht&uacute;ir &Oacute; Laighin's document bears quoting. It states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Making the arrangement for Irish to be recognised as an official working language of the European Union is entirely a matter for the Irish Government. There would be no negotiation involved, apart from the timetable, perhaps. All that is necessary is that the Irish Government should inform the European Commission that they wish to have Regulation 1 modified in order to include Irish as an official working language. The amendments involved are straightforward: Irish to be entered in correct alphabetical order in Article 1 [which deals with languages], and the number of official languages in Articles 4 and 5 to be amended from &lsquo;twenty&rsquo; to &lsquo;twenty-one&rsquo;. The Commission would forward the appropriate amendments to the Council of the European Union, and the proposed change would receive unanimous approval.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This clearly spells out the procedure to be followed and I have no reason to believe it is not accurate.</P>
    <P>The <i>acquis communautaire</i> is the corpus of European law. While I am not saying we should not go on to have Irish as a working language, at a minimum the <i>acquis communautaire</i> should be available in its entirety in Irish. As much of that work has been done, I do not see a particular difficulty with that. While I mentioned the logistical problems with people speaking Irish in the European Parliament, no such problems exist in dealing with correspondence and having the <i>acquis communautaire</i> in Irish. It is evident that one or two competent people would be able to do that over a period of time. I also recommend this to the Government.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to support the motion and I hope this debate will lead to some progress and eventually lead to the adoption of Irish as a working language within the European Union.</P>

	<P>Caithfear a bheith c&uacute;ramach nuair a moltar r&uacute;n i gceachtar Teach den Oireachtas go bhfuil ainmneacha ceannair&iacute; na ngr&uacute;pa&iacute; go l&eacute;ir curtha leis. Ar an oc&aacute;id seo, glacaim go bhfuil muid go l&eacute;ir i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re agus nach bhfuil gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ocht cinici&uacute;il i gceist mar gheall ar na hainmneacha at&aacute; leis an r&uacute;n. Aithn&iacute;m &oacute;n chleachtadh at&aacute; agam leo agus &oacute;n mh&eacute;id oibre agus an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite acu go bhfuilimid go l&eacute;ir d&aacute;ir&iacute;re. D'fh&eacute;adfadh an tAire seasamh suas agus focal amh&aacute;in a r&aacute; linn, agus d'fh&eacute;adfaimis go l&eacute;ir dul abhaile. N&iacute;l le d&eacute;anamh ach iarraidh ar an Aontas Eorpach, agus chaithf&iacute; glacadh leis an Ghaelainn mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il. N&iacute;l m&eacute; s&aacute;sta &eacute;isteacht le harg&oacute;int&iacute; faoi seo. T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil s&eacute; de cheart ag t&iacute;r ar bith go n-aithn&iacute;tear teanga a &uacute;s&aacute;idtear go forleathan sa t&iacute;r mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il. T&aacute; gear&aacute;n, mar shampla, ag muintir Catalonia, nach bhuil an Chatal&oacute;inis aitheanta, ach is ceist pholaiti&uacute;il &eacute; seo faoin dt&iacute;r sin &mdash; faoi dearcadh l&aacute;r na t&iacute;re n&oacute; an dearcadh l&aacute;rnach agus an dearcadh a ghlacann le hiolrachas sa t&iacute;r. T&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht agus mar sin de ar si&uacute;l f&oacute;s sa Sp&aacute;inn. N&iacute;l s&eacute; r&eacute;itithe ina ioml&aacute;n f&oacute;s. &Oacute;s rud &eacute; nach bhfuil s&eacute; r&eacute;itithe, is cos&uacute;il nach bhfuil p&eacute; rialtas at&aacute; i gceannas sa Sp&aacute;inn ag glacadh leis go n-aithneofa&iacute; an teanga, at&aacute; ar an seacht&uacute; teanga is m&oacute; at&aacute; in &uacute;s&aacute;id san Aontas Eorpach. Sin figi&uacute;r a fuaras amach tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na, ach n&iacute;l m&eacute; anseo chun caint faoi ach amh&aacute;in le r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; de dhualgas n&oacute; de cheart ag rialtas t&iacute;re an cinneadh seo a dh&eacute;anamh agus a r&aacute; go dteasta&iacute;onn s&eacute; uainn. Nuair a bh&iacute;omar mar bhaill nua ag dul isteach den gc&eacute;ad uair, cos&uacute;il le gach &eacute;inne ag dul isteach in eagra&iacute;ocht nua, bh&iacute; cuid mhaith bainte amach againn &oacute; thaobh talmha&iacute;ochta agus ruda&iacute; eile de, agus feictear dom nach rabhamar s&aacute;sta an chuma a bheith orainn go rabhamar ag lorg a thuilleadh agus a thuilleadh ar&iacute;st.</P>
    <P>T&aacute; an saol athraithe anois, &aacute;fach, agus athr&oacute;far i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; &eacute; nuair a thagann deich dt&iacute;r eile isteach. T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil s&eacute; r&aacute;ite cheana f&eacute;in go mbeidh teangacha anois mar theangacha oifigi&uacute;la san Aontas Eorpach nach labhartar n&iacute;os forleithne n&aacute; an Ghaelainn &mdash; go bhfuil an Ghaelainn ar aon ch&eacute;im n&oacute; leibh&eacute;al leo maidir le c&eacute; chomh forleathan is a labhartar iad. Beidh an oiread c&eacute;anna daoine sa t&iacute;r a bhfuil cumas labhartha acu agus an st&aacute;das c&eacute;anna mar theanga taobh istigh den t&iacute;r. Cosna&iacute;onn s&eacute; beag&aacute;n, mar shampla, go bhfuil c&oacute;ras aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n comhuaineach sa Tigh seo, ach glacann gach &eacute;inne leis go bhfuil s&eacute; de cheart agus de dhualgas againn go mbeadh a leith&eacute;id ar f&aacute;il. Is cuimhin liom, sular cuireadh t&uacute;s le TG4, n&oacute; TnaG mar a bh&iacute;odh mar ainm air, go mb&iacute;odh daoine &oacute; am go ham ag iarraidh ceist pholaiti&uacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh as. Chuir siad an cheist arbh fhi&uacute; an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh. Bh&iacute; baill de dh&aacute; Theach an Oireachtais d'aon ghuth, tr&iacute;d an speictream ioml&aacute;n, go raibh s&eacute; ceart go mbeadh c&oacute;ras teilif&iacute;se againn ina mbeadh an Ghaelainn &aacute; h&uacute;s&aacute;id mar phr&iacute;omhtheanga. D'&eacute;irigh s&eacute; sin, mar bh&iacute; an t-&eacute;ileamh ann. Bh&iacute; an lucht f&eacute;achana ann, agus bh&iacute; an cumas ag daoine <Col N="50"/>cl&aacute;racha fi&uacute;ntacha a dh&eacute;anamh arbh fh&eacute;idir le gn&aacute;thdhaoine taitneamh a bhaint astu.</P>
    <P>Glacaimid go l&eacute;ir anois go bhfuil ceithre chain&eacute;al teilif&iacute;se sa t&iacute;r seo agus go bhfuil rogha n&iacute;os forleithne againn mar gheall air sin. Caithfear bheith cinnte cad is br&iacute; le teangacha oifigi&uacute;la. Bh&iacute;os ag f&eacute;achaint ar an Idirl&iacute;on, mar a dh&eacute;anaimid go l&eacute;ir agus muid ag lorg eolais faoi rud ar bith. Chonacas su&iacute;omh amh&aacute;in, agus an sainmh&iacute;ni&uacute; a bh&iacute; ar "official language" n&aacute; "a language which citizens must use when addressing the institutions of the European Union". Is &eacute; at&aacute; &aacute; r&aacute; faoi l&aacute;thair n&aacute; go gcaithfimidne ceann de na teangacha seo a leanas a labhairt &mdash; Frainc&iacute;s, Sp&aacute;innis, Portaing&eacute;ilis, B&eacute;arla, Gearm&aacute;inis agus mar sin de. Caithfimid ceann d&iacute;obh si&uacute;d a &uacute;s&aacute;id, ach n&iacute;l cead againn labhairt le hinstiti&uacute;id an Aontas Eorpaigh tr&iacute; Ghaelainn. P&eacute; arg&oacute;int&iacute; a bh&iacute; ann faoi acmhainn&iacute; n&oacute; faoi chostais, is seanarg&oacute;int&iacute; iad, mar t&aacute; an c&oacute;ras ag athr&uacute;, agus t&aacute; teangacha le cur isteach sa ch&oacute;ras aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus dleath&uacute;il san Aontas Eorpach at&aacute; n&iacute;os laige n&aacute; an Ghaelainn. B&iacute;mid r&oacute;-&eacute;ad&oacute;chasach i gc&oacute;na&iacute; faoin Ghaelainn sa t&iacute;r seo, agus is f&eacute;idir f&eacute;achaint ar ruda&iacute; nach bhfuil chomh maith is a bh&iacute;d&iacute;s. Ar an dtaobh eile, is f&eacute;achaint ar ruda&iacute; a thaispe&aacute;nann go bhfuil an teanga l&aacute;idir f&oacute;s agus go bhfuil s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir gurbh &eacute; toil an phobail sa t&iacute;r seo go mbeadh an teanga l&aacute;idir go buan. N&iacute;l m&eacute; cinnte conas mar a bheadh s&iacute;, ach beidh an Ghaelainn beo sa t&iacute;r seo 100 bliain &oacute;n l&aacute; inniu. T&aacute; toil an phobail soil&eacute;ir anois, p&eacute; sl&iacute; ina d&eacute;antear &eacute;, go mbeidh an teanga &aacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id f&oacute;s. N&iacute; fheadar an mbeidh Gaeltachta&iacute; ann n&oacute; nach mbeidh, ach beidh pobail ann a labhra&iacute;onn Gaelainn eatarthu f&eacute;in. Sin mar a bheidh s&eacute;, agus sin toil an phobail. D'&eacute;irigh le pobal na t&iacute;re seo &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh, mar bh&iacute; an Ghaelainn ag me&aacute; nuair a fuaireamar &aacute;r saoirse.

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm seans a bheith agam labhairt ar an r&uacute;n seo. Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a r&aacute; leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; as an m&eacute;id oibre at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige agus na harg&oacute;int&iacute; at&aacute; curtha aige le blianta ag iarraidh go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il san Aontas Eorpach. Is d&oacute;cha go bhfuil muid go l&eacute;ir aontaithe sa Teach seo mar gheall ar an r&uacute;n seo. Bh&iacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in an-s&aacute;sta go raibh an Feisire Eorpeach, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Neacht&aacute;in sa Teach seo <Col N="51"/>c&uacute;pla m&iacute; &oacute; shin roimh an Nollaig ag caint ar an cheist seo. Is duine &oacute;n Ghaeltacht &eacute; agus is &iacute; an Ghaeilge a theanga d&uacute;chais. D&uacute;irt s&eacute; ag an chruinni&uacute; anseo gur cheart go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il agus gur gh&aacute; don Rialtas iarraidh ar an Aontas Eorpach &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh. T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeimid in ann &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh agus go mbeidh an Rialtas i bhfabhar an r&uacute;in. T&aacute; an tAontas bunaithe ar &eacute;ags&uacute;lacht chult&uacute;rtha, agus beidh an &eacute;ags&uacute;lacht sin le feice&aacute;il tar &eacute;is sh&eacute;ad&uacute; an Aontais i m&iacute; na Bealtaine seo chugainn. Beidh ar a laghad 20 teanga oifigi&uacute;il san Aontas ag an am sin. Is ceart go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ina measc fosta. Chuir an Seanad&oacute;ir O'Toole ceist t&aacute;bhachtach faoi na harg&oacute;int&iacute; a bh&iacute; ann 30 bliain &oacute; shin nuair a chuaigh muid isteach san Aontas. B'fh&eacute;idir go ndearnadh dearmad faoin Ghaeilge ag an am c&eacute;anna le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; iascaireachta, fadhb ar a bhfuil muid ag caint le 30 bliain anuas.</P>
    <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; praictici&uacute;il agus r&eacute;ad&uacute;il go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il san Aontas agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeimid in ann sin a bhaint amach. Bh&iacute; Seanad&oacute;ir &oacute; Murch&uacute; ag caint ar na postanna a bheidh ar f&aacute;il sna hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; leis na haistritheoir&iacute; breise ach is &eacute; an cult&uacute;r an arg&oacute;int is fearr ina thaobh seo.</P>
    <P>In addition to mentioning Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Neacht&aacute;in MEP, I should also mention another man from An Spid&eacute;al, Councillor P&oacute;l &Oacute; Foigh&iacute;l, who was elected to Galway County Council some years ago. He is still a councillor and will contest the local elections this year. When he was first elected to the council, on which I served with him for some years, he wanted to speak in Irish at the meetings but discovered there was no translation service. Furthermore, many councillors objected to him speaking in Irish because they said they did not understand it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Rinne s&eacute; sin agus bh&iacute; an c&oacute;ras sin sa D&aacute;il le blianta fada fosta. However, Councillor &Oacute; Foigh&iacute;l succeeded. I was glad because it is important that the Gaeltacht, a large part of which is in County Galway, is represented in that way. Native speakers are involved in local politics as well as national politics.</P>
    <P>We should also bear in mind areas outside the Gaeltacht where there is great support for the Irish language. The gaelscoileanna movement has been particularly positive in that regard. I received a magazine from the CEO of the movement before Christmas. The magazine contains photographs and articles from many of the 180 all-Irish schools and colleges nationwide. It celebrates the growth of the all-Irish school movement over the past 30 years and includes contributions from President McAleese, singer Moya Brennan, actor Stephen Rea, M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, gaelscoileanna president D&oacute;nal &Oacute; hAinif&eacute;in and politicians whose families are involved in gaelscoileanna.</P><Col N="52"/>
    <P>Before the last general election there was a strong campaign in the town of Ballinasloe to have the gaelscoil moved onto the Department's building programme and there was much criticism that an election pledge had been broken. Gaelscoil U&iacute; Cheithearnaigh in Ballinasloe is now included in the 2004 building programme. That demonstrates the commitment of the Government to parents, teachers and students who are anxious to have a gaelscoil in their community.</P>
    <P>Since my election to the Seanad, I have noticed a great deal more debate is conducted in the Irish language in this Chamber than in the D&aacute;il. The Seanad has debated Bille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2002 and there have been debates on Irish culture, music and tradition in addition to this debate on the Irish language. Yesterday's foreign affairs committee meeting was attended by representatives of the British foreign affairs committee and I noticed that many of the members of the Oireachtas committee started their contributions in Irish by simply saying "c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte" or one hundred thousand welcomes. However, I am from east Galway where one is given the f&aacute;ilte U&iacute; Cheallaigh, which is the most generous of welcomes. It has impoverished many members of the Kelly clan.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not use Irish to try to bamboozle our friends from the House of Commons but when we can use the language in a committee or in the Oireachtas, we should be able to use it officially in the European Parliament where we have played such a significant role over the years.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House is excellent and I compliment the Members on putting it forward. I hope our efforts are successful. As Conradh na Gaeilge puts it, n&iacute; g&aacute; ach &eacute; a iarraidh.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire. The motion can be summed up in one concept, that of identity. On one hand we have our national identity, an innate sense of being Irish, and on the other there is our collective identity as part of the European Union. While the emblem of any nation's identity is its flag, its distinct and separate identity is its language.</P>
    <P>For many centuries the Irish language was part of the cultural fabric of continental Europe. It was the language of scholars, soldiers and politicians. It was also the language of ordinary individuals. In County Longford, between 200 and 300 years ago, people were evicted by their landlords because they did not understand English. Irish was the natural language of rural Ireland in addition to the Gaeltacht areas of that era. Sadly, after next May, Irish will be the only one of 21 European languages without official status in Europe. This must be rectified and I hope the Minister will take on board the contributions by Members tonight and ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>In May, nine new languages, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, <Col N="53"/>Slovene and Maltese, will become official languages of the EU alongside English, Danish, Swedish, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Finnish, Greek and German. In 1972, the Irish Government said it did not want Irish to become an official and working language of the European Community, giving the reason that the translation work would present serious practical difficulties. Every country which signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and every country that signed a treaty of accession since then, with the exception of Ireland, has had its official language recognised.</P>
    <P>Over 30 years after Ireland's accession, this Government is still ignoring the views of the fluent Irish speakers of this country despite the gathering momentum of gaelscoileanna. I compliment the great job the gaelscoileanna movement is doing in County Longford. The movement is laying the foundation for a new generation of Irish speakers. The Government is failing to act at this opportune time to give the Irish language the prominence and status it deserves. What is the point of teaching Irish to our children and encouraging its propagation when the Government will not support its promotion to official European status?</P>
    <P>Ireland's Presidency of the EU, allied with the accession of nine new states and the recognition of nine new languages, is an ideal chance for the Government to rectify the omission of Irish from the official functions of the Union. Ireland did not object to the recognition of official language status being granted to languages with fewer speakers than Irish. There is also no evidence that this country complained that it would cost too much to increase the number of official languages next May. The new countries are delighted with this decision and they will gain advantages which the Government is denying our citizens.</P>
    <TimeSt idown="4" down="4">6 o'clock</TimeSt><P>The other member states do not object and are not putting obstacles in Ireland's way with regard to the recognition of Irish. The problem seems to be one of inaction on the part of the Government. The non-official status of Irish within the EU and its institutions relegates Ireland to the position of being the only member state not to have its first official language recognised. Our MEPs cannot address at will the European Parliament in Irish. The knock-on effects of this non-recognition mean that Irish speakers applying for a job in Brussels cannot claim Irish as their required second European language. So much for the chances of Irish speaking graduates. For each new official language the EU will engage 110 new translators and 40 new interpreters. If Irish was included, new employment opportunities would be available for Irish speakers. Perhaps the Minister could explain what is stopping him from acting on the Gaeltacht commission's finding that Irish should be an official EU language. Promotion of the Irish language and the refusal to promote its recognition in Europe is symptomatic of the Government's record of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other.</P><Col N="54"/>
   
    <P>Ireland's Presidency of the EU should be a time of advancement both for ourselves and the Union. I spoke earlier about the flag being the emblem of a country and its language representing its unique and separate identity. Over the next six months I would like Ireland to promote its first language and for Irish to take its place among the languages of Europe. As regards the Union, I would like our children to gain a greater sense of their European identity through its promotion in our schools. Every school should fly the European flag not only during the months of our Presidency, but as a permanent reminder of our European status. Europe is our future and we must do everything we can to foster a sense of pride in our membership of the Union among our young people. Pride in our Irish heritage and in membership of the EU should be the message for the next six months.</P>
    <P>At the last executive meeting of the Local Authority Members' Association, which represents every local authority in the country, a resolution was passed encouraging the Government to ensure Irish is adopted as a European language. Senator Jim Walsh, as chairman of the Confederation of European Councillors, promoted and encouraged the use of the Irish language at every opportunity given to him, whether he was speaking to Democratic Unionist councillors in Northern Ireland or to political alliances in Slovenia or Slovakia. I compliment him on that and I hope it continues.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take the views of the Members here this evening on board over the next couple of months. I await his response.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n Gaeilge agam. Chaill m&eacute; a l&aacute;n den Ghaeilge a bh&iacute; agam ach t&aacute; suim agam sa teanga agus t&aacute; m&eacute; ag freastal ar rang le feabhas a chur uirthi. Senator Ryan was the only person I understood this evening because he spoke my Irish. I am glad it is still in the back of my mind. He has encouraged me to continue speaking it.</P>
    <P>I went to the forum two weeks ago where this topic was raised by Dr. P&aacute;draig Breand&aacute;n &Oacute; Laighin. I read the document he produced. It is shocking that Irish is not recognised as an official language in Europe. We have a golden opportunity to put that right during our Presidency given that a number of new states will be joining the EU and that a number of new languages will be recognised. There should not be any difficulty in that regard. I understand the process is simple in that a regulation must be modified and put to the Commission. I will do everything in my power to move that along.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak, although I was a bit shy at the start because I thought everyone would speak in Irish. I am ashamed given that Irish was part of my upbringing. I attended Ring College for a long time, yet I am not able to speak Irish as beautifully as others did this evening. I apologise for that.</P><Col N="55"/>
    <P>As a member of the forum and of this House, I will do everything possible to promote the Irish language. Gaelscoileanna are mushrooming throughout the country. We have the opportunity to put it right now. The reason it was not considered before was that it was difficult to find jobs which used the Irish language. French was a better language to learn. However, if Irish is recognised as an official language, it will have a big impact on the economy. It will also allow us to identify with our culture. That is why we should endorse the use of Irish as an official language. We have the opportunity to do that now.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to speak this evening in English, but I hope I will have another opportunity to express my views in Irish when I am fluent. I support the joint motion.</P>

    <P>I join those Senators whose Irish did not match the beautifully spoken Irish I heard tonight from many Senators. N&iacute;l s&iacute; agam &oacute;n gcliabh&aacute;n, mar a deirtear, ach cos&uacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Michael Kitt, is as Gaillimh m&eacute; agus nuair a bh&iacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Murch&uacute; agus Baill eile bh&iacute; s&eacute; go h&aacute;lainn. I will continue as B&eacute;arla, but, like Senator Ormonde, that does not lessen my interest in the language or in this debate. Perhaps it is time for people like me to go back to Connemara, which I plan to do. This debate highlights the need for all of us to continue to improve our Irish.</P>
    <P>The debate was a good one, as are all debates on important issues in this House. I am always privileged to be here. I listened carefully to the points made and I will do my utmost to clarify the Government's position. Some questions were raised which I will try to address.</P>
    <P>I confirm to the House that it remains the Government's policy to monitor developments with a view to availing itself of any appropriate opportunity which may arise to enhance the status of Irish in the European Union. The Government is committed to continuing with this policy. To that end. there are ongoing discussions between my Department and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. We are analysing all the options available to us and, in pursuit of that, we will enter into further discussions at an early date.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about the background to this debate. Many Members and those who are here to listen to the debate are aware of the history behind this issue. The status of Irish in the <Col N="56"/>European Union was determined by a letter of 23 July 1971 from the then Minister for Foreign Affairs to the President of the European Council outlining the Government's views and by the Community's response to that letter, which is reflected in the accession treaty. The draft constitutional treaty under consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference would fully maintain that position. The position is that the Irish language has the status of a treaty language in the European Union. That derives from the fact that the treaties are published in Irish and that in the treaties Irish is listed as one of the languages in which the text is authentic. Each successive treaty is published in Irish as well as in the 11 other languages, with the texts in Irish having equivalent authenticity and status with those in all other languages.</P>
    <P>Article 217 of the EC treaty provides for the establishment of the Union's language regime. The Article stipulates that:</P>
    <P LI="1">The rules governing the languages of the Institutions of the Community shall, without prejudice to the provisions contained in the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, be determined by the Council acting unanimously.</P>
    <P FLI="0">On the basis of this Article, Regulation 1-1958 establishes the official and working languages of the Union, which do not include Irish. The status of the Irish language in the EU is unique. It is not one of the 11 official and working languages of the institutions. However, the provision made for the publication of the treaties in an authentic Irish language version confers a particular Union status which sets Irish apart from, for example, Luxembourgish, which has no Union status. The IGC discussions on the draft treaty, and the discussions at the Convention which preceded the IGC, were not an appropriate forum for debate on enhancing the status of Irish. The &ldquo;working languages&rdquo; regime of the EU is dealt with in secondary law, in this case through Council Regulation 1-1958. The IGC discussions concern treaty change which is a matter of primary legislation. Nevertheless, the treaty status of the Irish language and the rights established in the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice respectively, will be fully maintained in the new treaty. The Treaty of <?_ch?>Amsterdam confirmed the right of citizens of the Union to correspond with any of the institutions in any of the treaty languages. A declaration adopted in conjunction with the Treaty of Nice calls for a response to any such correspondence to be made within a reasonable period. These steps represented positive and practical moves forward for Irish which is the only language, apart from those specified in Council Regulation 1-1958, to which these rights apply.</P>
    <P>In 2002 the European Commission recommended in the enlargement negotiations that each of the national languages of the ten accession countries be made an official and working language. This was agreed in the accession negotiations. Consequently, with the accession of <Col N="57"/>ten new member states, nine more languages will be recognised as official and working languages on 1 May 2004. The accession treaty 2003 includes a provision automatically modifying Council Regulation 1-1958. The Commission will not, therefore, ask the Council separately to amend the regulation. Any alteration in the official status of the Irish language, or any other language, other than the provisions resulting directly from the enlargement negotiations, would have to come about through an amendment to Regulation 1-1958 using the normal procedures provided in the EC treaty. This would include a Commission proposal to this effect, as several Senators said. Ireland has ratified the accession treaty, having deposited its instrument of ratification on 18 December 2003. Half of the instruments of ratification have already been deposited. The question of re-opening the terms of the accession treaty does not arise for Ireland or any other member state.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposal during the accession negotiations in May 2002, to recognise Maltese as an authentic language of the treaties and an official and working language used by the EU institutions has been the focus of recent attention and was mentioned here tonight. The Commission proposed this on the basis, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Maltese language is used by all Maltese institutions, including the parliament, the government and the courts, as well as for administrative purposes, and it is the mother tongue of almost all Maltese people.</P>
    <P>The detailed practical consequences of enlargement for the Union's interpretation regime for official negotiations concluded in December 2003 under the Italian Presidency. Member states considered many approaches for the conduct of future meetings in a Union of 25. An underlying theme of the discussions was that the Union needs to streamline its interpretation regime. However, there was an equally strong sense that the full participation of member states in running the Union, and taking decisions in which they are entitled to share, should be facilitated. The outcome of negotiations broadly preserved this important balance. On a separate issue, many of our partners regard member states, most of whose citizens have English as their spoken tongue, as distinctly privileged by the arrangements in place.</P>
    <P>The approach agreed by member states entails an increased number of working group meetings in Brussels taking place without any interpretation provision. In practice these groups, which will meet at official level, will work in English and French only. This new regime limits the number of working groups which will have full interpretation services and will put a system of payment for interpretation services in place for the remainder of working groups. This agreement, which has been finalised, is limited to existing official and working languages for which the personnel and infrastructure are in place.</P><Col N="58"/>
    <P>There have also been calls on the Government to request the Commission and the Council of Ministers to amend Regulation 1-1958 which establishes the official and working languages of the Union. The normal procedure for the amendment of secondary law, such as Regulation 1-1958, requires that any proposal for amendment must be made by the Commission. In other words, for the status of Irish to be changed, the Commission would have to propose to the Council an appropriate amendment of the regulation and the Council would have to agree this unanimously. In making any proposal, the Commission could be expected to draw on the considerations it has applied in the past and the member states would expect a consistent approach.</P>
    <P>The Government has consistently taken any appropriate opportunity to enhance the standing of Irish in the European Union, and has achieved this in several respects, including the following: the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1996 confirmed the right of citizens of the Union to correspond with any of the institutions in any of the treaty languages; a declaration adopted in conjunction with the Treaty of Nice in 2001 calls for a response to any such correspondence to be made within a reasonable period; and the Irish representatives at the European Convention which negotiated the draft constitutional treaty ensured that these rights will be maintained. Furthermore, at our request, an Irish language version of the draft constitutional treaty agreed at the European Convention was also prepared. LINGUA, the Union's programme for the promotion of language teaching and learning, recognises the Irish language for its projects. Most recently, and this was mentioned this evening, the Government has taken steps to enhance the standing of the Irish language in the context of the reform of the staff regulations for EU officials. Under revised staff regulations due to be agreed shortly, and as a result of an Irish initiative a new requirement for officials to demonstrate before their first promotion the ability to work in a third language extends not only to official and working languages but also to Irish. In this regard, Irish is the only language that is not an official and working language which will be taken into account. This will mean that officials who reach the required standard in Irish can directly benefit in terms of promotional prospects.</P>
    <P>The Government remains fully willing to build on these advances and to take practical steps as appropriate. Further discussions between Departments will take place in this spirit and will result, I hope, in the identification of additional opportunities to enhance the status of Irish in the European Union. It could take some time to identify such steps and explore them with the EU institutions, although I wish to advance this as quickly as possible. I take careful note of the debate here but caution Senators that it is unrealistic to expect concrete outcomes during our Presidency. However, by setting realistic goals and demon<Col N="59"/>strating their practical purposes, we can make the most credible case for the enhancement of the status of the Irish language in the EU.</P>
    <P>Various Senators made very strong cases here tonight in beautiful Irish and I thank them for that. I have listened carefully to the points made which I will note to ensure that they are included in the discussions between my Department and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I thank the Senators for a very timely and useful debate. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo. Leir&iacute;onn s&eacute; an sp&eacute;is at&aacute; againn uile sa teanga.

Th&aacute;inig An Docht&uacute;ir P&aacute;draig Breand&aacute;n &Oacute; Laighin &oacute;s comhair an fhoraim agus thug s&eacute; tuarasc&aacute;il mhaith chuimsitheach d&uacute;inn. Is l&eacute;ir &oacute;n dtuarasc&aacute;il sin go ndearnadh an-bhot&uacute;n i 1972 nuair n&aacute;r chuir an t&iacute;r seo iarratas isteach go n-aithneofar &aacute;r dteanga oifigi&uacute;il mar theanga oibre oifigi&uacute;il don Chomhphobal. T&aacute; ruda&iacute; mar at&aacute; siad faoi l&aacute;thair agus caithfimid an bot&uacute;n sin a leigheas anois.</P>

Is &eacute; an tUachtar&aacute;ntacht sin an t-am is feili&uacute;na&iacute; le leas&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh go dt&iacute; go n-aithneofar an teanga mar theanga oibre oifigi&uacute;il. T&aacute; muid ag tabhairt isteach deicht dt&iacute;r nua san Aontas. Nuair a fh&eacute;achann duine ar na t&iacute;ortha nua sin, t&aacute; cuid acu an-mh&oacute;r le daonra&iacute; an-mh&oacute;ra agus t&aacute; cuid acu an-bheag, an M&aacute;lta mar shampla, ina bhfuil daonra 300,000. T&aacute; teanga an Mh&aacute;lta aitheanta mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il. N&iacute;l aon leithsc&eacute;al ag an Rialtas sa gceist seo agus is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil an chumhacht ag an Rialtas &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh m&aacute; t&aacute; an meon aige.</P>
    <P>We had an excellent and comprehensive debate on this matter in the Forum for Europe a fortnight ago. Nobody could fail to be impressed by the paper Dr. Breand&aacute;n &Oacute; Laighin put before the forum. He set out the arguments clearly, along with the background and the history, as the Minister did tonight. He also noted that this is a matter for national government, which depends on the Government's appetite to make it happen.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to make it happen. I do not think anyone would object. The Presidency of the EU is a marvellous opportunity. The Minister set out the procedures involved, regarding the Commission, the Council and so on, but in deference to our Presidency and to the fact that our language is left out, I could not see how there could be any objection from the EU.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the accession countries. The Estonian language will be recognised, as will Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Slovenian and Hungarian. The glaring omission is Irish. There will be 20 official working languages, the only exception being for Cyprus. <Col N="60"/>There is a very valid case for that since Greek is the official language of Cyprus, although the Turks control a large part of the island.</P>
    <P>Regarding population, Estonia, for example, has a population of 1.4 million while Ireland has almost four million. Slovenia has 1.9 million. Malta has a population of 380,000. The Minister notes that the Maltese language is the official language in reports on all state and semi-state operations in Malta. In Ireland, however, it is enshrined in our Constitution that Irish is the first official language. As has been said repeatedly on both sides of the House, and in the National Forum on Europe, language is central to our identity and we are extremely proud of it. Irish is on the march again, undergoing a complete rejuvenation. The number of gaelscoileanna has increased throughout the country. Just as all aspects of Irish culture are on the march again, the Irish language is making a decisive comeback. There is no excuse for not making it an official EU working language.</P>
    <P>As Irish is an official working language at the European Court of Justice, why can it not be accepted as such in the EU itself? As stated in Dr. Breand&aacute;n &Oacute; Laighin's excellent report, what is needed is a series of amendments. The Irish Government should immediately inform the EU Commission that it wishes to have Regulation 1 of Article 290 of the Treaty of Rome modified in order to have the Irish language recognised. The number of official languages must be increased from 20 to 21. That can be done by modifying the 1958 regulation, Articles 4 and 5. I am at a loss to know why this was not done in 1972 but there is no reason why it cannot be done during the Irish EU Presidency. I am somewhat taken aback at the statement by the Minister of State that he does not want to heighten our expectations, that it cannot be done during the EU Presidency. I have not heard any valid reason why it cannot. We have a Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs whose specific duty is to look after these areas, central to which is the welfare of the language. That Minister will be sitting as chairman of his particular Council of Ministers, and there is no reason why a motion should not be brought forward and adopted at an early stage. There will be no opposition from Europe and the Minister will have the eternal gratitude of all sides of the House, as well as that of the Irish language movement.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Higgins as ucht c&uacute;pla noim&eacute;id a thabhairt dom. T&aacute; n&aacute;ire orainn go l&eacute;ir nach mbaintear &uacute;s&aacute;id as an Ghaeilge n&iacute;os minice sa Teach seo agus sa D&aacute;il. In a way it is hypocritical of us all as parliamentarians in both Houses to ask for Irish to be recognised as an official language at European level, because we have made very little use of it. It was only at local level sna coist&iacute; gairmoideachais agus sna coist&iacute; condae i dT&iacute;r Chonaill, i nGaillimh, i Maigh Eo, i gCiarra&iacute;, san Mh&iacute; agus i bPort L&aacute;irge a &uacute;s&aacute;idtear &iacute;.</P><Col N="61"/>
    <P>Apart from that, we are making very little effort, and we are all to blame. There are several reasons Irish should be an official EU language. As Senator Higgins said, it is not today but long since that Irish should have been so established, if we were serious about it. Bh&iacute; an tAire &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v sa Teach seo sa bhfomhar agus th&oacute;g s&eacute; Bille tr&iacute; Ghaeilge amh&aacute;in. If the Minister was sincere in promoting Irish, he would have encouraged all of us to use the c&uacute;pla focal here and there in the discussion that took place. Were it not for TG4 and Radio na Gaeltachta, the Irish language would be dead and gone. Never mind Conradh na Gaeilge &mdash; its members have been purists regarding the language, which is why a great deal of damage has been done to it. People are afraid to use Irish because they are criticised for their grammar or word usage.</P>
    <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has now come on board. Despite the many requests that we in the Seanad have made to have this motion put before the House, we now have it as an all-party motion, which I welcome. It is to be put to the Government, which will have no option but to consider it.</P>
    <P>To justify this demand, we must make an effort to use Irish in the Chamber. Even if we were to conduct our business in Irish for only one day per month or year, we would make progress and possibly develop it from there. This is necessary and would add substance to the request in the motion before us by lending us credibility which the House will not be given unless Senators are heard to speak Irish.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bh&iacute; Seanad&oacute;ir P&oacute;l &Oacute; Foigh&iacute;l as iarthair na Gaillimhe ina bhall den Seanad, he insisted on speaking only Irish in the House to highlight the neglect of our language and that every vote be called in Irish. The translation facility under our desks was installed as a result of his endeavours. He also insisted on Galway County Council that everybody, regardless of whether one liked it, had to listen to him in Irish and if one wanted to understand him, one had to put on headphones and listen to the translation. If we had such determination and support for the Irish language in this and the other House, we could show much greater determination in getting Irish accepted as an official language of the European Union. Our credibility is at stake on this issue, which successive Governments have neglected since 1972.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm bheith sa Teach anocht mar Cheannaire an tSeanaid and I have the distinction and pleasure of speaking to this motion. The Seanad is particularly suited to an all-party motion such as this one. To give credit where it is due and without wishing to show any sense of animosity, having checked the records in the Seanad Office, I found that Senator &Oacute; <?_ch?>Murch&uacute; first raised this matter in the House during the previous session when it received enthusiastic support from all the Opposition parties. In turn, the Government parties enthusiastically support this motion presented during Fine Gael Private Members' time. The reason the House is <Col N="62"/>suited to a motion of this nature is that we can, in a spirit of consensus and by pulling together, debate an issue of major importance for this country.</P>
    <P>We need to ask who did what in 1971. It is rather like a Hercules Poirot mystery. My belief is that an insufficient number of people did anything on this issue. Lest anybody think I have been in the Houses for so long, I was not in public life at the time &mdash; bh&iacute; m&eacute; m&uacute;inteoir &mdash; and the decision in question and its significance passed me by. I believe that in the mel&eacute;e as we rushed towards accession and argued the merits of what we were giving and gaining from it, the important question of having Irish made an official working language &mdash; it is an official language &mdash; was abrogated.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. Not an issue of importance has been raised in this Chamber which he has not been prepared to come to the House to address when asked to do so. He has always given his best to debates. Senators will have noted from his contribution that the issue here is the use of Irish as a working language in the EU and this is what the motion is about.</P>
    <P>While we accept that what appeared initially to have been a blanket lack of coverage has been ameliorated in the meantime, progress has not been sufficient. We should adopt this issue as a totem for the next six months. While the issues raised in the other House are not our business, having begun the crusade in this House, the matter should be taken up by the D&aacute;il. The Forum on the Future of Europe gave us a lead and we have taken up the baton. It is now a matter for the other House to progress the matter.</P>
    <P>There appears to be considerable goodwill in Europe on this issue. Why should this not be the case? We have proven over the years that we are good Europeans. We have taken, but we have also given. Those who point to everything we have received from Europe overlook that we were essentially real Europeans in the fullest meaning of the term and that we participated in debates, assented to change and made our point of view known. Having attended meetings of the Council of Ministers for years, there is no doubt we exerted considerable influence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will be playing a significant role on this and other issues. The question is where do we go from here. I am sure the Minister of State will see fit to press this issue and I intend to clearly state the wish of the House to the Taoiseach at a meeting next week. I believe he will do us proud, as is already the case in other areas, by making progress on the motion.</P>
    <P>We should conduct some of our business in Irish. In case Senators think I was a poor student of Irish, I was awarded honours in leaving certificate Irish and first arts in Irish but I was never good at speaking it. I went on, however, to do other things, which is the reason I cannot address the House in Irish. Members have an opportunity <Col N="63"/>to enrol in an excellent service in the Houses to become adept again in the language. I have signed up for it as an indication of good faith.</P>
    <P>Although this issue may not be regarded as important in the labyrinth of power that is Europe, it is extremely important. The European project was founded on the basis of co-operation, ending warfare, ensuring countries would work together and giving big and small countries an equal voice. In meetings of the Council of Ministers I was always struck by the fact that I was as important as the Transport Minister of Germany or any other member state. Given that member states have an equal voice regardless of size, we should emphasise the importance of this issue. Now that we hold the Presidency, with member states flocking here rather than <i>vice versa</i>,we have an opportunity to do so as it gives added potency to the question, which we should use to the full.</P>
    <P>While former Senator P&oacute;l &Oacute; Foigh&iacute;l was an excellent public representative, I do not want to take a confrontational approach. Our aim is to ensure that Irish becomes an official working language of the European Union. I am pleased to have had an opportunity to have such a good debate on this issue, regardless of the language used by Senators. We do not have to argue we are better than others because we speak better Irish. Terrific Irish has been spoken tonight. It is terrible that I could understand everything Senators said and can read any magazine or paper in Irish, ach n&iacute;l m&eacute; in ann mor&aacute;n Gaeilge a labhairt. Although I can speak Irish at will, I do not want to show my inadequacies in it.</P>
    <P>This is a good start to what should be a good campaign. Having heard the views of the Forum on the Future of Europe on this issue, we have now had a debate in the Seanad. The question is where do we go from here. The Minister of State and I will discuss the issue with the Taoiseach and I hope the Minister of State and others will prevail upon Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la to hold a debate in the other House. The case has legitimacy but this would give it an added patina or varnish in that the two Houses of the Oireachtas would be of one mind on this important issue. We have put forward the project and now wish bua agus beannacht air.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the contributions. This has been an interesting debate which starts rather than stops here. I am not totally satisfied with the Minister of State's response but I understand that there must be a strategic element to this and to the approach taken. I still believe in the European project and, as citizens, we must believe in it and in our autonomy in the Council of Ministers where decisions are made. The Commission can bring this proposal forward to the Council of Ministers and it can be achieved.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there is a contradiction in regard to the necessity to have three languages to get promotion at European level. It is a contradiction to say that if one has Irish, one will get promotion because, in the first instance, Irish will not help one to get a job. It is like getting on the first team in Manchester United without being allowed to sign up with the club. It is an anomaly with which I have a problem.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a sense of purpose in this regard, there should be all-party support. I was a little disappointed when the Leader spoke about where this started out. I believe it started with the Irish language lobby groups.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the Irish language lobby groups which have been lobbying hard and have brought this issue to the fore and to the public's attention. That is not to undermine the work of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and his involvement in promoting the Irish language.</P>
    <P>There is an inextricable link between culture and economics. If we are to save the Irish language in the long term, there is no in point merely talking about it and coming into the House saying we are trying to learn the language, to get <Col N="65"/>involved and to promote the Irish language. This happens at grassroots level in homes and in national and secondary schools. However, there must be an economic carrot as well. That economic carrot should be that we are able to say to students at national and secondary school levels that they, like others, can get a job in Europe if they make an extra effort at Irish. We do not have an adequate percentage of the jobs in the EU as compared to other countries. We are being discriminated against.</P>
    <P>As has been said repeatedly tonight, Irish is recognised in the Constitution as our first language. We do not need to go to Europe and say this will cost the same as the translation service for French or German; we are not looking for every document and transcript to be translated into Irish. We are seeking recognition for the language and for Irish to be the second language on a job application for Brussels. That can be done tonight and we can move this forward. I am confident the Government will move this forward.</P>

   <Title>National Educational Welfare Board.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. I wish to refer to the new National Educational Welfare Board which I welcome. As the House is aware, the Educational Welfare Act 2000 became fully operational in July 2002. I understand a budget of &euro;5.4 million was allocated for 2003. My query relates to areas of concentrated disadvantage &mdash; for example, the RAPID areas &mdash; and to children at risk. It is important that children, who are not currently receiving an education, receive priority.</P>
    <P>I received word from the National Educational Welfare Board that six cities and 12 regional towns will shortly have an intensive service to work with schools and families to ensure children attend school regularly. I was disappointed that Tuam and Ballinasloe were not included in the initial phase. It is important these towns have a welfare service. We have come a long way since the time the garda&iacute; had a statutory role in rural <Col N="66"/>areas in looking after the welfare of children, particularly their attendance at school. Some cities had school attendance officers but those in rural areas were used to the garda&iacute; performing that role. Although the garda&iacute; have a voluntary role and there are many excellent <i>ad hoc</i> committees involving social workers, the juvenile liaison officer scheme and principal teachers, towns in the RAPID designation should benefit from this scheme.</P>
    <P>I understand up to 73 staff may be appointed and that there is a budget of &euro;5.7 million for 2004, which is not enough money. I do not know whether we know the real need for the service. That should be investigated first. Nine counties were not included in the scheme. It is important that the service is available to towns in the RAPID area. The Department has designated those areas. Up to now, it has designated some schools as disadvantaged. They have provided remedial teaching. I would like to see the report on early education completed by the Committee on Education and Science in the last Oireachtas. The rapporteurs were Deputy Richard Bruton and Senator Fintan Coogan. They recommended in particular that there be a very early point of contact with homes in the specific towns and cities designated. The example they gave was the public health nursing service, which obviously provided a service for newly born children. It is a very early point of contact for families and if that sort of service was available, it would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>Another proposal I could mention was that an individual education plan be made available for each child at a very early age. It is very important that there is early intervention. That is why I like the idea of the educational welfare service and the employment of educational welfare officers. The regions are very important in that regard. We must have the service in the regions. I understand there are five regions throughout the country. We are in the north west region and I presume we will have a service from Galway city. However, it is bluntly stated here that there will be no service in the towns of Tuam or Ballinasloe. I am interested in another sentence where the CEO states that the board will follow up urgent cases nationally where children are not receiving education. I would like to know how that will be done since I cannot see how a board will be able to do that nationally when we do not have the service in the towns I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Once again, I welcome the fact that I have had this opportunity to raise the issue and hope that we will very soon have those welfare officers available in all the various towns in the RAPID areas and the disadvantaged towns.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, to clarify the position regarding the appointment of educational welfare officers to the towns of Tuam and Ballinasloe in County Galway. The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents or guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For that purpose, educational welfare officers, or EWOs, are being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally.</P>
    <P>The board has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate services and educational welfare services and a management team of eight staff. To date, 53 educational welfare staff have been appointed. That includes 29 former school attendance officers who transferred to the board from the existing service. The board has recently advertised a competition to fill a further 15 vacancies which will bring the total staff complement to 84.</P>
    <P>At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas, including areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme and most at risk groups. Five regional teams have now been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and an educational welfare service is now available, for the first time, in the cities of Limerick, Galway and Kilkenny. Twelve towns with significant school-going populations, 11 of which are designated under the Government's RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. Those towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up urgent cases nationally, including in the towns of Tuam and Ballinasloe, where children are not currently receiving an education. Decisions regarding the assignment of staff to specific areas are a matter for the board, which is an independent statutory body. In 2004, the board will receive the first comprehensive data returns from schools and those will assist it in keeping the level of need for the new service in particular areas under review.</P>
    <P>The board has also moved to provide a service to families who decide to have their children edu<Col N="68"/>cated in places other than in recognised schools. A small number of people with the appropriate skills have been allocated to this work and assessments will commence shortly. The Department of Education and Science recently issued guidelines to assist the board in meeting its responsibilities in that area. An information leaflet and an application form are being prepared for issue to families who are educating their children at home.</P>
    <P>Work is also proceeding on the establishment of the register for 16 and 17 year olds who leave school to enter employment. The board is also ensuring that information concerning the Act and the work of the board generally is made available to schools, parents and others as soon as possible. An introductory letter was issued to all schools last March. Guidelines are being prepared for schools on the reporting of student absences and a protocol outlining the interaction between schools and educational welfare staff is being developed with the assistance of the school implementation group recently established by the board. That group provides for consultation and collaboration between the board and school managers, principals, teachers and parents.</P>
    <P>There is a range of schemes, initiatives and services dealing with educational disadvantage at both primary and post-primary level. Those include the school completion programme, the visiting teacher service for Travellers and the home-school-community liaison scheme. Each of those schemes contributes in a very positive way to promoting the education of children and young people. It is important that those schemes and the board co-operate with one another to ensure that there is a continuum of service to the child who may be at risk.</P>
    <P>In that context, and as provided for under section 10 of the Act, it has been arranged that the Department of Education and Science work with the board to ensure that any opportunities for integrated working between educational welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes, whose work involves an attendance element, are exploited to the maximum. The Department considers the implementation of protocols for such integrated working on attendance matters to be very important. When in place, those will assist the NEWB in carrying out its remit and ensure that all available existing resources are utilised to the optimum.</P>
    <P>The provision for the NEWB in 2004 is &euro;5.7 million. The provision has been determined in the light of developments to date, the overall resources available and the need to ensure a collaborative and co-operative approach by all involved in addressing issues of disadvantage. I trust this clarifies the position on this matter for the Senator and I thank him for raising this important and urgent issue.</P>
