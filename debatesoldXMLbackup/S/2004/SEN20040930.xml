	<P>I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to clarify the position on funding for child care services for Granard, Ardagh and Legan, County Longford.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bradford of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to respond urgently to the jobs crisis in Mitchelstown, County Cork, where there have been hundreds of job losses recently and where further redundancies have been announced.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, statements on the Report on Seanad Reform (resumed) to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business until 2 p.m, with the contributions of Senators not to exceed 15 minutes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We agree with the Order of Business today. It is important that as many voices as possible are heard on the major issue of Seanad reform. If this House can do one thing over the course of the four or five years that we have the privilege of serving as Members it is to commit to the process of Seanad reform. This is a cross-party matter. I commit myself and my party commits itself to the process.</P>
    <P>Later today the Taoiseach and the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will meet the political leadership of the DUP. It is a significant meeting and an historic one because it is the first time the DUP has met any <Col N="58"/>Government Ministers in Dublin to discuss political matters in Northern Ireland and the ongoing peace process. It is incumbent on all of us to wish those involved in the meeting well today.</P>
    <P>I join with Senators Ormonde and Maurice Hayes who asked yesterday for a debate on Northern Ireland at some stage over the next two weeks. The public needs to know what is happening. While we have confidence in our political leaders and in both Governments to work through all the remaining difficulties with the parties, the House would benefit from statements on Northern Ireland, particularly in light of today&rsquo;s meeting.</P>
    <P>I welcome that meeting and congratulate those behind the initiative to set it up. Nothing is more important to the people of this country, North and South, and on these islands than to resolve the outstanding difficulties in the peace process and to remove the barriers to making the restoration of the institutions and the executive in Northern Ireland a reality. I wish those involved in the talks today well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the issues we have discussed over the past two years about the House can be brought together in the debate on Seanad reform and it is crucially important that people express their views at this time.</P>
    <P>There is another issue I would like the Leader to consider. We have talked before about consultation and last night when we discussed services for people with disabilities I raised the issue. Prior to the Second Stage debate on the Disability Bill we should give ourselves enough time for formal consultation with interest groups to enable Members on both sides of the House to hear what is happening in this area. The Government consulted these people at length and the legislation grew out of that process. It would be useful to ask them what they think of the legislation and what issues arise from it. This would inform both sides of the House, regardless of party affiliations. It need not happen in the Chamber but we should set up a formal meeting to hear these people&rsquo;s views and Members can then decide whether to take them on board.</P>
    <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business Senator Ulick Burke raised a question about public private partnerships, citing significant figures from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report. These must be of concern to everybody. I am completely committed to the concept of public private partnerships and fought hard to get the trade union movement to support them. This is completely different in Ireland from anywhere else in Europe.</P>
    <P>Later in the debate Senator Scanlon spoke about the satisfaction of clients with these partnerships, namely, schools, parents, teachers and so on. This issue deserves consideration. If the scheme runs over budget but provides a good service does the Comptroller and Auditor General take account of the fact that schools are built two years earlier than projected, that there is no <Col N="59"/>cost for maintenance for 20 years and that the level of support is better than ever before? Does he quantify these factors? If not, Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s comments are crucial and we need assurance that we are getting value for money although that does not detract from the importance of the principle of public private partnerships. I have raised this matter with the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and he has agreed to put it on the committee&rsquo;s agenda. It is important that people contribute to that discussion.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Aer Lingus Act 2004 there was much discussion of its impact on the public. A number of speakers on the Government side referred to the position of the chief executive, Ms Margaret Sweeney. I do not know this woman and I have no brief on her behalf. However, there are serious questions to be asked. We legislated for this matter and, from what I can see, Ms Sweeney is doing an excellent job and has stood up to people, where necessary. What is the Government&rsquo;s position on this issue? I would like a clear indication on how we reached the current position where the recently appointed chief executive of a State company does not know where she stands. By common consent, this woman is doing a very good job and has shown extraordinary courage in standing up to some of the bullies in the industry, with some of whom the Leader will be familiar.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the ongoing debate on Seanad reform. Everyone is aware that the House and its Members have a serious responsibility in terms of the consideration of such reform. We are all committed to it. This is an important debate and I commend the Leader on the commitment she has shown in this area.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party, I welcome the Reverend Ian Paisley and the DUP delegation to Dublin for what is an historic day. Many of us would never have believed it possible for this to happen, particularly in the context of what we hope will be an historic breakthrough. All our best wishes go to the delegation and to everybody involved in the talks which will hopefully lead to the progress we all want to see in Northern Ireland. I wish the new Minister for Foreign Affairs well in that regard.</P>
    <P>On the subject of new Ministers, the appointment of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, to the Department of Health and Children is generating a certain fear and trepidation in some parts of the country. I refer, in particular, to the areas in which are situated the 26 hospitals earmarked for downgrading in the Hanly report. I listened carefully to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s remarks from the D&aacute;il yesterday, as played on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; earlier, and I welcome what appears to be her very open attitude to the concepts of equality of access, quality health care and very high standards of delivery. We all want to see these being put in place. However, there is a genuine fear abroad <Col N="60"/>regarding what the implementation, in its entirety, of the Hanly report will mean and questions remain as to whether it is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s intention to implement it in full.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to come before the House at the earliest opportunity to outline, as broadly and in as much detail as possible, her intentions regarding health policy? I and many others have open minds in respect of those intentions and I look forward to hearing them. I assure her that the communities to which I refer will continue to fight hard for local access to quality acute care.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to echo the remarks of Senators Brian Hayes and O&rsquo;Meara regarding the historic events taking place today. I welcome the fact that representatives of the Democratic Unionist Party are coming to Dublin to meet the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Taoiseach and others. I hope this will lead to progress. I accept that progress was made at the meeting at Leeds Castle and it is hoped that we will reach the point where devolved government can be restored to Northern Ireland and arms will be permanently taken out of use. I know everyone involved will make a genuine effort. It would be useful if we were to review progress on the entire peace process and not just today&rsquo;s meeting. Perhaps the Leader could organise a debate on that matter in the next week or so in order that we can discuss the issues involved. Senators Maurice Hayes and Mansergh made similar points yesterday.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge the changes that have taken place in Government and to wish the members of the new Cabinet well in their onerous responsibilities. It would be particularly appropriate for the House to mark the elevation of the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin to a senior Cabinet position, particularly in light of the fact that her brother is a sitting Senator and that her father was a very distinguished Member of the House for many years. I also wish to express my good wishes to Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, my constituency colleague, on becoming a Minister of State and to the others who have become Ministers.</P>
    <P>It would also be appropriate to recognise the work done by the outgoing members of the Cabinet&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We could have a debate on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly Deputies McCreevy, Joe Walsh and Brendan Smith. The economy was in very safe hands during Deputy McCreevy&rsquo;s term of office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>So that is why the Government is getting rid of him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dardis, without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="61"/>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It was quite noticeable that the Leader of the Opposition in the D&aacute;il&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;unlike many Opposition Members in this House, recognised the fact that the country is going well and stated he hopes he can make it go better. At least he accepted that.</P>
    <P>I wish to particularly single out the work done by the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, during the long period he spent in that office. He protected the farming, agriculture and food industries in this country in a very effective manner for a long period. That Ireland remained free of foot and mouth disease had a great deal to do with his actions. In addition, he conducted the CAP reform and WTO talks extremely well and we owe him a significant debt of gratitude.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>My final point relates to the T&aacute;naiste becoming Minister for Health and Children. She has always shown herself to be available and I am sure that in this instance she will be only too happy to come before the House to explain her policies in detail. We will try to arrange this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be remiss of me to allow the day to pass without complimenting the Taoiseach on his activities yesterday, particularly as, for the first time in his term of office, he admitted the complete failure of the Government to deliver on the promises made in the run-up to the most recent general election. There was great evidence of the latter yesterday when he sacked those in his team who were not performing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator cannot have it both ways.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon, without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately 3,000 crimes are committed in this country each day and many of them are not being investigated because the morale of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is at an all-time low. The Taoiseach did not take decisive action yesterday in respect of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has presided over these developments.</P>
    <P>The structures for the new Health Service Executive were put in place before the Minister,  Deputy Martin, moved from the Department of Health and Children. It is important that these structures should be the subject of a debate because one bureaucratic system is replacing another and I do not see where savings will be <Col N="62"/>made on behalf of the taxpayer or from where funding will be diverted to avert the chaos and crisis in the health service. I call for a debate on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the national drugs strategy? The Minister of State with responsibility in the area, Deputy Noel Ahern, has advertised for submissions from the public in respect of this matter because the problem is actually getting worse, not just in Dublin, but in other parts of the country, despite the provision of major resources. It would be timely for the House to debate this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are reports this morning that the Ombudsman is seeking to extend her powers in a Bill being drawn up by the Department of Finance. I would appreciate it if the Leader would outline the Government&rsquo;s view on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The peace process is about inclusion and that means including the DUP as much as Sinn F&eacute;in. Today&rsquo;s meeting is very important. If things go right in the next few weeks we might even be in a position to move beyond the peace process and achieve successful implementation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate our first woman Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very important step forward. We all know women have played a significant, if often not particularly recognised, part in farming over many years.</P>
    <P>I also congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on her appointment as Minister for Health and Children. If any fear and trembling is to be done it might be in the Irish Hospital Consultants Association. In her previous incarnation, she has shown an ability to take on the insurance industry and to improve performance. It would be very welcome if her reforming edge takes on some of the vested interests in the health sector.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier in the year I raised the issue of some unscrupulous people erecting posters claiming they could cure cancer for a sum of money. Some local authorities prosecuted them under the Litter Pollution Act. However, far greater penalties should be imposed on such people. It has recently come to my notice that newspapers have carried advertisements since June claiming to cure cancer and various other ailments. Surely the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland should take action over these newspaper advertisements. I am more interested in having laws to prevent such people from profiting from the misery and suffering of others. The relevant Minister, possibly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, should examine this matter. If laws are not already in place they should be introduced to deal with such <Col N="63"/>unscrupulous people. Nothing is worse than people profiting from the misery of others. I ask the Leader to act on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate that I too should join in welcoming the visit of my friends and neighbours in the DUP to Dublin. These are people I have met and with whom I have done business over the years. They are formidable people and represent a formidable body of opinion. I thoroughly concur with Senator Mansergh about the importance of inclusiveness. I am encouraged by the atmosphere in which the meeting will take place. It is an indication of normalisation and how far we have moved away from overt conflict when people are prepared to come here and meet.</P>
    <P>Like other Members I would welcome a debate on health and not only because we have a new Minister, whom I congratulate. I read the proposals for new health areas. An area from Thurles to Buncrana and from Loop Head to Bloody Foreland does not make much administrative sense and perhaps we should reconsider that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>While Senator O&rsquo;Meara encourages me, I was slightly irritated to hear even her refer to the downgrading of hospitals.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>It is contained in the health reforms.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity that we use that sort of shorthand. It is appropriate for hospitals to give up some surgical interventions so they are better able to look after chronic diseases and diseases of the aged &mdash; a subject which interests me more every morning when I look in the mirror.</P>
    <P>I wish to reassure any members of the farming community who might be surprised or concerned about having a woman Minister. Members of the Ulster Farmers Union would say they had their best Minister ever when Br&iacute;d Rodgers held that post.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole in what he said regarding my comments yesterday on the overrun of costs of projects in education. I welcome the fact that five projects have come off that long list. However, I am concerned that because it was a pilot scheme, the new Minister is bound to review this particular public private partnership scheme, which will inevitably cause delay for many projects already on stream. I wish the Minister Deputy Hanafin success in her new portfolio.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to request the new Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to come to the House as quickly as possible in view of the escalating costs of energy across the board, particularly electricity. The ESB has a virtual monopoly and it is blatantly <Col N="64"/>preventing others from producing alternative energy from renewable sources by not allowing them access to the national grid. The Minister should intervene quickly to free up the production area.</P>
    <P>Many individuals and community groups have spent considerable resources in providing plans for the production of electricity from alternative sources but the ESB is not allowing access. The ESB receives subsidies which are not available to other potential producers. The ESB claims other producers are too expensive while blatantly ignoring that it is subsidised. The new Minister should revisit this matter and open up the whole area of energy production and its cost.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a broad debate during this term under the general heading of international terrorism. During our break events at Beslan in Ossetia shocked us all. Perhaps the Leader might write a letter of support from this House to the Russian ambassador. These terrible events were probably unique. In the past, the face of evil has tried to hide itself. However, this was the first time terrorists prepared to murder innocent children were shown on prime time television, which shocked us as it shocked the world. Here as in Europe we are looking for an age of enlightenment involving tolerance for different views while holding our own views dear and getting on with living with others. It is very difficult to reconcile this with people who it seems have not even reached the age of reason. The Russian authorities must maintain the rule of law and the rule of international law. They face challenging times.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I read with great interest the tourist figures that have been bandied about for the past month. I am somewhat confused as all tourist operators as well as those involved in hotels, pubs and bed and breakfast accommodation have told me that the tourist figures are down. Who collates these figures? Are they independent? Is every Ryanair and Aer Lingus passenger deemed to be a tourist? Fewer tourists are coming to the country than two years ago and tourism is unbalanced. The area around Dublin and the east coast is getting the lion&rsquo;s share of tourists. Further west and on the west coast there are significant difficulties. What criteria are used to collate these figures? Are they independent? We must ensure that is the case.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the remarks of Senator Cummins on a matter I raised previously in the House. Clearly a legislative void needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In the course of the local elections campaign, I met a lady whose husband was &ldquo;treated&rdquo; by some of the people in question. If we are talking about the same people, I understand that some of them have been struck off the register. However, they are allowed to practise alternative medicine because of the existing situation. Dick Turpin was <Col N="65"/>a decent man &mdash; at least he wore a mask &mdash; but these people are outrageous. The tale the lady told me about her dear departed husband would make a good storyline in a horror film. It is outrageous. They should be put out of business as soon as possible. It is terrible that the only rap they have been given so far is a litter fine. It is outrageous.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senators Cummins and Glynn regarding the issue they raised. It is unspeakable that people can get away with claiming in an advertisement that they can cure such critical illnesses as cancers and strokes. When I listened to a radio programme during the week, I heard the story of a person who lost a loved one to cancer approximately two years ago. The person, who was rational and logical, said that in the height of their desperation and sorrow they would have been tempted to contact these people to try to avail of the hope which was being offered. It is unforgivable that the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland only has guidelines which are not necessarily cast in stone. This matter needs to be debated and examined with a view to introducing punishments for those who claim to offer cures for illnesses such as those I have mentioned and who take advantage of people when they are at their most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Deputies who were promoted yesterday and are now Ministers and Ministers of State. I pay tribute to my constituency colleague, the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh. I made my views known around the time of his announcement. He will be remembered for his skilful negotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy. The manner in which he defended this country against the blight of foot and mouth disease was very skilful. Ireland would have suffered a massive disaster if that had not been the case. I estimate that he was appointed to the Cabinet on four occasions between 1992 and June 2002. He spent five years as a Minister of State. It is a major tribute to anyone to have been a Member of the House for 27 years and to have spent almost 15 years as a Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the new Minister for Transport as soon as possible. I recognise that he has been given a complex brief and that it will take him some time to read himself into certain important matters. However, as I outlined yesterday, there are particular difficulties in the mid-west in respect of Aer Lingus and the new airport authority. We should widen the discussion to include the rail strategy, especially as the second Luas line has come on stream in recent days. I would like an update in the House about the activities of the working group on the western rail corridor and the state of that project. The outgoing Minister was supportive of the rail spur to Shannon Airport. He was in the final throes of announcing <Col N="66"/>funding for that project. I would like progress to be made in that regard as quickly as possible. A debate would be welcome.</P>
    <P>I wish the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, well. I hope he has an enjoyable time in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. We worked quite well with him in this House. He was supportive of us on many occasions. I wish those Ministers who are retiring well, particularly the former Minister for the mid-west, Deputy Michael Smith, who gave tremendous service to the region and the country. I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The end of the tourism season is an opportune time to discuss the tourism industry. We might differ about the number of visitors and other issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not differ about the jewel in the crown.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not differ about Killarney &mdash; we have never done so &mdash; or about the national parks in County Donegal and the Burren. Some administrative changes have been made in the promotion of the tourism business, especially in respect of the various regions. As the heat is off, the tourism season has finished and plans have been made for next year, this an opportune time to ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to clarify the areas which are under his responsibility. There is some overlapping at present in that regard.</P>
    <P>I join other Senators in congratulating the newly appointed Ministers and Ministers of State, particularly Deputy Killeen, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, who was reappointed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s remarks about Seanad reform. We have managed the reform process on a cross-party basis and I hope it continues that way. I hope there will be a fine debate here today and that everybody will wish to speak. Today is the second day of the debate, but I do not know if it will continue into a third day. We will endeavour to prolong the debate because I understand that some Senators who wish to speak cannot be present today, for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes also discussed today&rsquo;s meeting of representatives of the Government and Dr. Ian Paisley. It is quite amazing that we are debating Dr. Paisley&rsquo;s arrival in Dublin today in such an open, frank and welcoming manner in one of the legislative Chambers of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Given that snowballs were thrown at a previous Head of Government almost 40 years ago, today&rsquo;s meeting is a welcome step on a long odyssey which has involved journeys between North and South. I thank Senator Hayes for raising the matter, as others did. We should formally welcome the DUP leader and his delegation to Dublin today and wish the talks well. The historic nature of this fundamental step will become clear only with a little hindsight. We discussed yesterday the need for a debate on Northern Ireland. I hope it can be arranged within two weeks.</P>
    <P>Many Senators called for Ministers to come to the House to discuss various issues. With the agreement of the Cathaoirleach and other Senators, I propose to have a rolling debate with the new Ministers in the House. I will endeavour to arrange for a Minister to come to the House each week to lay out his or her stall. It would be good for Ministers to have to read themselves into their briefs precisely and quickly and to outline their priorities for the next two or three years. Such debates would give Ministers a platform, lead to good discussions and give Ministers a clear thrust as they go about their duties. I will endeavour to arrange such debates, but I do not know if they can start next week because the business for then has almost been formulated. I will start today to make moves to arrange the debates. I think they would be useful for the House, the Ministers and the country.</P>
    <P>I share Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s thoughts on disability, which I have discussed with the Deputy Leader, Senator Dardis. The Government has a significant disability agenda, involving the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 and the Disability Bill 2004. The Seanad reform report recommends that the House should meet all the interested parties here &mdash; I do not know if that could be cleared &mdash; or in another room as part of a formal consultative process. I know the interested parties <Col N="68"/>were formally consulted before the Bill was formulated, but the Seanad reform sub-committee heard that people would also like to engage in a consultative process about legislation before it is discussed by Senators. Perhaps such a discussion could become combative &mdash; I do not know &mdash; but Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s idea is a fine one and we will endeavour to see how we can proceed with it. Such a process would be suited to the Bills in question.</P>
    <P>Regarding a debate on public private partnerships, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, and perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, or the new Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, would be very interested in having one here. Perhaps it would be a good topic for Private Members&rsquo; business, but that is a matter for other parties; we have had ours.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to someone whose name I will not say, but we know whom he meant and the CEO of Aer Rianta. In the debate in this House, I spoke very strongly, saying that I could not understand the punitive nature of a clause in that Bill which specifically marked her out for demolition. I had never seen the like in any Bill or legislation before, despite my long experience. I had never seen such a determined, pointed assault on a specific position or person. I will endeavour to find out what the situation is, but yesterday I got the records and looked at what I said. I see that Senator Daly remembers it too. It was most remarkable. She is a very fine woman.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Meara for the Labour Party&rsquo;s warm welcome to Dr. Paisley and for raising the historic nature of what is happening. I will ask my friend and colleague, Senator Dardis, to exert some of his considerable influence over the T&aacute;naiste so that she might be our first guest in the House in this roll-out of policies and public submissions on health policy. Senator Dardis requested a debate on Northern Ireland issues, including Dr. Paisley&rsquo;s visit. There was also the matter of the new Cabinet. In particular, the Senator spoke of Commissioner McCreevy and former Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, with whom I know he has very strong lines of communication.</P>
    <P>Today is Senator Bannon&rsquo;s day as we will have the new garda&iacute; about whom he has spoken here and for whom he has toiled. The extra garda&iacute; will be brought into play on a rolling basis. The Senator also spoke about crime and the health services.</P>
    <P>Senator Brady called for what would be a very useful mid-term debate on the drugs strategy. The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, is seeking submissions, and we in this House could provide one. Senator Coghlan raised the powers of the Ombudsman. I do not know if she is seeking to have her powers extended, but I will endeavour to find out for him.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh mentioned the peace process and the fact that we now have our first <Col N="69"/>woman Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan. It is quite startling. In Northern Ireland, there was also a very fine woman Minister. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, will be excellent in her position. When Senator O&rsquo;Meara spoke, she said that there was considerable alarm, fear and trembling among health practitioners and so on regarding the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. Senator Mansergh spoke about the IHC. I know from the 12 weeks in which I was in the Department of Health and Children as Minister that trepidation would be very good for them; I would prescribe it in large doses.</P>

    <P>Senator Cummins raised a serious and startling issue. I met a woman whose husband had been taken in by one of the posters on the road to Waterford, which I myself saw, which proclaimed that the advertiser could cure cancer. Imagine putting that up on a poster in a field. Senator McCarthy raised the issue of advertising standards, saying that they need to be more specific, and I will come to that.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes welcomed his friends and neighbours, who are extremely formidable. He is formidable himself. He also spoke of the extensive health areas which must be dealt with and age-related diseases. I share his thoughts on that matter.</P>

	<P>No, the Leader is far too young.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is kind to say so.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke mentioned the pilot schemes, the public private partnerships and the Minister responsible for energy. There is a need for a debate on that matter. The issue of access to the grid does not seem to have developed at all and there is no more freedom. Senator Hanafin mentioned international terrorism. The mind goes off an issue very quickly. We were all horrified at that awful event in Beslan. Imagine children of that age suffering in that way. The Senator is seeking a debate on international terrorism and we will endeavour to arrange it.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan raised tourism numbers. Every hotel, guesthouse, shop and facility is saying that its visitor numbers are down, yet we keep reading that they are up. I am indebted to Senator Mansergh for pointing out that the CSO <Col N="70"/>collects tourism figures, so they should be objective. However, a different methodology may be used. Does everyone on a Ryanair or Aer Lingus flight constitute a tourist, although they may only have been shopping in London or have attended a match? The Minister does not need to read himself into this brief, as he is already immersed. We will endeavour to get him as quickly as possible. I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn spoke about alternative medicine. There is both proper and pseudo-alternative medicine. The people to whom he refers and the type of medicine they are parading are preying on people when they are extremely low and would grasp at any straw for comfort.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy welcomed the new Ministers and Ministers of State. The former Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, comes from the Senator&rsquo;s area, and he has long collaborated with him. Advertising standards are loose rather than precise in their application. The latter is necessary to counter the torment of the advertising referred to by Senator McCarthy and others.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooley welcomed the new Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and had great praise for his predecessor. He would like the Minister to come here to discuss the rail strategy, the western rail corridor, the Shannon rail spur and various issues which affect the mid-west. Senator Daly also mentioned tourism policy, very generously paying tribute to his two colleagues, the two Clare Ministers.</P>

   <Title>Report on Seanad Reform: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, and congratulate him on surviving yesterday, which was an important stage for everyone. I also thank him for his work on the labour portfolio. I am not sure if the Minister of State still has it, but his accessibility and flexibility in dealing with labour issues over the past two years have been very much appreciated in trade union circles.</P>
    <P>On the business of Seanad reform, there are as many views as there are Members in the House. However, this is my starting point. The structure of the Seanad today is undemocratic, unrepresentative and anachronistic, and I do not exclude myself in any way from that assessment. It is undemocratic because it does not treat people equally within a democracy. Regarding my own situation, certain third level graduates have votes in the Seanad while others do not. That must be undemocratic. The fact that 43 Members of the House are elected by elected local authority members raises a significant question in terms of democracy. I do not object to the principle as I cannot accept the argument that it is undemocratic for local authority members to elect the tier above them. However, if it is the only way to so <Col N="71"/>elect people, the question of it being undemocratic arises. The structure is anachronistic because it is out of time. It does not fit with the ebb and flow of a modern democracy. It needs to be changed and we have the opportunity to change it.</P>
    <P>In trying to make this topical, I want to put in context two of the less discussed aspects of what is proposed. The report presents a compromise position. On the Order of Business this morning I raised the consultation issue. In the New Zealand Parliament, after Second Stage and before Committee Stage of a Bill, the Members factor in a formal consultation process through committee. A consultative committee meets people who wish to have an input, comment on, suggest modifications or make proposals regarding the Bill. The committee listens and arrives at a conclusion.</P>
    <P>At the next stage of the debate, the Members of the House have before them a sort of two-sided document, like the Irish Constitution with the Irish version on one side and the English on the other, except that in this case the original Bill is on one side while the other shows the Bill with the changes which the committee asks the House to consider. The changes are not made at that stage but are put before the Members. When the Bill arrives at Committee Stage it contains that additional information for all the people.</P>
    <P>That is something we could carefully consider in this House. It would make us better informed, but crucially, it would create connectivity with people on the ground. It would give people a direct and real input into the legislative process which does not diminish in any way the responsibilities, rights and duties of legislators. It would also bring about involvement in democracy which is very much to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>This process should be structured into the Seanad. I suggested this morning that we might apply it, for example, to the Disability Bill. The consultation took place before the Bill, the Bill was then presented and it is now published. I disagree with those who say the Bill should have been cleared by the consultation group afterwards. That is not how government works. It is the Government&rsquo;s duty to bring forward a Bill. It brought the Bill forward to Members of the Seanad and it is now our duty to consult further. We should take the time to talk to these groups and ask them how disappointed or happy they are with the Bill, what good aspects they see in it and what they want to see changed. Nobody expects consensus on these issues but we could at least listen and inform ourselves, and then bring forward proposals on that basis for the Government to listen to again. It might not accept the proposals but that is democracy. It is another issue. It is not about taking the power away from us but about ensuring that we channel it in the proper direction.</P>
    <P>The report also proposes the scrutiny of public appointments. As politicians we all get very frustrated when, very often, a person appointed by <Col N="72"/>Government to a senior position is seen to be appointed merely because he or she is a friend or supporter of that Government and voted for it. That can often be grossly unfair to the people involved. It generally is unfair because nowadays people cannot risk that inference. I have no doubt, however, that being on the right side of the party line is of great help in these situations.</P>
    <P>We need a system which neither includes nor excludes party affiliations or people with certain political views. I do not support the system in the United States which involves lengthy intensive scrutiny of people appointed to senior positions. Such people have to go through a committee structure. It is a tortuous way of questioning. If someone is found to have slept in the wrong bed 20 years previously, that person might be considered inappropriate for a job in a legislative capacity, though there is no connection, and the story still makes the headlines.</P>
    <P>The Seanad could be an appropriate House in which to form a committee to approve people being proposed for important public appointments. The point would not be to suggest the best person, second-guess an appointments procedure or go through the skeletons in anyone&rsquo;s wardrobe. The committee would simply look at the matter, check that the person meets all the essential and desirable criteria and say if the person is fit for the job, or that it has no opposition to that person being appointed. It would be a default method rather than an appointment procedure. It would therefore take away from Government any hint of political favouritism in job appointments. I am not talking of board members but of people appointed to paid positions, as boards are dealt with in a different way. This matter could be handled effectively and efficiently by this House.</P>
    <P>Regarding the franchise, three consistent threads emerged from all the presentations made, as anyone could see if he or she took the trouble to read through them or sit in on some of the presentations. There was no appetite for the abolition of the Seanad. The matter was open to discussion by all and there was no such proposal. It is also crucial, and an aspect to be noted by the Lower House, that there was no appetite for creating a sort of second D&aacute;il in the Seanad, or a House which would be in conflict with the D&aacute;il. People accepted the argument that the sort of gridlock which can arise in Washington, Rome and sometimes in Paris is not what we want. I support that view.</P>
    <P>The will of the people should be articulated in the first place, and with greatest clarity, in the Lower House. Our job as Senators is modification, information and building on what is discussed there. The Upper House should never be able to pervert the will of the people as articulated and decided in the Lower House. That is not what it is about. There has been no proposal to increase the powers of the Seanad to check the D&aacute;il, though it is proposed to increase the Seanad&rsquo;s functions and influence.</P><Col N="73"/>
    <P>What emerged from the presentations was that people wanted the Seanad to remain and did not want it to have greater powers. I have been a Senator for some 18 years and I oppose those who seek greater powers for the Seanad. The Seanad needs some sort of Question Time whereby we can put a question to a Minister. It also needs more topicality but these issues can be addressed. We do not need greater powers to put us on a par with the D&aacute;il. All of this emerged in the presentations and there was no threat in them.</P>
    <P>The strongest issue to come through related to franchise. Some 95% of the presentations referred to increasing, expanding and extending the current franchise. Currently, if one removes the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Seanad nominees, 49 Senators remain. Of these, 43 are elected by local authorities and county councils and in some cases urban councils, while six Senators are elected by some university graduates. Regarding my own constituency, it was felt that it was quite unacceptable that only the graduates of certain universities would have a vote in electing people to the university panel. Up to 97% of those who made presentations on that point took that position. Only one or two posed questions about it. For 16 years I have pushed the idea of extending the franchise to every graduate of a third level college, which is the way it should be.</P>
    <P>The position is similar in regard to county councils, an issue on which there was a major row and a long debate. I know Members on both sides of the House have felt threatened by proposals for this kind of change, as I feel threatened by the possibility of a further 150,000 people joining my constituency. However, the case made most strongly was that the vote should be taken away from local authority members who should not have this power and that a second Chamber should be elected by the people in a format different to the D&aacute;il. I have considered the workings of second chambers around the world and think the idea of local authority members electing representatives to a tier above them is quite acceptable and what I would describe as a distillation or refinement of democracy. The people at ground level elect others to a local level and there is nothing wrong with local representatives electing people to a further tier above. Nonetheless, I accept the argument that for them to have the significant preponderance they currently have is impossible to justify. Therefore, we need to increase the franchise.</P>
    <P>This increase can be achieved by reducing the number of representatives elected by the local authority members or by increasing the number of seats so additional representatives would be elected by the people in a new way. Effectively, the suggestion has been a combination of these options. The proposal is for a slightly enlarged Seanad but I suggest it should be slightly larger again. It is important for local authority members to have their votes, which they value, and important that we recognise their value to <Col N="74"/>Members of this House, although they do not vote for me and I have no vested interest in this, as the House is aware. Nonetheless, I would protect the rights of local authority members and it is important we enshrine their importance in the structures of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>There is clear need for representatives to be elected by ordinary people. This must happen and was of greatest importance to those who made representations on this issue. There are various means by which it can occur, including various types of geographically-based constituencies, national list systems and otherwise. As I do not have time to consider all the options for implementation, I will discuss the principle. Some Members will be elected by local authorities and some by ordinary voters. Every third level graduate should have a vote on the University Panel and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees system should be extended to allow him or her to nominate further Members, for example, Members representing both sides of the political spectrum in Northern Ireland and representing the emigrant community. We could not reach agreement on the election of such Members and, therefore, the only way this can be achieved is through appointment by the Taoiseach, which is how we left the matter. The nominating bodies wanted to have more of a say and we should give them this.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach of the Seanad should not have to face re-election and should be returned by acclaim not by vote. If he or she is to do an impartial job in the course of his or her period of office, it is unfair for that person to suffer the pressure of having to seek votes from those who may have been rapped on the knuckles on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>We must make changes. The report is a starting point in this regard and we should do our best to make progress.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and wish him every success in his new role at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am glad to have the opportunity to make some points on Seanad reform. I made a submission on the issue and congratulate the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which presided over the process. It went through a sizeable number of submissions and produced a very good report with which I almost fully agree.</P>
    <P>Two problems are highlighted in the report, namely, that the Seanad has no distinctive role in the Irish political system and that its arcane and outdated system of nomination and election diminishes Senators&rsquo; public legitimacy. I do not fully agree with these conclusions and feel the problems should be redefined. I accept there is a public legitimacy issue. Despite this being perhaps the 12th instance of Seanad reform, nothing has happened. Therefore, I question whether the reform process has legitimacy and whether we will achieve something on this occasion following <Col N="75"/>hundreds of submissions from many quarters. I hope we do.</P>
    <P>When we focused on the issue of public legitimacy in the past, we focused completely on the electoral system. I find this offensive. Is it to suggest that we have no public legitimacy because the electoral system for the Seanad produces not good but substandard representatives? This is not the case. While I accept there is a view that universal franchise may be the way to go for the future, it does not need to happen. The system whereby 43 Members are directly elected by county councillors, borough councillors and outgoing Oireachtas Members is a good one which has served us well.</P>
    <P>The list system, as proposed, would be completely undemocractic. A Member of the House said privately to me that Members voting for this would feel like turkeys voting for Christmas, as I would. Who would draw up the list? I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that the University Panel should be extended to include all third level graduates. This may open an argument for all tradespeople, for example, to have representation in the House because they have qualifications and careers. Should this also be considered?</P>
    <P>When considering public legitimacy, the focus should not be on the electoral system. The process can be tweaked if necessary. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 nominations are a good idea and I support using some of the nominations to include representaion for the North of Ireland, emigrants and other sectors. However, to have real public legitimacy the process needs to be relevant to the people. We have universal franchise in the context of the European elections but if the local elections were not held on the same day the turnout would be poor. The difficulty still exists that the public does not engage with Europe despite voting for representatives. Why, therefore, do we think that universal franchise will give Members more credibility with the public?</P>
    <P>We need to make the Seanad more relevant to the people and can do this with the kind of functional reforms proposed. We should have a greater role regarding public scrutiny, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, and European legislation. If the House considered legislation at draft and proposal stage, it would give legitimacy not only to the European Parliament but would enhance our position in the public eye. It might also get a few members of the media to sit in the Seanad&rsquo;s press gallery. I have been a Member of the House for two years but only saw journalists in the gallery on one occasion, when it was full for the debate on freedom of information, which was of great interest to the media. Other than that, the Seanad gets very poor coverage. If we debated European legislation at draft stage, it would be very beneficial to the House. All too often motorway construction is stopped because of legislation emanating directly from Europe. One example of this was when a variety of snail was found that could not exist anywhere else on the planet. Such legis<Col N="76"/>lation should be scrutinised through the committee system. However, when it comes to EU scrutiny in the committees, what happens is that huge documents arrive on the morning of the meeting and although it is agreed that they should be further scrutinised, they are adopted. We, in this House, could carry out that function. It would be very meaningful and would give us public legitimacy. The media would have no choice but to cover it and, in turn, the public would see exactly what is going on here.</P>
    <P>If the Seanad was to receive adequate coverage in the media &mdash; I do not say this from an egotistical standpoint &mdash; and the public could see what goes on here, it would give the House more legitimacy. People would see the level of debate and scrutiny not only of legislation, but many other issues such as alcohol abuse and could see how legislation is changed as a result of good debate on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>It would also be a good development if the Cathaoirleach were elected automatically, as is the Ceann Comhairle in the other House. The number of nominating bodies should be reduced because there is much duplication with particular sectors having multiple bodies with multiple nominations. A scenario that develops at elections, which is not particularly fair, relates to inside and outside panels where somebody may have a certain number of votes but because a particular sub-panel is already full, a candidate with half the vote may take the seat. That is not addressed. I am not sure that is equitable and it should be examined.</P>
    <P>I would be opposed to the introduction of a list system as it is undemocratic. I am fully in favour of the maintenance of the local authority franchise because it has served us well in the past. In the search for enhanced public legitimacy, the electoral system is not where the focus should be. It should be on the functions. Engaging in debate on public policy and EU affairs, particularly EU legislation, would greatly enhance our position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on surviving the axe yesterday, although it turned out to be a fairly blunt instrument as nobody was sacked &mdash; we had a couple of resignations. I wish the Minister of State well with his portfolio.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report on Seanad reform. I compliment the sub-committee and the secretariat on their work and all the individuals and bodies who made submissions on the subject, which I read with interest. While they differed in many areas, what came through forcibly was the need for reform in terms of the functions of the Seanad and the electoral system. Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, and it should be emphasised, that nobody suggested the Seanad should be abolished. It was also agreed by everybody that the Seanad should not be in conflict with the D&aacute;il and should not be a second D&aacute;il <i>per se</i>.</P>
    <P>The vocational panel system has served this House well in the past. Scrapping it would be a <Col N="77"/>retrograde step. Some of the nominating bodies are outdated. There are probably too many of them. Some of them show very little interest in the process. However, other nominating bodies take their responsibilities very seriously and view their function as an important part of the electoral process and as an important part of the their duties under the Constitution. My nominating body, the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations made a very good submission on Seanad reform. I would have grave reservations about depriving nominating bodies who are active and informative of a say in the electoral process as they have carried out their duties in an exemplary and fitting manner as envisaged under the Constitution. I certainly agree that the system should be reformed, but scrapping the input of such bodies would not be fair or equitable.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the direct election of a number of Senators to a national constituency by the people, whether under a PR list system or otherwise. I agree with Senator MacSharry that a list system may not be as democratic as people would wish. It is suggested that we should move away from the political system and towards a system of people representing various bodies. However, under a list system it will be down to the political parties, probably not even local representatives in many instances, but people in headquarters in political parties to put people on lists. I do not view that as being very democratic, but I would agree that some Senators should be elected by the people to a national constituency. It would make the Seanad a more meaningful and relevant body in the eyes of the people and it is also very important that the people should see the Seanad as a very democratic body.</P>
    <P>That the role of county councillors in elections has been recognised is welcome as they also view their role very seriously. The proposal that the Seanad be renewed on a rolling basis over a five year term in the interests of continuity is a sensible one. I have not heard anybody speak against a rolling system with elections every two and a half years.</P>
    <P>The Seanad should at all times avail of the experience and expertise of former officeholders in Government and the suggestion that former taoisigh and t&aacute;naist&iacute; should have the right to attend and speak in the House is a good one. Providing Irish MEPs with a domestic forum in which to discuss EU issues and give an account of the work they do is another sensible suggestion that would add to the effectiveness of the Seanad. In the past year or so several MEPs have come here to speak on European issues and have been very effective, and they welcomed the opportunity to do so. That practice should be encouraged and expanded on and I agree with the sub-committee&rsquo;s remarks in that regard.</P>
    <P>The recommendation that a formal system of consultation should be put in place in the Seanad to allow for consultation with interested groups and individuals early in the legislative process is <Col N="78"/>one of the most important recommendations in the report. This has been alluded to already by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. It is imperative for the House to know, well in advance, even in terms of its current operation, what Bills will come before it. I accept that this must be within reason as emergency Bills must be introduced from time to time. Knowing what Bills are to come before the House would afford Members a better opportunity to prepare and make more informed and considered contributions on proposed legislation. This is why one of the report&rsquo;s key recommendations is for more public consultation at an early stage in the legislative process.</P>
    <P>Having the Seanad assume the function of principal policy reviewer in the Oireachtas is an interesting recommendation. However, it may put this House in conflict with the Lower House. I may be incorrect in my interpretation of this recommendation but I would not wish it to happen. Another interesting recommendation is for the Seanad to be assigned responsibility for the scrutiny of senior public appointments, similar to the system used in the US. I welcome the clarification given by Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the sub-committee&rsquo;s interpretation of this issue.</P>
    <P>The report is a challenging one with recommendations that will, in some instances, require constitutional change. This should not prevent setting the wheels in motion for change. One recommendation is that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominations to the Seanad should include various interest groups such as emigrant groups. However, there is already a proposal with the Taoiseach from Senator Higgins on this issue. He has stated that he is prepared to step down if someone from the emigrant community takes his Seanad seat. If the Taoiseach is serious about Seanad reform, he should respond quickly to this matter by stating there will be no opposition to Senator Higgins&rsquo;s proposal and that the Government parties will not take his Seanad seat if he decides to resign. A representative from the emigrant community should be co-opted in his place.</P>
    <P>I welcome this exciting and challenging report. Whether the changes will proceed at this stage is in the lap of the gods. Nothing has happened despite several previous reports on Seanad reform. I hope that some of the challenging proposals of the sub-committee will be acted upon and make this House more meaningful and relevant to Irish life.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and his officials to the House and also take the opportunity to congratulate him on his promotion. There have been some excellent contributions from Members on this issue. I compliment those Members of the sub-committee who listened and read in detail the many submissions made by numerous bodies on Seanad reform.</P>
    <P>Time spent discussing Seanad reform is worthwhile. However, how the Seanad has worked up to now must be taken into account before a large <Col N="79"/>number of changes are made. The old saying comes to mind of why fix something when it is not broken. While times change, I agree with the principles of the nominating and electing bodies of the Seanad, particularly with the election of 43 Members by public representatives. It is important as every public representative, particularly every local authority member, represents a number of voters. Each one expresses his or her own views when electing Members to Seanad &Eacute;ireann. When &Eacute;amon de Valera established the Seanad, he assumed that each public representative represented approximately 1,000 people. Electing Members with interests in different spheres to the various vocational panels ensures a broad view of society.</P>
    <P>The number of Members must be expanded &mdash; by how many is for others to decide. Traditionally, three Members are elected from the National University of Ireland and the University of Dublin. However, with the numerous changes in the educational system that have occurred, the universities deserve extra representation. With the changes between North and South, representatives from Northern Ireland should also be included in Seanad membership. This can be done by increasing the Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 nominations, allowing for three representatives from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>From my experience as a Senator, another area for change is in D&aacute;il and Seanad sittings and their overlapping with the committee system. Reforms for streamlining Seanad &Eacute;ireann must take this into account. Up to half the number of Members can be tied up in Oireachtas committees, preventing them from making a proper contribution to the Seanad. One proposal that should be examined is having the Houses sit for three weeks out four, with the fourth week given over to committee sittings. This would make for a better committee system and, particularly, use of Seanad time.</P>
    <P>Those allowed to address the House should also be reviewed. Over the past 12 months a number of MEPs have addressed the Seanad. This step in the right direction should be expanded upon to allow Senators the opportunity to meet and question MEPs on EU legislation.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Sometimes the House sits for two days in one week and three days in another, depending on the pressure of legislation coming from Government. If Members of the European Parliament or other such people addressed the House occasionally, we could move towards a four-day sitting week. This could happen if we examined a change in the committee system and the proposal that the Seanad sit for three weeks out of four.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is an ideal Chamber for hearing the views of the party leaders from Northern Ireland. We should give them that opportunity; this may not require major reform. If the opportunity were afforded to the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland to address this <Col N="80"/>Chamber we would gain a better view of their thinking and they would get a better view of the thinking of the Members of this House. Senators from the northern part of our country have made a valuable contribution to the Seanad. However, they were nominated by the Taoiseach of the day. If successive taoisigh had not made those appointments, we would not have had the opportunity of listening to their views.</P>
    <P>I was appointed to the Seanad by the Taoiseach on this occasion but I was elected to the previous Seanad, having been nominated by one of the nominating bodies. I have a strong view on the manner of nominating candidates to the Seanad. Some nominating bodies are very active and made excellent contributions to the review while others did not think it worth their while to do so. Irrespective of whether a candidate is nominated by the Oireachtas or by a nominating body, the election should be held on a first-past-the-post basis. Seats should not be reserved for Oireachtas nominees or for the nominees of outside bodies. Candidates go before public representatives for election and they decide. It should not make a difference whether a candidate is nominated to a panel by Members of the Oireachtas or by a nominating body.</P>
    <P>Public representatives are strongly of the view that some of the large town councils should be included in the election process. Some of the larger town councils deal with budgets which are on a par with some of the smaller county councils. This proposal should also be examined.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Seanad should attend Cabinet meetings. Every day on the Order of Business the Leader is asked pertinent and important questions. The Leader should have the opportunity to attend Cabinet meetings so as to be able to reply to Senators who put questions on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach should be automatically re-appointed to a new Seanad as the Ceann Comhairle is re-appointed to the D&aacute;il. The Cathaoirleach must hold an independent position and he or she should be automatically re-elected.</P>
    <P>I commend the people who spent considerable time last summer listening to the submissions made by so many bodies and individuals. I listened to many of the contributions, particularly those made by party leaders, who made excellent contributions. Seanad &Eacute;ireann may not require major changes but we must continually review it and consider the need for change. We should expand our electorate to ensure that the interests of other organisations and individuals are represented in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and I thank the Ministers of State and their officials for coming to the House. There have been reports on Seanad reform in the past and nothing has come of them. The Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, and the committee have put considerable effort into the production of this document. I hope this report will not gather dust but will lead to reform and improvement and that the proposals of Members <Col N="81"/>on Seanad reform will be accepted. The final say will be with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Taoiseach and the Government. However, I hope the report will be examined quickly and decisions taken within a specified time limit. This matter should not drag on longer than six or 12 months. Reforms should be in position before the next election.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I could shorten my contribution by saying I agree with almost everything Senator Moylan has said. His suggestions all seem to be eminently practical and sensible and would help the working of the Seanad. It has been an honour and a pleasure for me to be a Member of the Seanad and to have been the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee on two occasions. That could be taken as an argument for continuing the practice but could equally be taken as an argument against it.</P>
    <P>What added value does the Seanad give? We should be prepared to face the awful prospect of asking what it would be like if there was no Seanad. Would matters be any worse? I happen to believe they would but it is a case to be made. The case is that we are a revising Chamber, that we can have more thematic and reasoned debates than the other House, that the atmosphere is not as adversarial and that business can be done. However, I often wonder if that is enough for the general public. We must show that we are in some way different from the other House and not just a pale replica thereof.</P>
    <P>It might be cruel to say it but sometimes the Seanad reminds me of the old county junior football teams. They were full of last year&rsquo;s minors trying to get back up and last year&rsquo;s seniors on their way down. We should not be afraid to open the doors and bring in a new culture and a new part of the body politic. Part of being different from the other House is that we operate from a different constituency. Members of the Seanad should be elected from a different constituency. There would be little point in electing Senators from the same electorate and by the same method as Members of the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>The vocational base is important. It has been diluted to an extent by being politicised at that level. Whether it is possible to avoid that or whether it is desirable to do so is another issue. The link with the local authorities is important and I support Senator Moylan in that regard. In fact, I would go further. There is a tendency towards centralisation in local authorities also, with the units becoming bigger. The essence of the process is to try to press political participation down to the lowest units possible. I would include town commissioners, town committees and many other groups if a way could be found to define them and add them to the electoral college from which the Seanad is elected.</P>
    <P>In this day and age it would generally be regarded as anti-democratic to have university seats. We had this argument in Northern Ireland when four seats were allocated to Queen&rsquo;s Uni<Col N="82"/>versity. In the great rush to democratic change we got rid of them. The sad aspect of it was that we extinguished some of the only independent and interesting voices. The university centres over the years, without going into details or personalities, have produced a range of interesting, quirky and sparky people who have not only enlivened debate but have also given expression to views that might not have been voiced if they had not been there. I would retain that element but I would go further and extend it to all third level institutions.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I would extend it, as Senator Moylan suggested, to universities and third level institutions in Northern Ireland. That might be a way of providing for a wider representation of views from the North in this Chamber. The House could withstand a modest extension in numbers. The Senate should not get much bigger because there is an intimacy in the Chamber and in the nature of the debates which it is important to preserve. However, it could accommodate these other interests in some way.</P>
    <P>Then there are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, which I should be the last to decry. I am not doing so. However, the question is how to include people who are representative of the North. I am conscious of the fact that I do not represent anybody. I represent myself. I am not authorised to speak for anybody else. I have been around the North for a long time, I have listened to people and I live there so I can sometimes say things in the Seanad that might not be said if I had not been here. I am glad of the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>The only way I can envisage increasing Northern Ireland representation in the present form is by giving the Taoiseach two or three other slots to fill and by trying to fill them not just from one party or group, but from across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland. The idea that one could have an election for the Seanad in Northern Ireland is farfetched for ideological, practical and constitutional reasons. Equally, it is a little fanciful to talk about representation for the wider diaspora. It is proper that there should be people, and there are such people, in the Seanad who are aware of the problems of the diaspora and can reflect them. However, in giving constituencies to people how far does one go? Does one go to find people in Patagonia or the descendants of people from the midlands who went to Argentina and Australia? It is far too difficult and we should not go down that route.</P>
    <P>There is a group of people who are under represented in politics in this country and whose involvement is vital to the continuation of democracy. That group comprises young people. It is not just in Ireland that young people are turning away from politics. It is happening everywhere. Some are getting involved in street politics, some are involved in protests. By and large, politics and politicians are sliding down the scale of respect as far as they are concerned. It is important that we get them to engage again in politics. My radical suggestion is that a third or a quarter of the seats <Col N="83"/>should be reserved for people under 25 years of age. They should be elected. There is no reason the general electorate should not elect them. We have to find some means of engaging young people and that is perhaps one.</P>
    <P>Having discussed the composition of the Seanad, I will now discuss what the Seanad might do to make itself different. There is a revising role. There is also a role which I would describe as the pre-Green Paper stage of legislation. It is difficult to make substantial changes to legislation when one is confronted with a draft Bill. It is almost cast in concrete. One can tweak it here and there and make suggestions but the principles of it have already been embedded. It would be helpful if, when a Minister gets a gleam in his or her eye about some matter, that he or she says: &ldquo;We are going to have to legislate on this; here is the problem and here are the ways we are thinking of dealing with it.&rdquo; There could be a broad debate at that stage about the principles involved and the things that might be done. It would be extremely helpful to Ministers and to the people who will draft the subsequent Bill. The Seanad would be ideal in that regard.</P>
    <P>The other issue the Seanad could deal with is Europe. It was extremely interesting and useful to have not only speakers from other European member states come to the House, but also MEPs to discuss their experience in the European Parliament. This House could be a focus for debate, although not for scrutiny of European measures. An Oireachtas committee will carry out the scrutiny and it is a technical matter anyway. However, there could be debate of the broad issues of principle that arise in Europe. It would give us the opportunity to examine them before they become problems.</P>
    <P>We could also examine other big and broad problems that are not dealt with by separate Departments and seem to slip between the interstices of Government. An example is what the impact of global warming will be. What crops will be grown in 2050? What land will be habitable or uninhabitable? What lifestyle changes will we have to make? These are great thematic debates that are ready made for the Seanad. We could serve a purpose in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Seanad could be a point of contact for the North-South bodies. I was attracted to Senator Moylan&rsquo;s suggestion of Northern political leaders and representatives coming before the Seanad from time to time to lay out their wares and to be open to discussion. The Seanad could also be a focus for consideration of the reports of the Ombudsman. They seem to run into the sand at present even though they are full of case studies and information which could be used to improve administration and the responsiveness to the citizens.</P>
    <P>I have great belief in the Seanad. I have enjoyed the fellowship, warmth and contributions of all my colleagues. I believe we could make the Seanad a beacon of participatory Government <Col N="84"/>and I hope we do so. I hope also, like Senator Moylan, that we do so in time for these things to come into force at the next election, which may be in two years time. This allows sufficient time for consideration and to get these things moved on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this report and congratulate all those who had an input, the authors and those who made submissions. While it is an interesting debate, the question of reforming the Seanad is almost as old as the Seanad. We should not delude ourselves into believing there would be rejoicing on the streets and wild parties and celebration if, suddenly, the Government announced a changed system of election to the Seanad where there would be a universal franchise and where in the near future all citizens would have a vote to elect the Members of the Seanad. We must recognise there is a new reality in regard to the lack of connection between people and politics. We recognise that from the most recent general elections where we were lucky to get a little over 50% of the people to vote to elect the Government. I admit there was an improvement in the turnout at the recent local elections.</P>
    <P>The country is not very concerned about how Senators are elected. What concerns those interested in politics, sadly the diminishing number of people interested in politics, is how the Seanad and Senators do their work. It is not a question of a larger Seanad or a smaller Seanad but a better Seanad. That is the question we must pose, whether elected through the vocational system, the university system or direct nominations. The issue is how can we make the Seanad a more effective debating chamber and a forum where the daily concerns of the people are debated and deliberated upon. From the point of view of debate and considered analysis of legislation, the Seanad has always been most effective.</P>
    <P>Having served in both Houses, I make the point I have made previously in another place that there is much better debate and dialogue in the Seanad. It does not have the same political bite that, perhaps, the other House, believes it must have. The debates here are much calmer and, therefore, more effective. The question, therefore, is how the Seanad can be more effective.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of queries from constituents and friends about the Seanad are not about how one is elected to the Seanad but rather what the Seanad does. We must ensure our work is more strongly profiled and that our engagement with the people is stronger. If we were to proceed with a number of measures contained in the recommendations, our role would be strengthened in the eyes of the public.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to get into the issue of election to the Seanad as I do not think it will happen. In ten years time, if some future Government is debating Seanad reform, it will still debate how Senators are elected. Progress in that area will be <Col N="85"/>slow. In the short term there is much we can do and we can go forward in a positive fashion.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note the comments on EU affairs and the proposal that the Seanad should play a major role in debating European Union policy. Some Members, including Senator Ormonde, are members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. Others of us are unfortunate enough to be members of the EU scrutiny committee where, once a fortnight, we go through in a reasonably detailed way the huge number of proposals before the Commission in Brussels. We are charged with the responsibility of suggesting what documents should go for scrutiny to the various committees. It is not a high profile committee but it does much effective work. That type of work could be done here in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>As an aside, an issue we did not debate but observed at our EU scrutiny committee meeting this morning was a proposal, before the Commission in Brussels, on introducing and controlling licences for the felling of timber. One might ask what is the significance of that. It was pointed out to members of the committee by officials and through the documentation that it could result in a major increase in the price of timber here which would have a major knock-on effect on house building given that up to 30% of houses are built by timber frame construction methods. Relevant issues such as this often remain hidden. If the Seanad were to tackle those EU policy issues it would give the Seanad a meaningful role as far as the public is concerned.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed last year when we had dialogue with the then MEPs. Every MEP who addressed the Seanad and took questions learned from us and we from them. It may be too early to invite the new batch of MEPs to address the House but it should be done on a regular basis. This is an ideal forum for listening to our MEPs and debating the issues of the day with them. There is the possibility of extending such dialogue beyond MEPs to other distinguished persons who, from a policy perspective, would have something to add to Irish life.</P>
    <P>The proposal from the all-party group makes the observation that the Seanad should assume the role of principal policy reviewer in the Houses of the Oireachtas and mentions the possibility of debating medium-term economic and social planning, the performance of Departments, etc. I agree with that view. It is fair to observe, however, that as every Department has a committee of its own, there may not be the same scope for re-debating public policy, economic planning, performance of Departments as could have been the case five or ten years ago. I would expect that, say, the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food, would have a greater role in debating the work of that Department than would the Seanad. The Joint Committee on European Affairs probably has a more major role to play in examining the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs than would the Seanad. Nevertheless, it is a matter that should be kept in mind because these <Col N="86"/>issues are important. If we want to be viewed as relevant by the people, the question is not how we are elected but what we do once we are elected and the impact of our work on people&rsquo;s daily quality of life.</P>
    <P>The system of election to the Seanad is very different from that for the D&aacute;il. It has existed for a long time and may not be perfect, but it is difficult to improve it because we are not competing with another House. There is no point setting up 20 constituencies around the country to elect Senators. The Seanad is designed as a different Chamber from the D&aacute;il, to be elected in a different fashion and to do a different job. It might not be broken as badly as some might argue. We should not rush to fix something that might not be completely broken. For us to concentrate more closely on our role and exercise it better might not be a bad starting point. Taking on issues such as more detailed consideration of legislation, a stronger emphasis on EU policy and public policy would be effective.</P>
    <P>We have enough work to do here. Over the past five or six years the Seanad has met more often per year than the other House. The individual contribution of the average Senator is probably more substantive than that of the average backbench Deputy. I do not use the word average as a judgment of the quality of the speakers. We complain that we do not receive sufficient public profile and media attention, but we do not live in a perfect world and we must expect and accept that the other House will always be the focus of greater political attention.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some simple measures introduced such as allowing Ministers to come here to answer questions, be they oral or written. We are all Members of the Oireachtas, whether elected to the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, and should all be entitled to the same level of response from Ministers. This report provides the bones of proposals which can in some cases be introduced gradually to make the work of the House more effective. The document is a substantive response to the submissions from members of all parties in the House. However, I have been around long enough, and was fortunate to be a Member of the Seanad in the late 1980s, to expect no miracles in regard to the electoral system, but we can make genuine progress in the way we do our daily work.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has made a significant contribution to political life. Sometimes when we review our role as politicians, whether as Senators, Deputies or Ministers, we can be too critical. We should reflect on the development of the country in the past 50 or 60 years. It has matured politically, grown economically and loosened itself up socially. Many people have got it right including many Oireachtas Members and many of our institutions have not been too wrong. We could do with a little less self-flagellation. Everybody elected here under whatever system does his or her best and contributes to parliamentary democracy and to the life of the people. We would all <Col N="87"/>like to have a designated cine-channel that our constituents were forced to watch 24 hours a day, but that is not going to happen. We should try to get on with the job we are elected to do and expand our policy role a little more in so far as possible. The idea of changing the electoral system totally on the basis that the people would become highly excited at directly electing a portion of the Seanad might be a little unrealistic.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for listening to my meandering thoughts. My current tenure in the House reinforces what struck me during my first term here, namely, that the House and its Members do a good job on behalf of the people. In politics one can never expect the sort of recognition that one believes one deserves whether as an individual Member or as a member of a group. Since its inception this House has served the people well in a calm, considered fashion. We should approach change cautiously because the Seanad does not need too dramatic an overhaul.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well for the next two years in office. I agree with Senator Bradford that too drastic changes would be dangerous. This Chamber has served the public very well. This is my third term in the Seanad and my father and brother also served here. Over the years my family has made a significant contribution to this House and we acknowledge its worth and how it has worked. There are, however, areas in which it can improve. My submission to this report was divided into two areas &mdash; the composition and the function of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The composition is made up of 43 elected Members from the county and city councils, the university panel and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 nominees. To understand how we are elected one must consider the five vocational panels. We could look at how those panels operate. Perhaps they should be updated and the criteria for becoming a nominating panel reviewed and revisited. There could be a combination of those panels and I wonder what criteria are used to form a nominating body. I would have no difficulty with examining that aspect.</P>
    <P>In my submission I said there is ongoing confusion among the electorate, the county and city councillors, about the significance of and the advantage for a candidate of being on an inside or outside panel. When I canvass this becomes a problem and I have to explain that I am on an outside panel because I am nominated by a nominating body as opposed to the Oireachtas panel. The confusion arises on the question of whether one scores over the other. It is difficult to explain this to the electorate when canvassing. I would like that confusion to be tidied up. Perhaps there should be a better system in that regard. We should all be nominated through the nominating bodies of the Oireachtas or a nominating panel but not inside or outside which raises confusion <Col N="88"/>about the significance or advantages of one over the other.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the suggestion that there be new modes of electing Senators. We have a powerful democratic body of county and city councillors who know their jobs thoroughly. They were elected by the public and they know what is needed and have a good nose for who would do a good job in the Seanad among the 43 Members. There should be no dilution of the power bestowed upon county and city councillors who have done a good job since the foundation of the House.</P>
    <P>Councillors also have knowledge of the people being put forward. I was elected from the Cultural and Educational Panel and I outlined my views to each county and city councillor in order that they would know where my interests lie in terms of regional and national policies. I reflect the views of county councillors who bring problems to my attention. There is nothing more democratic than that. The system we have is democracy at its best and is working well. There should be no dilution of the power of county councillors to elect Senators.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should revisit the question of the composition of the panels. We could consider combining a number of panels. Although I am happy with the university bloc, the franchise could perhaps be extended to everyone with a third level qualification and should not be exclusive to graduates of Trinity. The franchise should be extended to every person who qualifies with a degree from a third level institution. I do not believe there would be a problem with doing this as there appears to be a universal consensus in respect of it.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nomination of a representative from the North of Ireland. However, I would not like too much representation from the North. We should have a united Ireland before the number of representatives from there is increased. When we have a united Ireland, representatives from the North can canvass for votes like the rest of us. I would not give them a hand out. I have no difficulty with there being a representative here but there should be no more than that. I would not be satisfied with a situation where there might be four or five representatives in the House from the North. When there is a united Ireland, I would support that notion but not before then.</P>
    <P>I would like to see changes as regards the functions of the Seanad. We have already begun the process of change. For example, much legislation has been initiated in the current Seanad and its predecessor. It has become a very effective Chamber in which to debate the Committee and Report Stages of Bills. I would like this to be enhanced.</P>
    <P>MEPs could play a role in the workings of the House. They might be given the right to attend the Seanad and make contributions but not to vote. That would create a link between the House and Europe.</P><Col N="89"/>
    <P>During the referendum on the Nice treaty, this Chamber was used quite regularly as a link with the public in terms of how to debate the issues which became controversial. That link must be enhanced. Members of the public still do not know enough about the Seanad. I am not saying there is hostility but there is an attitude of indifference to us. The media should give the Seanad a fair crack of the whip. The only coverage of our proceedings appears on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and even then only the Order of Business is shown. If Members do not utter catchy soundbites or say something controversial, they will not get any coverage at all. Everyone naturally uses soundbites but I would like to think that my contributions are more constructive than that. However, if I do not use soundbites, I will not be given a chance and the public will not know that I exist.</P>
    <P>The media should play a greater role in covering debates. Many good debates take place in this House in respect of various documents and reports that are published. We thrash out the issues but when one reads the newspaper the next day, one finds there is not one line of coverage. We have many fine speakers in the House who make substantial and constructive contributions but what they say is not covered by the media. We put a great amount of work into reflecting the views of members of the public and we spend much time reaching out to them. However, we need support from the media. Coverage of our proceedings is very poor.</P>
    <P>We are starting a new term and I call for increased coverage of what happens here. This will allow us to communicate with the members of the public and take on board their views in terms of our role in vetting European legislation and directives initiated in Brussels. We are obliged to scrutinise such instruments and decide whether they are important or relevant in terms of what happens in this country. We have a monitoring role in respect of all the legislation initiated in Europe and the Seanad should play a major role in terms of linking, via consultation with our MEPS, with Brussels. The links to which I refer must be further enhanced. If we get matters right in that regard, we can move forward in terms of linking with the public.</P>
    <P>The Seanad could also consult with lobby groups, particularly when legislation is being drafted. Let us consider, for example, the Disability Bill and the elements involved such as Comhairle, the strategy and the various areas of disability. There could be a consultation process within the Seanad in respect of such legislation in order to allow people to express their views. This would enable the proceedings of the Seanad to be opened up more to the public.</P>
    <P>As Senator Bradford stated, we are doing a very good job, we work extremely hard and we reflect people&rsquo;s views, be they national, regional or local in nature. The electorate keeps Members on their toes and it is seldom wrong in terms of deciding to put square pegs into round holes. <Col N="90"/>Regardless of the way in which we entered the Seanad, we are all playing a major role in its workings. I want us to do our best to enhance that role in order to serve the public. The Seanad must be used to initiate more legislation and its role in linking with the European Union and the committees must be enhanced. Other than that, all I can say is that if it is not broken do not fix it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important debate and I am delighted that so many Members want to contribute to it. I assume that it will run across a number of sitting days.</P>
    <P>The Seanad comes in for a certain amount of criticism from members of the public in terms of its relevance but the process we are undergoing is worthwhile. We need to raise people&rsquo;s awareness of the work done by the Seanad. How best we can do this in terms of making our work relevant is what this debate is about. There are a number of good proposals contained in the report and I wish to refer to some of them.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals in the report, to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred yesterday, is that there should be more widespread consultation with interested groups. The Disability Bill is a good example to take in terms of considering how we can move forward. There was much consultation with the various advocacy groups in respect of the Bill&rsquo;s preparation. However, it was not shown to those groups before it was published. It would be interesting for Members to hear from those groups and obtain their opinions on the contents of the Bill. I would welcome a system being put in place to allow a Second Stage debate on the contents of a Bill and then meet those groups to hear their opinions on how best to amend or improve the legislation. This would ensure that we pass the best legislation possible through consultation with the groups working on the ground, which we represent and whose members want the legislation to be user friendly and deliver the proper service. This would make our work more relevant and worthwhile.</P>
    <P>During the consultation process I said that I would like to see a Question Time in this House similar to the system in the D&aacute;il to allow us to raise issues on a daily basis with the relevant Ministers. This would be very helpful to Senators.</P>
    <P>To improve our profile it would be extremely helpful for this House to scrutinise draft EU legislation and EU legislation already implemented to determine how well it is working and whether Ireland is in compliance with all EU directives, etc. On many occasions the authorities in Europe have advised that we are not fully complying with such legislation. That duty would make our work very relevant. While the work at the moment is carried out in the committees, it could be done more fruitfully if such a structure were established here and provided time to prepare for and scrutinise the legislation.</P>
    <P>We are increasingly influenced by and interlinked with our European partners and this House could deal more fully with European <Col N="91"/>issues. Earlier this year we welcomed MEPs to address the House, which was very successful. Our MEPs should be statutorily obliged to come to the House at least on an annual basis to outline their work. This would give us an opportunity to put our views to them on how best we feel they could be working. We could question them and make other points that would be of value to the MEPs. This would also help to make us more relevant.</P>
    <P>To increase the profile of Members of this House and make us more relevant to the public we should be allowed to scrutinise Departments on their performances. This has come to light with the publication of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in recent days, which highlighted issues such as the problems with speed cameras. I was amazed to hear the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform say on radio that he did not know about those problems. If we had the opportunity to monitor how well a Department was doing it would make us very relevant in terms of keeping an eye on what is happening in various Departments, State agencies and semi-State companies. I would like to see the senior management teams appear before us so that we could question them on the progress or otherwise of their Departments.</P>
    <P>On the make up of the Seanad, I support the recommendation of the committee that we should have directly elected Senators. I believe it was proposed there should be 26 such Members &mdash; the number could be discussed more fully at a later date. We could be more relevant to the public if they were to elect some Senators, while still having local authority members and outgoing Deputies and Senators electing a large number of Senators. That must be retained. We have a very close link with the local authority members and now that Senators and Deputies can no longer be members of such authorities, retaining that link is vital.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider how emigrants can be represented here. As he is probably aware, Senator Higgins has proposed to the Taoiseach that in the event of his vacating his Seanad seat, he could be replaced by an emigrant. Emigrants have expressed interest in being represented here. We have had a very good debate on our emigrants abroad. Many of them had to leave and went all over the world, particularly to the UK. They helped to build roads, bridges and railways. In their later years they find themselves in pretty awful conditions. From the debate we had here it is clear the majority of Senators have a great empathy with them and would like to improve their lot. Having a representative here to keep their views on the agenda would be worthwhile and would be recognised by the public.</P>
    <P>As is the case with the D&aacute;il, considerably more television coverage of proceedings in the House should be broadcast. When I travel to the US I can see the local council proceedings on television and the same is true of their legislature. <Col N="92"/>This would make us more open and transparent to the public. While &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; has a considerable viewing public, it is mainly watched by those involved in politics. However, its biggest problem is that it is broadcast so late at night. Considerably more people would watch it if it were broadcast earlier in the evening. Television coverage should be broadcast during our proceedings, which would allow the public to know what we are doing by hearing the debates and help them to make up their minds as to how we perform.</P>

T&aacute;imid an-bhu&iacute;och ar fad de gach duine.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House. I congratulate him on his re-appointment and wish him well in the future. He has done a magnificent job in the past in a very challenging area. The concern and compassion he has shown to vulnerable people is something I like to see in public life. I wish him well in the future.</P>
    <P>I compliment those who put so much time and effort into making this transparent report available to the Seanad. It is obvious that many people engaged in the process. I accept that we have had discussions, debates and reports on Seanad reform in the past, but we have to start from the premise that it will be successful and effective on this occasion. I am sure most Senators have had a difficult time making contributions on this subject, for the simple reason that we probably have a vested interest in Seanad reform. It is possible that the implementation of the report, or part of its implementation, will impact on our electoral prospects in the future. It could also impact on our role and the perception of the Seanad and the part it plays in parliamentary democracy. Having said that, all Senators are clear in their desire to make a sincere contribution to this debate.</P>
    <P>A number of things have come across to me in a forceful manner during my time in the Seanad. There is quite a gap between perception and reality in the public view of the Seanad, but it is improving and it is possible that the reality is coming centre stage. I give credit to RTE, particularly &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, for that. When <Col N="93"/>debates are broadcast to the public, people can see the standard of debate in the House. It is evident that quite an amount of research is done by Senators, many of whom take independent views, irrespective of political affiliation. I do not mean to be derogatory when I say that personalities are not to the fore in our debates to the same extent as they are in the D&aacute;il. Senators tend to focus on the business in hand. We receive a fair degree of credit from the media and the public in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that few people suggested in their submissions that the Seanad should disappear from the parliamentary democratic process. It is good that people feel that the Seanad should be retained. It is also right that we should adopt an incisive approach to deciding what should and should not be changed. It is easy to make changes for the sake of change, but one often discovers afterwards that the devil one knew was better than the devil one did not know. I would like to put my remarks in context for that reason.</P>
    <P>I genuinely believe that the Seanad has served us well, although I accept that Senators have a vested interest in saying so. It is not a place where those who want to go to the D&aacute;il mark time, or a reward for others. There is great cut and thrust in the House from time to time. Many Senators are passionate and determined about the subjects discussed in the House. It would be wrong to categorise the House as a rest home.</P>
    <P>Many Bills &mdash; over 30 in one session &mdash; have been initiated in the House. They have been exceptionally well debated, as have the Bills which have come to the House from the D&aacute;il. Many amendments have originated in the House. Many Bills have been set aside or delayed as a result of something that has come forward in the Seanad. That has to be an important contribution.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the election of the Seanad has been the source of democratic weakness, an argument which is sometimes made by those who engage in the false characterisation of local authority members. I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s assertion that other assemblies use a particular stepping stone of election, which is exactly what happens in the case of the Seanad. Local authority members, who are elected following a severe process, face difficulties because they are at the coalface. When they come through that challenge, they have been filtered through an examinations system which is not found in any other electoral process. When local authority members vote in Seanad elections &mdash; I am not talking about the university elections &mdash; they participate in another system to elect us. They comprise our constituency and we are elected by the people through them. I would not like that to be tampered with in any major way.</P>
    <P>Those who have proposed a list system of election have not told us how such lists are put in place and have not outlined how such lists can be said to be transparent. They have not clarified the degree to which one might need to be in favour <Col N="94"/>to get on a list. I would be worried about such a system. We will not be made aware of its lack of transparency until it starts to operate. I do not think we should tamper with the other system. I agree that all third level institutions should be brought into the franchise for graduates &mdash; that is the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>I wish to consider the role the Seanad can play in the future. I would like to suggest a new role which would not require a change to the Constitution, but to Standing Orders. I have to be careful because the Leas-Chathaoirleach is familiar with the mechanisms which are used. On the Order of Business each morning, for example, one has to try to avoid the malign eye, if that is the case, of the Cathaoirleach. One has to get a benign eye if one wishes to sneak something in under the Order of Business. One has to be tight in one&rsquo;s contributions. There is a degree of panic, generally speaking, among those who fear that the Cathaoirleach will interrupt them. I propose that a couple of hours be set aside every day for dealing with day-to-day and urgent matters. We have dealt with issues such as Iraq, crises in the Third World and racist attacks on unfortunate immigrants when such issues needed to be dealt with urgently. The Seanad would be thanked if it had such a role.</P>
    <P>We know that sensitivity applies in many other areas. The Seanad could play a particularly effective and sensitive role in dealing with the Northern situation, for example. It is far better that we should talk to each other than at each other. There is a significant difference between the panic or sensational headlines in the media and the personal dialogue many Senators have with people of different traditions in the North from time to time. I had the pleasure of serving as chairman of a particular body of which the late Sir Robert Kidd was vice-chairman. Sir Robert was the chairman of the Northern Ireland civil service when the secretary was the famous Paddy &ldquo;Bogside&rdquo; Doherty. It was a rare mixture and yet we found that we could work together, respected each other and became great friends.</P>
    <P>Let us bring that to another stage, that of the legislative area. I do not mean tokenism but there should be people here, perhaps through the nominations of the Taoiseach. I do not think that it can be done in an electoral manner in the immediate future, since it will be difficult to achieve representation in a sensitive situation. However, I know that the different players would be particularly pleased to participate in a more subtle manner in providing people for this House. Consider the types of debates we have had. On the Order of Business this morning, we requested a debate on Northern Ireland because we felt that there had been a long vacuum and we were awaiting developments. Incidentally, it is great news that Dr. Ian Paisley and the DUP representatives are coming to Dublin. That is major progress, and we ignore how much has been made in the last 20 or 25 years. We could give substance to <Col N="95"/>that if we had people representing both traditions here with us.</P>
    <P>The other area I would like brought centre stage is that of Europe. The vast majority of people do not relate to it. I do not mean &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; as a continent, but the European institutions. Probably people relate far more to America or Britain. One reason is that we do not seem to have a continuous flow of information or interaction between us. I see no reason in the world that MEPs should not regularly attend not just to address us, as they have done, but to interact with us in debate. I know that we get all the documents passed on to us. However, as Senator MacSharry said this morning, how is one to read through those and how relevant are they?</P>
    <P>I see that I am getting a little nod. I may be being unfair to Senator Feeney, since I promised that I would share time with her. However, my first point is that there are many suggestions in that report on which we should act. Second, we should not do something because it is politically correct or might in some way satisfy the media. We should act as legislators of real conviction who want to get the best out of the current system. As I had already complimented the previous Minister of State, I would like to avail of the opportunity to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, and congratulate her most sincerely, wish her well for the future and thank her for all the good work she has done hitherto.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s finishing note, I too would like to congratulate the Minister of State on her re-appointment. It is great to see her back continuing the good work.</P>
    <P>I feel a little inadequate as a new Senator. I do not like to say &ldquo;young&rdquo;, since I am not that. I have been here only two years, but I am speaking about Seanad reform. I am still finding my way. There are still days when I come in and ask questions regarding what is going on and how the system works. However, I left it until quite late in the debate to contribute. I am giving myself a little tap on the back since I listened to the more experienced Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;. They have all voiced the same type of issues that I picked out of the report. I must be good &mdash; at least as good as them and I always have the height of respect and admiration for them.</P>
    <P>When it came to looking at the report, I took it away with me on holiday. I had one or two days in the sun and flicked through it, making little comments and annotating it. When I summed it all up, I thought to myself that it was a very good system. However, it occurred to me that I would say that, having been elected through it. If I may be very personal and honest, I would be afraid of how I might fare if the system were changed. I want to be back here after the next election.</P>
    <P>However, when I considered the system, it seemed to me that there was not a great deal wrong with it. It has served us well since 1937. It is a complicated system and I say that as someone <Col N="96"/>who has come through the election process to get into Seanad &Eacute;ireann. However, as a member of the public before my election, I never really understood the system, all the bodies, or the difference between the inside and outside panels. It was not really until I decided to run for Seanad &Eacute;ireann that I got my head around it. It seemed too complicated to waste time getting one&rsquo;s head around.</P>
    <P>I should have said at the outset that I thank and compliment the authors of the report, who are all our colleagues in this House. They put in a great deal of time. I believe that this time last year they gave over almost an entire month to it. I sat in on some of the deliberations, since my nominating body was very anxious to make its own submission, which it did. It is a complex system. The report, if implemented regarding getting people elected or appointed to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, will make it more complex.</P>
    <P>I am saddened that it would somewhat reduce the role of the councillor and create further centralisation of political power and influence. As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; pointed out, we should never underestimate the closeness of our county, city, town and urban councillors to our shared electorate. We should not deny them, with the dual mandate gone, the right to determine part of the membership of one House of the Oireachtas. I would hate to see the role of the county councillor diminished in that way.</P>
    <P>I am glad that others have raised the list system, since I was in two minds. As a young Senator, one wonders whether one is saying the right thing or will bring the wrath of the political powers down on top of one if one says that one disagrees with such a system. However, I do not agree with it, just as I do not agree with its use in those countries which have it. It would bring more cynicism into the political parties in both Houses. One would have 20 people going forward on a list, with the party deciding who were the best people. That is undemocratic and unfair. I would hate to see a list system come into play.</P>
    <P>I suppose that I am a little critical of the university system. Out of a small Chamber of 60 Members, it is a little selfish that six of them are from such panels, although I respect and admire the six colleagues here. It is a shame when third level education is so widespread and everyone has access to it. It is not only NUI but institutes of technology and whatever other third level institutions may come under that umbrella. I would keep the six seats, but we should widen the electoral base. On the question of outside and inside panels and whether seats should be reserved, it is grossly unfair and I have always thought so. I listened to the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s contribution earlier this morning, and I say this not because he said it, but the system should be first past the post. We all get into our cars and roam the country from morning to night. By the time one is in the fifth week, one is almost deranged. One lives on a bottle of water, an odd bar of chocolate and an apple. If people say <Col N="97"/>&ldquo;Hello&rdquo; and smile, one almost questions why they are smiling. Are they supporting someone else? It is a horrible system. For those who take it on, it should be a case of &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo; rather than the current system. I hope that area will be looked at and perhaps changed.</P>
    <P>Where can we improve? The system works very well. I would not like to see a radical overhaul but there are areas where it could be improved. When I was campaigning I talked about EU legislation. Whether we like it or admit it, many people continue to view EU legislation as foreign policy. This House has bright minds and intellects. If more complex EU issues were discussed in this House, and more television coverage were brought to people&rsquo;s homes at a reasonable hour, Seanad &Eacute;ireann would become more productive and more noticeable, and be perceived to be working better, but we would also be educating people who feel lost.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate her on a successful personal result yesterday. I look forward to working with her in the future.</P>
    <P>I will outline my own position regarding the Seanad. I did not originally have a clear view of what the Seanad or Senators do. Five years ago I was elected to Roscommon County Council and even then was not sure of the role or mandate of a councillor in the political process. I have learned a lot in the past few years.</P>
    <P>To be elected to a corporation, to a local or urban council, is a significant achievement. One has the trust of the people in one&rsquo;s ability, integrity and capabilities of delivering results. When elected, one is appointed to many different boards. At one stage I was chairperson of Roscommon VEC. I saw the complexities of the education system and how many education providers had a vocation or a commitment to ensuring the best possible education was provided to students. I was on the Roscommon County Enterprise Board and was also fortunate to work with volunteers committed to ensuring that any industry or local person starting out would be helped with expertise or employment grants which would foster the business and help it grow, so that employment would be created in the county.</P>
    <P>I also served on the Western Regional Authority, where I met many councillors from different political parties. There was a great way of working together on regional issues such as water quality, road and transport and rail freight. That was a major plus. I also worked with the adult education board and I pay tribute to the amount of energy it put into adult education. Although there are some issues in that area with which one might not be entirely happy, matters have improved in the past ten years. Adult education is an area to which we must give more resources.</P>
    <P>I was on other committees, including special policy committees of the county council and so on. One then wonders how a Senator can be a <Col N="98"/>county council member, sit on a VEC, a county enterprise or adult education board among many others, and then find time for the Seanad. It cannot be done. When I was elected to the Seanad I was fortunate that the county councillors around the country put their faith in me to represent in this forum their interests and those of the people. I was fortunate that one of the nominating bodies, the Irish Kidney Association, took the time to nominate me. I had an interest in its work and have worked closely with the association since my election to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I have some difficulty regarding the nominating bodies. Senators act as a conduit to all the nominating bodies in the country. If, for example, the Irish Kidney Association has difficulties it can use me, through my good offices, perhaps to contact the Minister for Health and Children to raise an issue, whether serious or sensitive. It is regrettable that some of the nominating bodies do not use this facility to the optimum.</P>
    <P>There are more than 1,000 county councillors in the country, many with far more expertise than I had. Some have 30 or 40 years&rsquo; experience and genuinely represent the grassroots. I spent two most enjoyable months travelling around the country. I was in every town and village and met many would-be Senators on the trail. It should almost be compulsory for any would-be elected representative to go around the country and meet people from the particular party. One gets a view of where the party is heading and what is happening in the political system, from independent councillors and even from councillors in opposing parties. We can bring out reports and set up think tanks but there is nothing to replace the bond or liaison created when one sits in a county councillor&rsquo;s kitchen for half an hour and explains why one is the best candidate. The councillors will tell one what is wrong with the party or with the political system.</P>
    <P>I am very keen to retain that system. For example, I raised certain issues with my party leader in Fine Gael. I realised, for example, that there was a strong republican tradition in Fine Gael which was still evident among the councillors. One does not realise such truths until one sits in someone&rsquo;s home. Any would-be Senator or Deputy should be sent around the country for two months in every five years, and meet the people who should make the decisions, the people who matter, namely, the councillors who represent the people.</P>
    <P>I suppose I should welcome the end of the dual mandate although I would prefer to be on the county council or the VEC. However, it is good legislation. I have more time to attend the House to deal with the issues I was elected to address. If I must deal with mental health legislation or legislation relevant to the health boards, I now have time to research and debate and to put across a measured argument. This was not previously possible as I was too busy attending meetings around the country. A great future for the Seanad is now possible because Members do not <Col N="99"/>have to sit on local boards but have the time and resources to make the House a meaningful forum. I am not saying it was not meaningful in the past. Debate in the House since the foundation of the State was of the highest quality. However, as Members had other interests, the people did not think the Seanad was as meaningful as it could be.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that more legislation is coming before the Seanad. The D&aacute;il cannot deal with the amount of legislation before it and it is welcome that this House can debate it in a more comfortable and measured environment. While party politics will always have its place here, it enters Seanad debate far less than D&aacute;il debate. The House is an ideal forum for debating legislation.</P>
    <P>There should be representation for emigrants. My uncle from the west recently told me that of his school class of the late 1940s, almost 95% emigrated. How could Ireland move on when the brightest, best and most liberal emigrated to London, New York, Sydney and elsewhere? We must have some link with the emigrant population. While they visited for Christmas or at other times, their views have never been articulated since they took the boat from this country. If they had been able to return in the 1960s, we would have had the Celtic tiger in the years following. We would not have had to suffer the continued blight of emigration and would have had a more enlightened, liberal and multicultural society if our emigrants had been allowed to participate in the democratic system.</P>
    <P>There should be much greater emigrant representation in the Seanad and perhaps in the D&aacute;il also. We are talking about the diaspora who we tend to forget, although we remember them on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day when we tell them what a great job they are doing. However, through the Internet many emigrants know much more about the legislative process in Ireland. They have a meaningful contribution to make to the Seanad and they should be represented.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion that the Taoiseach should nominate 12 Members, including two from each tradition in Northern Ireland. Today is significant in that two members of the Democratic Unionist Party are visiting to debate and open talks. I am not concerned with the content of the talks but it is monumental that they are taking place. Governments over the past 15 years have made a significant contribution in this regard by inviting a nominee from Northern Ireland. At present, Senator Maurice Hayes represents one tradition and the other tradition was also represented. This is welcome and should continue.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the suggestion that the Leader should be entitled to attend Cabinet meetings with the rank of Minister or Minister of State. We have much time for the current Leader who is doing an excellent job. I would like to see the Leader representing the interests of the House and the country at the Cabinet. It is a positive suggestion and not one to be feared. The <Col N="100"/>Seanad would receive new responsibilities and would also be able to inspect the work of the North-South bodies. People are appointed to various forums and committees but we never see the fruits of their works. I am sure that 99% of this work is valuable and the contributions meaningful. However, the House would like to inspect the work of such bodies and suggest improvements where necessary. Such bodies were allowed to comment on Seanad reform and we should be allowed to do likewise.</P>
    <P>The House should also be able to review reports and Government programmes referred to it by the D&aacute;il. County councillors represent their constituents but the Seanad has the cream of the local representative system. We should not be afraid to review reports and Government programmes.</P>
    <P>The public image of the Seanad could be better. It is regarded as a staging post for politicians on their way to the D&aacute;il or to retirement. However, it provides a forum for calm deliberation and provides analysis of many of the national issues. Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is correct that we had a heated but measured debate on the situation in Iraq. There should be more widespread consultation with the interested groups and Members can be used as a conduit in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have mixed views on the suggestion that 50% of Members would be elected on the same day as European and local elections with the other 50% elected following a general election. We could have gone further by having 30% elected on a list system, a system I would prefer. However, we cannot take from the significant contribution of the grassroots and the expertise of county councillors.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important and detailed report and pay tribute to the Leader and all involved in drawing it up. Some 11 reports were produced in the past 50 years but there has been virtually no reform. It is time to act. Members now have greater time and resources, including research officers, and we take our job seriously. This is an opportune time to make the Seanad more relevant. The quality of this debate has been exceptional and I welcome the reform process. I would also welcome an increase in the number of seats to 65. We are privileged to have the contribution of the university Members who add a certain level of debate and work closely with the council representatives.</P>
    <P>I once again welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish her well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others who have welcomed the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House and congratulate her on her continuing role in Government.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat ironic, given that it is Deputy de Valera who is here, that in discussing a Seanad reform document, the production of which took much time and effort by many people, we are discussing proposals to change a Seanad set up by her late grandfather. It is good to examine and <Col N="101"/>debate what we are doing here and we will, I hope, be constructive in our comments. I assume that all comments on the debate have been constructive.</P>
    <P>My reason for coming here to make a contribution is that I have difficulty in accepting some of the recommendations of the report, although there is some good in it as well. That is to be expected. I will deal first with a particular issue of concern relating to the system of election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann. Why change it? Perhaps the Cathaoirleach would expect me to ask that, having been elected under that system, but that is not necessarily the reason I ask. I ask the question against the background of whether the system has served Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the Legislature well. I conclude that it has. It is democratic and I know of no other form of election that would be more democratic. I have no reason to believe that the new system as proposed in the recommendations would be more democratic. I do not believe it would; it would be totally centrist. The suggestion that a political organisation, whether it is my political organisation or another, would determine who should be on the list is wrong.</P>
    <P>The system we have, whereby Members of the Seanad are elected by Members of the other House, members of local authorities, corporations, etc., is a democratic system because all of those bodies are elected by the people. I expect there has been comment about the role of the county councillor and the local authority member in this election. We have approximately 960 local authority and county council members in the country at the moment. Each of those was elected by the people in his or her own electoral area and knows the people&rsquo;s requirements. When we canvass during election campaigns we are put through the mill, whether we are on a vocational panel or on the Oireachtas panel. We are asked questions and if we are elected we are expected to live up to the answers we give. No other system is more democratic. Most democratic countries around the world have two Houses; only a few small countries do not. To do away with a democratic system that has stood the test of time begs certain questions.</P>
    <P>If one evaluates either the vocational panel system or the Oireachtas system one will find they have selected good people. I was nominated by ICOS, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, which embraces the totality of agriculture and has two nominations which many people seek, but which are not easy to come by. Historically the Seanad nominating bodies have selected good people. If I say that about myself, I hope I will be forgiven but that is the situation as I see it. Equally, perhaps there is a need to examine the vocational bodies as they are set up for nominating panels. Needs have evolved and changed. That aspect could be examined and I would not object to that.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in terms of inside and outside panels, I am on the outside while others are on the inside. The weighting of votes in the determi<Col N="102"/>nation of where seats should go is unfair. We should have a straight system. Whoever is first past the post should be deemed elected. In the Constitution there is provision for Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to be appointed to Government and this has been done on two occasions to the best of my knowledge. The late Senator Se&aacute;n Moylan was appointed to the Cabinet by &Eacute;amon de Valera. Professor Jim Dooge was appointed to the Cabinet by former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald. I expect that if the need ever arose, that could be done again and that provision should be retained as it is currently enshrined.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words on what I see as an expanding role for Seanad &Eacute;ireann. Since 1937, systems have evolved. We have joined Europe which, to many people, is still a distant entity. We now have scrutiny of EU legislation in various committees. Perhaps Seanad &Eacute;ireann could play a role in that area. In the recent past, various MEPs have addressed the House. They came in for 40 minutes and made a presentation. There should be more open dialogue, questions and answers.</P>
    <P>The last issue on which I will comment, and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence, is the evolving nature of this country&rsquo;s role. The political climate is changing. In the past, we had a 26-county Republic and the Six Counties in the North were totally hostile. This morning and yesterday on the Order of Business, reference was made to the DUP&rsquo;s Dr. Ian Paisley and his team coming here for the first time to meet Irish Government officials on official business. That is good. We have the cross-Border institutions which were set up under the Good Friday Agreement and we have set up many other structures. Dare I suggest there is a role for Seanad &Eacute;ireann as an all-Ireland institution? I do not have answers but I have some thoughts on the issue. Dare I ask that Seanad &Eacute;ireann become the first all-Ireland institution with elected, appointed or nominated Members representing communities in the Six Counties?</P>
    <P>I long for an all-Ireland institution and a 32-county Republic. It is my wish to see this achieved before I pass over the great divide. I belong to the republican party which has as its philosophy a united Ireland by constitutional and peaceful means. Is there not a role for Seanad &Eacute;ireann in this regard? I believe there is and we should apply ourselves to this rather than making cosmetic changes. Reference was rightly made to emigrant representation in the Seanad. However, if a role cannot be given to the people with whom we share the island, how can one be given to those emigrants in Australia, America and elsewhere?</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, and wish her well in her new term of office.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw her attention to the urgent need for funding under the equal opportunities childcare programme for Granard, Ardagh and Legan, County Longford. Dedicated and hard-working groups are struggling to provide essential child care assistance in often highly unsuitable premises and conditions. Granard, Ardagh and Legan are extremely handicapped areas with high unemployment and its ensuing problems. Low income families struggle to provide child care facilities and pre-school education to their children. Over the years, projects in these areas have endeavoured with much success to provide low-cost child care for all, regardless of income.</P>
    <P>In Granard, 58 children attend the play group and Montessori school. Set up in 1985, it has now reached a stage where expansion is essential. Granard, a small town situated on the Cavan, Westmeath and Longford border, is approximately 16 miles from Longford town. Historically, this town was known for lack of employment, single-parent families, early school leavers and a high percentage of settled Travellers. Unemployment stands at 18.1% in the urban area, which far exceeds the national average. Similar situations apply to both Ardagh and Legan, details of which are in their respective applications for funding.</P>
    <P>The lack of education has been identified as a recurring problem in these areas with a high illiteracy rate among the unemployed and disadvantaged. This problem relates to early school leaving and the lack of interest of some parents in education. Many other parents are in the unfortunate position of being unable to help their children in the most basic areas of literacy and numeracy. In 2002 R&amp;H Consulting was commissioned to examine the problems in Granard. It suggested that a full day care service should be provided to assist in breaking the illiteracy cycle. The same applies to Legan and Ardagh.</P>
    <P>The Granard community play group is successfully trying to provide such a facility and it is important that it is given every possible assistance. This group provides low-cost child care for parents and children. It is trying to establish an after-school homework group as part of the proposed new development which would include full day care facilities, after-school service and an enhanced existing play group and Montessori school. Marginalised parents of school-going children would greatly benefit from the support of the staff of after-school services and would allow parents to avail of employment or education opportunities which would otherwise not be <Col N="104"/>available to them due to the constraints of child care. This valuable project has requested funding at the most cost effective level possible and has full support from everyone in the area concerned with education and provision of services for young people. The future expansion and prospects of extending its services to the community depends on an ability to provide necessary and essential facilities.</P>
    <P>The people of Longford have waited years for funding for child care services. The future prospects of the children of these Longford towns and the important breaking of the cycle of illiteracy and deprivation depends on early intervention and the provision of funding to ensure that facilities are available in the interest of both the young people, their parents and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I understand an announcement will be made soon as the Department is at the final stages of assessment. We wait with bated breath. There is an enthusiastic local committee. One of the chairpersons of the committee, Ms Mary Lyons, is in the Visitors Gallery this afternoon and I acknowledge the work and effort she and her committee have put into bringing this project to fruition in the area. However, it now awaits an imminent announcement on funding. I plead with the Minister of State to facilitate those three groups. It is not often that I look for project funding but on this occasion I plead from my heart that these three groups be allocated it. I understand the time, effort and energy that these three communities have put into getting these projects up and running. I hope the Minister of State does not now dash their hopes. I look forward to a positive response from her.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bannon for raising this matter on the Adjournment. As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot attend the House, he has asked me to take this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is aware that there are capital grant applications for funding under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000-2006, with his Department for each of these locations in County Longford, which are together seeking almost &euro;3 million. The Senator will be aware that the review of the capital provisions of the programme is taking place largely due to its success in stimulating activity to develop child care throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>In carrying out the review, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform found that every county has benefited from considerable support for new child care facilities under the programme. In all, funding to create some 28,300 new places has been approved to date. This will, when fully drawn down, bring an increase of 50% <Col N="105"/>in the number of centre-based child care places throughout Ireland since the start of the programme in 2000.</P>
    <P>The programme also makes grant assistance available towards the staffing costs of community based not-for-profit child care facilities which have a clear focus on disadvantage and which support disadvantaged families who are in work, training or education. Staff funding, which is current expenditure as distinct from capital expenditure, is helping to support a further 26,600 child care places.</P>
    <P>The EOCP originally set aside over &euro;140 million in capital funding to create new and enhanced child care places. The availability of this ground-breaking funding, together with the demand for child care places, sparked considerable interest in the capital element of the EOCP. As we are all aware, capital investment is an investment for the future as well as for the short term. As a result, the child care directorate of the Department undertook the review of the programme funding to ensure that as much funding as possible would be channelled to support the creation of much-needed new child care places.</P>
    <P>The Border, Midlands and Western Regional Assembly also agreed to make a small increase in its capital commitment to the EOCP and this facilitated a significant increase in the capital programme, particularly for the development of community based not-for-profit groups which are delivering pre-school child care and integrated child care services, bringing the total amount available to &euro;115 million from a total capital budget of nearly &euro;157 million. The Senator will be aware that this is effectively an increase of more than &euro;15 million in the capital provision for the programme over its eight year life to the end of 2007.</P>
    <P>ADM, on behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme&rsquo;s capital commitments to date, numbering over 1,100 and at a value of &euro;114 million, to ensure that all the grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed. If they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner as must grant approvals, to ensure the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.</P>
    <P>Efforts are being made to achieve a good geographical spread through the appraisal and approvals process. County Longford has already received significant grant assistance under the equal opportunities childcare programme with 25 capital grants to establish either new or quality enhanced community based not-for-profit or private child care facilities. The county has also benefited from 20 staffing grants to community groups which have a focus on disadvantage. This <Col N="106"/>funding to child care providers is leading to the creation of 621 new child care places and to the support of 359 existing places.</P>
    <P>The county child care committee also receives annual funding to support its developmental work. The Minister understands from the review that the levels of support going to County Longford under the equal opportunities childcare programme compare very positively with other counties in the Border, midlands and western region.</P>
    <P>Apart from looking at the funding amounts to be made available for capital, the review has also been looking at approvals to date in each county in the context of existing services. It has reviewed the types of service which are being supported to ensure there is a good mix of full-time and sessional services serving the full range of age groups, particularly children under two. It may be that a review of a county as a whole may mask unmet need in a local area and this has also been considered and addressed during the review process.</P>
    <P>The review has also led to a thorough appraisal of all capital applications to determine those which best address the aims of the programme and which, therefore, will be accorded the highest priority for funding in the short term. The programme guidelines lay out the criteria against which capital grant applications are appraised, the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area, the quality of the proposal, the capacity of the applicant group to implement the project, the level of integration and co-ordination with existing services to avoid duplication and value for money. These are the criteria which are being used to evaluate each project which seeks funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform tells me that he intends to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline on 30 April 2004 have been reviewed again by ADM Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered, value for money and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme in 2007. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority funding from the capital funding which remains unallocated at this point.</P>
    <P>The Minister understands that the final recommendations to him regarding the allocation of the remaining funding are currently in preparation. If a project is recommended for funding as part of this process, its recommendation will be conditional upon its being able to establish that it can be completed within a fixed budget and a tight timeframe. If a project is not recommended for priority funding at this time, it will be considered again should additional capital resources become available. The allocation of any additional funding which might become available to the Minister will also be allocated on the basis of local need, <Col N="107"/>levels of service being offered and value for money.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very much aware of his Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase the supply of child care places in Ireland to enable parents to engage in employment, education and training. The contribution that a quality child care facility can make to the lives of parents and children is well documented.</P>
    <P>The availability of child care directly supports the economy in that it enables parents to work, safe in the knowledge that their children are being cared for in appropriate settings. The Irish labour force is expected to increase to nearly 2 million by the end of the decade and, therefore, sustained growth in the numbers who remain active in the labour market is vital for economic development.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also aware that the support of family participation in the labour market is recognised as a key contributor to the equalisation of opportunities and as a measure to foster social inclusion. Training and education will enhance the labour market opportunities of unemployed parents. Again, enhanced economic circumstances have been shown to enhance educational performance among children. Thus the provision of child care is an essential support for many reasons. This is why it receives generous EU support as Irish child care facilities are developed to address the new needs of Irish parents and to move towards the range of services which are already developed in our European neighbouring states. Thus, the provision of child care supports the twin aims of Government, namely, the promotion of economic development and the promotion of social inclusion. For this reason, the Minister is very actively involved in the review of the capital programme for child care development which he is treating as a high priority. The Minister does not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the programme and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing workforce will support his case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Indeed, should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, he would expect that the equal opportunities childcare programme would again benefit from transfers.</P>
    <P>The programme has a focus on many quality issues which were identified in the national child care strategy which was drawn up by an expert working group on child care chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the context of Partnership 2000. The EOCP is implementing the supply side recommendations of the expert working group, which strongly advocated the provision of significant State support for child care. The equal opportunities childcare programme is the response of the Government and the EU to the need to develop a child care infrastructure to support parents in Ireland <Col N="108"/>and, with an annual commitment of some &euro;68 million, the Minister is confident that Senator Bannon will acknowledge there has been welcome progress in the creation of a good child care service, particularly in County Longford.</P>

	<P>Would the Minister agree to meet a small deputation from the three child care committees to which I referred?

   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter. This is probably the Minister&rsquo;s first engagement in the Houses as the new Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I congratulate him on his appointment to a position of great importance and wish him well during his tenure. Over the next two years or so the Minister will probably drive through the town of Mitchelstown hundreds of times as he travels between Dublin and Cork. He is familiar with the town and the community and he is aware of the current difficulties in the town.</P>
    <P>This afternoon I wish to address the urgent need for Government intervention with regard to job losses in the Mitchelstown area and to appeal to the Minister to ensure that his Department and officials work in a strong and proactive fashion with the State and local job creation agencies, the local authorities and others to ensure that the jobs crisis in Mitchelstown is dealt with. On many occasions pleas have been made in the House for industrial development for different towns throughout the country. However, Mitchelstown is one of the few towns, if not the only town, which, since the foundation of the State, has never received any type of inward industrial development.</P>
    <P>For the past 50 or 60 years employment provision in Mitchelstown has arisen from a single source and a single industry, namely, what was formerly Mitchelstown Co-operative and is now Dairygold. No major industry providing more than 30 or 40 jobs has located in Mitchelstown. The town and the community, therefore, have been almost entirely dependent on one industry. That industry is now under pressure. Unfortunately, a commercial decision was made for which the Government cannot be blamed. However, as a result hundreds of jobs have been lost in the Dairygold group. A significant number of redundancies are planned for the Galtee Meats division. Obviously, this is a cause of grave distress and concern for the Mitchelstown community.</P><Col N="109"/>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to work with Dairygold to ensure that the assistance the company is seeking for research development and technological advances is provided through the State agencies and to give whatever assistance the company requires to ensure its long-term viability and expansion. That must be done. I also ask the Minister to meet the local community, business groups and local people who are aware of the problems that exist. They will discuss various possible solutions with the Minister. There was a helpful meeting some months ago with the T&aacute;naiste when she held the Minister&rsquo;s portfolio.</P>
    <P>I do not expect overnight miracles. It is not possible for the Minister to open his briefcase and produce two factories for Mitchelstown. However, our goal must be to ensure that new industry is brought to the area. It must also be to ensure that Dairygold gets whatever help and support it requires to progress and develop in the future. We now have a Cork-based Minister with responsibility for employment. While he has to look after other counties, I hope his personal knowledge of the town and community of Mitchelstown will lead him to ensure that they get the attention they deserve.</P>
    <P>There is a great community in Mitchelstown and a fantastic workforce has been available to the main employer in the town. Everybody must work together. There has been anger in Mitchelstown in recent times but that is understandable. However, we must move on to phase 2, which means everybody working in a positive and progressive fashion to stem the tide in the area. I thank the Minister for coming to the House this afternoon. I hope it is a first positive step and that the Minister will be willing to work with the community council, the Mitchelstown business association, Cork County Council, the Leader groups and so forth. If everybody pulls together, we can turn the situation around.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bradford for raising this matter and for his constructive contribution. Other public representatives, including the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Michael Ahern, and Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe, who lives in Mitchelstown, have also expressed their concerns about developments there.</P>
    <P>Mitchelstown has been to the forefront of considerations since a meeting last April between the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and a delegation from Mitchelstown, which included the Senator. On 26 November 2003, Dairygold announced 500 jobs losses across a range of its operations. These were sought on a voluntary basis. On 10 August 2004, the group announced its plans to terminate slaughtering at its Galtee Meats operation in Mitchelstown, with the loss of 170 jobs at the end of October 2004. Galtee Meats, which is the pig division of Dairygold, employs 500 people across a number of locations.</P><Col N="110"/>
    <P>Slaughtering as well as value added processing is carried out in Mitchelstown. This action has been taken following a comprehensive review of its pigmeat division&rsquo;s cost competitiveness. Galtee will now focus on growing its added value, branded category business which has been profitable.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is keeping in close contact with Dairygold Co-operative Society Limited about recent announcements on job losses and is monitoring the development of rationalisation at the company, including Galtee Meats. Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work with the company on the development of its business. The importance of Dairygold as an employer in Mitchelstown and the entire north Cork area is fully understood, as are the implications of the job cuts announced recently by the company in line with its restructuring plans.</P>
    <P>At present, F&Aacute;S is in the process of registering the 150 employees of Galtee Meats in Mitchelstown who are about to be made redundant. The full range of F&Aacute;S services are being offered to the employees, including CV preparation and interview skills and re-skilling in line with labour market conditions. F&Aacute;S has also increased activity across north Cork, offering the business community and the general public additional courses and support.</P>
    <P>Dairygold has been approached for assistance with regard to industrial development in Mitchelstown. A socio-economic study of the Mitchelstown area has been commissioned and a proposal will be presented to the company shortly with a view to securing funding for the study. The industrial development agencies are continuing to promote Mitchelstown for industrial development. Last year, Enterprise Ireland approved a grant of &euro;200,000 for a food enterprise centre in the town. Approval for business expansion scheme relief is awaited pending the outcome of certain EU state aid issues regarding BES relief in general. However, in the meantime, a food forum committee, of which Enterprise lreland is a member, has been arranged to drive the project forward. The first meeting of this committee is scheduled for today.</P>
    <P>A substantial new facility has also been funded under the BES and this is being marketed by IDA Ireland to potential clients. There have been two site visits to date, the most recent in August 2004. However, no client interest has been expressed in the facility as yet. Four small advance industrial units are being provided following a joint initiative involving the county enterprise board, the local credit union and Cork County Council.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council has designated Mitchelstown as an important growth and development centre. The council has acquired lands for industrial purposes and new industrial sites are also being sought. Mitchelstown is also to be included in the roll out of broadband infrastructure. In addition, Mallow has been designated as a hub location under the national spatial strategy and <Col N="111"/>this has the potential to benefit Mitchelstown and the broader north Cork area. Future employment opportunities generated at the business and technology park in Fermoy will also benefit Mitchelstown. While there are no IDA supported companies in Mitchelstown at present, companies such as Sanmina SCI and FCI in Fermoy and Kostal in Mallow are significant employers in the area.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the combined efforts of agency and local interests will address the ongoing needs of Mitchelstown. However, in addition to increased global competition for investment and as a result of the slowdown in the global economy in the last few years, there have been fewer companies seeking investment locations than in the past. This has resulted in both fewer companies visiting Ireland and fewer companies choosing to locate in Ireland. The final decision on where to locate a project rests with the promoter of that project. Mitchelstown con<Col N="112"/>tinues to be marketed by the development agencies for new investment as actively and vigorously as possible.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I intend to closely monitor the situation and give whatever assistance I can. I am familiar with the Mitchelstown story for a range of reasons and from my connections there. I will continue to ensure the efforts being made will maintain the same level of momentum.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister consider meeting the local community and business interests at the earliest possible date?

We are not expecting solutions to flow immediately but a meeting of the various interested parties would be of assistance. I ask the Minister to consider such a meeting at his convenience.</P>
