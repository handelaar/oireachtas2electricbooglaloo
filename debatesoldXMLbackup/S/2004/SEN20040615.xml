   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 &mdash; Report Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 4.15 p.m.; No. 2, Civil Liability and Courts Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee Stage (Resumed) and Remaining Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 1 or at 4.15 p.m. and to conclude no later than 6.30 p.m.; and No. 3, motion re operation of the provisions of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 2 or at 6.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 7.30 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We support the proposed Order of Business. I offer the other side of the House my sincere commiserations on the results of last week&rsquo;s elections. I have a word of advice for the Taoiseach. He stated that he intends to carry out a major reshuffle of the Cabinet. He should look to the Leader of this House to bring back some solidity and competence to the Government as soon as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="2"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much deadwood in the Cabinet and the appointment of Senator O&rsquo;Rourke as a member would help to solve this problem. I ask the Taoiseach to follow my advice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business, Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of everyone, I offer congratulations to Senator Higgins on his election to the European Parliament and to all those who stood in that contest. I also congratulate all those who were elected to the local authorities. The most important result was not just the success of the Opposition but the massive turnout compared with an average of 15% to 20% in other EU countries. We owe the people, and the candidates from all parties whose campaign over the past six months or so contributed to that turnout, a great tribute.</P>
    <P>The results clearly point to a dramatic change in the composition of the next Seanad by virtue of local authority membership. I wonder whether, in a newly constituted Seanad, there would be greater support for Seanad reform along the lines we have proposed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There would.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="3"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Leader of the House would agree it would ensure some of her colleagues on that side of the House might make it back after the next election.</P>
    <P>The Government has succeeded in having the constitutional referendum on citizenship passed. I congratulate it on that. We should now move on the basis of all-party consensus to agree the legislation to be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas over the next few months. We have been given the right by the people, who are sovereign in this matter, to limit citizenship in certain circumstances. We have an obligation to move on an all-party basis. Genuine debate and agreement on the issue of immigration is necessary. The time is now right for that debate. It is also time to introduce legislation based purely on all-party support and consensus. That is how we should proceed to ensure we have a rational, confident and balanced debate so the terrible tyranny or racism will not be bestowed on the Irish people. That must happen now. I encourage the Government to work with us on this side of the House to achieve all-party agreement on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I offer congratulations to the newly elected members of the local authorities and to the newly elected MEPs. It is important that we recognise their potential contribution. I also offer my condolences in respect of the number of single transferable votes that evaporated from my colleagues on the other side and suggest that it might perhaps encourage Members on the Government side to take a new look at the proposals in the recent report on Seanad reform and show a new interest in, for example, the list system and various other forms of election. It would add a certain level of information to how they should be informed.</P>
    <P>I support what Senator Brian Hayes said about our Leader&rsquo;s position in Government. Perhaps she is currently more needed in Westmeath than in Government. Westmeath sadly lacked her calming and supportive influence over the past week or two.</P>
    <P>On the more serious Curtin issue, the committee appointed to deal with the matter is meeting today. We can only wish it well in what I believe to be an impossible task. I have communicated with the Leader on a number of occasions about this and she has been extraordinarily helpful. However, the Government should seriously consider negotiating an outcome or conclusion to his issue because unless negotiations are entered into, Judge Curtin will still be a judge long after this Government has gone. In terms of costs, taxpayers&rsquo; money will evaporate on a mission impossible. We should be realistic about it. The Government has a clear objective which it can achieve in ways other than the way it is going about it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="4"/>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been very careful in what I have said. I know the Chair is uncomfortable with it. However, I do not believe I have gone beyond the limit. I ask that this be raised confidentially by the Leader with the Government. Serious mistakes have already been made, not by anybody in this House, and we should examine carefully what the conclusions might be. I think we are making a mess of it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole. I am very concerned with what I have read from well informed commentary in the media that the path being pursued will not succeed and will cause problems for the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be decided by the two Houses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my commiseration to the parties opposite and I advise them to brace themselves for what is ahead. They probably already know from the comments of backbenchers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator advising us?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Those opposite should cheer up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>They should enjoy it while they are here as God knows what will happen after the next election.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>We know we are all subject to the vagaries of the electorate. From listening to people on the doorsteps and to the backbenchers&rsquo; comments in the media, some of which were attributed, it is clear there is a long list of issues about which people are concerned. Two issues are of particular concern and they are linked. One is the impact of the Hanly report, which will be even bigger if the Government publishes a second Hanly report. The second issue is decentralisation, in which the Government has put itself in a bind. If it delivers decentralisation, it will <?oasys [jy?>alienate a great number of public servants who are bothered about it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given the Senator latitude. I am not sure if this is relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>If decentralisation is not delivered, there are areas around the country which will be very annoyed at the Government. These issues are linked. Public servants should have a look at where the Government intends them to go and check whether the hospital that is there now will be there when they get there.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate everyone who succeeded in the recent local elections. More importantly, I congratulate everyone who par<Col N="5"/>took in the local elections regardless of the result, both the candidates and the public at large for coming out in such large numbers. It is a great test of one&rsquo;s calibre to put oneself before one&rsquo;s community and peers to face an electorate. It is very easy for those who do not put themselves above the parapet to be critical. It was a good day for the body politic that so many people contested the elections. I am not going to rise to the bait of warnings and advice given from members of the other side of the House. The reality is that we should be complimentary to our democratic system. Not all countries have a democratic system that works as effectively as ours and we should acknowledge that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Because the current situation is fraught with difficulty, I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that negotiations should be examined. What the Senator said is wise and this could drag on for years. I encourage the Leader to pursue that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator knows the procedure has been adopted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not trying to do anything to upset that. I agree with the comments that have been made regarding the increased vote and the number of people who took part in the democratic system. It is great to see it working so well. Maybe it is not the last hurrah for the tallyman because the elections worked very well and people were very satisfied with it. I support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s comments on citizenship legislation and that is something the Leader might usefully pursue.</P>
    <P>When does the Leader expect the fog of indecision will lift regarding the break-up of Aer Rianta? Is there any report from today&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting on that matter?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have to go around the hotels again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that last Friday was a very good day for democracy. The people&rsquo;s vote was up by several percent. While wishing to join in congratulating everyone concerned, none of us, either optimistically or pessimistically, should pre-empt the choice of the people in two or three years time.</P>
    <P>Can the Leader arrange a debate on the annual report of An Post? There is much concern throughout the country about the future of certain post offices and this should be debated in the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to pass on to the Office of Public Works congratulations on the magnificent job it has done in the National Library of Ireland with the space which now houses the remarkable exhibition of manuscripts of James Joyce. For the first time I feel I can hold my head high in the international community of Joyceans because we have a deposit of material <Col N="6"/>of world standing which was imaginatively bought by the Government and we now have a facility of world standing in which to exhibit it for the first time.</P>
    <P>I must be a little negative and ask the Leader to speak to the relevant Ministers about Carmichael House, which many Senators know. More than 40 voluntary organisations which look after people with motor neurone disease, gifted children and many others are under threat that the house may close by July if there is not a co-ordinated attempt to support it. One Department has already rowed in but others need to do so also. The closure of Carmichael House would be a real tragedy and a loss.</P>
    <P>I dissociate myself from the encomiums paid to President Reagan recently. It is a very sad thing for a family when a human being dies and one accepts and respects that. However, this is a man who laid the foundations for the catastrophic foreign policy of the United States. Arms were illegally exported to Iran, drugs were sold and the money used to supply guns for the murder squads in South America. President Reagan&rsquo;s interventions in Asia and the Middle East were equally disastrous. He laid the foundations for the tragedy we are looking at today. History will show this to be the fact and I am happy to put that on the record.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I also raise the issue of Carmichael House which, it was announced at the weekend, may have to close. This house, which accommodates 46 important support groups which help needy people, is under threat of closure because it needs funding of &euro;300,000. On 17 May last the Taoiseach opened Carmichael House, wished those working there well and congratulated them on the work they are doing. The same Taoiseach is now standing over the possibility of the house closing. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has promised to provide funding but the house needs additional funding from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I ask the Leader to ensure that Carmichael House gets this essential funding, not just for the next six months but on an annual basis, to ensure that the work of the organisations who use the house can continue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel like a fish out of water today, having a licence neither to laugh nor cry about the election results. I congratulate those people who participated. As an ex-returning officer, I would like us all to pay tribute to the people who keep the machine going during elections and play an important role in that way.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s request for a calm debate on citizenship. After the referendum, this is something to which we should move quickly. This is a matter of particular interest in Northern Ireland. It is also important to begin to unstitch immigration from citizenship and asylum. We need and welcome these people. It is a labour force issue more than anything else.</P><Col N="7"/>
    <P>I support the remarks about Carmichael House which does magnificent work for deserving and needy people. It would be tragic if for some reason it fell between the cracks of various Departments. I hope the Leader will be able to encourage people to pull together in that regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, share Senator O&rsquo;Toole concerns regarding the committee given that the person involved is apparently suffering serious mental illness.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader request the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to discuss how he is dealing with the health problems of those in prison given that prison doctors have been on strike for some time now? Many people in our prisons are suffering from serious mental and physical illness. I request that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to discuss the matter because the prison health service is run by his Department and not the Department of Health and Children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in complimenting and congratulating all those who placed their names on ballot papers for last Friday&rsquo;s European and local elections. Local government is democratically elected by the people and they gave their verdict at the weekend. Fine Gael won outright control of the councils in my constituency, wiping the Progressive Democrats completely off the map and melting down Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that the people have given their verdict, it is important that we debate the economy, crime, the health services and funding for local authorities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is seeking four debates.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Those of us on the Opposition benches who met people on the doorsteps know these issues are of great concern to the public. They are annoyed with the Government in terms of the policies it has pursued for the past two years. The Government has let the people down. It is important we debate these issues of grave public concern before the summer recess because I do not believe the Government will survive autumn 2004.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator suggesting there will be a revolution?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon should put his salary on the Paddy Power slip.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="8"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We have our own weapon of mass destruction.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We had it last week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Browne on the Order of Business, please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in congratulating all those who contested the elections. The bravest thing any person can do is put their name on a ballot paper. Those involved deserve our congratulations on taking part in the democratic process. It is encouraging that voter turnout has increased, something which upset the trend in recent elections.</P>
    <P>As a person who took part in the election, I learned a great deal about the importance of transfers, an issue we should consider for the future. We should consider advertising or making available information leaflets on the importance of transfers, the advantages of PR voting and the role of local government. There is much ignorance in that regard. The number of deliberately spoiled votes is also an appalling matter. There is an onus on Government to ensure people have such information available to them.</P>
    <P>The House should also have a debate on the register of electors. I was appalled to learn that many people who turned up to vote discovered to their horror that they could not do so because their names had been taken off the register and they had not been notified. Voting is a basic right to which everyone is entitled. The current register of electors is totally unsatisfactory. I am not sure what is the solution to this problem but the matter should be debated in the House so we can consider alternative methods of keeping it up to date. We should also ensure everybody who is entitled to vote has the option of doing so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>On the occasion of the last Private Members&rsquo; business in the House, involving a motion from the Progressive Democrats about decentralisation, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, indicated to the House that everything was going according to plan as regards the timescale initially set out for that programme. On the very next day he was interviewed by RTE and clearly indicated that was not so. He stated that in the worst case scenario it will be the end of 2007 before the last Department decentralises. It was a terrible injustice to the Members of this House to change his mind the very next day and mislead them. I ask him as a matter of urgency to correct the record, either through the Leader or personally in the House. His statement was certainly a terrible rebuff to this House and its Members. He sat here and winked and nodded with regard to various statements that were made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>And promised A, B and C.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="9"/>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Certainly. He is obliged to come back to the House to correct the record regarding the accuracy of the statement he made.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, will the Leader request the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to explain in the House the reason for the deteriorating conditions of many beaches throughout the country that lost their blue flag status? I refer in particular to the beach in Spiddal, County Galway, which is one of the most important beaches in the county. The real reason for this, which I raised on the Adjournment, is that the local authority and the Government still allow untreated sewage to be discharged into Galway Bay. Consequently, because of the currents and prevailing winds, it drifts towards the beach.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Which beach? Is it the beach in Spiddal?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. Kinvara is the town in question, and I referred to it on the Order of Business previously. This issue is being ignored and it is time the Minister, particularly as president of the Environment Ministers in the EU, directed Galway County Council to prevent this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bannon&rsquo;s call for a debate on the economy. It would be useful and give us a chance to examine those elements of the economy that are the envy of other European countries. We have one of the most successful economies in the world. The sooner we discuss this, the better.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the public for turning out in such numbers at the local and European elections. I have certainly noticed a mood change among the electorate in that it treats the representatives and the candidates with such respect and courtesy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator did not know where he was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>This has certainly changed over many years.</P>
    <P>I, too, call for a debate on the register of electors. It is a mess and we need to find some formula that will ensure that those who are entitled to vote can vote and that those who are not do not have a vote.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, quite rightly praised the turnout at the elections. It was magnificent in light of the stories one hears from around Europe about a decline in voter participation. I suppose we all have different ideas as to why our turnout increased but it is very good when people turn out in large numbers. I thank the Senator for his other kind comments.</P><Col N="10"/>
    <P>As the Senator was talking, I was thinking about the accompanying legislation that must follow the referendum vote. We stated in our Seanad reform discussions that the Seanad would be the catalyst for getting groupings together to hear their views on legislation. This is what all the various parties involved in this matter have put forward. I could address myself to the Minister on this and it would be a good idea if he would consider the issue in that vein. We would then try to have all-party agreement on the accompanying legislation.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole. We are pretty robust on this side of the House. There is no point in saying that we loved what happened to us. How could one unless one was foolish? We will live to fight another day. There was a rout; there is no other way to describe it. We are good at picking up and I am sure we will all do so. We should try to smile about it and not have such glum faces on this side of the House as we will have to pick up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader seems to be enjoying herself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the committee working on a particular matter and clearly expressed his views, which will be on the record as is fair. He asked if I would speak privately on the matter and I undertake to do so. Senator O&rsquo;Meara echoed the comments about the path being pursued and spoke about the vagaries of the electorate. She spoke about the Hanly report and decentralisation. I suppose we all get our day in the sun from time to time and the Opposition&rsquo;s day is now. If I were in the Opposition&rsquo;s position, I would make the most of it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only half the day; the other half is to come.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader should be allowed to continue on the Order of Business without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is whether this is the start of a bright spell for the Opposition.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators should remember the words: &ldquo;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old time is still a-flying&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>After the shower comes the rainbow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator does not know real poetry. It was Horace who wrote <i>&ldquo;carpe diem&rdquo;.</i> Everyone has rightly congratulated those who were elected to local authorities. I spent many years on an authority. Those who failed have come out with their heads held high. They have had their hopes dashed and it is quite serious and difficult for them to cope among their families <Col N="11"/>and friends. However, that is the game and those who participate do so with good heart.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan referred to the great turnout and to those who ran. I agree that we have a good democratic system. Senator Coghlan echoed the sentiments of Senator O&rsquo;Toole about a particular matter, which I can understand. The Senator spoke about the increased vote, which was very good and he wants the fog of indecision surrounding Aer Rianta to be cleared.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will it lift?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know. I would think it has slipped below the horizon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the date slipped again?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would think so, if they have any sense. Senator Mansergh also spoke about democracy and called for a debate on the annual report of An Post. We can have such a debate and will invite the Minister to whom the report is presented to attend. Senator Norris congratulated the Office of Public Works on the job done at the National Library, which is free to the public and has a shop, a caf&eacute; and everything one would need. The Senator spoke about Carmichael House and I have been approached on the matter this morning. Terrific voluntary work is carried out there and it is the catalyst for all the voluntary organisations. The Senator made remarks about the late President Reagan, which will be on the record and on which I would prefer not to comment as he has passed away.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry mentioned the need for ongoing and properly structured funding for Carmichael House.

    <P>Senator Ulick Burke spoke about decentralisation. I will check the Official Report to determine what the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, said on both days.

The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Adoptive Leave Act 1995. However, it also makes amendments to the Unfair Dismissals and Redundancy Payments Acts.

    <P FLI="0">I welcome the fact that the Minister has the power to extend the period of adoptive leave.

   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>As indicated on Committee Stage by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, the review of statutory periods of leave such as adoptive, maternity or parental leave is a matter for consultation and negotiation by Government with the social partners through the partnership process, where the views of all relevant stakeholders can be taken into consideration. The partnership process should remain as the forum for reviewing adoptive leave entitlements rather than imposing a <Col N="14"/>statutory review every three years or otherwise. The partnership model has well served employers and employees by providing a forum for negotiation and agreement on a wide range of workplace issues including leave entitlements for parents and carers generally. In this context, introducing a statutory provision for a review of the adoptive leave period outside the partnership process would be inappropriate. The amendment would also introduce an inconsistency with similar types of legislation such as carers, maternity and parental leave legislation where there is no statutory provision for periodic review of the duration of leave.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 5, to delete lines 20 to 26 and substitute &ldquo;period of 8 weeks.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We in the Labour Party have tabled this amendment because we believe that a period of eight weeks is appropriate. I do not understand why for example section 6(1)(<i>b</i>) is necessary. Why not let the period be eight weeks, and leave it at that? It seems petty to insert the conditions contained in that subsection.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accept this amendment. It would result in granting bereaved adopting fathers a more generous leave entitlement than that of a bereaved natural father. As stated on Committee Stage, the maternity working group considered the periods of maternity leave available and made recommendations to increase both maternity leave and additional maternity leave by four weeks each. These increases were immediately implemented in March 2001 and were simultaneously applied to adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave. The increased leave provisions are also available to bereaved fathers in certain circumstances depending on the date the adoptive mother dies.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the group made no recommendations to increase fathers&rsquo; leave in the manner suggested in this amendment. Acceptance of this amendment would not only go beyond the agreed recommendations of the working group but would also break the link with the maternity leave provision and the parity of entitlement between natural and adoptive parents.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) An employee who is engaged in a process of foreign adoption, shall be entitled, in <Col N="15"/><?oasys [fc?>accordance with regulations made by the Minister, to a maximum of two weeks off work&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="3">(i) without loss of pay where placement subsequently occurs, or</P>
    <P LI="3">(ii) with loss of play where no placement subsequently occurs</P>
    <P LI="2" FLI="0">to attend pre-adoption meetings which he or she is obliged to attend.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We spent much time discussing a similar amendment on Committee Stage. I have put forward a fair amendment which I hope the Minister will be in a position to accept. There is no provision in the Bill to provide adoptive leave to parents prior to the placement of the child, which is discrimination. While accepting the reasons for giving maternity leave to natural mothers and the distinction between natural and adoptive mothers, we must recognise that adoptive parents must spend considerable time and effort trying to secure a child.</P>
    <P>As was clear from figures provided last week, a growing number of foreign adoptions are taking place involving adoptive parents from this country and this figure will increase. It would be a great loss if we did not take this opportunity to address the issue of families travelling abroad. We should not ignore the fact that these families must travel abroad, in some cases to faraway countries such as China and countries in South America, to attend meetings and are often obliged to stay in a country for a number of weeks before they get a child. I ask that a couple would be entitled to two weeks off work where they go through this process. In the case of a successful adoption, this would be without loss of pay and in a case where a successful adoption was not concluded, the leave should be without pay.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable amendment. I ask the Minister to recognise the difficulties involved and to recognise the growing number of adoptive parents of foreign children coming to this country.</P>

	<P>I second it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the amendment. The Adoptive Leave Act 1995 already makes provision for leave prior to placement in the case of a foreign adoption. Section 8 of the 1995 Act provides that in the case of a foreign adoption, an employed adopting mother or sole male adopter may avail of some or all of her eight weeks additional unpaid adoptive leave prior to the placement of the child for familiarisation purposes. Section 11 makes similar provisions for an employed adoptive father in circumstances where the adopting mother dies.</P><Col N="16"/>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill already provides in the case of both domestic and foreign adoptions for paid time off for employees to attend the pre-adoption classes or meetings which they are obliged to attend as part of the pre-adoption process. It was never intended that this entitlement would extend to overseas meetings and subsection (4), introduced by a Government amendment on Committee Stage, makes this clear. While Senator Terry&rsquo;s proposed amendment would ensure that an employer would not incur costs where placement did not occur, it strays beyond the agreement made in regard to this matter during consultations with the social partners.</P>
    <P>During these consultations, there was no consensus on extending a paid leave entitlement to adoptive parents for time spent abroad as part of the foreign adoption process, which the Minister, Deputy McDowell, argued on Committee Stage would impose an unacceptable cost on employers, particularly small employers. Equally, there was no agreement among the social partners to extend the existing provisions for unpaid time off for familiarisation visits or for meetings with adoptive authorities abroad.</P>
    <P>The amendment also introduces an element of uncertainty with respect to the entitlements of employees engaged in foreign adoption as to whether subsection (1) applies to them. The amendment is open to the interpretation that the entitlement of paid time off in subsection (1) would be lost in the event that a placement did not subsequently occur, creating an anomaly between domestic and foreign adopters.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is rejected. The provision in section 8 of the Bill for termination of additional adoptive leave on the sickness of the adopting parents is consistent with the provisions in section 6 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003, which implements the recommendations of the maternity working group on this matter. The review group recommends that in the event of illness, an employee should, <Col N="17"/><?oasys [fc?>subject to the agreement of the employer, be able to transfer from additional maternity leave to sick leave. If an employee transfers from additional maternity leave to sick leave, she will forfeit her right to any additional maternity leave not taken at the date of commencement of the sick leave.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides the employee with an option, if the employer agrees, to terminate unpaid additional adoptive leave in the event of illness and to benefit from payment in respect of sick leave subject to the sick leave arrangements in place. The proposed amendment strays from the agreed recommendations of the working group by removing subsection (4)(<i>b</i>), which requires untaken leave to be forfeit, and runs contrary to section 12(2) of the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement. The agreement states clearly that the Bill would provide for termination of additional adoptive leave in event of illness, subject to the agreement of the employer. To depart from this would be a significant departure from the package of compromises agreed and could damage further agreements of this nature.</P>

    <P FLI="0">We tabled this amendment previously because both sides should be able to agree a date rather than the postponed leave being taken seven days after the child leaves hospital. What if the employer wanted to change that? Why not leave it up to the parties involved to decide when the postponed leave will start?</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is also rejected. The proposed amendment is inconsistent with the recommendation of the maternity working group and gives rise to an anomaly with the provisions of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>The working group recommended that provision should be made for the postponement of the maternity leave in the event of hospitalisation of the child, subject to the agreement of the employer, and that the postponed leave should be taken in one continuous bloc when the baby is discharged from hospital. Section 9(2)(<i>d</i>) meets this requirement by providing that the postponed leave should be taken as a continuous period beginning not later than seven days after the child is discharged from hospital. This is identical to the provisions in section 7(4)(<i>c</i>) of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the working group is constructed to meet the needs of an adopting mother by offering her the opportunity to return <Col N="18"/><?oasys [fc?>to work while her child is in hospital and postponing her untaken leave until her child is discharged from hospital, provided the employer agrees. Effectively, in section 9 of the Bill we are putting in place some flexibility for adopting mothers in employment who find themselves in the particularly difficult situation where their child is in hospital. The provision that the untaken leave should be taken within seven days of the child&rsquo;s discharge from hospital reflects the reality that the adopting mother would, in all probability, wish to take the postponed leave immediately upon the discharge of the child from the hospital for the care of the child at home. In the case of an adopted child, the mother&rsquo;s presence is more important given the need to re-establish a bond with the child in his or her new family.</P>

	<P>I welcome the provisions of the Adoptive Leave Bill 2004, which represent a balanced and progressive response to the needs of employed adopting parents. The measures introduced in the Bill will enhance the existing legislative provisions for employed adopting parents by offering them greater employment protection and more flexibility in managing their work and family responsibilities throughout the adoption process.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my thanks to Members of the House for their contributions to the debate on the Bill. I am pleased it was possible to accommodate a number of Opposition amendments on Committee Stage, which improved the text of the Bill. As Senators know, the Adoptive Leave Bill is modelled closely on the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003, which is further advanced in its passage through the Houses. Consequently, the scope for amendments on this Bill was somewhat limited given the requirement to maintain the links between adoptive and maternity leave and ensure parity of leave entitlements between adopting and natural parents.</P>

    <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with the issue of interest on costs, charges and expenses associated with certain judgments, orders and decrees. The reason we have tabled this amendment is that the section as it stands could constitute an injustice against plaintiffs. It deprives plaintiffs of an entitlement to interest until such time as the taxation process is complete. The result of this is to favour defendants and there is no good reason for this position. I am not a lawyer, but the advice I have received is that this could be an unconstitutional interference with property rights and possibly even rights under Protocol No. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>The Law Society points out that if this provision is enacted, defendants will have no incentive to encourage the taxation process. I know the Minister is anxious to ensure that the entire process of civil liability is speeded up but this provision may result in the taxation process being dragged out for months or even years. If a plaintiff is successful he could end up significantly out of pocket because he will not be entitled to any interest until the process is complete. This amendment is designed to make sure this does not happen. I hope the Minister will agree that the section as drafted could result in a considerable degree of unfairness to plaintiffs who are successful in their claims.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="21"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 represent retrograde steps. Amendment No. 47 would have reversed a change brought about by the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002. We would revert to the pre-2002 position in which interest on costs awarded to a party in court proceedings would run from the date of the judgment at 8%. That would mean that the losing party in an action would be obliged to pay this interest from the date of the judgment even though the amount of the costs had not yet been quantified or communicated to him or her. The MIAB strongly recommended that should not happen.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 48 seeks to confine the change in interest from 2% to 0% to actions brought after the commencement of this section. I do not agree with this move. I want the change to apply to pending actions also and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>

	<P>That is fine.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I do not agree is that the right to interest is not a constitutional right. In these circumstances, the obligation to pay interest on an unascertained sum of costs is penal. The defendant does not know how much he or she owes until the proceedings are over and he or she is then asked to pay a sum of money on the basis of a judgment that is given at a later stage. That is not fair. This provision should apply to pending proceedings also. We want this new regime to apply from the moment the Bill becomes law.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>What about my point that this could constitute a disincentive to completing the process?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 47 is the exact opposite. It represents a major incentive for the solicitor for the plaintiff to delay the taxation process. The result of this amendment would be that the defendant could not pay until the taxation process was complete and the resulting sum of money would carry interest of 8% per annum, which is a nice little earner in this day and age. I do not agree with the Senator&rsquo;s point.</P>

  <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  <P>Sections 33 to 42, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 49:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 28, after section 42, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">43.&mdash;(1) Upon the application of a party to any proceedings, the court hearing those proceedings may direct that a person (other than an expert witness) who it is intended will be called to give evidence in those proceedings shall not attend those proceedings until he or she is called to give evidence.</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">(2) Where a court gives a direction under <i>subsection (1)</i>, it may give all such other directions as it considers necessary or expedient to secure that a witness to whom the first-mentioned direction applies does not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>a</i>) communicate with other witnesses in the proceedings concerned, or</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>b</i>) receive information such as might influence him or her when giving evidence.</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">(3) In this section &rsquo;expert witness&rsquo; means, in relation to proceedings, a person who it is intended will be called as a witness to give expert evidence.&rdquo;.</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This section provides that the court in a personal injury action may, upon the application of a party to the action, direct that a person, other than the party to the action or an expert witness, who it is intended will be called to give evidence at the trial of the action, shall not attend the trial until he or she is called to give evidence. Where a court gives a direction under subsection (1) it can give all such other directions as it considers necessary or expedient to secure that a witness to whom the first mentioned direction applies does not communicate with other witnesses who it is intended will be called to give evidence at the trial of the action concerned or receive information such as might influence him or her when giving evidence. &ldquo;Expert witness&rdquo; is defined, in a personal injury case, as a person who it is intended will be called as a witness to give expert evidence at the trial of the action.</P><Col N="23"/>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to provide for a power, but not a duty, for the courts to exclude witnesses in personal injury actions from the trial of the action. It is commonplace in criminal procedure that witnesses as to fact are sometimes excluded by order of court while other witnesses are testifying so that they may not be influenced by or tempted to match their evidence to that which comes before. The same should apply in civil procedure. It is not mandatory in every case and where the truthfulness of witnesses is unlikely to be an issue it is unlikely that the court will deploy such a power. However, where three people are giving evidence relating to an accident in a heavily contested case, it can be desirable in working out which side is more reliable that the witnesses give evidence without hearing what other witnesses have said before. It is important that they do not hear the cross-examination of preceding witnesses and tailor their evidence to meet it.</P>
    <P>I recommend this provision to the House as it will improve the standard of evidence in civil trials. It is already the practice in the UK and other countries to exclude witnesses of fact while others are testifying.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this section is to amend section 46 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002, which has not been brought into operation, to remove the possibility of judges being required to deliver judgments within prescribed periods but to preserve the requirement for a register of reserved judgments which is accessible to the public. I have concerns that section 46 as it stands might be perceived as an inappropriate interference with the exercise of judicial functions and the reason for this amendment is to avoid any such suggestion of interference.</P>
    <P>The proposed new subsection (3) provides that as long as a judgment is undelivered, the proceedings in question will be listed before the judge or, where there is more than one judge, the senior judge, at intervals of two months and the <Col N="25"/>judge will indicate on each occasion when he or she intends to give judgment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that where proceedings are listed before a judge in accordance with subsection (3), the judge shall specify the day on which he or she proposes to deliver judgment in proceedings.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides that the date specified by the judge shall be entered in the register of reserved judgment and where the proceedings have been listed more than once, the most recent dates specified shall be entered in the register. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) provides for the repeal of section 46(9)(<i>b</i>). That is consequential on the changes I have described. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) replaces section 46(10) with a new subsection to make clear that in the case of court constituted of more than one judge, the listing of the cases for the purpose of the register will be before the most senior judge in accordance with section 9 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, as inserted by section 9 of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1997. The existing subsection (10) refers to the presiding judge of the court, a phrase which is defined in the Courts (No. 2) Act 1997 as the Chief Justice in the case of the Supreme Court and the presidents of other courts in their respective courts. However, many courts constituted of more than one member will include only ordinary judges, so it is necessary to change the law slightly to bring that about.</P>
    <P>On the broader principle it is important that where judgments are reserved by a court the parties to the judgment have a clear sense on leaving court that there is some momentum in the process and that it will not simply be put on a shelf and addressed when the judge gets around to it. The purpose of the section is to require that there will be a register of reserved judgments, so that if any judge is falling into arrears with his or her work &mdash; that can happen for a variety of reasons &mdash; a warning bell will sound not merely to the president of that judge&rsquo;s court, but also to the public at large that an accumulation of reserved judgments exists in the case of that judge. The purpose is to effectively motivate the members of the Judiciary to address the question of reserved judgments and to keep it constantly fresh in their minds that they have not yet delivered judgment in a particular area.</P>
    <P>Some people may think we should trust the Judiciary to deal with matters. In my experience, the vast majority of the Judiciary work extremely hard and extremely well to deliver their caseload in terms of judgments before them. However, I have known it to be the case on occasion in the past that some judges have, under the weight of the work they have undertaken, begun to fall far in arrears with delivering judgments in the cases they have heard. The result is a very unhappy one, which most public representatives will recognise. When people come to their clinics to ask what can be done about it, there is very little a public representative can do because, by definition, a letter from a public representative to anybody in the Courts Service in those circumstances <Col N="26"/>would be immediately misunderstood and could be very damaging and compromising to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Some judges have allowed significant arrears to accumulate and it was the view of the Government in proposing the original legislation that this must be addressed by some form of public incentive to the Judiciary to keep arrears within reasonable limits. The original section was never commenced because of judicial hostility to being told judgments must be delivered within a specified period because, they would say, the interests of justice may require them to delay judgment in particular circumstances. The new approach is that if the judgment is not delivered within a reasonable period the judge must have it listed before him or her again by the registrar and announce a substitute date on which it is intended to deliver the judgment. It is an incentive to delivering reserved judgments and a disincentive to leaving reserved judgments undelivered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for this worthwhile amendment. We are aware of a number of cases where judges have fallen into arrears and that is unacceptable. This measure should go some way towards alleviating that problem.</P>
    <P>More broadly, in many cases the time limit is unacceptable and the workload of judges seems very large. Recognising the separation between the Judiciary and Government, is there some way in which we can address the problems in the courts and the level of arrears by perhaps appointing additional judges to ensure that cases are dealt with more speedily? That would be much more helpful to the people who are taking those cases and to those against whom the cases are being taken. This amendment must be welcomed and should go some way towards alleviating the problems.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. Is there any sort of centralised information regarding the extent of arrears? Could the Minister illustrate &mdash; not necessarily by mentioning particular cases &mdash; how long reserved judgments take in the worst cases? Regarding the register, will it be public and can it be taken up by journalists, if necessary, in particular cases?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an excellent amendment. There are notorious cases where years passed before a judgment was given. The public find this terribly hard to understand. However, we cannot put too many stipulations in the legislation. What the Minister has proposed is probably about right without us being accused of interfering with the mind processes of the Judiciary. Therefore I support the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator Terry&rsquo;s point, more judges are required. I intend in the near future to bring a memorandum to Government in that regard. If I am successful at Government, I may amend this legislation as it goes through the <Col N="27"/>D&aacute;il and bring it back here in an amended form, providing for extra judges. I must first go through that procedure. I agree that in an increasingly complex world, with judges having more and more duties and more and more enactments to consider, and with increasing population and, unfortunately, an increasing caseload in some areas at any rate, it is necessary to have more judges.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh asked a question regarding the types of cases where judgments could be reserved to the point where significant difficulty arose. There have been cases in the past, and I do not want to mention any names because it would be unfair to do so, where some judgments have been undelivered for in excess of 12 months and in some case for more than two years. That has given rise to difficulty. On one occasion an application was made to the European Court of Human Rights based on the failure of the Irish courts to deliver a reserved judgment in a case and compensation was awarded to the party affected by it.</P>
    <P>In the context of the recent ECHR legislation which I piloted through the Houses and which is now law, I exempted the Judiciary, the administration of justice, from the application of the Act itself, but a <i>quid pro quo</i> or balancing item in regard to that was that this measure would be put in place. In other words, there would be an effective means of monitoring any failure in that regard. I do not want to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary. However, what I want to do above all is to ensure that no litigant ends up waiting years for a judgment and wondering what happened to that judgment. Unfortunately, for one reason or another, and very frequently without any malice or conscious default, some cases are sidelined in this way. The effect on the litigants is very significant.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>A judge was effectively forced to resign in the UK because of an inability to deliver reserve judgments within a reasonable period. It is, therefore, not a matter which is confined entirely to Ireland. It seems this mechanism is the best one to make sure that it does not happen. Let us say that Senator Mansergh was a judge and a defaulter in this respect. If he kept reading in the newspapers that he was the worst judge and that his slow speed was the subject of public comment, it would act as an incentive to clear away the arrears and get on with the task. It is a gentle way of ensuring that the task is done. Given that a public register is involved, it gives a strong motivation to the Judiciary to ensure that the maxim that justice delayed is justice denied does not apply to its proceedings.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh asked if there was some form of central register in existence at present. The answer is that there is not. The presidents of some of the courts have written circulars, talked to the registrars of the courts and, on an informal basis, brought delayed judgments to the attention <Col N="28"/>of the members of their courts. There is no organised system at present of a statutory nature. Once the light of media and public attention is shone into the dark corner of reserve judgments, the problem should disappear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for assuring the House that he is looking at providing additional judges. Will he ensure that equality laws apply to judges also? Are judges entitled to maternity and paternity leave? They should get the same rights as every other worker in the country such as holidays and time off. It is my understanding that the same laws might not apply to them. Who ensures that those laws are applied to them? Who is their boss? It is not the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Is it the President of the High Court and the various other presidents and the registrars? Female judges in particular are unable to avail of all the rights afforded to other female workers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for the president of each court as to whether a judge should be allowed leave for any purpose and how the sittings of the court should be arranged to accommodate a judge who has a particular need of the type mentioned by the Senator. It is best left in its current form rather than put into statutory form. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board generally operates on the basis that nobody is appointed to the Bench until he or she is over 40. Many women have children in their 40s, but it may not be as widespread a phenomenon as the Senator imagines. The general rule that people are not appointed as a judge before 40 is due to the feeling that 20 years is a long time to be an arbitral judge on the Bench and 30 years is an even longer time. If any error is made in appointments in terms of temperament or suitability, people in their 20s or 30s will suffer the consequence for a long time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the point about paternity leave, given the age factor that will apply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>One never knows what the male members of the Judiciary would achieve with paternity leave, so we had better say nothing about that matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to leave it at that; the Minister should look at that again. The next time he brings legislation before the House on this issue, we should look at the equality issues in that regard.</P>

<P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 5, line 10, to delete &ldquo;ONE YEAR&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2 YEARS&rdquo;.</P>
   
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is to substitute &ldquo;two years&rdquo; for &ldquo;one year&rdquo; in the Long Title. On Committee Stage, I undertook to examine the issue of the limitation period with my colleagues in Government and the outcome of my consideration of the matter is that I am prepared to accept amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 11, as tabled by Senators Terry and Henry. For completeness, I shall be proposing a consequential amendment to the Long Title at the end of our debate on Report Stage.</P><Col N="30"/>
    <P>Also for completeness and having considered the debate we had here the other day, I believe a common limitation period should apply to all personal injuries actions. Providing a separate period for medical negligence actions could give rise to confusion, especially in the case of mixed actions with a little medical negligence and a little non-medical negligence involved. Therefore, I have introduced amendment No. 10, which is necessary to bring subsection 5(1) of the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act 1991 into line with the other provisions under that Act.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on Committee Stage, I mentioned that my preference was for a limitation period which would apply across the board. There must be clarity on the issue. While I have some sympathy with the points raised by Senators regarding medical negligence claims, I consider that a two year period from the date of accrual of the cause of action or from the date of knowledge of the injury is sufficient time to lodge a claim for medical negligence. It is not my intention, therefore, to exempt medical negligence from the general limitation period of two years.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is not my intention to accept amendment No. 9, which would have the effect of leaving the limitation period for a person under a disability at three years. I have outlined my reasons that a common limitation period should be in place for all personal injuries actions and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I brought this matter to the Government today and secured its agreement to this proposal. In addition to what I have just stated, I am conscious that the one year period is being introduced in the context of an obligation to send the initial warning letter, which is provided for, and also in the context of an obligation not simply to issue a plenary summons before the expiry of the statutory period, but, in the case of a claim for damages for negligence, at the end of the limitation period to issue the personal injuries summons to which this applies setting out the case <i>in extenso</i>. This has to be a very significant statement of one&rsquo;s case and not just a two line formula. In those circumstances, those who may feel disappointed that I am deviating from the one year rule should bear in mind that there are compensating issues, such as the obligation to send an initial letter and the obligation to state one&rsquo;s case in full in the initiating legal document.</P>
    <P>In a personal injuries case involving medical negligence, I could well imagine someone having a traumatic event in a hospital, taking months to recover from it, then going to a solicitor, the solicitor having to spend months researching what actually happened to the client and then, as frequently happens in a small medical community such as Ireland&rsquo;s, having to get a foreign expert to say negligence has occurred which justifies initiating proceedings and to agree to testify to that effect. All that could take quite an amount of time. If it were all to be done within 12 months there was a danger that the courts might have felt <Col N="31"/>that the Bill was a disproportionate interference with a litigant&rsquo;s right of access to the courts.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>
    <P>In those circumstances, I have decided to accept the spirit of the amendments tabled by Senators Terry and Henry and to introduce a two year limitation period across the board.</P>

	<P>The Minister is as good as his word. He has done what he indicated he would do. I have looked at the report of the full debate on this matter on Committee Stage and at the legislation. I am inclined to agree with the Minister that an extraordinary level of complexity would be created if there were one rule for medical negligence cases and another for non-medical negligence cases. I hope the Bill works in practice, considering that the two year period will run from the discovery of an injury or harm.</P>
    <P>I support the amendments and the Minister&rsquo;s approach to them. This is the correct compromise. It is important to get this legislation up and running. A framework is being put in place and this is an essential part of it. These amendments are very important and useful. I commend the Minister on his approach.</P>

    <P>It is right that the period is to be the same for medical and non-medical claims. I write occasionally for the <i>Irish Medical News.</i> After the debate on Second Stage I wrote about the debate and said what the Minister intended to do. While the article was published only yesterday, my colleagues are normally very quick to contact me if they have a complaint about something which is about to happen. I have not had any complaints. Therefore, it seems that they think this is a reasonable length of time.</P>

    <P FLI="0">As stated on Committee Stage, if disability is to be a ground for affording a longer period, incapacity should also be covered. For example, a person who is extremely traumatised or depressed following an accident may have knowledge of his or her injury but may not be in a position to do anything about it. I am asking that we make provision for such a mental condition and ensure such claims are not ruled out. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment because the word &ldquo;disability&rdquo; is a term of art when used in the context of limitations law and does not mean disability in a colloquial sense. Therefore, extending the provision to include incapacity is not necessary in the circumstances. Disability in limitations law includes that the person is an infant, a person of unsound mind, a convict subject to the forfeiture Act or a victim of sexual abuse suffering from consequential psychological injury. Those are the categories of people which count as disabled.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 13 is introduced to close what could be seen as a possible loophole in the original provision. The original wording &ldquo;a person who intends to bring a personal injuries claim&rdquo; was to my mind open to possible abuse. In that regard, it may have been possible for a person to evade the penalty aspect of the provision by stating that he or she did not actually intend to bring an action and was still making up his or her mind. The new provision does not contain those words and its content is <Col N="35"/>otherwise in line with the policy of the original provision.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>
    <P>Subsection (1) now provides that where a plaintiff in a personal injuries action fails to serve a notice in writing on the defendant within two months from the date of the cause of action, the court may draw inferences from the failure as appear proper. The court may also make no order as to the payment of costs to the plaintiff or deduct an appropriate amount from the cost to be paid to the plaintiff. Subsection (2) goes on to define for the purposes of the section the term &ldquo;date of the cause of action&rdquo;. This can be either the date of accrual of the cause of the action or date of knowledge whichever occurs later.</P>
    <P>One of my main objectives in bringing the Bill before the Oireachtas is to ensure that defendants are informed in good time of the wrong alleged to have been done to the plaintiff. It is not acceptable that defendants are only informed late in the limitation period that they may be facing a claim for personal injury damages. The rephrasing of the section means that any person who brings an action and who has not served a letter of claim on the defendant within two months of the date of accrual or of the date of knowledge may be penalised in costs. The provision does not provide that the person will be penalised but that he or she may be penalised and must have a reasonable excuse for not sending the letter. The amendment is in accordance with my thinking on the issue.</P><?oasys _cl11.5-?>
    <P>I opposed on Committee Stage the approach taken in amendment No. 14 and I continue to oppose it. Increasing the time limit goes against the purpose and objectives of the Bill. A two month period is sufficient time for a plaintiff to serve notice on a defendant. There must be a penalty for non-compliance with the procedures for personal injuries actions. In my view, the possibility &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; &mdash; that failure to serve a notice of claim could lead to a court making no order as to costs or to a court deducting an amount from costs is a much greater deterrent than the proposal contained in the amendment.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of amendment No. 15 could negate the section. Certain plaintiffs may be willing to take their chances on not serving a letter of claim if they consider that the penalties for non-compliance are too weak or too limited. It is not right in normal circumstances that a defendant only becomes aware that a claim is pending when he or she receives a personal injuries summons towards the end of the limitation period. As the law stands, that is what can happen and that is a source of much concern. The section, as currently drafted, seeks to ensure defendants are made aware of potential claims within a short period. This provision is an important part of the legislation and for that reason I do not propose to accept amendment No. 15.</P><Col N="36"/><?oasys [fc?>
    <P>I must stress that a claim does not automatically fail for want of sending a warning letter. Also, a claim will not be knocked on the head by the courts for want of serving a warning letter. The law provides that a plaintiff can be penalised if he or she does not provide reasonable cause for not sending a warning letter. Reasonable cause will be determined by the courts.</P>
    <P>In addition, where failure to send a warning letter occurs, without reasonable cause, the courts can draw such inferences as it feels appropriate. If a plaintiff withholds a claim until such time as the defendant is not in a position to investigate the accident and if a fair inference in that regard is that the plaintiff was deliberately making it difficult for the defendant to substantiate the claim, the courts may make whatever inferences it feels appropriate. An example would be a person who allowed at an unconscionable level a building to be repaired or demolished and then claimed the existence of a defective step on the third flight of stairs in that building. In such circumstances, a court could ask why if the person fell down the stairs in February he or she did not by April send a letter of claim and why he or she allowed the building to be demolished without ever drawing the attention of the defendant to the claim.</P>
    <P>The mechanism being provided is a reasonable one and is always subject to the fact that the courts are not obliged to knock a case on the head or to disallow costs unless it believes there has been an unreasonable failure to comply with obligations to warn defendants of a potential claim.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand why the Minister is introducing this provision but I am concerned that the time limit provided is short in terms of people who may be seriously injured. The court will merely note that no letter was sent within two months.</P>
    <P>I hope cognisance will be taken of the fact that if someone is very seriously injured, litigation may be the very last thing on the minds of those concerned &mdash; it cannot be on the mind of the person injured if he is badly injured. This is the only aspect of this that worries me. I hope the measure was interpreted very carefully. I am quite sure the Minister does not want to see anyone who is seriously injured done down but this aspect of the Bill concerns me somewhat because two months go by so quickly in the case of people with serious injuries.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said before, following an accident a person first needs time to recover and then needs time to consider taking legal action. The request for a four month period is quite reasonable. The period of two months is unduly short and therefore I ask the Minister to consider our amendments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my fellow Senators that two months comprise a very short period. Four months would meet the Minister&rsquo;s inten<Col N="37"/>tions. I join Senator Henry in questioning how we will know the courts will interpret the provision in the same way as the Minister. We can only go on what is in the Bill and I am assuming the courts will do the same. While the Minister&rsquo;s intention is in the spirit of the legislation, as alluded to in his remarks, I share Senator Henry&rsquo;s concern. In the interest of fairness, a period of four months, or even a compromise period of three months, would represent a better way forward.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>While I must accept the Minister&rsquo;s judgment on this &mdash; it is a difficult issue of judgment &mdash; I urge him to consider it further as the Bill goes through the Oireachtas. All of us would have received quite strong representations from the legal profession on this matter and I see some merit in the suggestion of Senator O&rsquo;Meara that a period of three months should be considered as a compromise.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage, I said I was not attracted by the amendment and remained unconvinced of its necessity. If I were to accept the amendment it would mean that a party failing to attend a conference as directed by a court could escape the consequence if their failure was reasonable. This implies that the court in giving the direction to attend would be acting in a manner requiring them to do something unreasonable. I cannot accept that construction and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

    <P FLI="0">During our discussion on Committee Stage on these amendments, I said I would consider re-tabling them on Report Stage on the basis that clarity is required.

	<P>The situation remains the same. This is a matter on which I would like the Minister to have the capacity to initiate change and prescribe the period. If I simply left it to rules of court it would mean that unless the committee made a proposal to me, nothing could ever happen in these circumstances. On balance, I would prefer to have the right of initiative in this area. It does not mean that the courts cannot propose their own substitutes if I fail to come up with any.</P>

   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 22, between lines 12 and 13 to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>g</i>) the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act 1991;&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment seeks to include the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act 1991 among the list of relevant enactments coming within the terms of section 31(1) of the Bill. The term &ldquo;relevant enactments&rdquo; means those provisions for the hearing of family law matters other than in public. Section 1(2) of the 1991 Act provides that the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts 1961 to 1988 and the Act in so far as it affects the jurisdiction or procedure of any court in the State shall be construed together as one.</P>
    <P>Section 45 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 provides that justice may be administered in public in minor matters and is a relevant enactment under section 31(1) of the Bill. As I am informed of the matters already covered, the amendment is not necessary.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 22, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) the disclosure or publication of data or results of research conducted relating to proceedings, or&rdquo;</P>
    <P FLI="0">Section 31(2) seems to permit only a report of proceedings and the judgment. There is nothing in it to permit the publication of the results of <Col N="44"/>systematic research or academic studies of trends or aspects of family law cases. As this kind of work has proved very valuable in other fields and we must provide for it here if we are to learn from the way in which family law courts operate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second this important amendment. People involved in work in this area must build up knowledge as to what types of families are most at risk. In the absence of data it will be extremely difficult for them to do this without relying on anecdotal evidence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my colleagues on this side of the House. The need for the information Senator Henry referred to is becoming increasingly evident. There are calls from many quarters to make the information available. I hope the Minister will address the clear need. We cannot rely simply on anecdotal evidence. We must have solid, clear information and statistical evidence. I hope the Minister will take this on board.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an important difference between the provisions of the proposed Bill and the wording of amendment No. 36. On the face of it, the Bill simply provides for a straightforward, deadpan report be it verbatim or summary. The amendment involves some degree of assessment and analysis as well as a report. Whether the exact wording of the amendment fits the Bill or whether after further reflection the Minister might consider a variation on it, the point underlining it has some validity. Perhaps the Minister can persuade us that there are compelling reasons to provide that only a verbatim or summary report can be permitted but I do not see the reason for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I regard the current state of the Bill to be slightly unsatisfactory in this area. As I indicated in the House previously, it was my plan to bring forward a revised proposal. Due to the time constraints on me, I have not been in a position to put my formulation into exact and proper terminology. I intend to move an amendment when the Bill comes before the D&aacute;il. When it returns here, we will have an opportunity to consider it if that is agreeable to the House. This attitude also applies to the amendments which follow. I accept fully that there is a problem and I will deal with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister says. It would be nice if our amendments could be accepted where the Minister is in agreement with us. Is it correct that he is not in a position to accept them today?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I prefer not to accept them as I do not regard them to be satisfactory. I must do a little more homework on the matter.</P>

   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 22, between lines 30 and 31 to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) The Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for Ireland,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">With the tolerance of the Cathaoirleach, before speaking to the amendment I note that we are being very lenient with the Minister. We accept his <i>bona fides</i> entirely and the need to advance the legislation whereas normally we would create a song and dance about the fact that he has not had time to bring the amendments before us which he said he would. We have all been involved in strenuous activities over the last week or so. As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the only problem is that when the Minister brings the amendments before the House, we will not debate them. We will either take them or leave them. While the Minister is being broadminded and we are having a useful discussion on the legislation which we are improving, it is not good practice simply to rely on coming back to the House to change the Bill again. I trust this will not arise again as the circumstances are slightly unusual.</P>
    <P>The aims of amendments Nos. 37 and 39 are self-evident. We considered the provisions on Committee Stage when I was asked to put them forward for clarity and to be helpful. The Minister said he would consider the provisions in the context of what is necessary and he may be coming back to us with his own views later.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment and the comments of Senator O&rsquo;Meara to the effect that we like to have amendments discussed here. They will be a <i>fait accompli</i> when they come back to us. The Minister can see what a reasonable body of people he has here with which to discuss these amendments. We have made good progress with this Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have not completed my homework, I will accept the amendments for the time being as a gesture. I may have to tidy them up later. While reporters from the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for Ireland are among the type of people I have in mind, I will not tie myself to the particular phraseology of the amendment in the last analysis.</P>

  <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 38 and 40 are related and may be discussed together, by agreement. I point out a correction to amend<Col N="46"/>ment No. 40 as circulated in which the line reference should read &ldquo;between lines 15 and 16&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 22, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4) Nothing in this section shall permit the publication or broadcast of journalistic or news reports of a case relating solely to a relevant enactment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I expressed concern previously that section 31 will allow journalists and reporters to cover very private matters. The last thing we want following enactment of the legislation is to pick up our newspapers to find explicit details of someone&rsquo;s private life. We must ensure that will not happen. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. I am quite sure the Minister is as concerned as we are to ensure there should be nothing voyeuristic about attendance at family law cases. It is the concern of all of us to allow a body of jurisprudence on family law to be built up to give judges, barristers and solicitors an idea of what each is doing. We must also ensure the public realises how serious some of these cases are but that should not mean only the most sensational cases are reported. This is especially true of cases which involve people in the public eye or those who are not in a position to defend themselves by taking court cases where they are all too readily identified from details reported. This amendment is the best way we could think of to address the concerns we all share.</P>
  
   </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>When we discussed this on Committee Stage I said that balance is necessary and important, because quite rightly there is a demand that justice be seen to be done. The current situation is not satisfactory. We need reportage but not a free-for-all with people&rsquo;s privacy invaded. I ask the Minister to ensure that as far as possible a good balance is retained. I also suggested on Committee Stage that the Minister should enter into discussions with the National Union of Journalists. He did not indicate at the time that he had done so. I assume he has not and ask him to consider having such discussions. We should not assume that all journalists will be responsible regarding the reporting of court matters.</P>
    <P>I read the obituaries of Mary Holland. In the past, the former <i>The Irish Times</i> journalist Mary Maher, along with Mary Holland, Nell McCafferty and others, uncovered in <i>The Irish Times</i> an entire area of Irish life which needed to be uncovered. Other newspapers did similar work. We must remember that the media play an important role in keeping the public informed of what is going on, but must also be accountable. It is difficult to get the balance right. I accept that professional standards in journalism have fallen <Col N="47"/>in some areas and that we do not feel as confident as we used to regarding how matters are reported. I ask the Minister to retain a good balance as far as is possible when he is framing law in this area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Senators for their remarks. This is an area where we must get the balance right. I said I was not disposed to accept these amendments because, well-intentioned as they are, they do not quite achieve the right balance. For instance, would it be desirable that members of the public could enter courtrooms where such proceedings were going on and listen merely out of curiosity? Would it be desirable that an employer, for example, should send someone to a court to listen to the family law matters of an employee? That would not be acceptable. Such situations could expose people, particularly those in public life, to severe pressures. For such a person to be watched in the course of a family law case by people who, even if prohibited from identifying the person, might well chat about it in the pub afterwards, could grossly inhibit the proper conduct of family law cases and the proper decision-making process in issues as sensitive as the custody of children, their psychological well-being and so on.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that while we are dealing with a matter where privacy is an important issue because the entire process is essentially a private matter, we must also have some sort of system whereby State interference with those private matters in the form of judicial arbitration is subject to some degree of accountability thereafter. Striking that balance is not easy. I need a little more time to come up with a formulation and I accept that it would be more desirable if I could have done so by today. The thinking caps are on in the Department regarding this matter, and the formulation to be brought forward will cover all the points made today and will be more protective of privacy than the current text appears to be.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I thank the Minister for his comments on Committee Stage which suggested he would accept this amendment. It is tabled because there can sometimes be some urgency with these cases. It would be a great pity if due to delay in going to another court the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for example, or schools, or those minding children were not informed of the judgment that had taken place in the family law case. That is a greater concern of mine than the additional costs involved in going to another court. I hope the Minister has decided to accept this amendment.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for the manner in which he dealt with this Bill. We were very pleased at its initial introduction in this House. It deals with two very important areas. No one could be unconcerned at the way personal injuries claims have gone in this country and it was important to tighten the legislation. That is why the Minister got such support in this House. I thank the Minister for accepting the amendments which mainly related to time, and I am particularly grateful regarding the section on reporting of the family law courts. This has been an area of great concern to many of us for some years because so little information came out of those courts.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was Attorney General he said that the <i>in camera </i>rule had to be interpreted very strictly as it was. I am glad to see that when he became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform he rapidly brought forward this Bill which I hope will allow us to make great improvements in those courts, which are more important to many people than any of the civil or criminal courts. The family courts are of great importance to people and I am delighted with the changes the Minister has made in this area.</P>

It is an example of how we can work together to produce better legislation. I would like to see other Ministers taking the view of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He clearly has full ownership of the legislation. It may not be exactly what we on this side of the House want but once passed this legislation will have a transforming and necessary effect on the whole area.

   <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
    <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the <Col N="50"/>State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30 June 2004.&rdquo;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">The motion before the House seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June 2004. It is worth recalling the circumstances in which the 1998 Act was enacted. In August 1998, the Omagh bomb brutally snuffed out the lives of 29 innocent people and injured more than 200 others. That terrible atrocity has reverberated throughout the island of Ireland ever since, and rightly so. There was a determination then, as now, that those responsible for that mass murder would not succeed in subverting the democratically expressed will of the people and that the Northern Ireland conflict should be resolved only by peaceful means and on the basis of consent.</P>
    <P>To date, one person has been convicted in this jurisdiction on a charge related to the Omagh bomb, and another person has recently been charged in Northern Ireland. I emphasise that the investigation is continuing at a very high level on both sides of the Border, with excellent co-operation between the Garda authorities and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. It is worth reiterating that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will never cease in the search for those responsible for that atrocity.</P>
    <P>It will also be recalled that, in recognition of the particular circumstances surrounding the enactment of the provisions of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that the Act should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas. The purpose of this recurring Oireachtas scrutiny is to determine if the circumstances then prevailing in 1998 justify the continuance in force of its provisions or whether there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to convince the Oireachtas that the provisions were no longer needed. Accordingly, under section 18 of the Act, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, and by virtue of resolutions passed most recently by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 and 26 June 2003, sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 will cease to operate from 30 June 2004. That is, of course, unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for a period of up to 12 months.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is a requirement in the 1998 Act on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lay a report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas prior to any consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. Such a report was laid before this House today. The conclusion of that report &mdash; this is also the view of the Garda authorities &mdash; is that the renewal of the provisions for a further year is absolutely necessary. The regrettable reality is that those responsible for the Omagh bomb continue to pursue and plan a cam<Col N="51"/>paign of violence and that there is no substantive change in the circumstances which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act. In this regard, the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA, which are factions of the republican movement, continue their calculated repudiation of the democratically expressed wishes of the people of Ireland, North and South, for peace in the form of the Good Friday Agreement. These paramilitary groups arrogate to themselves the right to kill and maim in the name of a people and a nation who, time and again, have rejected their path of violence.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that these groups, day in and day out, seek to plan and execute terrorist attacks, both small and large. The House may recall that, in June last year, two enormous improvised explosive devices were intercepted, one by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in County Louth and the other by the PSNI in Derry. Both had the potential to be two more Omaghs, and it was only through dint of excellent police work that further tragedy on a massive scale was averted.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the individual sections of the Act, I should mention the current position as regards the report of the committee to review the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998. The report is an extensive one which deals with complex issues of law and policy. It involves important considerations concerning the balance to be struck between national and international security on the one hand and civil liberties and individual rights on the other. Those recommendations in the report of direct relevance to the purpose and scope of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 were considered in the context of the preparation of that legislation. The Bill, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage debate in the D&aacute;il, will, accordingly, give effect to a limited number of recommendations to that end. A fuller consideration of the recommendations of the committee will be finalised once this Bill has been enacted, and I will then bring further proposals to the Government.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the individual sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 that this House is being asked to continue in force for a further 12 months. In particular, I will briefly outline their purpose and indicate to the House how they have been utilised in the past 12 months. Section 2 was utilised on 29 occasions, with one person charged and convicted in the reporting period. In addition, six persons were convicted during the period under report, having been charged prior to that period in cases where this section was utilised.</P>
    <P>Section 5 was utilised on 16 occasions. This section provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts, and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to <Col N="52"/>draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his defence that he could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. As with section 2, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</P>
    <P>Section 7 was utilised on 12 occasions. This section makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.</P>
    <P>Section 9 was utilised on 30 occasions. This section makes it an offence to withhold information which a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 10 was utilised on one occasion. This section extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court. In the reporting period, no charges resulted in the granting of an extension order, but a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Section 11 was utilised on four occasions. This section allows a judge of the District Court to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he was previously detained under section 30.</P>
    <P>Section 14 was utilised on 76 occasions. The effect of this section is to make the new offences created under sections 6 to 9, inclusive, and 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing these offences are liable to arrest under the provisions of section 30.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to those sections of the 1998 Act that were not utilised, namely, sections 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 17. Section 3 provides that, in proceedings for an offence of membership of an illegal organisation, the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his behalf. This section was not used.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1972. The effect of the 1972 provision is that any statement or conduct by a person accused of membership of an unlawful organisation implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was a member of such an organisation shall be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
    <P>Section 6 establishes the offence of directing at any level of the organisation&rsquo;s structure the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made. Although it was not utilised in terms of criminal charges during the period, one senior member of a dissident republican group was found guilty of this offence last August and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment to run concurrently with a sentence of six <Col N="53"/>years imprisonment for membership of that organisation.</P>
    <P>Continuing with those sections of the 1998 Act that were not utilised in the period under report, section 8 makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation. Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training. Although this section was not used in the reporting period, one person arrested for membership was subsequently charged with receiving training in the use of firearms. Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 providing for the forfeiture of property.</P>
    <P>This information is based on data received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid before this House. This report, together with the previous reports, shows that the key provisions of the Act are continuing to be used to good and proper effect. One of the most significant results in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s fight against subversive activity was the conviction of a person on a charge of conspiracy to cause an explosion related to the Omagh bomb. The provisions of the 1998 Act were used appropriately by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this case and will continue to be used in its efforts to bring to justice all of those responsible for that and other unjustifiable acts of terrorism. Equally, however, the relatively modest number of occasions on which the provisions of the 1998 Act have been used by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na demonstrates that these provisions have been applied in a reasoned and proportionate manner.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and, although the current pace of progress leaves much to be desired, it is the only show in town. However, as I have already mentioned, there are those who would do everything in their power to subvert the peace process through violence. One need only examine the recently published First Report of the Independent Monitoring Commission to see just how much of a threat these dissident republican groups pose.</P>
    <P>In the IMC report, the Real IRA is described as having access to a significant quantity of arms and equipment and as being potentially a very dangerous terrorist group. Since the Omagh bombing, attacks attributed to the Real IRA include the bombing of Shackleton Barracks in February 2000, a sporadic but high-profile campaign in Britain, including a rocket-propelled grenade attack on the Security Intelligence Service headquarters. There have also been some recent attacks on the British military, as well as against people involved in the Policing Board and district policing partnerships.</P>
    <P>The IMC report goes on to state that the primary focus of Real IRA attacks remains on security force bases and personnel in Northern Ireland and on those involved in the new policing <Col N="54"/>arrangements but that a wide range of targets cannot be ruled out, including targets in Britain.</P>
    <P>The IMC characterises the Continuity IRA in similar vein. Although it is described as a limited organisation with a relatively small membership, the IMC considers that it can, by operating through small units, mount effective, if sporadic, attacks. The Continuity IRA is further said to have access to an unknown quantity of weapons and explosives and has technical expertise sufficient to construct improvised explosive devices. In the last year or so, the group has carried out a number of successful attacks, including an attack on a military barracks, one on a town hall, and one on a Unionist politician&rsquo;s constituency office. It was also responsible for a recent arson attack on the vehicle of a member of a district policing partnership and has targeted other members. Furthermore, it has recently been involved in setting up new active service units.</P>
    <P>Finally, the IMC goes on to describe the relationship between the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA as, seemingly, one of co-operation.</P>
    <P>That is a small glimpse of their activities because I know from my functions as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that both organisations are also engaged in major low grade criminality, connected to the drugs world, levying drug pushers, sorting out disputes between them and other terrible crimes. They will also lend their firearms for reward to common criminals to carry out criminal acts. That is what they are up to. When thinking of the invocation of Pearse and others at the end the 1916 Proclamation not to bring dishonour and shame upon the arms of the republican movement, I wonder how even they, in their warped and twisted logic, square that one.</P>
    <P>This motion offers us the opportunity to keep in being, although under scrutiny, valuable provisions of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which I would be happy at some stage to tell the House were no longer necessary but I would be derelict in my duty if I was to do so now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his address on this important matter. He knows that when the Act was amended in 1998, following the Omagh atrocity, the Government gave a commitment to all sides of the House that not only would this resolution be put on an annual basis but there would also be provision for a report being placed by the Minister in the Oireachtas Library concerning the rationale for continuing with these draconian provisions. It is important that we debate this on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>I have read the Minister&rsquo;s short report on the rationale for the continuance of the Act and I fully agree with him and with the view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the need to retain these measures as a means of countering terrorism in both parts of the island and ensuring that maximum co-operation exists to put these people behind bars, where they belong. The Minister has <Col N="55"/>the support of this side of the House in bringing this resolution to the House and in arguing for it.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that in the report the Minister placed in the Library on 14 June 2004, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na states in no uncertain terms in paragraph 8 that there were 14 convictions in the period under report in connection with subversive activities and a further 30 persons were charged during the period and are awaiting trial. A total of 14 convictions have resulted from the legislation that was amended in 1998 following the Omagh atrocity; that is important. Most significantly, for the first time a charge was brought against an individual for directing terrorism.</P>
    <P>The Northern authorities should learn from this. Recently, as the Minister is aware, the case against four alleged members of the Real IRA was dropped in the Northern Ireland courts as a result of a loophole in the legislation there whereby the Real IRA, which is proscribed in this jurisdiction, was not specified as an organisation banned under the Terrorism Act 2000. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is appealing the case but it is worth pointing out because attention should be paid to this matter on both sides of the Border and a consistent approach taken in both jurisdictions. The authorities in Northern Ireland, particularly the Secretary of State, have a responsibility to the families of the Omagh victims to do everything in their power to ensure that charges outstanding against many of the individuals directly involved in the planting of the bomb and motivating others to carry out the atrocity are brought to bear. It is good to hear that the investigation will continue until such time as all charges are laid against these people for one of the most serious atrocities in the Troubles in the North.</P>
    <P>These fanatical organisations still refuse to accept the new form of self determination which the Irish people accepted when they voted for the Good Friday Agreement. We must be careful from a counter-terrorism standpoint to keep a close eye on these people and be on our guard at all times because they have no democratic compulsion whatsoever. They exist merely to frustrate the will of the Irish people and to bring down any possibility of putting in place the Good Friday Agreement on a lasting basis and they must be squashed and sat upon by every means possible. This is why this draconian legislation will continue in place until such time as these fanatics move off the scene and are put behind bars indefinitely.</P>
    <P>It is important that all the offices of the State, specifically the Criminal Assets Bureau, are brought to bear on these people. As the Minister rightly pointed out, this group and others are involved in a whole range of illegal activities. It is important that the Criminal Assets Bureau should be enabled to do everything in its power, even if it needs more support or changes in the legislation, to close down the significant operations in place by these people to carry out their <Col N="56"/>particular form of terrorism. It is important that the Criminal Assets Bureau should continue its work in this regard and do everything in its power to investigate the criminal links that exist within these organisations.</P>
    <P>As some of the weaponry from the Continuity IRA got into the hands of the criminal fraternity in Limerick city last year, it is very important that this matter is continually monitored, because these people trade in arms. They have no compunction about giving arms to various organisations as a means of extracting a price from them. Much of the gangland feuding in our cities stems directly from the fact that much of this illegal weaponry remains in place and intact and the hardware can be sold on or leased out at various times to these individuals and other criminal groups. This is why it is important to sit on them and wipe them out.</P>
    <P>Younger and madder republicans than the breed we saw in the 1970s and 1980s are still to the fore in some of our universities. Some of the universities are still the recruiting ground for the more irredentist illogical breed of republicans who still refuse to accept the will of the Irish people. The Real IRA used a particular university as a recruiting ground and preyed on young people as a means of bringing them into the United Kingdom and causing havoc at some point in the future. It is important to be aware of this fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the continued threat by the Real IRA referred to in the latest report of the IMC. Like other Members of the House, members of the Fine Gael Party met this morning with the IMC, which I compliment on its work. It shone an important light on the murky world of paramilitary political parties who operate in this State and in the other state. The rationale for the IMC remains important because it continues to expose the fundamental anti-democratic tendencies of paramilitary political parties, some of which are on the peace message but most of whom are not.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party welcomes this resolution. It is important that it remains in place and that these powers are given to the law enforcement authorities to ensure those who are directly responsible, not just for the Omagh atrocity but for the continuation of their fascist message to our people, because they refuse to accept the will of the Irish people, are rounded up and ultimately put in prison. They will not accept the wishes of the Irish people because they are not democrats and never have been. They used their neo-racist argument against British people for the past 90 years to continue their war in this country and in the neighbouring island. The Government, which is committed to international treaties and is a Government within the European Union, must do everything in its power to squash these people and ensure their deadly message is once and for all taken from society. Members on this side of the House, particularly the Fine Gael Party, welcome the resolution and support the joint co-<Col N="57"/>operation between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in ensuring these people are brought before the courts.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. However, I do not welcome the fact that the resolution is still, unfortunately, necessary. The Minister, in his former capacity as Attorney General, and I, in my former capacity as adviser, took part in proceedings of the Northern Ireland Cabinet sub-committee when this response to the terrible Omagh bomb was being formulated. It was necessary then and it is necessary now. The firm and vigorous response of the Government at the time contributed substantially to the temporary ending of the Real IRA campaign because all the powers necessary to deal with it existed. Unfortunately, as the campaign resumed some time afterwards, this legislation will remain necessary until terrorism of all sorts is ended.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the vigour with which it has pursued both the perpetrators of the Omagh bomb and the perpetrators of all the other actions undertaken both then and since by the Real IRA. I regret any notion or suggestion &mdash; my name was drawn into this at one stage &mdash; that the Government would in any way soften in regard to two objectives, namely, the ending of the campaign of violence and the vigorous prosecution of those responsible for the Omagh bomb, the bombs that preceded it but did not cause the same loss of life and any further acts they might commit. Some members of that organisation in Portlaoise Prison have expressed doubts about continuing with the campaign. It should be clear to any thinking person that there is nothing positive to be gained by pursuing that tactic. I look forward to the day when they accept they have been defeated by the Irish people and those acting on their behalf.</P>
    <P>It is criminal to draw young people into something which is not just criminal but utterly hopeless and which could at best succeed in putting people who could be more productively and positively used behind bars for much of their lives. I regard as particularly pernicious the attempts to intimidate people from joining or staying in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which is a necessary step. I was particularly pleased that the Minister&rsquo;s special adviser applied for and was accepted as a media and public relations officer for the PSNI. She worked not only with the Minister but also, previously, with the Taoiseach when he was Leader of the Opposition. That sends an important signal to those who would still be tempted to demonise the effort to establish a new reformed police service in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is not necessarily perfect and that there might be, in certain instances, legacies of the past that still need to be addressed and dealt with through various inquiries. We had to co-operate, for our safety and for the benefit of the people of Ireland, with the unreformed RUC. There was good co-operation but obviously it is far more satisfactory to be able to work closely <Col N="58"/>with the new reformed Police Service of Northern Ireland. We have every interest in making it a success. It is both essential and important that the republican movement, at the earliest opportunity, give its support to and participate in it so we can confront whatever remnant remains that is unreconstructed.</P>
    <P>I do not have a problem with dissident republicanism that does not engage in violence. There is a body of dissident republican intellectuals who publish their views. There is no harm in having critical voices, regardless of the standpoint from which they originate, within the republican movement and coming from the republican tradition. What is indefensible, however, is attempting to attract people from the mainstream movement into continuing what is an absolutely hopeless campaign. I have always taken the view that democracy is inherent in any sane republican philosophy but if it is ever the case that republicanism and democracy find themselves on opposite sides, democracy will always win.</P>
    <P>There are many ideological absurdities. It is sad, for example, that in Republican Sinn F&eacute;in and the Continuity IRA there are people who still cannot recognise the existence and achievements of this Republic over so many years. It is a real existing Republic, as opposed to some fantasy that never existed in real terms in the past. That somebody should spend their life living in this Republic and be unable to accept or recognise it as such, incomplete though it might be, is very sad.</P>
    <P>There is a letters column in the <i>Irish News</i> where one can read letters from what one might call dissident republicans. I noticed one last week from somebody associated with the 32 County Sovereignty Movement. The person spoke about standing up for socialism. If one means hardline, irreversible socialism, that is not possible except in a Marxist state and democracy would have to be suspended to achieve it. The person also claimed to stand for anti-sectarianism. That is ludicrous coming from a remnant of a movement that has no input or participation whatsoever from the other tradition or community in the island. Their position involves either forcing that tradition to accept an imposed united Ireland or, as somebody from that source once put it, going like the people from Cork did in the 1920s. I recall replying that my grandmother came from County Cork and she did not go.</P>
    <P>That attitude is a travesty of the republicanism of the United Irishmen, which was based on traditions or elements of traditions coming together, and that of the 1916 Proclamation which spoke of cherishing all the children of the nation equally. It is an utterly degenerate form of republicanism.</P>
    <P>People should not cease, in addition to taking any security and police measures that are necessary, confronting these ideological assumptions. That had to be done with the mainstream republican movement in the late 1980s and it was a far from unprofitable exercise. One must question the assumptions people have in this type of closed <Col N="59"/>world where everything adds up in terms of mathematical logic, as it were, but not in terms of any sort of humanity.</P>
    <P>I support this resolution. It will be a wonderful day for Ireland when these two dissident republican organisations decide to accept the will of the Irish people. I am not aware that anybody stood in any of the recent elections to represent their viewpoints, let alone got elected. The will of the Irish people today matters, as Pearse would have written in 1914 and 1915. It matters and we cannot refer to an electorate that has long since disappeared from this earth.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank both Senators for their contributions. This House is well aware of the seriousness of the threat we face. I echo what Senator Mansergh and Senator Hayes said about the dissident republicans. They are seducing innocent and guileless individuals into a wholly warped and hopeless expression of something which itself is a caricature of what it pretends to be.</P>
    <P>As Senator Mansergh said, people are entitled to have convictions. I do not care if there are some people who believe they are the direct descendants of Cardinal Rinuccini&rsquo;s Confederation of Kilkenny or if there is a group of people in some back street in the Liberties still carrying on the Emmet revolution in their own minds. So be it; they are entitled to these views. If, on the other hand, one takes a life or sets out to murder somebody or to ruin young people&rsquo;s lives or have them thrown into our jails, it is a different matter. It is entirely wrong and evil and it must be confronted. The sad fact about the so called dissident republicans is that their only ultimate aim is to try and re-ignite an undeclared civil war on this island.</P>
    <P>The true vocation of republicanism now is to hark back to Tone, Emmet and Davis and to the process of reconciliation. It is to take the tricolour <Col N="60"/>which is waved so often these days and to state that its purpose was to symbolise a society that reconciled green and orange and that united both not simply by subjugation but by a voluntary act of the will. The crucial issue now must be that the Good Friday Agreement in the minds of all true republicans, among whom I number myself, be the context in which that great act of reconciliation, which has not yet happened on this island, can take place. Without that, the republican spirit of the people of this island will be completely thwarted. If there is no reconciliation of orange and green there will be no genuine republic in Ireland, rather there will be a separatist State. People will leave on boats, as Senator Mansergh said, because they cannot fit into a monochrome and introverted view of republicanism and Irish history.</P>
    <P>I agree with what has been stated here and I echo what has been said on both sides of the House: this so-called dissident threat is threadbare. It is perverse and grotesque and is fated to fail. I address myself to the people involved because I know they read about all these matters through their various organs. People in Portlaoise Prison and elsewhere should not mistake the resolve of democratic Ireland to see them off the stage.</P>
