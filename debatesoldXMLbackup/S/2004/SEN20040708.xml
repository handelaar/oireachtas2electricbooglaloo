	<P>I have received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give an update on the application by Limerick County Council for approvals in relation to refurbishment works at Glenma housing estate, Croom, County Limerick.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to give a progress report on his Department&rsquo;s plans for the roll out of additional quality bus corridors in Dublin.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a motion regarding the designation of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service as the authorised committee for the purposes of section 32(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Civil Liability and Courts Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 11.30 a.m.; No. 3, Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 11.30 a.m. and to conclude at 1 p.m.; No. 4, Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 1 p.m. and to conclude no later than 1.30 p.m.; No. 5, Maritime Security Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 1.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 2.30 p.m.; and No. 6, Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill 2003 &mdash; <Col N="1094"/>Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 2.30 p.m. and to conclude at 4.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>Regarding No. 1, section 32(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a joint committee of both Houses shall review from time to time the operation of any provisions of any enactment that authorise or require the non-disclosure of any record and to ascertain whether specified legislative change is required. The authorised committee must report the results of its review to both Houses.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The prospect of health officers running around the pubs of this country to take the names of people who are smoking is quite Orwellian. In the current situation where one County Galway publican is openly flouting the smoking ban and others are considering doing the same, would the Leader agree that a calm and reasoned approach is necessary? People must realise that the law is the law and it must be implemented.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>While this breach of the law may just be a publicity stunt on behalf of one publican or a group of publicans, the anti-smoking legislation is important in terms of sending out a strong public health warning against the dangers of smoking. Another report regarding the dangers of passive smoking was published in Britain last week. I ask the Government to move swiftly on this matter and I compliment the Minister for Health and Children on his actions to date. It is important that every citizen should realise that laws enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas must be enforced locally. Nobody is above the law and nobody has the right to decide not to implement the law where he or she is obliged to do so. The Government has moved quickly on this and I encourage it and the health authorities which have a responsibility locally to continue in the same vein.</P>
    <P>The House shall debate the State Airports Bill 2004 next week and I ask the Leader if time might be given during that discussion to consider the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s report of yesterday to the T&aacute;naiste. A short debate would be useful and perhaps the T&aacute;naiste could attend to respond to the various recommendations in the report. The most important of these are the need for Ireland to retain its competitive edge and to root out uncompetitive practices in the economy and the necessity of a vibrant immigration policy which is based on skills shortages in the existing economy. There was a harsh rebuke for the Government&rsquo;s policy in that area to date. Regarding the national spatial strategy, the report stated there was a need to build up capacity in the new economic hubs that the Government has highlighted as opposed to the dispersal approach evident in the decentralisation programme. We should debate this matter next week given that the D&aacute;il is not sitting.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The first item on the Order of Business regarding the designation of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service is simply a matter of dealing with the question of which groups and institutions should be subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Recently we received the annual report of the Information Commissioner which has been dealt with by the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which had a meeting with the commissioner yesterday. The issues arising are astounding and are much worse than those which arose last year when the Act was amended. The implications and consequences of this amendment are far worse than we ever expected and we should review this in the autumn. Requests for information have reduced by 80% in some cases. We all agreed people were abusing the Act but this statistic points to people not being able to use the Act. Ireland is the only country which sets a charge of &euro;150 for an appeal to an information commissioner. As far as our Information Commissioner is concerned, her job is stalled. The flow of information has been stopped. A number of weeks ago, Senator Brian Hayes asked for a debate on the report. We should come back to it in the autumn as there is no immediate rush to have a debate. However, it should be made clear to Government that this is not good enough.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Aer Rianta Bill, unfortunately, will be pushed through next week. The House will be prevented from making changes and it will be an absolute charade. I accept Second Stage will be useful to put issues on the record but, after that, it will be a charade. Did the Attorney General give advice to the Government on the Bill before it was published? Has the Attorney General been made aware of the conditions and restrictions attaching to the &euro;500 million borrowings of Aer Rianta? Is the Government, including the Attorney General, satisfied no risk attaches to those borrowings going forward? There are significant problems and this issue needs to be addressed. I will return to it at a later date. However, I would like clarity on whether the Attorney General has examined this issue and whether he has been absolutely assured no restrictions attach to Aer Rianta&rsquo;s borrowings; otherwise, what is proposed would be dangerous and risky for the taxpayer.</P>

	<P>There are many laws with which I disagree. That is the nature of democracy but I have no right to break any of them and nobody has the right to claim the right to break the law. I, therefore, enthusiastically support the promised action by the Minister for Health and Children relating to the smoking ban and he should have the vocal support of all Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no way to avoid tyranny other than by the rule of law and if people believe it is uncomfortable or difficult for them, they should seek to have the law changed. They should not be allowed, under any circumstances, to break the law. I regret that the Minister can yet again go charging into the smoke and, therefore, escape his obligations to deal with the major problems in the health service. However, somebody else created this problem.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening reasonableness and common sense on the part of a member of the Government enabled us to reach a reasonable position on the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004. The Minister for Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs agreed to return to it in the autumn and he assured me he would recommit the legislation so that a sane and sensible Committee Stage can be taken then. Will the Leader confirm this is the case?</P>
    <P>This sets a good example, which, perhaps, another Minister could have followed in terms of providing time for a sensible, rational discussion in the autumn, when there will not be a shortage of debating time. I compliment the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. We started in tetchy humour and we shouted a little each other but good sense prevailed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Flattery will get the Leader everywhere.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That was yesterday&rsquo;s business. The Senator should return to today&rsquo;s business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Cathaoirleach would at least have complimented me on being nice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give compliments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the report of the enterprise strategy group, I am disappointed Members did not receive copies of it. It is astonishing that newspapers could publish multiple pages of the report, yet Members of the Oireachtas did not receive a copy. I have long learned not to trust newspaper summaries of such reports because ideology and other things get in the way.</P>
    <P>I am interested to hear about the emphasis on immigration in the report because I had not picked up on that in the articles I read. A serious debate on immigration is needed because it does not only concern a shortage of skills. Many immigrants have no skills and they are imported into areas of the economy where there is a shortage of people to do unskilled work. It would be extremely invidious to put together an immi<Col N="1097"/>gration policy, which provided green cards for people with skills and sustained a form of bonded labour whereby many people coming to Ireland to work, particularly in the catering industry, would not have skills or qualifications. Our immigration policy must be based on the need for workers in the economy and not on skills and qualifications.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that the House should discuss the report but I would rather leave it until the autumn so that we can have a long, detailed debate because this is an extremely important document. Predictably, economists are saying the same thing they have been saying for 20 years. Given the number of prominent economists who make the same comments over and over again, I am inclined to rephrase Clinton&rsquo;s famous comment &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the economy, stupid&rdquo;. In this country the problem is the stupid economists.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senators Brian Hayes and Ryan for a debate on the enterprise strategy report, about which we have all read this morning. It would be timely to have the debate next week, given that the State Airports Bill 2004 will also be debated. The report has implications for the mid-west region and Shannon Development and it makes a number of interesting comments in this regard. I also have not read the report in its entirety and I am depending largely on media reports. However, I have received a number of calls from people in Clare and the mid-west. There is great concern about the provisions of the State Airports Bill 2004 and the strategy report. People are concerned about their jobs in State agencies and the concentration of industrial development in the region. Under the decentralisation programme, Enterprise Ireland will be based at Shannon. Notwithstanding that, the retention of knowledge and skills of employees of Shannon Development has been crucial to the development of the area. The strategy needs to be addressed in a careful and calculated way going forward.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the enterprise strategy report. I presume there will not be sufficient time next week to schedule anything other than brief statements but it is important that time should be set aside for a debate at the earliest date. This is an interesting and fundamental report and its recommendations on immigration and migrant labour present a major challenge to society. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs recently examined the future economic development of Europe and the central finding of its report was that over the next decade tens of millions of people will have to migrate to the Union if its economic base is to be sustained. If that is the picture in Europe <Col N="1098"/>generally, there will be a similar requirement in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We debated the issue of citizenship and racism in recent months. Significant numbers of foreign workers must be allowed into the State if economic progress is to be sustained. It will be a challenge to a society to address this issue fully, accept it openly and put structures in place to meet the recommendations as quickly as possible. A thorough debate is required and it will be a great challenge to us politically and to every other citizen to accept in a mature fashion the requirements of the Ireland of the new millennium.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of Senator Brian Hayes about the defiance of the smoking ban. He has isolated an important issue. No sectoral interest has the right to flout the law, particularly when it involves potential damage to the health of citizens. It is wrong and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to urgently raise a case with the Department of Foreign Affairs, which relates to a young Chinese man who was studying in Ireland. He is a Falun Gong practitioner who was put in a labour camp by the Chinese authorities. As a result of pressure involving the Irish Government he was released some time ago. He wishes to return to Ireland with his wife to resume his studies here but he has been held up in the Irish Embassy because of a visa problem. It is remarkable that someone should be allowed out by the Chinese authorities after all this difficulty and then, for bureaucratic reasons, have another problem. His name is Feng Liu and I would be grateful if the Leader would raise this matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>This House played a role in a discussion on abortion, and I took a particular line on the freedom of information about abortion in light of my experience. We now have a dreadful situation in that at least two backstreet abortions have been performed on members of the immigrant or asylum seeking community. Part of this results from the mean-spirited removal of certain sections of the population from the operation of the social security services. We say we are serious about the respect for the right to life and such ideals but as we speak employers are entitled to refuse to renew work permits for people like these two women once they become pregnant. That is shameful and we should draw it to the attention of the relevant authorities, as it is the kind of pressure which leads to abortions. If we are serious we should address this issue and make life easier for these unfortunate women.</P>
    <P>A debate on the Freedom of Information Act is necessary in light of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report. Ms O&rsquo;Reilly said, as we predicted on this side of the House, that the charges introduced did not even cover the administration of their imposition. The only reason could be to prevent people from getting access to information. The Taoiseach said yesterday in the D&aacute;il that inquiries to his Department under the Act had dropped to one third of what they were, and the majority of those <Col N="1099"/>requests came from journalists. That is worrying, because journalists have a right to this information. They have a right to investigate, though sometimes they get it wrong and they misinterpret the information they are given. We should be prepared to correct that misinformation but we need a debate on this issue, as what was said on this side of the House has been validated by the Ombudsman.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I have called in the past for a debate on the massive underspend of &euro;650 million in the national development plan on the BMW region, which has Objective One status, and I now do so again. I have highlighted this in the past and I have called on the Leader for a debate on the mid-term review of the BMW region. I want the Government to embark on a programme of real investment in the region. There will be significant decentralisation to the midlands and the west and it is important to have the proper infrastructure in place.</P>
    <P>Rumour is rampant in the midlands and in the House that the new EU Commissioner will be announced by the end of the month and there is speculation that the Leader&rsquo;s name has been put forward for that position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish her well. It would be very embarrassing if she were Commissioner with responsibility for rural development when there is a massive underspend in our area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon would be my <i>chef de cabinet</i>.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the review of the Freedom of Information Act by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and I note that it will report in due course to both Houses. Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the report when it is completed? Will she use her good offices and considerable authority to ensure the Government listens to the recommendations of the committee?</P>
    <P>When I heard on the radio this morning that the Garda is investigating backstreet abortions involving foreign women in Ireland I, like many others, was appalled. Refugees and asylum seekers existing on &euro;19 per week and illegal workers who clearly feel they cannot leave the country now form part of what can only be described as a hidden Ireland. They lack social protection to such an extent that they feel it necessary to have illegal, backstreet abortions and to put their health at risk. We cannot ignore that and we should look at this as legislators. At the minimum it is ironic that having passed a referendum based on the so-called propensity of asylum seekers and women from third countries to have babies in Ireland, one of the first stories to emerge after that referendum is the horrific reality of back<Col N="1100"/>street abortions taking place here. That is appalling.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to make time in the autumn for a debate on dyslexia. We had a very good rolling debate on autism, which was very useful, and I have been asked by several people about a debate on dyslexia. I will discuss this with the Leader later.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the remarks of Senator Norris. All right-minded people will be appalled by his revelations and I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to have this matter investigated. I wonder if the person who carried out those backstreet abortions is still in the country. The chances are they may not be.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They are gone.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event this must be nipped in the bud. I am appalled by the revelations and I demand an immediate investigation. This must be stamped out now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senators about these illegal abortions. I am alarmed that the Garda has begun separate investigations into backstreet abortions, which cost up to &euro;500. The House should immediately let these vulnerable groups know that help is available for new arrivals and new ethnic groups. We should have education and information campaigns in these people&rsquo;s native language outlining the health and social services available to them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very worrying trend and the House should immediately assure these people that help is available.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with calls for a debate on the enterprise strategy report. It is probably correct, as Senator Ryan said, to wait until we have had time to consider it and discuss it in September or October rather than now.</P>
    <P>I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to a report published yesterday in Britain which is causing the British to reconsider their strategy on child care. For years the emphasis here and in Britain has been on encouraging more child care. The report yesterday suggests that nursery care can lead to increased evidence of anti-social behaviour among children under two years, and the British are apparently going to announce an alternative method of handling child care today which involves encouraging parents to stay at home by increasing the amount of child maternity leave for mothers.</P>
    <P>I raise this because that research does not necessarily conform with the research in other countries, so let us not jump to the same conclusion as the British without doing our own research. This issue plays a large part in the <Col N="1101"/>enterprise strategy report, and there have been calls for increased child care in Ireland for a long time. We have listened to those and taken some steps but we have not done nearly enough. Let us make sure that when we take the steps we go in the right direction.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not going to intervene but I am grateful that Senator Quinn has raised this issue. It provides justification for a debate on child care in the autumn.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Speaking as chairman of the County Leitrim child care committee, there is unquestionably a need to debate the emphasis being placed by Government policy on the manner in which child care is funded. Increasingly, the view is that the development of the child is being neglected at the expense of providing what are effectively baby-minding services and nothing more. In other words, we are fuelling an economy to encourage women to leave the home and enter the workforce. This encouragement is fuelled partly by the need for additional skills in the economy.</P>
    <P>For some years under the equal opportunities programme, it has been a matter of policy to provide funding for child care facilities, although some may say it is inadequate and I agree that we need to spend more. We must debate where the emphasis should be placed in future. Are we to provide nothing more than a baby-minding service for those who have no choice but to work, while neglecting the development of the child by not providing properly structured programmes for children in the mornings and afternoons? I welcome Senator Quinn&rsquo;s intervention in this regard. As a former Minister for Education, the Leader may also wish to express a view on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>In the run up to the last abortion referendum in 2002, much play was made of the fact that substantial resources, personnel and expertise would be put in place to help people with crisis pregnancies. In recent days, at least two women, and probably many more, have resorted to backstreet abortions. This is another clear example of the failure to implement the promises made then of support mechanisms that were supposed to be put in place to help those with crisis pregnancies. The relevant Government services have failed to put those support mechanisms into action, despite all the support that was promised prior to 2002. The Leader should make immediate contact with the relevant bodies with responsibility for the delivery of such services so they can be activated on an emergency basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek a debate in the autumn term on the failure of the penalty points system to reduce road deaths. It is appalling that, so far this year, 191 people have lost their lives on the roads. One can only imagine the heartache this has caused their bereaved families. Clear patterns are emerging as to when car crashes are most <Col N="1102"/>likely to occur. As legislators, we should have a role in preventing road accidents. We must analyse why the penalty points system was so successful initially but has since failed to reduce road deaths. I hope the Minister for Transport will attend the House for such a debate in the autumn. He may be able to enlighten us on this matter.</P>
    <P>We are beginning to see some unravelling of the initial success of the smoking ban. I am not sure if the current Minister for Health and Children will be in charge in the autumn, but perhaps we can have an ongoing debate on the success or otherwise of the ban. There is a tendency to introduce new laws that start off well and then fade away. The penalty points system is an example. In the autumn term, the new Minister for Health and Children may outline whether he or she has any plans to introduce a system, as in New York, where pubs can apply for a smoking licence. It would be interesting for the House to examine that aspect of the issue, so perhaps the Leader could organise such a debate in the autumn session.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes mentioned the recurring theme that &ldquo;the law is the law, and we live by it&rdquo;. Everyone agrees that no encouragement should be given to those who seek to break the law. The Senator&rsquo;s point was valid and it caught the mood of the House. He also asked about a debate on the enterprise strategy next week but I agree with subsequent speakers that it should be kept for the autumn term when we can have a full discussion. I have not yet received this important report, although I have requested it and hope to receive it later today. The Senator also mentioned the need for vibrant, integrated immigration and spatial policies. I will take note of that report and hopefully the House can debate it early in the new session.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned the data commissioner and said that freedom of information requests had decreased by 38%.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure is 80%.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He mentioned that the Ombudsman appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. It was a startling revelation that the money brought in by the new charges for freedom of information requests does not cover the costs involved, which seems ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked about the State Airports Bill. I tabled a question to the Office of the Attorney General this morning to ask whether he had given advice on that matter. I hope to have the reply before the House commences its debate on the Bill next week.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan echoed the sentiment that we live by the rule of law. He paid due tribute to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v. As you will know, a Chathaoirligh, there was a good debate on the <Col N="1103"/>Dormant Accounts Bill here yesterday. I attended the end of that debate, which had been lively. The belief is dawning that these matters must be re-examined. When we adjourned to the ante-room there was an excellent debate, which included the Minister, his officials and Senators who had contributed earlier, including Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure if discussions in the ante-room could be called debates.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am just trying to explain that we had a discussion. Following that, the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, told us that in the early autumn he wishes to recommit the Dormant Accounts Bill to Committee Stage, after which Report and Final Stages will be taken. It was a rare occurrence but it was worthwhile and greatly acclaimed by those who were present when the Minister took that decision.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooley sought a debate on the enterprise strategy report, which is a good idea, particularly as one of the issues concerns Shannon development. It would muddy one debate, however, to have a debate on the other matter at the same time, but I will take account of the Senator&rsquo;s request in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford referred to the challenges currently facing our society. Senator Ryan raised a related point concerning whether we would have unskilled bonded labour and skilled green card labour. That would immediately create a two-tier system in the workplace and the Senator elaborated on that point. Those are huge challenges but we will need many workers with a variety skills. The important aspect is how we deal with people and shape labour policy generally.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also said that nobody can flout the law. In addition, he asked about the Chinese student, a member of the Falun Gong, who had been here and wishes to return with his wife in order to resume his studies. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for visas so I will contact him with regard to that matter. I am currently in contact with him about another case, so I will raise the issue mentioned by the Senator also.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of backstreet abortions and the refusal to grant work permits to pregnant immigrants.</P>

    <P>Senator Bannon sought a debate on the BMW Objective One region. I will take the Senator as <Col N="1104"/>my <i>chef de cabinet</i>. Would that not be lovely? We would have a great time in Europe.</P>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara requested a debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, referred to in No. 1 on the Order Paper. She also requested a debate on dyslexia, which would be interesting. We previously debated the issue of autism which ran for a number of sessions, the notes from which the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, said he found very helpful.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara also raised the issue of backstreet abortions. It is extremely sad that these women were so confused and had to take such action, sad in the context of the abortion of a baby and also in regard to the women&rsquo;s health. The abortions came to light because one of the women was discovered in a bad state of health afterwards. The issue, which was also raised by Senators Feighan and Glynn, has echoes of half a century ago when, as Senator Feighan stated, women did not have or could not access the information to help them.</P>
    <P>Today, two good bodies namely, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and Cura, provide such information. They advertise widely, post notices in public buildings, give good advice and offer practical help. However, as was raised on a radio programme this morning, the question is whether the women in question would have understood English and been able to follow advice offered. For information to be useful, it must be accessible and understandable by everyone. I listened to Ms Olive Braiden talking about the issue and I and some of the women in the House met with her afterwards to discuss it among other matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to an imminent new policy development on child care in the UK, whereby maternity leave might be legally extended in order that men or women can stay at home with their babies for the first two years. Senator Mooney raised a similar issue in respect of properly structured child care which would have an educational element. It is not a comment on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but it would seem that other Departments would be more suited to hear a discussion on the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s point about the backstreet abortions. The incidents are sad but stones should not be cast at Departments because there will always be aberrations. Berating people about the matter is not fruitful. Senator Browne referred to the issue of road fatalities. He also appears to be lurching towards another way of looking at the smoking ban. However, the law is the law and, no matter what Minister is in office, it is on the Statute Book.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il. This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad. For the convenience of Senators , I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. I propose to group the amendments made by the D&aacute;il as follows for the purposes of debate: Group one, subject matter of amendments Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive; group two, subject matter of amendments Nos. 6 to 37, inclusive; group 3, subject matter of amendments Nos. 38 to 46, inclusive; and group four, subject matter of amendments Nos. 47 to 63, inclusive. I remind Senators that the only matter that may be discussed is the subject matter of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il and they may contribute only once on each of group of amendments.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P><Col N="1106"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments in group one are amendments Nos. 1 to 5, which were made in the D&aacute;il and are now submitted to the Seanad where the Bill was initiated. Amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, are technical in character but amendments Nos. 1 and 2 relate to the commencement provisions.</P>
    <P>The one point I wish to make on amendments Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, is that the Minister has endeavoured to ensure that as many provisions of the Bill as possible will commence on the enactment of this legislation. Many of the provisions will take immediate effect.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that two amendments of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act to Chapter 1 of Part 3, dealing with funds of suitors, section 49, providing for centralised issuing of summonses and their issuing by electronic means, and section 56, increasing the number of judges, will commence as and from enactment of this legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, can the Minister of State make available his notes to Senators because this is technical material?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes I can, if it is of assistance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>My notes do not cover every amendment because some of the amendments are very technical. Where there are amendments of substance I have notes which I can make available to all Senators.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are moving on to group two and I invite the Minister of State to speak on the subject matter of amendments Nos. 6 to 37, inclusive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, a large number of these amendments are technical in character. Amendment No. 20 deletes the original subsection and substitutes two new subsections. Subsection (4) clarifies the intention of the section with regard to the powers of the rules of court committee. Subsection (5) is necessary to ensure that the reference to the courts earlier in the section includes the Master of the High Court and county registrars.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 deletes lines 19 to 27 in page 12. These sections related to the lodgement of pleadings in the relevant courts. Following extensive discussion on this issue in the D&aacute;il, the Minister considered that such lodgements would prove time consuming and expensive for the Courts Service. There was a provision in the original legislation that pleadings would have to be lodged in court as another additional requirement in personal injuries proceedings and proceedings generally and the Minister believed that to insist on this would add to the cost of litigation and the burden on litigants and the burden on the Courts <Col N="1107"/>Service. Accordingly, he accepted an amendment deleting these provisions.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 24, 26, 28, 29 and 31 were introduced by the Minister to meet some concerns about the wording of the relevant section which relates to offers in settlement. It was felt that the use of the term &ldquo;final offer&rdquo; could indicate that the prescribed date would occur late in the proceedings. The Minister considered that it would be better to use the term &ldquo;formal offer&rdquo;, which would allow more flexibility on the timing of the prescribed date.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 36 provides that the register of personal injuries action include information regarding the name and address of the solicitor for each party to the action.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 37 was accepted by the Minister following much discussion on the publication of the register on the Internet. The amended section now provides that the Courts Service shall make the register available to those who have established to their satisfaction a sufficient interest in seeking access to it. As I understand it, the former provision was a general publication through the Internet. That is being modified so that the register can be made available to those who have shown a sufficient interest in seeking access to it. It is difficult to strike a balance between making information available on the one hand and making it available to persons who simply wish to have it for prying reasons, or to know if their neighbour has taken an action. This is the balance that has been struck.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly the Minister adopted the same approach in the D&aacute;il as in the Seanad which was to take on board as much as possible the concerns of Opposition Members. While a number of the amendments are technical, they are significant. On the issue of the rules of court we had extensive discussion on Committee and Report Stages on how they would operate. The Minister takes a particular view of that being a practitioner. I stated that the Minister, being a practitioner, would know how the rules of court apply and so on.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendment related to the lodgement of pleadings in the relevant courts which is designed to make it less expensive. There was a passing reference to that here. It appears that the register to which the Minister of State has referred is a useful one. Given that this is the era of information, the availability of the register on the Internet is useful. Much legal information, settlements, wills and so on are published in the newspapers. The Revenue Commissioners publish a much greater amount of information than in the past. How will that work in practice? Given that the Bill was discussed at a late hour in the other House, I did not have a chance to read the entire debate but I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides on amendment No. 37, that the register should be made available to such persons who have established to the satisfaction of the Courts <Col N="1108"/>Service a sufficient interest in seeking access to it. I hope that will work out in practice. The amendments in the group are largely positive and substantial.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara appeared to be a little concerned about publication of the register. It must be realised that this is a targeted register as it relates to personal injuries proceedings. While, as the Senator rightly said, the will of everyone who dies is published in the probate office and the Revenue make certain statements also, this register is being created for the specific purpose of enabling those who must meet personal injuries claims to carry out research on the persons bringing the claims. In the case of such a register, universal disclosure might lead to people&rsquo;s private matters being analysed by others unnecessarily. Incidentally, it was Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s party which originally moved the amendment in the D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I had a feeling that might be the case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We move now to the group of amendments Nos. 38 to 46, inclusive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to highlight the most significant amendments concerning dormant funds, which are now contained in sections 33 to 38, inclusive, of the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il. In amendments Nos. 39 and 41 certain new definitions have been added. The new definition of financial institutions allows greater flexibility to the Courts Service when deciding which financial institution should handle its account. The Bank of Ireland has always held the account and was specifically mentioned in previous Funds of Suitors Acts and, previously, in this Bill. There is no complaint whatsoever about the Bank of Ireland; it is simply deemed prudent to provide freedom of choice to the Courts Service. For the first time, an explicit definition of the nature and extent of the indemnity offered should any loss be caused to someone who holds a dormant account is provided.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 42 is critical and will permit the future realisation of dormant investments on each five year anniversary of the passage of the Act. Amendment No. 43 makes clearer the provision for the transfer of the dormant funds of suitors to the Exchequer. From time to time, the Chief Justice may now direct the amount of dormant funds to be paid to the Exchequer, while not exceeding 97.5% of the total amount available. The provision makes available a small reserve and rolling mechanism to enable the future disposal of all realised dormant funds without recourse to new legislation. The previous reference to the Bank of Ireland in this section has also been deleted.</P>
    <P>Having noted the comments of Senators in March, I am now providing in amendment No. 45 for a public notification procedure of the transfer <Col N="1109"/>of the funds. Amendment No. 46 makes provision for the creation of a registration system for dormant funds. While these matters did not feature in any previous Funds of Suitors Acts, they are now necessary to assist and inform any persons who might have a claim on these dormant funds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the amendments. They appear to put in place a useful, user-friendly and important framework. Sections 33 to 38, inclusive, have been enhanced through debate in the D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We move now to amendments Nos. 47 to 63, inclusive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The first important set of amendments in this grouping consists of amendments Nos. 47 to 55, inclusive, to the section which relaxes the <i>in camera</i> rule in family law cases. Senators will recall the detailed discussion of this proposal on Committee Stage when the Minister readily accepted that the section in the Bill, as initiated, was not adequate. The Minister brought forward in the D&aacute;il the amendments sought in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 49 to 51, inclusive, are key elements in the system envisaged in the Bill to communicate information about family law proceedings to the public and professions. They provide for the preparation by a barrister or solicitor or such other person falling within a class specified by ministerial regulation of reports of family law proceedings and for attendance at court for that purpose. There is a provision for rules of court to be made to regulate this process. These elements were absent from the Bill when it was last before the House at which time it was unclear who could report on the proceedings or if the media could attend.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 52 has two distinct elements. It allows parties to supply <i>in camera</i> orders or extracts from them to such persons and in accordance with such conditions as may be prescribed by ministerial order. Examples of third parties who might need to see orders are schools, the Passport Office, the Revenue Commissioners and parties to conveyancing transactions. In all these contexts, difficulties have arisen due to the confidentiality of court orders. Judging by the debate on this element of the Bill, Senators recognised the problem. The Minister proposes that this process should be regulated by order to allow people to be clear about what they may and may not do in this regard.</P>
    <P>The second part of amendment No. 52 allows for the attendance in court of an accompanying person. Organisations involved with the victims of domestic violence were particularly keen on such a provision being made and the amendment addresses the point adequately. While the accompanying person will be a person of the party&rsquo;s choosing, attendance will be subject to the approval of the court and any directions it may <Col N="1110"/>give in that regard. The judge, obviously, must have final authority in the courtroom.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 55 provides that the section shall apply to proceedings brought or a decision made whether before or after the commencement of the section. While the arrangements for attendance and reporting and the attendance of an accompanying person must be prospective in their effect, the amendment will, for example, allow a person to supply an order made in the past to a third person in the circumstances I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 58 provides for the centralised issuing of summonses and their issue by electronic means to facilitate the penalty points system. Amendment No. 63 provides for increases in the maximum complement of judges by three in the High Court, three in the Circuit Court and two in the District Court.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for setting out the amendments. Clearly, the Minister listened during the extensive Seanad debate regarding the relaxation of the <i>in camera</i> rule. It is a difficult area. In general, I welcome the amendments and note the Minister intends to bring forward regulations by order which it will be very important to consider. While the Minister is meeting the concerns of bodies such as schools, the Passport Office and the Revenue Commissioners, a measure of regulation is required.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the amendment which allows an accompanying person to attend court in accordance with a specific request by organisations working with women and others who are victims of domestic violence. The provision meets their concerns. Given that consideration of the Bill by the D&aacute;il did not conclude until 10.30 p.m. last night, can the Minister of State clarify if the legislation as amended also meets the other concerns of Women&rsquo;s Aid? The organisation wishes the Bill to ensure the consistent application of the rule of law by family law courts in cases of domestic violence and the facilitation of reporting and compilation of information on family law cases. A major issue has been that a corpus of law has not been recorded and that we do not know what is happening in one family law area versus another. When people go to court they do not know what various judges have said. This also affects practitioners who do not have the information they need. Such information in required, first, to ensure that the law that has been consistently applied and, second, to ensure that third parties, people like ourselves, know that the law has been consistently applied.</P>
    <P>As this is the last opportunity I will have, I ask the Minister of State to clarify, if possible, how far this legislation, which is critical for organisations such as Women&rsquo;s Aid, has progressed. The issue of the accompanying person has been dealt with satisfactorily in the legislation. Will the Minister of State clarify the position regarding the consistent application of the law on the ground? Is it possible for the appropriate people to have <Col N="1111"/>sight of the details of results to ensure this happens? Are there clear criteria regarding the details recorded of family law cases, and is that available to the appropriate people?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo what Senator O&rsquo;Meara said. I compliment the Minister of State who seems to have taken on board many of the concerns expressed in the Seanad when this Bill was previously discussed here. I refer in particular to amendment No. 51 which deals with the issue of an accompanying person. This is an area in respect of which all Senators received correspondence. I am delighted the Minister of State has included this provision.</P>
    <P>I echo the questions put by Senator O&rsquo;Meara regarding the <i>in camera</i> rule. That was the second part of the two major issues raised with Senators by the bodies that deal with domestic abuse. It is important that the Minister of State should clarify the position in that regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many bodies have been established in recent years that are concerned about the impact of matrimonial, family and domestic litigation on people&rsquo;s lives and fortunes. We have to strike difficult balances in these matters.</P>
    <P>To answer one of Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s questions directly, not all of the amendments proposed by the organisation to which she referred were accepted. In this legislation we have, for the first time, provided for the compilation of information, on a systematic basis, on this area. The previous operation of the <i>in camera</i> rule effectively meant that it was impossible for us to assemble that type of information. Therefore, many of the submissions we received from the interested organisations would have contained much material which was, in research terms, anecdotal. In saying that, I do not want to take from the sincerity or the passion of the viewpoint expressed by many of these organisations. However, the fact remains that we were working in a void because of the operation of the <i>in camera </i>rule. As a result of the discussions in the Oireachtas and the initiative taken by the Minister in this legislation, we now at least have a statutory framework that allows the collation and assessment of information in regard to this type of proceeding.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara referred to the exercise of particular powers by the courts, for example, in regard to the family home or custody disputes. Under this legislation it is now possible to assemble information about that type of area on a systematic basis. That will inform debates in the future in this area to a far greater extent than was the case in the past. We will then have research-based information at our disposal. That will also inform us as Members of the Oireachtas. We often have important decisions to make about how we should draw up the law in this area. That is as far as I can go on that side of the matter.</P><Col N="1112"/>
    <P>The issue of consistency was raised by Senator O&rsquo;Meara and also, to some extent, by Senator John Phelan. Many of the organisations dealing with this area would say that the courts are not being consistent in regard to cases.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not know if they are consistent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not know. At least we will now have an evidential basis from which we will be able to find out whether they are being consistent.</P>
    <P>There is a more fundamental issue in this regard. The Oireachtas decides to commit these decisions to the judges and courts because an element of discretion has to come into the decision made. This is the great difficulty in that we want consistency. We want an absolutely rigid standard applied to all cases, but no two cases are the same. The search for consistency can become self-defeating in any context. The reason the Oireachtas asked the courts to take on this task is that it is recognised that the complex, factual positions that establish themselves in these cases do not readily admit to a uniform solution. If there were a uniform solution, we would legislate for it. We would not say to the judges in the courts that they had better listen to all the evidence and make a decision they think is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. That is the difficulty with consistency. I do not decry the need for consistency and uniformity of approach in the courts as far as it can be achieved. I have no doubt that the evidential basis we will establish under this legislation will assist that.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the exceptional work done on this legislation. In my seven years in the Seanad it has been one of the most satisfactory debates because of the attitude adopted by the Minister of State. He has been open and has listened to what all Members had to say. In particular, he was prepared to accept amendments to the Bill. In that regard, one must note the Minister of State&rsquo;s acceptance of a key amendment to the original published legislation, the effect of which is to reduce from three years to two years the limitation period for the taking of cases. In doing so, he has shown himself to be fair-minded and an excellent legislator.</P>
    <P>I have a sense that the news has not spread of what is contained in this legislation. Only this week I heard a radio report on the Neary case in Drogheda. A strong impression was given that this legislation would potentially prevent women who had been injured due to medical negligence from taking cases a few years later. My understanding from our debate on the legislation is that <Col N="1113"/>the date it will apply from is the date of knowledge of the injury. It is important the reality that is contained in the legislation is put into the public domain, otherwise there will be a degree of concern and unnecessary apprehension about people&rsquo;s rights.</P><?oasys [cl10.5]?>
    <P>I hope we have retained sufficient rights in regard to genuine &mdash; a word I use advisedly &mdash; victims. We have had considerable discussion about that. Undoubtedly there are genuine victims of negligence and of accidents who have a right to compensation and to take a case to court. It is not our objective to prevent that from happening. However, it is our objective to ensure that the framework will be fair, effective, speedy and will act as a deterrent against the compensation culture, which has developed in certain sectors in this society and which has an economic effect.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State and his officials on the work they have done on this Bill. It is a fine and necessary piece of reforming legislation. I hope it will work. We will only learn that by observing its operation. It may be necessary to revisit the legislation in years to come, but the work done in this House and in the other House has led to important and significant reform in the area of civil liability.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his work on the Bill to which amendments have been accepted from this side of the House. I thank the Minister of State on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleague, Senator Terry, in her absence, who dealt exclusively with this Bill on behalf of my party when it was previously before the House.</P>
    <P>I have not previously heard the concerns expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Meara in her last comments. It would be regrettable if the perception existed that this Bill would bring about such changes. It would be opportune for the Minister of State to respond to that particular issue. Many amendments have been made to the Bill since it was last before the House. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their work.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister, Deputy Michael McDowell, on all the contributions they made to the Bill in the House.

Amendments were then made in the other House, some of which were based on discussions that had taken place in this House. It was a matter of casting those discussions into an appropriate formula that would serve as an amendment.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill on which most public attention has focused is Part 2, which radically changes <Col N="1114"/>civil liability law. The most significant amendment was that made in this House when the Minister accepted a proposal by Senator Terry to reduce the limitation period for personal injuries actions from three years to two, rather than to one, as originally proposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister very much appreciated the assistance of Senators on this Bill. One barrister, in his memoirs, referred to the Statute of Limitations as the &ldquo;Statute of Lamentations&rdquo;. One has to strike a balance between the interests of all the parties involved. It is important in the context of Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s point to stress that the sole change to the Statute of Limitations is the reduction from three years to two years in the case of a personal injury claim. We are not changing any rule or law on the discoverability of injuries or on when the cause of action accrues. These matters are dealt with elsewhere. It is important to note this because Senators might be concerned about the issue. Senator John Phelan echoed that certain changes might be more dramatic than I am suggesting, but that is not the case. The sole change is the reduction from three years to two.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 24, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) Such action includes, but is not limited to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="3">(i) harassment;</P>
    <P LI="3">(ii) intimidation;</P>
    <P LI="3">(iii) abusive or threatening behaviour; or</P>
    <P LI="3">(iv) retaliatory notice to quit.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 are all about treating tenants with the respect they deserve. As we all know, tenants pay huge rents, particularly in this city. I refer in particular to students who come here in September to do various courses at university. Since tenants pay phenomenal rents, it is important to grant them the rights they need.</P><Col N="1115"/>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 is very important because section 14 needs to be made even clearer. It should spell out what constitutes action that affects peaceful occupation and that is why I am proposing the inexhaustible definition that such action includes, but is not limited to, harassment, intimidation, abusive or threatening behaviour or retaliatory notice to quit. If a tenant is to be evicted or asked to quit, he or she should receive a letter indicating the reasons.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is designed to ensure that where a landlord, in a state of rage, tries to end a tenancy because a tenant has made a particular complaint, the termination would be deemed to be invalid. The amendment is vital to ensure that a tenant who makes a legitimate complaint will not suffer the consequences of seeking their statutory rights. This approach has worked very well in parts of Australia and America. The Minister of State may note that the cost of rental accommodation is 25% lower in New York than it is here. I would be very disappointed if the Minister did not share the sentiments behind what I am proposing and accept the two amendments.</P>

	<P>I share some of the Senator&rsquo;s sentiments and I fully agree with his opening comment that tenants should be treated with respect. This is a fundamental principle of the Bill, the purpose of which is to improve tenants&rsquo; rights. However, I am not in favour of accepting amendment No. 1. It would not be appropriate or beneficial to insert examples of a few matters that might be deemed to involve penalisation. I fear it would detract from the effectiveness of the provision. Section 14 provides the most comprehensive definition of penalisation possible in terms of any action that adversely affects a tenant&rsquo;s enjoyment of peaceful occupation.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In legal terms, one cannot go further than stating &ldquo;any action&rdquo;. To specify individual actions would not strengthen this legislation. If one included two, five or 25 matters that might be deemed to involve penalisation, sure as God one would leave one out. If a dispute arose over the omitted matter thereafter, people would probably say it was left out for a purpose. While the Senator&rsquo;s amendment is well-meaning and I understand it, it would not be of any help. The section was extended on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to cover complaints to public authorities generally or to the Garda.</P><?oasys [cl10.5]?>
    <P>Equally, amendment No. 3 would not be of help because section 14 provides adequate safeguards against the penalisation of tenants. I do not feel either of the amendments would strengthen the Bill.</P>

  <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, section 14 is very important to the Bill. However, it has loopholes and unscrupulous landlords &mdash; I would like to <Col N="1116"/>believe there are few &mdash; could force tenants onto the highways for invalid reasons. At present, there are approximately 5,500 homeless people in the country and we do not want this Bill to be the cause of there being more. My amendment is valid and should be accepted.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 31, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">28.&mdash;Where a landlord terminates a tenancy prior to the expiry of the non-protection period, he or she shall provide the tenant with a written explanation of the reasons for the termination.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment will give a greater level of security of tenure. It is designed to ensure that where a tenant is asked to leave before he accrues rights under the legislation, he is given a reason in writing as to why he is being asked to leave. The amendment is simple, straightforward and clear. I ask the Minister of State to accept it. If an employee is sacked he must be given notice and tenants should know why a tenancy is being discontinued. The amendment strengthens the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This provision is one of the fundamental principles of the Bill. It was discussed at great length by the commission on whose findings the Bill is largely based. Security of tenure after six months is a fundamental aspect of the Bill. It was agreed at the commission, and it is central to the Bill, that in the first six months of a tenancy the landlord can ask a tenant to leave without giving a reason.</P>
    <P>One must consider the current situation and what the situation has been until now. A landlord may terminate a tenancy at any time without providing a reason. We are moving from a situation where, for many years, a tenant did not have security of tenure unless he had rented a property for 20 years. Until that time a landlord could ask a tenant to leave.</P>
    <P>This provision strikes a balance. In the first six months a landlord will have the right to ask a tenant to leave. After that a tenant will have security of tenure for three and a half years. There will then be a six month period during which a landlord may ask a tenant to leave, without giving a reason, followed by a further three and a half years of security of tenure.</P>
    <P>Why would a landlord ask a tenant to leave if he has proven himself to be a good tenant? It may be because a landlord needs the property for his own occupation and the Bill contains provisions in that regard. However, in the first six months of a tenancy or of any subsequent tenancy, the Bill allows a landlord to ask a tenant to leave, without reason. That is one of the fundamental principles of the Bill. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1117"/>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment gives strength to the rights and responsibilities of both the landlord and tenant. If a tenancy is discontinued for reasons of misbehaviour or otherwise, I see nothing wrong with stating that in writing. The amendment is valid and would strengthen the Bill. I see nothing wrong with the amendment, despite the arguments put forward by the Minister of State. A requirement that a notice to quit a property should state the reason for the notice would strengthen the Bill and give it greater clarity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not give greater clarity. The Bill is clear as it stands. The amendment would give additional rights to tenants.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that, but we must consider where we are and from where we have come. Tenants have had very few rights. The commission tried to move matters to a situation which, I accept, will not be as good as that applying in many European countries where tenants have much greater security of tenure. However, we are moving from the first step on the ladder to the fifth or sixth step. I accept that there will be further steps. In years to come we may move forward to a situation where there is greater security of tenure.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, this is one of the core principles of the Bill. We are trying to achieve reasonable support and agreement from landlords&rsquo; groups and from groups representing tenants. Furthermore, a landlord will always be able to demand a <Col N="1118"/>market rent. If a tenant has rented a property for four years, the landlord will not have an incentive to ask the tenant to leave because he can demand a market rent from the existing tenant and cannot demand a higher rent from a new tenant. If a tenant has proved himself a respectable tenant who does not cause hassle, why would a landlord wish to churn the tenancy and move from a decent rent paying tenant to one he does not know?</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is confined to the first six months of a tenancy. During that period a landlord is permitted to end a tenancy without an excuse or reason. After that time the landlord may not do so unless for a specified reason, such as requiring the property for himself or a member of his family or for major refurbishment. While the amendment would be of benefit to a tenant, this provision is one of the main building blocks of the legislation and brought landlords on side.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I regard this provision as discriminatory and it should be amended to take into consideration the rights of all citizens. It does not provide for partnership relationships. The Opposition highlighted this on Committee Stage. The Minister of State has gone out of his way to exclude people. I ask him to delete the words &ldquo;as husband and wife&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;partners&rdquo; which would make the Bill more inclusive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. In the interests of clarity, there are also five more names following that of Senator Bannon on this amendment. I note what the Minister of State said in his contribution on Committee Stage and there was a good debate on this issue. There is a particular exclusion in this section of the Bill which we believe to be discriminatory and not inclusive. It is contrary to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Karner case which was eloquently expounded on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There have been significant advances in equality legislation. Ireland ranks as one of the leading states in Europe in terms of equality legislation passed. It would be a retrograde step to seem to be excluding any particular category of persons from this section of the Bill and it is not the right thing to do. I recognise the difficulties inherent in accepting this amendment and I do not expect it will be accepted. However, it is important that the case is advanced at this stage of the Bill. I appreciate there is a belief that this issue could be debated in some other context. I reiterate those points to the Minister of State. I know he is a fair-minded individual and I am aware of the difficulties faced in accepting this amendment. I urge him to think on what was said on Committee Stage and consider an alternative method for giving rights to all categories of people. This is about equality for everyone and not just one particular section. I appeal to the Minister of State to bear that in mind when considering this amendment.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1120"/>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in a position to accept the amendment. The amendment as worded is incompatible with the remainder of subsection 39(3), as the deletion of the words &ldquo;husband and wife&rdquo; would widen the provision to cover any non-tenant living in the accommodation at the time of the death of the tenant. It would render the other subparagraphs redundant. The extension of the provision to include same-sex partners in sexual relationships would require specific reference to the category of occupant rather than the mere deletion of the words &ldquo;husband and wife&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was discussed on Committee Stage and I appreciate the motives of the Senators. I emphasise that we are not excluding anyone or discriminating against any category of multiple occupancy nor do we wish to do so. I have no personal ideological stance on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is intended to be a provision of limited application and therefore does not cover other categories of multiple occupancy, such as friends, cousins, siblings, colleagues or persons in same-sex relationships. It is not specifically excluding those in same-sex relationships. I explained on Committee Stage that in discussion in the D&aacute;il, I was asked to consider extending the provisions to a spouse, married or unmarried, in the event of the death of a tenant and we tried to do that. The limited application of a right to inherit a Part 4 tenancy is what is considered legally feasible because of the constitutional protection afforded to families. For good or ill, the Constitution affords protection to families and does not afford the same protections to cousins or siblings. As I explained on Committee Stage, the purpose of the amendment was to provide a mechanism by which dependent family members would be able to continue a Part 4 tenancy in a situation where the only member of the family who is the tenant, died.</P>
    <P>This is the only instance in the Bill whereby a landlord has no say in whether to grant a tenancy to a particular person. One of the fundamental provisions of the Bill is that a landlord always has a right to decide on who can be a tenant. The only exceptions are in the case of a co-tenant or licensee, where the tenant is already in occupation. In this case, the amendment would afford the automatic right of tenancy to somebody who is not a tenant and who might not be known in legal terms to the landlord. That would be against the normal drift of the Bill. Because of the protection afforded to the family in the Constitution as opposed to other groupings, the Bill is taking away the right of the landlord in that one instance. The Bill is not discriminatory against anyone in that it is not taking anything away from anyone but rather giving a special protection to the spouses of existing family relationships, be they married or unmarried.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recently issued a consultation paper dealing with legislative treatment of same sex unions. Following the consultation period, the commission will issue a final <Col N="1121"/>report for the consideration of the Government. At that stage it will be appropriate for the Government&rsquo;s thinking to include the position of couples in same sex unions in the occupation of rented accommodation. The Succession Acts must also be borne in mind. Widening the provision to include all categories of multiple occupancy who are not joint tenants, would and could create a conflict with the Succession Acts and could necessitate amendments to them. When one person in a relationship dies, the question of rights to the Part 4 tenancy, the right to occupation, arises. Other people not living in the apartment, flat or house might have rights under the Succession Acts and complications can arise. The Office of the Attorney General devised this amendment and felt justified in doing so because of the right of the family under the Constitution. Other groupings of people do not have that same right and the Attorney General deliberately did not extend it to other groupings. The debate in the D&aacute;il was in favour of spouses in the case of the death of the tenant. I understand the Senators&rsquo; concerns. It may well be that the report of the Law Reform Commission, when delivered to Government and rolled out in a couple of years, will make the changes sought by Senators. To accept the amendment now, however, would create considerable difficulties. This legislation is not the correct place for such a change.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has not allayed my fears about discrimination. It is illegal to discriminate against a person on the grounds of sexual orientation. Sisters, brothers and other members of a family frequently live together, yet such circumstances are not provided for in the legislation, which specifically refers to &ldquo;husband and wife&rdquo;. It would be a simple matter to use the word &ldquo;partners&rdquo;, which would cover all relationships. Given our equality legislation, it will be difficult for the Minister of State to explain his stance on this issue in future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have tried to explain that I am not discriminating against anybody. An amendment was introduced to assist and provide for spouses, married or unmarried and living as couples in family-type relationships, who were not joint tenants at the time of death of their spouse. As I stated on Committee Stage, it is recommended and the residential tenancies board will also recommend that the way to get around this potential difficulty is for persons who rent a house, flat or apartment together to become joint tenants, either at the beginning of the tenancy or any time thereafter. If one joint tenant, rather than licensee, dies or leaves, the remaining joint tenant would then have legal rights.</P>
    <P>It will be a responsibility and legal requirement on tenants under the legislation to report when a person moves into a dwelling on a permanent basis and it becomes his or her main place of residence, not, however, for a one night stand or a period of a week. At that point, the tenant will <Col N="1122"/>record whether the new tenant will be a licensee or joint tenant. Contrary to what was stated on Committee Stage, choosing the latter option will not require a tenant to go to a solicitor&rsquo;s office. It would be advisable for a second person who moves into a dwelling to be registered as a joint tenant because such persons will have legal protection in the event of the death of another joint tenant. This would be the best course of action in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>The amendment on Committee Stage providing for spouses was introduced to deal with cases where a second tenant has not been registered. We are not discriminating against anyone or excluding people deliberately. We introduced an amendment specifically to address concerns raised by Members in the other House. It was drafted to conform with what was deemed legally feasible and taking into consideration various constitutional and legal provisions.</P>
    <P>I understand the point made by Senators. Legislative changes may be made when the Government receives and rolls out through various Acts the recommendations of the final report of the Law Reform Commission.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes in page 86, line 21, after &ldquo;application&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or formal notification&rdquo;.

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill has an appropriate mechanism to provide data to the Revenue Commissioners, where necessary. The Revenue Commissioners have informed the Department that the provisions of section 148 are acceptable. Section 148 requires the private residential tenancies board to supply to the Revenue Commissioners details of tenancies registered in respect of a landlord specified in the Revenue request. It is a question of how one meets this requirement. The board will comply and supply all information quickly to the Revenue as and when it is requested.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 proposes a new section dealing with notification of tenancy details by landlords to the Revenue Commissioners. Tax law specifies the liability of citizens to make income returns to the Revenue Commissioners. As a result, the amendment is not necessary. It is for the Revenue Commissioners to specify what information they require and when they require it. It is likely the information they will require will concern rental income on a tax year basis, rather than a separate notification.</P>
    <P>The board will give all information to the Revenue Commissioners when they ask for it and in the manner and form requested. While we want excellent co-operation between the various State agencies, there is no point in sending lorry loads of information to the Revenue if it not delivered in the format it wants. Section 148 covers the Senator&rsquo;s point and the board will give the Revenue Commissioners all the information they require in the manner and at the time they wish.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 95, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) the monitoring of any discrimination against tenants or any other discriminatory actions in the private rented sector,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the board will monitor discrimination faced by those seeking or retaining accommodation. Students, for example, are often refused accommodation at certain times of the year. There have been instances where landlords have stipulated that students are not welcome to apply for tenancy in their accommodation. There should be no discrimination against anybody who is prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 proposes that a function of the private residential tenancies board should be to monitor the quality and pricing of accommodation in the private rented sector. This is important as the price of accommodation rockets at certain times of the year. Unscrupulous landlords often raise rents when they know that students from rural areas will be moving to Dublin to seek accommodation. A student who has left it late to seek accommodation, perhaps because he or she has received a late third level offer, is desperate and may pay more than he or she can afford because there is no time to wait for more affordable alternative accommodation. City accommodation for students in Ireland is more expensive than that available in other European countries and in the United States. Students are being priced out of the market and it is their parents who are forced to fund their accommodation. People who work in agriculture and public enterprise, in particular, do not enjoy the same healthy circumstances they did during the Celtic tiger years and the necessity to provide for their student children&rsquo;s accommodation requirements is a significant burden to bear.</P>
    <P>No young person must be denied the right to attain a third level education but the cost of rented accommodation in urban areas limits the choice to students. Third level educational facilities have not been decentralised to a great extent in that most of our third level institutions are located in large cities.</P>

	<P>There is no university in the midlands while there are three or four in Dublin and one in other major cities such as Cork and Galway. The Department of Education and Science should address the question of locating a university in the midlands and perhaps County <Col N="1125"/>Longford might be considered as a suitable location for such an educational facility&mdash;&mdash;</P><?oasys [cl11.5]?>

	<P>I second amendment No. 7.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew that Senator Bannon would mention discrimination with regard to County Longford. I sympathise with his point about students and it is an issue I have raised in this House on a number of occasions. The Minister of State may differ from me in this but that is no harm. One cannot blame the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Department of Education of Science for the lack of both campus and off-campus accommodation in our universities and institutes of technology. This matter must be addressed and I have made the point that some universities have large land banks which could be used to build more student accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the hype that surrounds the issue of accommodation for students and a lot of this is generated by the ritual of queuing for newspapers and scanning the accommodation advertisements. I cannot understand why the colleges should not be able to provide students with information on accommodation vacancies instead of this situation of queues and mad scrambles around the city or town to view the accommodation. While we agree that rents in general are decreasing, I have seen no such decrease in the area of third level student accommodation. Many parents to whom I have spoken agree with me on this. It is a strange situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative regarding long term accommodation for rent supplement tenants. This legislation is a core element in this regard. Perhaps the Minister of State might outline the plans for those who are in accommodation for 18 months or longer. The private rented sector has an important role to play in assisting people who are in accommodation for more than 18 months. This does not apply to students but to those who would like more security of tenure and a better system for attaining accommodation than the payment of rent supplement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the legislation the private residential tenancies board will have the function to undertake research and provide information and policy advice in general with regard to the private rented sector. It will also have the specific function of monitoring the operation of this legis<Col N="1126"/>lation and reporting to me on any changes it might consider necessary. These functions will address the concerns expressed in the provisions of Senator Bannon&rsquo;s amendments. The proposals in amendments Nos. 7 and 8 to assign the board specific statutory functions to monitor discrimination, quality and pricing would go beyond the remit of the board as defined in the legislation. Monitoring discrimination is formally a matter for the Equality Authority and it has been allocated resources for this purpose. Enforcement of the regulations regarding standards of accommodation will remain a function of the local authorities although the Government does intend to review these standards. The board will have a specific responsibility to monitor issues such as market rents and to keep the Minister informed of circumstances in the private rented sector. In view of this the thrust of the Senators&rsquo; concerns are addressed by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The provisions of my amendments are not spelt out in the Bill. The purpose of the amendments is to grant specific responsibilities to the board, but the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks undermine the functions of the board. It is important that the Bill should specify the functions of the board in terms of monitoring the price and quality of accommodation as this objective represents the thrust of the Bill. These amendments represent an addition that should be acceptable to the Minister of State. They would strengthen the Bill from the perspective of both landlord and tenant. The onus would be placed on the landlord to ensure that no substandard accommodation is let to people, including students.</P>
    <P>The inspection of student accommodation has always been neglected. A small number of landlords let accommodation in any condition to people, particularly students and asylum seekers. One only has to travel to a few rural towns to sample the quality of accommodation that is let. It is important that the board&rsquo;s functions are spelled out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The functions of the board are specified. Legislation usually covers new ground and it is not necessary to put in new Bills everything that has been provided for in other legislation, for example, in areas such as taxation or equality. If other agencies and bodies have been established to cover those areas, there is no need to reference them in each subsequent Bill. A function of the board will be to monitor rent levels generally by reference to the type of accommodation, location and so on and report to the Minister. It will not be a function of the board to monitor discrimination as that will be dealt with by the Equality Authority. One does not have to put in the kitchen sink in all legislation. One puts in what is relevant to what one is doing and what <Col N="1127"/>is new. One does not have to duplicate the provisions of other Bills.</P><?oasys [cl11]?>

	<P>When we discussed the amendments on Committee Stage, I indicated there should not be a problem ensuring both sexes are adequately represented on the board. The interim board is split 50:50. Relatively few women have expressed an interest in working for the board in the dispute resolution field, which indicates that not many women have experience in this area. That creates a greater difficulty in achieving the desired gender balance on the dispute resolution committees.</P>
    <P>My concerns in this regard relate to the committee, not the board. Members of the dispute resolution committee will serve on a part-time, non-permanent basis and will be engaged for tribunal hearings on a case by case basis. Appointments to the committee will be made from a pool of qualified and suitable people. Given the lack of women in the dispute resolution field, the committees may not have an appropriate gender balance. I do not accept the amendments. More women than men may ultimately become members of the board but a difficulty may arise in regard to the dispute resolution committees. However, the committee members will work for the board and we will try to get the gender balance right.</P>

	<P>This issue last cropped up during the debate on the Bord Bia Bill, which was taken by the Minister for Agriculture and Food. He was accompanied by three civil servants, all of whom were female.

The Minister of State probably will not accept the amendment but I appeal to him to reflect its spirit in future legislation. I welcome his comments regarding the composition of the board. Appointments must be made on the basis of ability but consideration must also be given to the glass ceiling, which is a major issue in the corporate sector. It would be fitting if the Government was proactive in this regard.</P>

	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Over 12 months ago I introduced the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 in the Seanad. The Bill has been substantively amended and I am glad to report to the Seanad on the amendments made to the Bill in the D&aacute;il. Fourteen Government amendments were tabled and accepted on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and I propose to outline their effect.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 13, inclusive, correct a difficulty with the prior notification an employee wishing to take resumed leave must give to an employer. This became apparent when similar provisions in the Adoptive Leave Bill were being drafted. The text of the Bill as passed by the Seanad, in so far as it relates to the postponement of maternity leave or additional maternity leave, was likely to present a difficulty for employees in the practical application of certain notification provisions. Section 7(4)(<i>c</i>), as passed by the Seanad, compelled the employee to give seven days&rsquo; prior notice of her intention to resume leave which had been postponed earlier on the hospitalisation of the child. Section 7(9) provided that such resumed leave must commence within seven days of the discharge of the child from hospital. In practice this would have proved impossible for many employees to comply with, as it is usually the case that the discharge of a child from hospital would only become known to the parents on the preceding day or even on the day of discharge, requiring the immediate presence of the mother or father to care for the child at home.</P>
    <P>I felt the notification procedures in sections 7(9) and 12(8) required amendment in order to provide more flexibility to employees in this situation. Consequently, amendments Nos. 3 and 9 <Col N="1131"/>remove the notification requirements in sections 7(9) and 12 (8) by the deletion of those subsections and the incorporation of a more flexible notification requirement in sections 7(8) and 12(7) respectively.</P>
    <P>As a result, employees will be required to notify their employer of their intention to resume the untaken portion of their leave as soon as it is reasonably practicable, but not later than the day on which the leave begins. This gave rise to a number of consequential amendments, mainly to amend existing cross-references which are the subject of amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 to 8, inclusive, and Nos. 10 to 13, inclusive.</P>

   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise a D&aacute;il amendment which has not come back here and which relates to the leave provisions for bereaved fathers in the event of the death of the mother during a post-confinement period of maternity leave or the additional maternity leave period. This was brought to my attention by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, who asked me to raise it today. She raised it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Is it the subject of an amendment within the grouping?</P>

	<P>The Minister of State can perhaps clarify the position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>This arose in the D&aacute;il and I wrote to Deputy Moynihan-Cronin as a result, giving her my interpretation of the relevant section, section 10. It states that if a woman dies after the birth of a child then the father is entitled to a certain amount of time off. The Bill goes on to state that if the mother dies before the expiry of the 16th week following the week of her confinement, the period ends at the end of the 16th week. In other words, if she dies in the 15th week then the maternity leave ends at the end of the 16th week, one week later.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that if the mother dies at any time after the expiry of the 16th week, when one is into additional maternity leave, the period ends at the end of the 24th week. Deputy Moynihan-Cronin was rightly concerned that one could have a situation where, if the mother dies in week 15, the father would have only one week&rsquo;s paid leave; if she dies in week 17, he has seven weeks&rsquo; unpaid leave. In the first case he will have one week paid leave plus the other eight weeks. Section 4 states that if a father takes subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) leave &mdash; 16 weeks minus whatever he decides &mdash; he shall, if he so wishes, be entitled to further leave from his employment for a maximum period of eight consecutive weeks commencing immediately after the end of his subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) leave or <Col N="1132"/>eight weeks, all or part of which is postponed if he wants to postpone it because of illness or whatever.</P>
    <P>The position is clear. I wrote to Deputy Moynihan-Cronin who should have received my correspondence yesterday evening.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 2 relates to the subject matter of amendment No. 14 only.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 14 to section 20 corrects an omission relating to the notification of intention to return to work from a period of resumed leave in a case where the employer had waived the right to receive notification from the employee of the intention to take resumed leave. I am satisfied these amendments have improved the provisions of the Bill by offering more flexibility to employees in circumstances where they wish to resume their postponed leave on the discharge of their baby from hospital.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

  <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister of State on a job well done. I recognise that he listened carefully to all the arguments that were made on Second, Committee and Report Stages. The Minister of State has been diligent in tabling amendments which have only served to strengthen the Bill. However, there is one glaring omission from the Bill, which I raised on Second and Committee Stages. Women involved in political life, be it at local or national level, have no automatic right to maternity leave and, while such women can take time off, their political party or group does not have a right to record their votes. The difficulty arises in votes on no confidence motions or votes for the appointment of Taoiseach where one&rsquo;s vote is required to be cast. If, however, by virtue of one&rsquo;s absence due to confinement there is no leeway, pairing system or automatic entitlement to have a vote recorded until the Legislature and the Government addresses this matter, we will be discriminating against women Members of the Oireachtas and women members of local authorities, who may be absent for a vote by virtue of the need to be with their families. Whether the matter relates to this Bill or to other legislation, we are missing an opportunity to deal with it.</P>
    <P>One Member of the House is, happily, expecting a baby in the summer. Come September, however, if there was a close voting scenario, I have no doubt that, no matter what sympathy might be evident on both sides of the House, that Member would be expected to be here to do her job. That attitude is unfair, discriminatory and shows a lack of commitment to the involvement of women in our political system.</P><Col N="1133"/>
    <P>The Minister of State listened sympathetically to demands for the removal of the ridiculous time limits on applying for maternity leave, so I will lay this additional burden at his feet now. I realise that he may not be able to deal with the matter today but it is my job to make representations on behalf of women involved in politics. The Minister of State should raise the issue in whatever fora are available to him, to see what can be done during this Government&rsquo;s period of office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I commend the Minister of State and his officials for their work on this legislation. I have not been present for all debates on the Bill as it went through the House. My colleague Senator Tuffy was dealing with the matter but I have been urging her to rest because she is expecting a baby in August. The point that Senator Cox has raised is extremely interesting because it relates only to female political representatives. Pregnancy is not an illness, however. It is not like being in hospital for months on end with a broken leg or other ailments. Senator Cox&rsquo;s point should be explored further and we should examine what we can do about it. It is an important matter for democracy generally and, in particular, for the participation of women in our democracy as public representatives.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to compliment the Minister of State and his officials on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleague, Senator Terry, who is unavoidably absent. The Bill will certainly provide increased protection in this area. Senator Cox has raised a good point. We continuously lament the fact that younger women, in particular, are not involved in politics, yet this is an obvious stumbling block to their participation in political life. I must confess to my own lack of knowledge in maternity matters, but Senator Cox&rsquo;s point is both fair and appropriate. Some sort of mechanism, whereby votes can be cast on behalf of an Oireachtas Member who is absent on maternity leave, should be considered for the future. Such a system could also be considered at local authority level. As Senator Cox said, it is a glaring omission from the Bill as currently drafted. The Bill&rsquo;s provisions will, however, make for an improved situation. The Minister of State and his Government colleagues should consider Senator Cox&rsquo;s proposal for the future.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill before the House. On many occasions, officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have attended the House with the relevant Minister or Minister of State, to furnish us with a great deal of information. They have assisted us in shaping various Bills. The Bill before us will provide added protection for women who wish to re-enter the workforce. As we have been seeking to do, it will bring women back into the workplace, whose experience and qualifications have been lost to us due <Col N="1134"/>to the absence of such legislation. The Bill will also mean less hardship for families where mothers wish to work.

	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il. This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il. For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>

	<P>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann made five amendments to the Bill as passed by the Seanad on 6 April 2004, which I commend to this House. Amendment No. 1 to section 3, puts beyond doubt the needed extra-territorial scope of the section as required by the 1988 convention and protocol. Doubts were raised by reference to the definitions of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; and &ldquo;fixed platform&rdquo; in section 1, as passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2, to section 4(5), closes a procedural loop by clearly requiring the delivery to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a suspect arrested by a member of the Defence Forces. Such delivery was already required by the section in the case of any suspect delivered to a member of the Defence Forces by the master of a ship or person in charge of the fixed platform.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4, to section 7(4), are merely technical consequential amendments revising cross-references to reflect the substitution of more detailed provisions of the original section 3. Amendment No. 5 is a technical redrafting of the original section 10 in accordance with standard drafting practice as in, for example, <Col N="1135"/>the parallel Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002, sponsored by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. No change in substance is involved.</P>
    <P>The effect of the substantive amendments proposed to the 1967 Criminal Procedure Act by both Bills is to ensure that cases involving murder or attempted murder will not, on a plea of guilty, be dealt with summarily in the District Court or sent forward for sentence, and that in such cases applications for bail must now go to the High Court.</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;3.&mdash;Where both the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children have joint roles under a provision of this Act, they shall establish a central body with responsibility for the co-ordination of education and health services in these areas.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State and her officials. I tabled this amendment on the realisation that the first time I raised the matter two Departments were involved in the preparation of the plan. Overall, there could now be as many as three or perhaps four Departments involved, including the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, and, because of a reluctance on the part of the Minister to accept the extension of time beyond the 18 years of age rule, Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Given the difficulty in co-ordinating the efforts and endeavours of all parties there can be a great number of individuals and bodies involved in planning and providing services for students with special educational needs. The thinking behind the amendment is <Col N="1136"/>that in order to avoid delay there is a necessity to bring a co-ordinating group together. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, made one revealing comment here on the last occasion, which Senator Fitzgerald will remember. He said a greater joining up of thinking was his idea of what should happen. That is the essence of this amendment. I see no be better way of co-ordinating thinking than the inclusion of this amendment to ensure persons with responsibility work together in their efforts. I am not blaming the Department of Education and Science, but the Minister of State will be well aware of the position in health boards in the past. They are now being replaced by a health executive. It is next to impossible to get a timely response to a request for whatever the service and the part it plays in it. Given the way the health boards were structured I have no reason to believe there will be an internal division of the sections, though they are no longer called health boards. People at ground level will have great difficulty in getting though to those sections to get a response.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I quoted from a constituent who had returned from the US with three children, two of whom were in the special needs category. They had become involved in and availed of very fine services there. When they went to the local national school they discovered they would have to wait indefinitely to get an assessment. The parents had an assessment done privately and presented it to the principal to be forwarded to the Department. I am open to correction here. From November 2003 to date that parent has not had a response from the Department of Education and Science. Because she was conscious of the busy schedule of the principal she took it on herself to make contact with the relevant section in the Department but to date has not had a response. That parent is angry. Whether it is the Department in this instance, or the health boards in the past, there is an obvious delay and breakdown. Time is of the essence with regard to the provision of services as many Senators pointed out on Second and Committee Stages. With a view to focusing on the services required it is important that this amendment be included so those at the lower level can avail of that service.</P>
    <P>The previous day the Minister of State mentioned the division of responsibility. A division of responsibility is a sure recipe for delay. If there are lines drawn and there is a crossover by the various Departments or services there will be delays and there will be no improvement in the delivery of the service. In those circumstances, despite this being good legislation and everybody welcoming it, the reality on the ground will not be improved. I have a letter from a principal in another school from which I will read one section. It might be more appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On the amendment, Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring directly to the amendment. Parents are making demands in the context of abysmal special needs provision in primary schools. The principal has experienced that as I will explain at a later date. One of those sentences followed on from another point he was making which was relevant to another of my amendments.</P>
    <P>It is important to establish a mechanism to co-ordinate all Departments involved and facilitate the speedy provision of the services available through them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. It is to a degree ironic that the newspapers are filled with reports of the body established by the Government to consider ways to encourage enterprise. Among the body&rsquo;s conclusions is the need for agile and responsive Government. Where agile and responsive Government are considered, the issues of delay and the unwillingness of Governments of a variety of complexions to accept that decisions must be taken within a timeframe arise. Governments seem always to resist the idea that a positive or negative response should be provided within a clear timescale. Other problems involve services the provision of which requires the intervention of more than one Department or agency and the failure of the State to institutionalise a mechanism to deal with such scenarios.</P>
    <P>During my recent marathon tour of Munster, I visited a centre for people with learning disabilities located in a town in the Southern Health Board area whose hinterland included Mid-Western Health Board areas. The people there were tearing their hair out because the Southern Health Board used resources to support people with disabilities one way and the Mid-Western Health Board operated a different system. A great deal of the time of the people running the centre was taken up doing two different things for two different health boards with replication of activity simply because the boards could not work out a common approach to dealing with people with disabilities. This is one of our institutional problems. I ran into it 20 years ago when I first arrived here full of vim and vigour about homelessness to find the then Departments of Health and the Environment playing a wonderful game of ping-pong about which was responsible for the issue. The consequence of this ping-pong was that nobody was responsible.</P>
    <P>While I listened with interest to what the Minister of State had to say, I fear from my experience and what I have heard of Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s experience that where there is divided responsibility there will be no responsibility. I do not claim to be an authority in this area with which my colleague, Senator Tuffy, is dealing but there is no doubt given the experience of us all that while it seems a wonderful idea to divide responsibility by drawing in several Departments, <Col N="1138"/>the result will be that nobody is responsible. Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s amendment is worthy of the Minister&rsquo;s consideration even at this late point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>When Senator Ulick Burke tabled this amendment on Committee Stage, I said I did not agree with the piling on of additional layers to deal with issues. I am still of the same opinion. As the Minister said when dealing with the amendment on Committee Stage, the council will have quite detailed powers to deal with the necessary co-ordination, which I accept. However, the real challenge involves my greatest fear about the legislation&rsquo;s most significant flaw, which is its definition of a child as someone under 18 years of age. I have had detailed discussions with the Minister and, at this point, will accept his assurances that the issue of the age of a child will be addressed in the forthcoming disability Bill which will continue the right to education through this legislation. The council will have the job of ensuring health boards deliver on the promises made to children in education plans whether they are 18, 19 or 20 years of age. If a child is still going through the process of education at second level, he or she will be entitled by right to the education he or she deserves.</P>
    <P>The issue of joint roles for health boards and the Department of Education and Science gives rise to real and valid concerns. We have seen on a daily basis that children in mainstream education are not receiving the services of speech therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists from health boards because health resources are under such budgetary strain. I hope money will be provided through the disability Bill, whatever form it takes, and that resources will be made available as required to deliver a mix of education and health services. Hopefully, the council rather than an additional body will deal with the co-ordination of services.</P>
    <P>The challenge is for the Department of Education and Science to deliver. It has done a very fine job to date. Anybody who has noticed over the past eight or nine years the change in education for children with special needs will recognise the great work which has been done. I acknowledged as much on the previous occasions on which I have spoken to this legislation. Children with special needs are children for longer which is why they are special. If we fail to recognise that by providing for them, we are not giving them what they deserve and are entitled to as citizens. While I do not agree with Senator Ulick Burke that there is a need to make his amendment, I remind the Minister of State and the officials who are here from the Department that the real challenge will be for the council to do its job to ensure co-ordination. The council must ensure that the education plans are followed whether a child passes 18 or not. There must be no discontinuity of service and parents must not be forced to run from Billy to Jack to secure a <Col N="1139"/>continued right to education and the services being delivered for their child.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also sympathetic to the views expressed by Senator Ulick Burke. Any Member who has dealt with children with special needs in public life or professionally in education will know that 99% of what the Senator outlined is very true. We have all come face to face with such situations.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is to mean anything, its text must address the significant lacuna the existence of which has been so cogently articulated by Senator Ulick Burke. There has been a complete lack of co-ordination of services allowing State organisations to opt out of their responsibilities over the years by too frequent buck-passing. It is with sadness that we must recognise the truth of the scenario depicted by Senator Ulick Burke. While professional teachers, child psychologists and therapists were aware of needs, there was no structure in place and no law to compel them to come together with a single focus. There was no mechanism to knock heads together. A focus on the interests, well-being and benefit of the child was required rather than the stand-off scenarios which developed, motivated perhaps by professional pride among other issues.</P>
    <P>If ever a Bill was drafted to confront this unacceptable scenario, it is the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill 2003 which sets out to do so clearly and unambiguously by establishing the national council for special education. While I do not wish to be too anecdotal, I remember that in the early 1980s, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, the then Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on education, asked me to prepare a paper on special and remedial education. I availed of the services in 1986 of an eminent national expert on special education, Eamon &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, a primary teacher. The genesis of what we handed to the then Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, who was the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on education, was a proposal to establish a national council for special education, specifically for the purpose outlined in the guidelines she handed to me when I decided to carry out this research. Therefore, this proposal was put forward before 1986. I agree with Senator Ulick Burke it is now time to co-ordinate these services. Given that the Minister provided for the establishment of a national council in this Bill, it must be seen to do the work it is assigned. One of the most challenging tasks it will face is to bring about a co-ordination of services, the need for which was strongly articulated by Senators Ulick Burke, Ryan and Cox.</P>
    <P>The genesis of what will be a new era in terms of the co-ordination of these services is contained in the terms of reference, role and functions of the national council. If it is perceived in the not too distant future that those functions are not adequate to deal with and confront the inadequacies in the co-ordination of the services among the various professionals and Depart<Col N="1140"/>ments, I agree with Senator Ulick Burke that we will have to amend the role and functions of the council to give it more teeth to ensure that relevant professionals operate in a co-ordinated way. Irrespective of whether we are talking about children who are in pre-school, primary school, secondary school, or those over 18 years of age, the scenario that sadly has existed up to now should not be allowed to exist for one more day in view of what is possible.</P>
    <P>While I agree with 99% of what Senator Ulick Burke said, as Senator Cox articulated earlier, an extra body is not required to bring this about. We must ensure the council which is provided for in the Bill is given the requisite powers to implement the necessary degree of co-ordination.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ulick Burke raised this matter on Committee Stage. At that time the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, explained that the new national council for special education will be, in effect, the central body that will ensure the co-ordination of educational services. The Senator was of the view that the body would be distant because it was a national rather than a local body. That was the kernel of the argument put forward by the him on that occasion. However, the intention is that the council will work closely with the schools and health boards to ensure appropriate education provision is made available. The special needs organisers will bring together educational and medical professionals to form part of the assessment and education plan teams. They will be assigned particular schools and areas and will advise and assist schools and parents. Rather than being distant, the council will be closely involved in the education of individual children.</P>
    <P>The provision of appropriate education services for children with special educational needs absolutely requires the close co-operation and co-ordination of activities between education and health authorities. Through the linkages provided in the Bill, the current difficulties regarding co-ordination will be resolved. I understand why this is a matter of major concern for Senators Ulick Burke, Ryan, Cox and Fitzgerald who have taken part in this debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke spoke about the co-ordination of parties being perhaps the most important part of the delivery of this service. Senator Ryan was concerned that in circumstances where there would be a divided response, that would imply no response at all. Senator Cox spoke about the importance of the council being able to bring these bodies together. Senator Fitzgerald spoke about the terrible lack of structures we have had up until now to deal with the issues of concern in regard to these special children and that the importance of the council in addressing those could not be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>I genuinely believe there is no need for this amendment because the co-ordination of activities among the various agencies will be addressed particularly with regard to the council because <Col N="1141"/>the two main agencies under this Bill are the health boards and the council. This section provides for the appointment by the council and health boards of liaison officers to deal specifically with the issue of co-ordination. The Bill, as proposed, will deal with the genuine concerns expressed by the Senators.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply. Senator Fitzgerald accepts that this amendment is 99% valid. In regard to gaining access to this body, it has been said that it will constitute another layer of bureaucracy. Parents will find it as difficult to gain access to officials in the national council as to officials in the existing structures. I outlined the difficulty parents have in getting through to an official in a section in the Department with definite responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>Parents are reluctant and intimidated when they get through to a senior official in the Department in order to do what is the best for their child where a need has been established. The response can often be cold and distant. A parent who is driven by a determination to do what is best for his or her child, and who has the support of the school principal, teachers and the relevant agencies, will have to deal with another layer of bureaucracy in terms of this council. Parents who are on the edge and under pressure may find it difficult and daunting to get through to an official in the national council. For that reason, it would be preferable if a co-ordinating body was structured locally.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the health board or its replacement body, people will have identified their responsibility at local level. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that a body is put in place to ensure that these people are drawn together and their heads knocked together so there is a response to a legitimate need. It is for no other reason that I say that. Great difficulty will be experienced in dealing with the council as proposed. If, as the Minister of State and Senator Fitzgerald said, in future, and it will be sooner rather than later, personnel in the national council find they are being dragged in every direction throughout the country, that will highlight a void in terms of services for those with special needs which will have to be filled.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ulick Burke has raised a genuine point. He mentioned earlier that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to joined-up Government. We are all in favour of that because it means a better delivery of whatever services are needed to individuals in communities. We spoke about the co-ordination of policies and the operation of the council and the health boards and it will be the role of the liaison officers to address the issue raised by the Senator. There are school principals, the council and the health boards, but the role of the liaison officers is to bring this information together and to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, line 43, after &ldquo;an&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;individual&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Minister of State in her last comments mentioned the individual. We are talking about children with special needs. The response must be consistent. The section refers to arranging an assessment of a student. This must be an individual assessment. That is what this amendment seeks to ensure. To ensure consistency with what is stated earlier in the Bill, the plan must be individual to the student. The individual needs are already established. This amendment is minor, but it copperfastens the need for an individual assessment. Special needs are involved because we are talking about an individual with identified special needs. It is important that the Minister of State use &ldquo;individual assessment&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;an assessment&rdquo; so that, in schools with groups of children with special needs, a collective assessment of those groups could not be conducted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to Senator Ulick Burke very carefully on Committee Stage and understood that every reference made to individual education plans in the Bill concerns the preparation of a plan for an individual child, as I tried to articulate on Committee Stage. There is no ambiguity in this matter at any point in the Bill. The Bill brings all the relevant agencies and partners involved towards the centre but places at the core the individual child and his or her special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I believe Senator Ulick Burke detects that where there are two or three children in a school with special educational needs, there could be a tendency to lump them together when creating the education plan in the interests of expediency and saving resources, although I am sure teachers would not use the expression. In view of this, I understand the Senator&rsquo;s concern. Perhaps there is merit in his proposal to include the word &ldquo;individual&rdquo;. I do not know how the Minister of State feels about the issue but it is genuine and legitimate and I ask her to re-examine it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>The clear intention of the Bill is to confer on each child with a special educational need arising from a disability a right to receive an assessment, an educational plan and the support services necessary to meet that need. The Bill recognises that solutions for children with special needs do not lie in a one-size-fits-all approach. Obviously they must be specific to the particular children or child involved.</P>
    <P>The assessments and plans must be tailor-made for the individual child. Referring to an assessment as an individual assessment does not in any way enhance the rights a child with disabilities <Col N="1143"/>will enjoy once this Bill is enacted. As stated on Committee Stage, the application of the entire measure to individuals is unquestionable and therefore I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Senators have asked what would happen if there were a collective approach to assessment in a school with more than one child with special needs. Such an approach would not suffice under this Bill because we are talking about specific needs of specific pupils. Each child is obviously a separate entity who will need very particular attention and a specific plan to help with his or her specific needs. That we are dealing with individual plans does not necessitate the inclusion of &ldquo;individual&rdquo; as this is implicit in every part of the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has circumvented the issue by avoiding the use of the word &ldquo;individual&rdquo; through including words such as &ldquo;specific&rdquo; time and again. A specific assessment is an individual assessment and I do not know where the difference lies. The use of &ldquo;individual&rdquo; would be consistent with most sections of the Bill. This has been highlighted repeatedly and I do not know why &ldquo;specific&rdquo; is used in this instance rather than &ldquo;individual&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>In layman&rsquo;s language, those two words are interchangeable. We are proposing to provide an educational plan specific or individual to a particular child with special educational needs. I use the word &ldquo;specific&rdquo; because the essence of this legislation is that it provides for the specific needs of specific children. The question of individual plans features in the legislation and therefore the issue about which the Senator has concerns is adequately covered.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 18, line 35, to delete &ldquo;with the consent of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;having consulted with&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Section 13 is probably the kernel of the Bill. While it may be fine to see the legislation on paper, the most important issue alluded to by Members of both Houses on Second and Committee Stages was the need for adequate resources and finance to deliver the service. We have received very welcome indications that adequate resources will be provided as a result of what are in effect the shackles placed on the Minister for Finance. However, section 13(1) goes that little bit too far in using the phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;. We want balance in the Bill. To have balance we must remove from the Minister for Finance and his officials the overall power they will have in the implementation of this legislation. This is achieved by deleting &ldquo;with the consent of&rdquo; and <Col N="1144"/>substituting &ldquo;having consulted with&rdquo;, as provided for in the amendment.</P>
    <P>By stating &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;, we are qualifying everything. There is no denying that the Minister for Finance has responsibility for the national finances but it is within his remit to give to the Minister for Education and Science a certain sum of money and ask him to deliver what he can with it because he will get no more. With the permission of the Chair, I will draw a parallel with the health services. In the past four years, when there were adequate finances to solve the problems in the health sector, the Minister for Finance did invest a certain amount but put a limit on it. This will also be the case in financing education for persons with special educational needs if he continues to have such a grip on the purse-strings of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>As I stated, this legislation looks wonderful on paper. It is a wonderful breakthrough &mdash; this jargon can be used &mdash; but the necessary resources must be provided and a balance struck such that the Minister for Finance will not be able to negate the effectiveness of the Minister for Education and Science in delivering those resources to the schools and individuals who need them. This is my fear and that is why the amendment was tabled. I remain to be convinced otherwise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. In the 20 or more years I have been in this House I have seen more than 1,000 Bills go through the Oireachtas. Those which contained references to expenditure included a sub-clause stating that the Minister required the &ldquo;consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. This is mythology. If the Minister for Finance devoted himself to giving consent to all of the legislation which requires it he would do nothing else. The truth of the myth is that power is handed over to middle ranking public servants in the Department of Finance. Only the Department of Finance, with its extraordinary view of itself, would see that as a good way to do business. One of the greatest obstacles to the efficient delivery of public service is the enormous inefficiency arising from the centralising instincts of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>In every Department there are well paid and well trained Accounting Officers who should be responsible for expenditure. Money should be allocated to Departments and the responsibility for spending it should lie with the Minister and the Accounting Officer. Once funds are allocated to a Department there should be no need to refer back to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I have always been sceptical about references in legislation to moneys provided by the Oireachtas. The Seanad does not have a role in the provision of funds. All Bills should refer to moneys provided by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. The phrase, &ldquo;moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo; is in breach of the Constitution. However, that is for another day&rsquo;s debate.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1145"/>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senator Ryan that the word used in section 13 is &ldquo;may&rdquo; and not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. It makes no significant difference whether we include or delete the phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. The inclusion of the phrase is consistent with the role of Government and the way it operates. We discussed this matter yesterday and I do not propose discussing it in detail.</P>
    <P>The Bill is given strength by subsection 9(7), which we referred to yesterday and which I may not deal with now, and section 13. Section 13 places a legal imperative on the Ministers for Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and also on the Minister for Finance. The section provides that all Ministers must, in allocating resources for the purposes of the Bill, have regard to the constitutional imperative contained in Article 42. The Constitution requires that children with special educational needs be given a level of support comparable in effect to their peers who do not have such needs. That provision is clearly enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>To decide whether a level of support is adequate requires a subjective judgment. If the Minister for Education and Science decides that the support provided in a particular year is adequate and the Minister for Finance agrees to it, anyone may disagree with that perception of adequacy and seek a judicial review in the courts. The right to a judicial review remains, even when the Minister for Education and Science decides that a level of support is adequate, and a parent may take that course. The powers vested in parents, or appellants, in the amended section 13 are unique and unprecedented. This section does much more for the Bill than the deletion of phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a good discussion on this matter yesterday. As Senator Ryan said, the Constitution confers on the Lower House the supreme role in the matter of public finances. The Government must obtain its approval to spend public money and the Minister for Finance is accountable to that House for expenditure.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole felt that the wording of section 13 suggested that, having received his allocation for a particular year, the Minister for Finance might get a second bite of the cherry by being able to determine how much of the allocation is spent on educational plans. I reassure Senators that this is not the intention of the provision. Subsection 13(1) simply states that enough money must be made available to allow for the preparation and implementation of educational plans. This would happen as part of the overall allocation process and a two stage process is not envisaged.</P>
    <P>Senators expressed concern yesterday that the Minister would set an unreasonably low level of funding for the preparation and implementation of educational plans. This is not the case and this <Col N="1146"/>section will prevent rather than facilitate such a strategy. It was to this that Senator Fitzgerald very ably referred. It is a well established principle of administrative law that a Minister must not act unreasonably in exercising his or her function. If a decision were made to make a clearly inadequate allocation for educational plans, a person would have a good case to bring this before the courts. Ministers must act reasonably in performing their functions. This provision will ensure that the Ministers are reminded, when an allocation is made each year, of their duties under the Constitution. A key objective of the Bill is to ensure equality between those who have special needs and those who do not.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also remarked that this provision is unprecedented. It is difficult not to agree with that view. It makes the rights contained in the Bill immeasurably stronger.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for that reply. The Minister of State suggests that people who are not satisfied with the allocation of funding should go to the courts. When the Minister for Education and Science presented this legislation to the House, he indicated his absolute determination to avoid having to go to court at all costs. I do not intend a pun on the words &ldquo;at all costs&rdquo;. The wall which deters people from going to court is growing higher and higher. Must an individual who feels he or she cannot get his or her entitlements always resort to the courts? Having seen the examples of the Sinnott and O&rsquo;Donoghue cases, no parent would want to go down that road. The Minister is determined, through this legislation, to deter people from going down that road. It is unfortunate that the Minister of State mentioned that course of action.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>We must recognise how Government works. It is up to the Minister for Education and Science of the day to fight his or her case with the Minister for Finance to get his or her annual allocation for the Department. That is how Government works for all Departments.</P>
    <P>This issue is strengthened by the fact that there is a legal imperative on the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education and Science to carry out their duties. A person can make a subjective judgment about whether the money is sufficient and that individual can decide at election time if he or she agrees with the priorities of Government. This legislation, however, places a legal imperative on the Ministers to carry out their duties and copper fastens the position of the child.</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 19, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P><Col N="1147"/>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4) In exercising powers under <i>subsection (1)</i>, special provision shall be made in respect of the increased demands placed on schools, in particular, Gaelscoileanna.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment would ensure that children with special educational needs have the same rights to avail of and benefit from education as their peers.</P>
    <P>It may be obvious that a child should go to a Gaelscoil but this choice will be denied because so many Gaelscoileanna are in their infancy and have totally inadequate facilities. If a child with special needs had a choice or his parents wanted him to go to a Gaelscoil because of their own linguistic background or their determination that the child will be educated through Irish, they will be deterred from going to a Gaelscoil instead of to a mainstream school. If the parents of a child with special needs want him to go to a Gaelscoil, there must be a clear indication that resources will be found for the adequate provision of services in that school. Most of the Gaelscoileanna established in the last decade are still in unacceptable accommodation and lacking facilities. We must highlight those schools because their needs are greater than any other school.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. Bh&iacute; m&eacute; i nGaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne le linn deireadh na seachtaine agus thug m&eacute; faoi deara go raibh com&oacute;rtais eagraithe ag daoine a bh&iacute; d&iacute;rithe ar leana&iacute; le riachtanais speisialta ach ba chom&oacute;rtais iad a bh&iacute; eagraithe ina n-ioml&aacute;n tr&iacute; Ghaeilge. Nuair a chonaic m&eacute; an leas&uacute; seo bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag smaoineamh go bhf&eacute;adfainn ceist a chur ar an Aire St&aacute;it. What provision will be made not just in Gaelscoileanna but in Gaeltacht schools to ensure that the capacity to carry out an assessment and make provision will exist in the child&rsquo;s home language? There are literally thousands of children, with numbers dramatically increasing according to the recent census, who are being brought up with Irish as a first language. It is important that children whose first language is Irish and who have special educational needs should have both the right to have the assessment through that language and to have the provision of whatever special education services they need through the language of the home.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan referred to riachtanais&iacute; speisialta. That requirement applies not alone to the Irish language but in an era of multiculturalism, across the board. There is a genuine case for the amendment and it is true that in many cases additional resources are needed to deal with the linguistic and cultural requirements in Gaeltachta&iacute; and Gaelscoileanna but surely this Bill, the Education Act, the Equal Status Act and the Official Languages Act must, individually and in aggregate, take account of the multiculturalism that we all support. We cannot focus on the needs of a child without taking account of his or her linguistic and cultural needs because otherwise the assessments will be flawed and any appellant <Col N="1148"/>will be able to demonstrate that in an appeal. I sympathise with the amendment but, as far as I understand the Bill and the other Acts, it is unnecessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>This is another issue that was given a good airing on Committee Stage. It comes down to the kernel of what the Bill will do for children. The education plans will be drawn up for each child and each child will have different needs. Children will have rights whether their first language is English or Irish. Although the amendment refers specifically to Gaelscoileanna, Senator Ryan&rsquo;s point about schools in Gaeltacht areas is noted and the amendment obviously applies across the board. It must do so because, as Senator Fitzgerald said, it would not be fair to any child unless the work for that individual child was done in the child&rsquo;s own first language or the language of his or her choice for the test.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to multiculturalism. I am particularly interested in that facet because one of my responsibilities as Minister of State is to ensure there are courses for those whose first language is not English, namely non-nationals. This legislation, the Equality Act and the Official Languages Act, ensure equality of treatment.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the issue of the physical infrastructure, particularly in Gaelscoileanna and that is a separate matter. I congratulate the Senator for raising those issues. The question of the building programme is of interest to all Members of both Houses.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 19, line 37, after &ldquo;disabilities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and ensure that children with disabilities are not subject to bullying or unfair treatment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Bullying is a fact of life in many schools, at both primary and secondary level. It is a greater tragedy if children with special needs are regarded as an easier target for such bullying. Both the Minister of State and I acknowledge that in many schools, the boards of management, teachers and students go out of their way to be visibly supportive of children with special needs. It only takes one person to increase the difficulty for children with special needs. That difficulty often manifests itself at home rather than in the school environment. A child may refuse to go to school or it may manifest as illness.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment. There is no national plan for dealing with bullying. It is dealt with at local level. A national plan to deal with bullying in the workplace was called for and reported on in the newspapers last week. In this instance, it is very important that the school is mandated to protect children and to provide even greater protection for children with special needs. I qualify that <Col N="1149"/>statement by saying that most schools are very sensitive to the idea that bullying must be eliminated from the school situation. It is important that this legislation clearly states that school authorities must eliminate bullying as quickly as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is not necessary, in my view. By virtue of section 11 of the Equal Status Act, a person who is responsible for the operation of a school, must not allow another person who has a right to be present in that place, such as a student, to suffer harassment at that place. Harassment occurs where a person subjects another to any unwelcome act, request or conduct, including spoken words, gestures or the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material, which is in respect of the victim and is based on any discriminatory ground, including disability and which could reasonably be regarded as offensive, humiliating or intimidating to him or her.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke requested the implementation of a national plan to deal with bullying. He will be interested to hear that the Equality Authority and the Department of Education and Science, have produced a joint publication on the Equal Status Act and its application in schools. It is a useful document which addresses these issues and helps provide a blueprint for school managements.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 21, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;20.&mdash;(1) The Minister shall ensure that parents of children to whom this Act applies shall be afforded adequate counselling and support services.</P>
    <P LI="2">(2) In complying with <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Minister shall recognise the importance of promoting the communication between such parents and facilitating the exchange of views.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">When parents realise that a child has special needs, depending on the severity of the disability, this can have a serious impact on the family, the individual parents and siblings. This Bill will guarantee the parents&rsquo; input into the education of their child. There is no doubt that parents will need counselling, assistance and support. There is a shock to the system and to the family and educational environment. This section of the Bill refers to information regarding the student being made available to parents. There is an emphasis on the provision of information but no indication of the necessity for parents to have access to professional counselling to help them be supportive of the child&rsquo;s needs. It was highlighted in the debate on Second Stage that people may with<Col N="1150"/>draw emotionally from a situation and be in denial. This could be highly detrimental to the child with special needs and could add further to the delay. I cannot find in the Bill any mechanism whereby parents have access to counselling and support services for the short time it may be required. It would not be a great expenditure at any level but it is very important to some parents.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the points made by Senator Burke. This was discussed on Second Stage. It is vitally important that the whole weight of the services being provided by the State move into action as soon as a child is diagnosed with a special need. Disabilities legislation is the most appropriate place to provide for this type of support and counselling. I hope the input of the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform will ensure the disability Bill includes a strong section making provision for a journey path to be drawn up immediately a learning difficulty is identified, whether at birth or aged two, three or four years. This must make clear which State services will be required in education and health, for example, speech and occupational therapy. The challenge is to provide children with the necessary resources and services from birth onwards.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not the appropriate framework for making such provision because it relates solely to children in education. While I cannot support the amendment, the views articulated by Senator Ulick Burke are valid and need to be taken on board in the wider context of disability and I look forward to them being addressed in the disability Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the concerns raised by Senators Ulick Burke and Cox in this highly sensitive area. The Bill gives parents a central role in the education of their children. One of the reasons it has gained support across the board is that it allows parents to request that an assessment be carried out, be involved in and form part of the educational plan team, seek the advice and guidance of the special education council and appeal decisions affecting their child&rsquo;s education to an independent body. The parents are, therefore, central to the process of providing for the specific educational needs of their special child.</P>
    <P>The Comhairle (Amendment) Bill will provide for the introduction of advocacy services for children and adults. I do not propose to introduce such a provision in this legislation as it would create an unhelpful overlap and possible inconsistencies between the two Bills. As Senator Cox stated, it may be possible to consider the matter in the context of other legislation under preparation.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1151"/>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment as regards the inclusion of such a provision in the disability Bill, which we hope is being finalised. The disability Bill, as Senator Cox stated, is the most appropriate framework for addressing this matter because it also covers adults and parents.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have no responsibility regarding the provisions of legislation produced by other Ministers, I will pass on the concerns raised by Senators on this specific issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 21, between lines 43 and 44 to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>g</i>) to ensure that teachers are trained to the highest international standards in special educational needs;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to ensure teachers are trained to the highest international standards in special educational needs. To illustrate the current position in this regard, I will cite a letter from a school principal to which I referred on a previous occasion when the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was present. It highlights that, despite their best intentions and good will, the onus placed on teachers to deliver best quality education to children identified in schools as having special educational needs creates fear among many teachers delivering special needs. It states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Ulick, what can a principal do when teachers come in tears to you because they perceive themselves as failing the Special Needs child? I know these teachers are doing an excellent job, but I can acknowledge their perception they have absolutely no training for dealing with children [with special needs].</P>
    <P FLI="0">When one considers that this is replicated in practically every primary school and secondary level school, it is clear we have a serious problem. Moreover, the current annual throughput of newly qualified special needs teachers is only 35.</P>
    <P>The Department must provide much more extensive inservice training for teachers. This cannot be done on the cheap, as has been the case with the introduction of various new subjects to the curriculum in national and secondary schools. The approach taken in the past has created reluctance among many teachers to participate in inservice training. The Department must give a clear indication of a sea change in its approach to retraining, which has been inadequate.</P>
    <P>Many teachers are growing old and more than 20% of them will leave the system in the next five years. Apart from their lack of experience, few new teachers entering the profession will have training in special educational needs, whereas the number of students identified as having special needs and entering mainstream education will <Col N="1152"/>increase. With the level of need increasing on two fronts, it is vital the Department address the urgent need for adequate and acceptable inservice training.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with developing inservice training is the unwillingness by some parents to accommodate it. One hears in the media, on radio programmes, for example, parents complaining that a teacher has been absent from school for several days because he or she is in training. A price must be paid. School managers, principals and boards of management face great difficulty organising inservice training but the nettle must be grasped and all possible measures taken to ensure we have a sufficient number of trained teachers to meet the requirements of the legislation. This will not be easy while one has snipers in the media and among parents. While I have the greatest of respect for the right of parents to get the best for their children, some of them do not think beyond their own requirements.</P>
    <P>Funding, the main problem, is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance who must realise that proper inservice training for teachers has never been adequately resourced.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. I come late to the Bill because I was not dealing with it. The functions of the council, as set out in the Bill, do not feature a reference to the necessity to ensure that adequate numbers of properly trained teachers are available to meet the requirements of making information available, monitoring the progress of students, assessing and reviewing the resources required and ensuring that a continuum of special educational provision is available. These requirements will impact on teachers, particularly since the objective of the legislation is, in as far as possible, to have children with special educational needs educated in the framework of mainstream schools.</P>
    <P>I know many teachers and many of my family members are teachers. It is delightful and extraordinary to hear teachers of my age say how good are young new national teachers. Older people often say that national school teachers are no longer as good as in their own time. However, I have heard many national teachers in their 50s and early 60s speak of the extraordinary quality and enthusiasm of their younger counterparts. It is fantastic to hear that the quality of our primary school teachers is, if anything, better than it has ever been. If one imposes a lot of obligations, desirable as they may be, on national teachers without ensuring they receive the training necessary to fulfil those obligations, that goodwill and enthusiasm may be stifled. The Minister of State will respond that such provision for training is implied in many of the provisions of the Bill but the statement that teachers are entitled to training of the highest international standing is necessary, not least for the sake of the teachers themselves. It is necessary in terms of the allocation of resources and also to ensure the fantastic enthusiasm and idealism of young national teachers is <Col N="1153"/>not stifled by aspirations that are not matched by the provision for training.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether the formula of words proposed by Senator Burke in his amendment is necessary is a matter for the Minister of State&rsquo;s judgment but the aspiration which it represents is essential. If that aspiration is not translated and given effect in the Bill, the state-of-the-art framework set out in the Bill will not be realised. That there is a timescale for the implementation of the Bill of five years obliges the Government to ensure that sufficient cohorts of the types of specialist teachers to which Senator Burke refers in his amendment are provided. One cannot implement the provisions of this Bill in a top drawer fashion unless the professionals are available at the coalface to do so. The national council for special education or the special educational needs organisers cannot do so, only the teachers can and if they do not have the skills to which Senator Burke referred then the provisions of this Bill, about which we are so enthusiastic, will come to nothing.</P>
    <P>In 1985 a Fine Gael Deputy and I were approached by the parents of a six year old boy who had been diagnosed as autistic, although he was later found to be suffering from a condition related to autism rather than autism itself. The boy&rsquo;s father, who was a Fine Gael politician and good friend of mine, was advised by a relative in the then Department of Education that the best course of action was to place the child in a comfortable residential institution for life. Without casting aspersions on any individual, that was the establishment mindset in the Department at the time. This story illustrates how far we have come despite the significant lacunae we all acknowledge are there. The glorious opportunity that is presented by this Bill must not be lost. Incidentally, that six year old boy is now a third level graduate, working as a professional in a building not half a mile from this House. This is a marvellous story of the endurance, commitment and determination of that child&rsquo;s parents and their refusal to accept the mindset of officials who did not have the academic qualifications or the professional expertise to make a holistic judgment as to his requirements. It is frightening to think what could have become of that boy.</P>
    <P>There should no longer be a situation where parents must fight the odds. The framework is there, the facilities are there and we must ensure the professionals are there to provide the services. I am unsure if Senator Burke&rsquo;s amendment is required but I am enthusiastic about its intention.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that we are lucky to have a tremendous teaching profession. I am fortunate that my job allows me to witness the idealism of which Senator Ryan spoke on almost a daily basis. This morning I spent some time in Kilbarrack at a summer camp for seven to 11 year olds and the enthusiasm and interest of the <Col N="1154"/>teachers in each child was evident. Teachers want to give the best possible service to the children they teach, including those with special needs. It is vital that we address the issue of inservice training and training within the teacher training colleges because education changes quickly as we become aware of the changing practices regarding conditions such as autism and other learning difficulties. I understand there is a commitment in the Department of Education and Service to provide further funding for teacher training, which is another acknowledgement of the important work that teachers are doing and an attempt to assist them in that work.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendment No. 7, I do not see how the national council for special education could ensure that adequate training and professional development for teachers in the area of special needs would be provided because teaching standards are not the remit of the council but rather a policy matter for the Minister. However, the council will be free to advise on this and its perspective will enrich the Minister&rsquo;s decision. It is also a matter for the teaching council when it is established as it will have responsibility for accrediting teacher educational programmes and reviewing the standards of knowledge, skill and competence required for teaching practice. The national council for special education will have a function to liaise with the teaching council on this matter even though the issue of teaching qualifications and standards is not directly within the remit of the former. It is primarily a function of the teaching council and therefore the provision of this amendment is inappropriate. The concerns represented in the amendment are being addressed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>One hopes this legislation will be enacted quickly but there must be a realisation that there is an acute shortage of teachers, particularly at primary level, and there is a very large percentage of untrained substitute teachers. That is a difficulty which the Minister for Education and Science must acknowledge and address. Senators Ryan and Fitzgerald and the Minister of State have acknowledged the enthusiasm that exists among national school teachers. I do not know whether it was inadvertent or deliberate but the Minister has dampened enthusiasm by issuing a short-sighted directive on the duration of the school year in the recent past. In addition, the directive he issued prior to last Christmas will be forever etched in the minds of teachers. He totally disregarded the effort, endeavour and commitment of teachers. Inspectors always supported teachers and he has dampened their commitment.</P>
    <P>There is a greater need now than ever before for teachers to undertake inservice training but they can quite easily stand back from participating now because they can say it is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility and he has a policy in this regard. I plead with the Minister of State to convey the message to the Minister that it is time for him <Col N="1155"/>to rebuild the bridges he burned because of his attitude. His attitude was coloured by sections of the media, which harped on day in, day out about teachers being out of the classroom. The reason they were not in the classroom was they wanted to enhance their performance by participating in inservice training, which was often arranged on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the Department. That was terrible.</P>
    <P>If the legislation is to be worthwhile and effective, the Minister must address issues such as this. It is incumbent on him to ensure the legislation gets off on a good footing and to make sure everybody affected by it will accept it. He should support the legislation by making the necessary resources available to allow teachers to implement its provisions. There is no better group to respond to the needs of pupils when the chips are down. However, the Minister cannot expect a return on the legislation while, at the same time, clobbering teachers with abuse.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator wants to ensure the highest quality teacher training is provided but that is not the business of the council. That will be an issue for the teaching council when it is established and that is why I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 24, line 42, to delete &ldquo;5 years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3 years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We have been around the houses on this issue. There is potential for delay in the implementation of the legislation by providing that it should be done within five years. I am fearful of this provision and that is why I tabled the amendment. It must be ensured the legislation is fully implemented in less than five years because many children who will not be able to avail of the full benefits of the legislation will have lost out again. Once they lose out in their formative years, which are important, they will continue to lose out down the line. It is fine if future legislation kicks in to address the age barrier referred to by Senator Cox earlier. We have heard the reasons for the resistance to shortening the implementation period but it is imperative that it should be reduced from five to three years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. It is a fact of life, not a political issue, that government in general has resisted rigid timetables. However, it has very often demanded them from others. I raised this issue during the debate on the regional technical colleges Bill with the then Minister for Education, Deputy Seamus Brennan. The Bill contained a detailed prescription of deadlines by which the colleges had to supply various information to the Department of Education but it did not prescribe, for instance, that the Department <Col N="1156"/>should give adequate notice to the colleges of their budgets, which often arrive halfway through the year. There is an enormous reluctance on the part of Government to be judged by the performance standards that most other people expect to be judged by. Yesterday&rsquo;s report referred to the need for agile, efficient Government. The suggestion that five years is a reasonable timescale to implement this legislation is a classic example of government thinking on timescales.</P>
    <P>Two light rail lines costing &euro;600 million were built in Dublin in far less than five years. Five years is an extraordinary period. Two general elections on average can be held in five years. However, five years in this context refers to the time from which various sections are brought into force. That is extraordinarily long.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was discussed at length during the Bill&rsquo;s progress through the other House and it is difficult to see how the implementation period of no more than five years can be reduced. It has been broadly supported by interest groups as a realistic timescale. A great deal of consultation took place in drafting the legislation and taking amendments in the D&aacute;il. The council can implement all phases in a shorter timeframe if it is possible but if an unrealistic shorter timescale is set, the council is likely to be discredited in failing to meet it. Introducing mechanisms to ensure the rights of children with special needs is protected through an incremental process and attempting to speed it up to an unreasonable extent runs the risk of derailing the entire process. I, therefore, do not accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Within the five-year timeframe, in the first year and possibly the second the allocation of money will be so impressive that people will really begin to hope. They will think this is a panacea, but if it were implemented over a shorter period people would just say the legislation was being implemented.</P>
    <P>In this timeframe we cannot get going. If the pressure is on to deliver and there is a commitment to do so then that can be done in a shorter period if there is a willingness to do so. Bodies may say they cannot be seen to fail but the finger will be pointed at the Minister for failure, not the organisations.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable for people to go cap in hand for five years. We are told the money is in the national coffers, so why not move quickly if these measures can be put in place quickly, as we are told? We are not gathering information or reporting any more. We need action and if we cannot make this legislation active in a shorter period than five years then some questions must be asked. The consultation is all over and, my God, any member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science saw what it meant to so many groups who put across the urgency of their plight. What is stalling this for five years? It is not acceptable that the council or <Col N="1157"/>whatever organisation is formed as a result of this legislation can say that if it cannot meet the deadline of five years then it will be seen to have failed. That is a very poor response to people&rsquo;s needs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Senator that this is not a matter of stalling the issue. We all want to see these matters progress as quickly as possible. It is not correct for Senator Ryan to say in a pejorative way that this is a reasonable time according to the Government. What is being proposed is a very realistic timetable which is based on a great deal of consultation. Obviously the interest groups were very involved in the legislation and this was looked on as a reasonable time in which to get this work done for a child. The council is in a position to implement all phases in a shorter timeframe if it finds a particular case which can be expedited in that way.</P>
    <P>The concerns raised here about time do not have a sure footing because we are talking here about the realistic position, therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 33, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;39.&mdash;For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Act or any other enactment shall prevent a person from having full access to the Courts at any time to enforce, assert or enhance their rights which accrue under or arise from this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We touched inadvertently on this amendment earlier. There was a clear indication in the statements of the Minister in the D&aacute;il and on Committee Stage that his idea was to avoid at all costs a situation where anybody would have to have recourse to the courts. We know from the past that is not the case. There are situations where people must have recourse to the courts, and the Minister mentioned a case herself when she mentioned resources. If a person does not feel they are getting adequate resources from the Minister he or she can go the courts.</P>
    <P>Based on people&rsquo;s past experience, they will not want to go to court despite the fact that there are no alternatives. The Minister has included a definite deterrent in the hope that parents will not go down that road at any costs. The wall is getting higher and higher in order to avoid that situation. As she said, the reality is that someone will query the resources and the only place to resolve it is through the courts. It is unfortunate that there seems to be a determination to deter &mdash; prevent might be too strong a word &mdash; people from taking that option, which is their absolute right and entitlement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P><Col N="1158"/>
    <P>Parents have always been slow to go the courts under Article 42 of the Constitution. The only body I know of which was caught under Article 42 was the Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation. In a certain strike it was found liable for substantial sums because it was suggested it had taken away children&rsquo;s constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>Parents are reluctant to take this route and the fact that some parents of children with particularly severe and demanding needs went all the way to the Supreme Court was more of a commentary on the intensity of the gap in the service than on the tendencies of parents. It should not be a problem to insert clarity in the legislation about an issue which is clearly included already, namely the right of parents to use the courts to vindicate their rights and those of their children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is unnecessary. The right to litigate and to have access to the courts is a personal right guaranteed by the Constitution and recognised by the courts for some time now. I agree with Senators Ryan and Burke when they say the right to go to court is an absolute right of any citizen but there is nothing in the Bill which suggests otherwise. I will not accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>This is one of the great days in the life of a Legislature which passes ground-breaking legislation. We may be sorry that this has been slow in coming but it is a huge step forward in addressing the education of children with special needs. I speak in recognition of the &euro;3.2 billion being spent on disability per year. The Bill provides a framework of rights for children with special needs and I know the Minister and Ministers of State who have attended the debate are convinced that the issues I and others raised in section 1, the age of children with special needs, are dealt with adequately in the Bill and that any special areas will be dealt with adequately in future legislation. I refer particularly to the area of disability.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to criticise the Minister. As the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, was first off the blocks in providing this legislation.</P>
    <P>However, while I accept his recommendations and assurances, I am greatly disappointed that it was not possible for him to address the age issue in this legislation. He could have done so. The Bill should have recognised the difference between children with special needs and children who do not have such needs in an age timeframe. The Supreme Court has ruled that every child under 18 has a constitutional right to receive an education. The Bill gave us an opportunity to <Col N="1159"/>provide greater rights, within a statutory framework, to deal with children who have reached 18 in terms of their chronological age but not in terms of their educational requirements.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and represents a job well done. My only disappointment is that the age issue has not been tackled. I challenge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance to deliver what is required in the disabilities Bill, which has not yet been published. Following one of the most positive debates on disability that I have heard since becoming a Senator in 1997, the message from all sides of the House is clear. The challenge is for those Ministers to ensure that the rights of children with special needs will continue to be guaranteed &mdash; with no break in continuity and no need to go to court or an appeals board &mdash; through second level education. We must enshrine their entitlements as we move forward to deal with other legislation, including the disabilities Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank the departmental officials and the various Ministers for the courtesy they have shown to me in recent weeks. While I am not fully convinced, I will bow to their greater knowledge and judgment. I hope I will be proved wrong and that my fears will be groundless.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, and her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for having steered the legislation though the House. They did so while being able to accept other points of view, which does not happen in all cases. If the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, had been here I think we would have crossed swords and there would have been flames on occasion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at all.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That was avoided because of the way in which both Ministers of State handled the debate. I also wish to thank the departmental officials. The debate has been a great learning experience for all who participated in it. It was instructive to follow the debate in the Lower House, in addition to following the proceedings of the Committee on Education and Science where representatives of so many interest groups appeared as witnesses. Senator Fitzgerald and others who are members of that committee know that through the consultation process, everybody received an insight into the legislative requirements. The departmental officials took most of those needs into consideration.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what Senator Cox said because my first amendment on Committee Stage related to the 18-year age limit. I always considered that it would be an easy transition for children with special needs to be educated while they were in full-time education, rather than having a cut-off point. There will be difficulties but when they are <Col N="1160"/>identified I hope the Minister of the day will act to amend the legislation accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Department should take note of teachers&rsquo; requirements and provide the necessary support for them to implement the legislation with enthusiasm. That enthusiasm is there but visible support and determination is required on the Minister&rsquo;s part. Adequate in-service training should be provided for those who are actively involved in teaching children with special needs. Unfortunately, not enough specialised teachers are being trained at the moment. We must act quickly to support those children currently within the education system who are categorised as having special needs. It will take time to implement the legislation, but parents of children with special needs, who are crying out for support, need assistance immediately.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, some parents have been told that their special needs support services are being reduced from five to two and a half hours per week, or in some cases from two and half hours to none. That situation cannot be allowed to fester. The Minister must act swiftly on those issues. Funding is required but the provision of caring personnel is also needed. When that element of care comes from the Minister to those who are providing services, the battle will be over and the rewards will be reaped.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I subscribe fully to Senator Cox&rsquo;s view that the education of people with special needs ought not be constrained by considerations of time. Given such people&rsquo;s needs, age is an artificial constraint. I am intrigued that the legislation is entitled the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill, when in fact it concerns education for children with special needs. Nonetheless, nobody would deny that the Bill is groundbreaking, positive and universally welcome. I compliment the Ministers involved, their officials and the Government for having produced this legislation. I wish them well in their struggles with the Department of Finance, which still insists that education is not a productive investment. It is hard to discern from where the Department got that notion, but if one reads the annual Book of Estimates, education is regarded as social expenditure. For those of us with eyes to see, however, education is a vastly productive investment. If we did not have primary education we would not have much of a productive nature going on in the country. The idea that education is not a productive investment is a figment of the Department of Finance&rsquo;s imagination, but it makes the Minister for Education and Science&rsquo;s struggle more difficult when such a mindset still prevails.</P>
    <P>I wish the Ministers well. In their struggle for resources, they can be sure of the opposition&rsquo;s support, however negative it may be in its articulation. The opposition&rsquo;s job is to ensure that the pressure to obtain resources is both vigorous and successful. If the necessary resources are available it will make an enormous difference to chil<Col N="1161"/>dren with special needs and to their parents who have suffered enormously from finding themselves in a hiatus, bereft of services or any understanding of their children&rsquo;s needs. I hope the legislation works well.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ministers of State, Deputies de Valera and Brian Lenihan, who have piloted the Bill through the House. I join with my colleagues in complimenting them for their attention to the detail of the debate. More important, they have responded meaningfully and holistically to the many views expressed. I also thank the officials in the Department of Education and Science for their commitment to the Ministers of State and to the House.</P>
    <P>I have sometimes been accused of being over the top in my use of words, but I believe history has been made here today. The Bill firmly establishes a fundamental milestone in the development of the provision of special education for our children and signposts a far deeper enlightenment about those needs than ever before. All of us have seen many Bills in the areas of education and health pass through the House but this Bill makes history because it is revolutionary, which word I assert the right to use. It is revolutionary because it is unprecedented.</P>
    <P>On many occasions Members of the Oireachtas have to the best of their abilities sought to articulate, assert, defend and vindicate the rights of those who have been educationally disadvantaged and left on the margins. The manner in which those rights are being vindicated in this Bill is far stronger than before. The hiatus in this area has been allowed to drift for various reasons but is addressed firmly by this Bill through a comprehensive framework, which establishes this moment in the history of education policy as being quite significant. Moreover, much good can come of it.</P>
    <P>I warmly embrace the sentiments expressed on both sides of the House on how we deliver the state-of-the-art service at the coalface, which is inherent in the Bill. We can only do this with state-of-the-art professionals who must be trained to an international standard of expertise, all of which I fully endorse.</P>
    <P>When we were growing up and going to school and subsequently as teachers, we were told that education is a continuum. More recently, we have been told that education is about life-long learning. We were also told growing up that education was for life. However, John Dewey in St. Patick&rsquo;s College in Drumcondra said that education is life itself. Never was that truer than in the case of what this Bill seeks to articulate and establish by vindicating and implementing the rights of every child.</P>
    <P>In the Leader&rsquo;s absence, I told the House that in 1985 or 1986 she had asked me to prepare a paper on special needs education, the terms of reference of which were to prepare a policy which, when we were back in Government, would <Col N="1162"/>seek to maximise the potential of every individual child. To this end, I employed the services of &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, whom I regarded then as the national expert on special education in Ireland. With no disrespect to the officials present, he was far ahead of anyone in the Department of Education at the time in terms of expertise, academic qualifications and so on. The core of our report to the then Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke was a proposal for the establishment of the national council for special education as well as one in respect of remedial education.</P>
    <P>The then Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke set out to ensure that if the proposal was put in place, it would secure the maximisation of the potential of every pupil in the State. Unfortunately, more austere times took over which prevented the full implementation of the plan. Nonetheless, I commend the Leader for the many initiatives she brought forward, even in those austere times. Just as education is a continuum, so there is that continuum here today.</P>

	<P>I do not often take the opportunity to speak on the Final Stage of a Bill but, when I saw it coming to a conclusion having been following its progress on the monitor, I came to the House to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, as well as Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, both of whom piloted the Bill through this House. I also congratulate the participants in the debate. I noted the Minister of State&rsquo;s warm responses, which were mirrored by those of Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>
    <P>It was an amazing experience to witness the manner in which this Bill was dealt with in this House, particularly the authentic voices of education of Senators Fitzgerald, Cox, Ulick Burke, Ryan and others. This is an historic day because children now have a right to have whatever potential they have realised and, as in the Latin term <i>educare,</i> brought forth and made to blossom. The Bill, the fruition of which represents very fine work by this Chamber over the past two weeks, will achieve all of this and I wish it well. I particularly extend my thanks to the Minister of State, the Acting Chairman and the officials who have patiently noted, waited, come and gone, as is the case with all officials. It is a good day for education and for young people.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their constructive, sincere and heartfelt contributions to this debate. I enjoyed being here through Second and Committee Stages recently and today on Report and Final Stages. The generosity of spirit displayed by Senators on all sides raised the level of debate above the usual party political one, which was very important given the essence of the discussion.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that the issues raised here today in a broader sense, in regard to teacher training and age by Senators Ulick Burke and Cox respectively, will be addressed carefully. <Col N="1163"/>Senator Cox referred to the disability Bill and the issues she raised today will be addressed in that Bill. I thank the Acting Chairman and the other Senators who have served as Acting Chairmen throughout this debate. I also thank the officials from the Department of Education and Science for their tremendous assistance and consistency in helping with all the work which is done not only on this Bill, but on every aspect of education. Today, I thank them specifically for piloting this Bill.</P>
    <P>As the Leader will know, one cannot always state it, but this was a thoroughly enjoyable debate because we all felt it was pushing through legislation which would be of immediate help to many young people in need of such assistance.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, for coming in to the House to reply to this Adjournment matter on the application for remedial works to Glenma housing estate, Croom, County Limerick, which is one of the oldest housing estates in County Limerick, having been built in the 1960s. The Minister of State encouraged the local authority to apply for grant assistance to carry out remedial works to that estate. Some months ago, eight houses under council ownership in the estate were approved for external and internal remedial works and 23 of the households in private ownership applied for assistance for external works which was also approved. Reports have been sent by Limerick County Council to the Department setting out the remedial works required to meet the needs of residents and which must comply with current building regulations. I urge the Minister of State to look sympathetically on this request to enable the estate to be put into first class condition, a matter which would be deeply appreciated by the residents.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Glenma housing estate is an estate of 43 houses built by the NBA in 1973. Thirty-five houses are privately owned, having been sold to private purchasers when the estate was originally built, and Limerick County Council owns and rents the remaining eight houses.</P>
    <P>The houses were constructed with flat roofs. The first floors are finished with a metal cladding <Col N="1164"/>fixed to a timber stud wall which forms the internal frame of the houses. There are various defects with the houses. These include leaking roofs and poor quality external cladding which, in general, is no longer waterproof.</P>
    <P>Limerick County Council submitted a proposal to the Department to refurbish the estate under the improvement works in lieu of housing scheme and the remedial works scheme. The proposed works include the provision of new pitched roofs to replace existing flat roofs, the recladding of external walls and the upgrading of windows, external doors and external finishes, rewiring, installation of central heating and some site development works. The improvement works programme allows local authorities to improve or extend privately owned accommodation in lieu of having to rehouse the occupiers involved. This scheme would not be used normally to upgrade an entire estate but this is considered to be an exceptional case and my Department agreed in principle on 14 May 2002 to have the improvement works carried out under this scheme. Under the agreed arrangements, the householders will be required to make repayments for the cost of the works to the local authority based on ability to pay.</P>
    <P>I understand that extensive discussions have been held between Limerick County Council and the local residents and that 23 of the households in private ownership are fully supportive of the council&rsquo;s plans for refurbishment in the manner outlined. I also understand that at this time the remaining nine residents are not interested in having refurbishment work carried out on their homes. The plans as they now stand are for works to 23 private residences and eight local authority owned residences. The remaining 12 houses are situated in one block and all are privately owned. I understand that three of these houses are unoccupied and that the council would consider purchasing the units should the remaining nine householders agree to participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Department issued approval in principle to the council in February 2004 to progress the refurbishment works to the council owned houses under the remedial works scheme. The latest cost details are currently being examined in the Department. With regard to the privately owned dwellings, the Department also issued approval at that time to the external works proposed and the latest cost details are currently being examined together with a further submission on the proposed internal works to these houses. A decision on these matters will be conveyed to the local authority by my Department as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I listened to what the Senator had to say. I may have more time next week in the Department and I will see if I can speak with the relevant officials with a view to speeding up the examination of those estimates, with a view to getting approval out to the Senator as soon as possible.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>

   <Title>Quality Bus Corridors.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Transport for coming in the House to reply to his Adjournment matter. With the advent of the Luas light rail it is clear that people can be attracted to public transport when it is properly provided. For many years we have had a bus network which has had to fight tooth and nail for every foot of QBC. That is due to the arduous nature and procedure which has to be gone though by way of public consultation, design and on to county councils.</P>
    <P>Given the huge investment through the national development plan, under the Minister&rsquo;s stewardship, I would like if the provision of QBCs could be treated with the same urgency as the light rail order gave to the Luas. The Luas will be successful because it has priority over a designated lane and is not competing for road space. Unfortunately, the buses on the current QBCs have to compete for limited road space. Hard decisions will have to be taken by us as politicians, and especially by county councillors, given that greater priority must be accorded to the provision of QBCs to eliminate the bottlenecks on current QBCs.</P>
    <P>While engaging in a further roll-out of QBCs in Dublin we have to become even more ambitious because with the provision of Luas it is clear when public transport is properly provided people have no problem in using it. I was given figures today which indicate that 20,000 passengers used the Luas last Monday. It is well on target to meet the 7 million passengers on the Sandyford line by the end of the year. That should give us the green light to do all we can for the Dublin bus network, for which we have provided a huge amount of funding to develop a good bus fleet. We have to look at the infrastructure deficits on the QBCs and move to a situation where people will have no problem in getting on the buses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is correct in that the Luas has exceeded my expectations for its first few days of operation. The promotion of public transport is central to easing congestion in the greater Dublin area. A key element of this strategy is the delivery of quality bus corridors. As a result of work by the Dublin Transportation Office and the greater Dublin area local authorities, there are nine quality bus corridors currently in operation &mdash; Malahide, Lucan, Stillorgan, Finglas, North Clondalkin, Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Swords and Blanchardstown. The quality bus corridors have proved very successful. Evidence of this success is provided by the QBC monitoring exercise of November 2003 which showed that average bus journey times have been up to 72% faster than those for cars during the morning peak time. <Col N="1166"/>Since the first QBC monitoring exercise undertaken in 1997, the number of cars crossing the canal cordon on QBCs has fallen by 25%, the supply of buses provided by Dublin Bus on QBCs has increased by 35%, and the number of bus passengers on QBC routes has increased by<?oasys [jy?>60%. As a consequence, quality bus corridors have changed commuting patterns, and the longer established QBCs &mdash; Malahide, Lucan and Stillorgan &mdash; are carrying twice as many people as a general lane of traffic. This is an indication of how successful they can be.</P>
    <P>As the Senator is aware, the specific impact of QBCs depends on the individual corridors and their locations, but good examples of the benefits arising in general include improved access to centres of population, employment and shopping, regularised loading and parking facilities, traffic signals upgraded to urban traffic control systems, improved regional accessibility and the promotion of sustainable and environmental modes of travel. Associated benefits to highlight include operational and financial efficiencies for bus operators, an improved pedestrian environment, improved travel times, reduced accident rates and linkage and integration with other public transport modes. A further roll-out of quality bus corridors has been prioritised by my Department and in excess of &euro;27 million has been allocated through the Department&rsquo;s traffic management grants to quality bus corridor development in 2004. This represents an increase on last year&rsquo;s investment of &euro;16 million.</P>
    <P>The ongoing development of quality bus corridors as part of a quality bus network is the responsibility of the quality bus network project office established early in 2003 by Dublin City Council. Funding for quality bus corridors remains a priority in the distribution of traffic management grants and substantial progress is being made in the development of several schemes. It must be recognised, however, that the necessary process of consultation can take time. For example, round table meetings must be organised to agree preliminary designs for schemes to go to public consultation stage in each local authority. Standard design details and specifications must be prepared and discussed with the quality bus network project office. Procedures for the planning, design, public consultation, procurement, construction and the financial arrangements for all projects must be agreed with the various agencies.</P>
    <P>The current quality bus network programme has been developed in conjunction with local authorities, the Dublin Transport Office, the Garda and Dublin Bus. It is important to recognise that the designs for the bus priority measures in all schemes must take account of the needs of all road users. There have been significant safety benefits on routes from the provision of enhanced cycle, pedestrian and mobility impaired facilities as part of the overall route designs which also provide for accident remedial measures at existing black spot locations. However, it is not poss<Col N="1167"/>ible to provide facilities for all road users at all locations due to existing pinch points.</P>
    <P>Works have commenced on several schemes, mainly in the Dublin city area. A total of 11 bus priority schemes went on public display throughout the Dublin region in March and April. These schemes are now at the detailed design stage. In general, there was a very positive response from the public to the schemes. The 11 schemes are Blackrock quality bus corridor; the Dundrum-Blackrock orbital quality bus corridor; the Pearse Street-Ringsend Road environmental improvement scheme; Howth Road quality bus corridor; the Howth-Ballymun orbital at Santry Avenue; the Howth-Ballymun orbital at Coolock Lane; Blanchardstown Road north and south quality bus corridor; Snugborough Road quality bus corridor; Newcastle Road; Naas Road quality bus corridor; and Dunshaughlin quality bus corridor.</P>
    <P>While all Dublin City Council schemes were successful in securing agreement in the consultation process, South Dublin County Council&rsquo;s Newcastle Road scheme has been deferred for further information and the Naas Road scheme has yet to be approved by the Tallaght area committee. D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County <Col N="1168"/>Council received objections to the Mount Merrion Avenue section of the orbital scheme and the Blackrock Village section of the Blackrock quality bus corridor. While these sections have been deferred for further study and consultation, the remainder of the schemes have been approved. The Dunshaughlin scheme has been delayed due to objections received during the planning consultation process.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the introduction of quality bus corridors has proved very successful. The programme to develop quality bus corridors even further will encourage more people to switch from cars to public transport. I thank Senator Morrisey for tabling this matter and providing me with the opportunity to provide the information outlined to the House.</P>
