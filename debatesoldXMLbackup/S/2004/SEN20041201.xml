    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>A serious matter came before the Special Criminal Court yesterday. It concerns the conviction and sentencing of two named individuals, both of whom are activists within the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, which is a registered political party in the State. When I raised this matter in the House on 6 October I asked the Government to ensure that the 20 or 30 Members of this assembly and the other assembly be informed of the fact that they were being spied upon during 2002. Has the Government taken action on that matter?</P>
      <P>If this matter had related to a member of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Labour Party, not only would there be a national outcry but there would be demands for a tribunal of investigation to be established as soon as possible. Here we have a political party under the guise of a paramilitary organisation which seems to think it can get away with this behaviour without any comment from its leadership or action by the members concerned. This is a very serious matter. Some people may not want me to raise it because they feel it should be swept under the carpet in view of the sensitivities of the Northern peace process. I say this because it must be said and because this is a democracy. The Irish people have elected Members to this assembly and the other Assembly and those Members have a right to go about their business without being interfered with by this neo-fascist group. I ask the Government to ensure that those named individuals who have been spied upon, interfered with and had their privacy put to one side be informed of that fact as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the points raised by Senator Brian Hayes. The issue of interference with Members of the Oireachtas when going about their business is covered clearly in the Constitution. I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s clear and unambiguous statement by the Taoiseach that the convictions of yesterday could not be covered by the Good Friday Agreement and that these people will serve their full sentences. The issues raised by Senator Brian Hayes need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The Leader may have misunderstood a point I made yesterday when I raised No. 25 on the Order Paper, relating to the committee which is considering the Judge Curtin matter. The House has a clear rule that we do not discuss this matter in the House and everyone has accepted that rule. However, I asked that the Seanad receive formal reports on the ongoing business of that committee, which was set up at our behest. It would not be appropriate for me to discuss the matter with the members or Chairman of the committee because that would be to compromise the work of the committee, and of the House if the matter ever comes back to us.</P><Col N="1583"/>
      <P>I wish to say one more sentence on this issue. I promise you, a Chathaoirligh, that if what I say is out of line I will take it back. It is inappropriate for us to get running reports on what is happening at that committee via the national media. There has been another move forward today but why are we not being told about these matters in a formal manner? All I am saying is that it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s point but the terms of reference of the committee state that &ldquo;following the completion of its proceedings the Select Committee shall furnish a report of these proceedings to the Seanad, together with appropriate transcripts and associated audio-visual material, if any, as the committee sees fit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely. I am not in any sense departing from that. You will be aware, a Chathaoirligh, that I am referring to something that is an item on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a crucial matter and the House is entitled to at least get reports of what is going on. We should not be left wondering. I will leave it at that and will not mention it again but I feel there is an issue here concerning how we do our business.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the issue of the report yesterday from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about building houses. Some 48,000 local authority houses were scheduled to be built over the past ten years but in the event only 37,000 were constructed. Therefore, 10,000 more houses could have been built. I do not know about the rights and wrongs of this matter but I am appalled because we have raised the shortage of housing repeatedly in the House. Where is the problem here? This is another issue relating to what we discussed concerning Seanad reform. We could have close relations with groups, such as local authority representatives.</P>
      <P>This is the second time I have made this suggestion to the Leader. I would like us to discuss housing with local authority representatives &mdash; the people who elect most of the Members here &mdash; to find the answer. Is there a problem with the process, the money or the way in which decisions are implemented?</P>
      <P>For whatever reason, some 10,000 houses remain unbuilt which have been approved &mdash; money was allocated to build them, people are queuing up to live in them and they should be built. That cannot be right, so I would like the situation explained to us. Let us see where the problem lies so that we can deal with it. The Leader should invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who I am sure would be delighted to discuss it with us, to the House. I also wish to take the matter a step further by having a consultation process with <Col N="1584"/>local authority members who know the situation inside out. I do not pretend to know about it so let us have a discussion with them. We should grant them that level of recognition which, during our discussions with them over the past few years, we said we would. I look forward to the Leader&rsquo;s reply on those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole has given a good illustration of the failure of local democracy in this country because essentially city and county managers can do what they like and members of local authorities rarely find out until afterwards. A fundamental restoration of real local democracy is required whereby people can discover what is going on and be responsible for policy, instead of getting blamed for other people&rsquo;s decisions which is the usual fate of local authority members.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy with the idea that a matter such as that covered by No. 1 on the Order Paper should pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas without debate. This involves depriving people of their liberty. We may debate whether it is necessary but these provisions are for the extended detention of people suspected of drug trafficking. We may or may not need those powers but I find it extraordinary that such a decision, to extend those powers for another year, would pass through the Oireachtas without a debate. I will not call a vote on the matter but I wish to inform the Leader that, as leader of the Labour Party group, I am unhappy that something as fundamental as the deprivation of people&rsquo;s liberty should ever go through without a debate in the Houses, as distinct from a debate in committee. It would be a good idea for a committee to review this matter but the report of the committee ought to be debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>A number of matters appeared in this morning&rsquo;s media which should give us great cause for concern. I cannot recall the figures but it appears to me that if we had the road fatality rates of a country like Sweden, between 200 and 300 Irish people would be alive who are killed here in road accidents every year. A survey was published this morning suggesting that 85% of drivers admit to regularly and deliberately breaking speed limits. Over 20% admit to driving when they had taken alcohol and I presume that to mean that they were aware of being in breach of the rules. The evidence shows that it is young men in particular who break the rules. We have the astonishing situation that young men are more successful in the driving test than young women. Those figures were produced by the Department of Transport. Therefore, we appear to have an extraordinarily inconsistent set of policies on driving, drivers and enforcing the rules. Incidentally, the people who broke the rules all thought they were great drivers. Less than 1% of them admitted to being bad drivers, while the remainder considered that they were good, very good or excellent.</P>
      <P>We have a horrendous accident rate. Peculiar things are occurring in driving tests whereby the <Col N="1585"/>gender deemed to be better at passing the driving test is more at risk on the road. We desperately need to examine seriously the proper enforcement of our driving regulations. Where we enforce the rules, as for example with the smoking ban, and when people believe the rules will be enforced, we have a 97% rate of compliance. We must assume, therefore, that the reason people ignore the rules on drinking and speeding are because they have a reasonable expectation that the rules will not be enforced.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with Senator Brian Hayes. There is something sinister about senior officials of a political party using paramilitary activities to find out information about the private lives of Members of the Oireachtas. That is not part of healthy, normal politics and nobody should excuse it or fudge over it, whatever the delicacy of the matter. It is a sinister development which can lead us only in one direction that will undermine democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator Brian Hayes and Senator Ryan as regards the sentencing in the Special Criminal Court yesterday. There is a complacency in tolerating the unconstitutional behaviour and activities of certain members of Sinn F&eacute;in. It is not acceptable that we should allow double standards. No party has any right to claim to be fully democratic if it engages in such activities. For a party to accept an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> version of democracy is intolerable. It would be irresponsible of this House, its Members and anybody else who supports democratic principles to allow this to go unchallenged. I ask the Leader to establish two points from the Government, if she can &mdash; first, to identify all Members of the Oireachtas who were on this list and, second, to confirm whether these Members have been told they were, or are being, spied upon.</P>
      <P>The Leader should send a letter to the leadership of Sinn F&eacute;in pointing out that this is unacceptable and ask for an unequivocal statement condemning these activities. If we truly believe in democracy and want Sinn Fein to come into the democratic system, it must come in fully. I call on all Members of the House to support the sentiments that have been expressed here this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to be helpful to Senator O&rsquo;Toole, as a member of the committee, I can say that we have always refrained from commenting on this matter even though we have listened to contributions regarding it in the Chamber. As regards the terms of reference set down for the committee, there is no provision for interim reports to this House or the Lower House. The only provision is that at the end of it, we will&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I just wanted to clarify that matter.</P><Col N="1586"/>
      <P>As a public representative for the mid-west region, I welcome the news from Ryanair and its chief executive and the management at Shannon Airport with regard to an expansion of routes from the Shannon area. It will be for the overall benefit of the mid-west region. I hope that Ryanair will expand further. I compliment the new management structure on its initiative in rapidly attracting new business. It is extremely important for the future of Shannon.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to the statistics produced in a survey on driving and the fact that drivers confirmed they had taken alcohol before driving. We should also note another recent survey which shows that serious fatalities on the roads are happening between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. and in many cases involve younger drivers. In 80% of cases alcohol was involved. The Garda needs to pay attention to this area to try to curb such activity. In many cases people feel as no garda&iacute; will be present on the roads between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. they can delay returning home on the basis that they will avoid Garda cars with the result that they may be taking unnecessary chances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the very successful debate last night on decentralisation, I ask the Leader if we could have a further debate as quickly as possible to further assess the benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator assessing his own contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It would also give me an opportunity to get further information on the sale of sites by Deputy John Bruton when he was Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is going too far in naming people who are not in the House to defend themselves. I have warned the Senator several times before and he should refrain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of clarification&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfair to use the privilege of this House to name people outside the House, who are not in a position to defend themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame. No name, shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of clarification, surely we are entitled to question the actions of a former Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is losing his grandeur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a problem with Deputy John Bruton and not with me.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1587"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask the Senator to leave the House if he does not obey the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Second Stage of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill be completed today or will it also be taken on another day? I join colleagues in expressing concern about the housing issue. I understand the Government made money available, which was not taken up by local authorities, except in Limerick where building completions reached 104% of the quota. The authority there should be congratulated on its achievement. On top of that we received a document from the Department of Finance regarding additional moneys required. A sum of &euro;14 million is required for asylum seekers&rsquo; housing, etc. I am concerned as I do not believe these premises are inspected for fire, safety and health, as they should be. The Minister should be required to ensure this is done.</P>
      <P>As the Leader and you, a Chathaoirligh, have been so helpful, I would like to ask the Leader if she would again raise the question of the Gulfstream jet in the light of the &ldquo;Kalla Fakta&rdquo; television programme broadcast by a Swedish television station on 22 November, which demonstrated that since October 2001, the aeroplane completed 72 operations in over 30 countries. The aeroplane&rsquo;s routes always take the same pattern. After take-off from its home base in Smithfield, North Carolina, it makes a short stop at Dulles Airport in Washington, close to the CIA headquarters. After crossing the Atlantic it makes stops in places&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been very generous in allowing the Senator to raise this matter every morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>While that is true, if I could just complete this paragraph, it would assist the Leader in raising this question with the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Put him out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Shannon is listed first then Frankfurt and Prague. Thereafter, it flies exclusively to countries with which the United States is allied in its so-called war against terror, Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Jordan, Uzbekistan and Pakistan. These are countries where prisoners are kept and interrogated, far beyond the reach of American or international law</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>These patterns are consistent and are repeated. This is all this aeroplane does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What I have said comes from a direct translation of a summary of a Swedish tele<Col N="1588"/>vision programme broadcast last week. I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for a debate on housing. The report reads very badly given that money has been allocated to local authorities. It is extraordinary that some local authorities have reached their targets while others have not. Questions need to be asked as to why this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>In his opening remarks in today&rsquo;s Budget Statement, will the Minister for Finance apologise to the Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Oireachtas Members&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A question on the Order of Business, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and also issue a statement on the Government&rsquo;s U-turn on the decentralisation issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Budget Statement is not a matter for the Order of Business. Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter should be a priority as many areas have been let down. On another issue, I ask the Leader to organise a debate on our competitiveness. As we know, Ireland is the third most expensive country in the EU and Dublin is the fourth most expensive capital after Paris, London and Copenhagen. We are pricing ourselves out of the tourism market as evidenced by a 7% drop in tourists visiting the country in the past three months. The price of goods and services are completely out of control as shown on the Fine Gael website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Or on Senator Leyden&rsquo;s website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We receive a constant stream of complaints. The Government needs to address the issue with urgency or we will shortly find ourselves in serious difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in asking for a debate on housing. The rate of construction of housing is very uneven across the country. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has received a number of applications from local authorities for affordable housing, which should be fast-tracked, particularly given that land is now becoming available from health boards and because of road development. Those applications should be addressed quickly by the Department to allow us to have the housing for which we have already made provision. An early debate on the matter would be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board issued its final report yesterday. Some of <Col N="1589"/>the functions of that authority will be transferred to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. It would be timely and appropriate for us to debate the whole industry, particularly the findings of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and where we go from here. Ms Dorothea Dowling gave a very good interview on RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo; radio programme yesterday evening in which she expressed some reservations about the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the matter raised by Senator Brian Hayes and indeed to the fact that it was raised at all. I do not believe Members are in the least endangering the peace process or negotiations in Northern Ireland, as these are the very matters that need to be clarified by other parties in Northern Ireland. We have moved on from the guns, which have been largely silent for a while, to all these other activities. What is now required is the decommissioning of mindsets as well as other things. While the fact that it has happened might cause a flurry for a moment or two, raising the matter in the House can do nothing but good to the ongoing discussions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I remind the House and the Leader that today is the United Nations World Day of AIDS. I ask the Leader to have the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid come to the House in the new year to debate Irish aid to address this problem. It would be churlish not to recognise the American contribution to the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as outlined by the American ambassador in today&rsquo;s newspapers. I hope any Irish aid would not be trammelled and restricted in the same way as America&rsquo;s by the refusal to help bodies advocating the use of condoms as a preventive measure.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to organise a debate with the Minister for Education and Science in the new year on the OECD report on higher education, which would be very appropriate to this body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Maurice Hayes has said regarding United Nations World Day of AIDS. It is worrying and distressing to see the increasing number of deaths in the world due to AIDS and the many children orphaned as a result. This causes great distress and heartache to many families. We must also recognise the increasing number of AIDS victims in this State, which has increased by 10% since 2002. A debate on AIDS both globally and in Ireland is timely. The sexual activity of young Irish people is causing the spread of many sexually-transmitted diseases and we must face this issue. Will the Leader organise such a debate in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Concern has been expressed over the emergence of off-licences following changes in the habits of people consuming alcohol. The concern relates to a deficiency in the planning laws which allows someone to change the use of <Col N="1590"/>a premises without the approval of the planning authority. Local councillors would like an input into the change of use of a premises from another commercial activity to an off-licence. We are talking about deaths on the roads a result of drink driving but it is becoming easier for people to buy alcohol in an unregulated environment. Will the Leader consider what might be required and contact the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with a view to introducing legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are five minutes remaining on the Order of Business and six Senators are offering but I can accept no other contributions. With co-operation I hope to accommodate the six Senators before we conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two pieces of bad news related to the Government&rsquo;s tendency to put things on the long finger. It was announced at the weekend that speed cameras which were to come into operation have now been deferred until 2006. We have talked this morning about death on the roads. Can the Leader confirm that the Road Traffic Bill next week will give us the opportunity to discuss traffic accidents and speed cameras that will help reduce the number of deaths?</P>
      <P>The other bad news was the information in the Forf&aacute;s report that we have only achieved 2% broadband penetration, one of the lowest rates anticipated in Europe. We set out to make ourselves the Internet hub of Europe ten years ago and the Government confirmed that challenge five years ago. If we have only achieved 2% penetration, it is evidence that we are also putting this matter on the long finger. I urge the Leader to encourage the Government to move on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support those speakers who have asked for a debate on housing. Some local authorities have fulfilled their obligations, with Waterford achieving 104%. County Sligo is also well up there. Local authorities can buy houses but the price ceiling is set at a very low level, although it is acceptable in County Sligo, where a three-bedroom semi-detached house can be bought for &euro;155,000. I am aware, however, of students who live away from home in major cities who put their names on the housing list to get rent allowance. I would like a full debate where housing need could be assessed. There are thousands of people on housing lists who do not need a house at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>No. 5 on the Order Paper is not being taken, understandably. Will the Leader comment on the statements on page five of this morning&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>?</P>

	<P>I support the call for a debate on housing. I welcome the provision of 39,000 houses in the past ten years but recognise the shortfall of 9,000 houses and the problems being faced by local authorities. It is time for the Minister to take the matter on board. We saw how &euro;353 million was paid out in rent supplement in the past year. An assessment of needs is being carried out by local authorities and people are asking what the future holds. Will local authorities stop building houses?</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the loss of 9,000 houses when local authorities are renting houses from builders over a ten-year period. That money could be better spent buying the houses.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the good news for Shannon Airport. It is the first break the new airport authority has got and is welcome. If it brings another 1.5 million tourists into the mid-west in the next year, the board should be congratulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, the meeting is during Seanad sitting hours so we cannot partake. As a result of the smoking ban and the increase in drinking in the home, a social and health challenge regarding smoking in the home has arisen. Those who originally went to the pub for a drink and a smoke are now smoking at home in front of their children. They are not out doing press ups and sit ups, they did not change their habits <Col N="1592"/>and now they smoke at home. Children do not have a choice and must put up with it. That is one of the challenges the vintners will put to us and when we meet them, I would like all Members of this House and the Leader to have an open ear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to explain the crisis in accident and emergency departments, where, according to the nurses&rsquo; union, 175 patients were on trolleys yesterday? In Tallaght Hospital, 59 patients were on trolleys, the hospital ran out of extra trolleys and an accident victim had to wait in an ambulance. This is unacceptable and the Minister for Health and Children should be invited to the House to explain what will be done about the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, raised yesterday&rsquo;s court finding about the two Sinn F&eacute;in activists. I can only repeat what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il yesterday. This is a serious business in a democracy and I am conscious of what Senator Maurice Hayes said which lent some texture to the matter. I regard it as extremely serious. As the Cathaoirleach knows the matter was discussed yesterday in committee. I thank the Senator for raising it and, indeed, he also debated the matter well on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today. Senator O&rsquo;Toole asserted that those involved should not be covered by the Good Friday Agreement. The Taoiseach mentioned that yesterday in the D&aacute;il when he said whatever sentences they receive would not be covered by the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the Curtin inquiry provide that it will make one report to this House. That will be done and there will not be an interim report.</P>

	<P>I just want to know what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the matter of social housing and the local authorities. It would be easy for us to damn all county managers or housing authorities. What has happened appears to be very patchy. Some counties have fulfilled the duties imposed upon them and some have not. It is a matter of getting the land, making <Col N="1593"/>the appropriate planning arrangements etc. However, it is a serious matter, with so many people on the housing list and houses laid out but not built. A gap exists and money is being provided, so I would agree there is a need for action in this regard. The Senator asked whether the House could set up a standing committee to meet the local authorities and find out what they are doing about housing. That is a matter which the leaders of the various groups in the House might talk about after the Order of Business. It would be a useful exercise.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan wanted to debate No. 1 on the Order Paper. I am always slightly at odds when I read out that there will not be a debate on a particular matter. I am conscious that four Members of this House serve on the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights &mdash; Senators Jim Walsh, Kitt, Terry and Tuffy. Clearly, that committee has debated the matter.</P>
      <P>On another occasion I said I was open to a suggestion that we debate particular matters. Clearly we cannot do it now, but perhaps if there is a concerted demand for it, the House will take it on another occasion. I take the Senator&rsquo;s point. He spoke about Sweden and the diminished road fatality statistics there. Drivers here regularly drive and speed after drinking and, despite the enforcement of the driving regulations, do not foresee that they will be stopped. Most people have such a dread of being stopped by the Garda they are afraid to venture behind the wheel if they have consumed any alcohol.</P>
      <P>The Senator saw what happened as regards the Sinn F&eacute;in activists as a sinister development, which indeed it is. Senator Minihan said there cannot be an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> approach to democracy and that it was unacceptable. He has asked if I should write to the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership, conveying the views of this House. I have no difficulty with that and will do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane also raised the matter of the Curtin report. He welcomed the good news about Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>In fact it was an excellent debate last night and it went on until ten minutes to eight, with great input from all parties and every side of the House. Senator Norris raised the matter of houses for asylum seekers. I have every confidence that they are subjected to housing and fire inspections and all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be doubtful of that, but I can inquire. I cannot see how the inspection of houses can be ruled out because they are to be inhabited by asylum seekers. The Senator also requested that I should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs about further revelations as regards trips by the particular aircraft he referred to yesterday. This is being dealt with. I am putting arrangements in place as regards what the Senator and I discussed.</P>
      <P>On housing, Senator Ormonde made the point that some local authorities are fulfilling their obligations in this area and some are not. Therefore, to damn all local authorities outright is incorrect. I did not know what Senator Bannon said the first time; I regret I could not hear him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ruled that matter out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon asked for a debate on competitiveness and said there was a decrease in the number of tourists coming to Ireland. Senator Kitt asked for a debate on housing and Senator McCarthy raised the matter of insurance, particularly as there appear to be developments in that whole area. It is still somewhat early, but we will make inquiries. Senator Maurice Hayes asked for the question of overseas development aid to be addressed in the House. I had anticipated such a debate after Christmas. I had also pencilled in the OECD&rsquo;s excellent report on education for debate, to be attended by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. As I said earlier, Senator Maurice Hayes gave texture to what Senator Brian Hayes said about the current Sinn F&eacute;in activity. It brought balance to the debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>I had intended to mention world AIDS day, as raised by Senator Terry. All over the world today people should reserve some time to reflect on this. The AIDS-HIV statistics in Ireland are up by 10%, which is an enormous increase.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooley spoke about planning and filling stations. I find it amusing that Statoil and Esso have proudly announced they have 24 petrol stations where wine may be bought. One may buy oil and wine together. If one is driving, however&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dooley asked whether there should be legislation as regards a change of usage. I always thought that if one changed what one was doing, change of usage planning had to be applied for. Senator Quinn raised the matter of the speed cameras and the Road Traffic Bill 2004. He asked me to confirm whether the House may discuss those matters next week. I can only give what I regard as general wisdom on the matter. One may range far and wide on Second Stage of a Bill, but that is up to the Cathaoirleach or whoever is in the Chair.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, if it is in connection with traffic and a road traffic Bill, there is plenty of scope for debate.</P>
      <P>On the matter of 2% penetration of broadband, I agree that is serious. Senator Scanlon raised the housing debate also and said that the trend was generally patchy, one county being good and another bad. He said there are underlying reasons for that. Senator Coghlan should read page 5 for himself. I have read it and know what it is about. He is acting as a type of tempter to me, but I will not go down that road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House again on the subject of Irish citizenship laws. Senators will recall that my last major excursion into this august Chamber on this topic was in connection with the Bill for the referendum proposal which is the direct antecedent of the measure now before us. Previous to that, in autumn of last year, I was here to address Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s Bill on investment-based naturalisation. At that time, in welcoming and supporting the principle of that Bill, I promised the Senator and this House that I would avail of the next legislative opportunity to bring forward Government legislation to deal with the issue, and I am pleased to say that the Bill before us also delivers on that promise.</P><Col N="1598"/>
      <P>Before I get down to the detail of the Bill, I take the opportunity to put it in context of the Government&rsquo;s overall policies regarding, not just to the acquisition of Irish citizenship, but the totality of the relationship between Irish society and the non-nationals who increasingly form a welcome part of that society. We are becoming day by day a much more cosmopolitan society, having within the past decade turned the economic corner from being a country of net outward migration to one of net inward migration.</P>
      <P>People who are not Irish have long been coming to Ireland to make their new lives here, to establish themselves, and usually in the fullness of time to become Irish citizens themselves. For many years the numbers were outweighed by Irish people who were obliged, often by economic necessity, to go abroad and make their own lives and futures elsewhere. That is all changed. Now this prosperous island is an attractive place for our own to stay and for more and more non-nationals to make their way to, with plans to share in and contribute to our prosperity and to our cultural diversity.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s immigration policy has enabled many thousands of people from outside the European Union to come and start new lives for themselves in this thriving economy, and to bring to Irish society new and often refreshingly vibrant influences, such that just as Irish culture rubs off on them, some of their cultures rub off on us. All we ask of such people is that they observe the immigration requirements for coming here and for remaining in the State and, as they settle in our workforce and establish new roots for themselves, they can be reasonably confident that, when the time comes, and if they wish it, we will welcome them not simply into Irish society as guests but as full members of the Irish nation by granting them citizenship.</P>
      <P>Our immigration policies have so far served us reasonably well but I am on record as agreeing that there is plenty of scope for improvement. While there has been some modernisation in recent years of the legislative basis underpinning the implementation of Irish immigration policies, there is general consensus that we need to carry out a complete overhaul of immigration law and to take advantage of that process to include provisions that will facilitate the development and implementation of changes to immigration policy and practice so that Governments can keep adapting to changing circumstances and responding with appropriate refinements.</P>
      <P>That is why I have in the course of development in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a comprehensive immigration and residence Bill that will put the necessary legislative framework in place to achieve this aim. As part of that development, I expect within the next few weeks to publish a discussion document that I am sure will stimulate and inform public debate on the comprehensive legislative measure.</P>
      <P>All too often, discourse in various public fora and in the media can be characterised by misun<Col N="1599"/>derstanding of the principles involved, lack of awareness of the factual position, or the sometimes quite understandable over-emotionalising of debate. I hope the proposed discussion document will help to advance the issues in a calm and rational way without these pitfalls, just as I can, in keeping with the usual norms of this House, be confident of a high standard of calm and rational debate on the matter now before us.</P>
      <P>There is one misunderstanding that I would like to take this opportunity of nailing, namely, the oft-heard but completely erroneous assertion that we have no immigration policy. We have in place active policies regarding migration for entry into the employment market. These are designed to meet the needs of the marketplace where they cannot be met by locally recruited staff, while at the same time protecting the availability of job opportunities for Irish and EEA nationals who have access as of right to the employment market here, as elsewhere within the European Economic Area.</P>
      <P>It is worth stressing that there is a right invested in migrant workers, particularly from the new candidate states but from every member state of the European Union, to come to Ireland and avail of the job opportunities here. In order to vindicate that right we have to have a migration policy which gives them preference, otherwise their right would mean nothing. For high-skill occupations where there are particular shortfalls in local availability of suitably qualified personnel, our policies have in place special work visa and work authorisation facilities to ease the difficulties for employers and potential non-national employees alike.</P>
      <P>These policies are working. We have seen the numbers of employment permits mount year by year during the past five years or so. That there is a falling off this year is, I think, attributable to the fact that many of the countries whose nationals had been availing of the employment permit as the conduit to the Irish employment market are now full members of the European Union. As a result, their nationals no longer need employment permits and may live and work here as of right.</P>
      <P>I do not claim that these policies are perfect, far from it. I acknowledge that there is much validity in some of the criticisms levelled from time to time. There is room for improving the policies and the manner in which they are delivered. I am taking steps to address those criticisms.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the charge that there is no policy at all. In that context another myth that should be addressed is one that was recently propagated by a series of unfortunate circumstances. The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism held a press conference recently. It published a report which stated that instances of people facing discrimination increased since it established a monitoring telephone line to which people could phone in their complaints and record their experience. A <Col N="1600"/>newspaper headline followed &mdash; it was not the fault of the journalist&rsquo;s story &mdash; stating that racist attacks had grown dramatically. The survey said nothing about racist attacks, it merely said that people faced discrimination and were making increased use of a reporting and monitoring mechanism. More recently, responsible people whom I admire have built on that myth by saying that since the referendum there has been an increase in racist attacks in Ireland, which is wholly and completely untrue. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established for a number of years a mechanism to monitor all attacks in order to determine whether a racist element is involved. Curiously since the referendum, far from there being an increase in the number of racist attacks, there has been a steady pattern of decline in racist incidents of violence in the past three years. While some people posture as being concerned about the issue and simply assert that there has been an increase in racist attacks since the referendum, the opposite is the truth. There has been a decline in this pattern of behaviour. This does not mean that the referendum caused the decline. It equally means, however, that it is nonsense to claim that the passage of a referendum in regard to citizenship has made Ireland a more dangerous place for people from ethnic minorities. This type of self-serving wishful thinking has got out there and I feel like someone chasing balloons. I will have to chase around until it comes down to earth again because this notion has escaped from the intellectual Pandora&rsquo;s box in the circumstances I described.</P>
      <P>In the immigration context, it is important to advert to asylum and our international obligations to offer Ireland&rsquo;s protection to those who are in need of it. Some commentators insist that asylum is not an immigration matter but a question of human rights. Others address immigration issues solely in terms of asylum and fail to recognise that most of the non-nationals we encounter in our daily lives in Ireland are people who have come here through normal, regular immigration processes. Of course, asylum is a question of human rights, but it also has a significant immigration dimension because of the frequency with which the State&rsquo;s systems for dealing with the human rights of asylum seekers are used and abused, not just here but throughout the developed world, as a means to circumvent normal immigration controls by those who have neither a likelihood of being admitted by those controls nor any basis for a claim to protection.</P>
      <P>Ireland has an active asylum policy. We offer protection to those who have a well-founded fear of persecution and need our protection. We aim to identify those with a genuine protection need as soon as possible after they arrive in the State with such claims. For those who make claims for protection, which turn out after independent examination to be ill-founded, we aim to remove them as soon as possible from the State. There are many who welcome the fact that we have an asylum policy, but then accuse me or the Govern<Col N="1601"/>ment of racism if I follow its logic and deport those who are not entitled to avail of it. Let me remind Senators that without deportation as a resource of last resort, there is no asylum policy. If we do not remove those who have claimed protection but do not need it, then we may as well say to the world, &ldquo;Come in, we will not throw you out, even if you should not be here&rdquo;. No Minister of any developed society could operate on that basis, and no Minister relishes the responsibility for removing people from the State. As I said on another occasion, it is never pleasant because we all know that we are dealing with real people, with real human problems and real hopes and concerns. However, the Government cannot shirk its responsibilities to Ireland, legal migrants and the international legal institution that is asylum.</P>
      <P>The sad fact is that approximately 90% of those whose asylum claims are examined under our system of independent investigation and independent appeal turn out to be without foundation. Ireland has been seen as a good mark for people with no prospect of gaining access under normal immigration criteria, because it is a thriving economy within the European Union. Another considerable factor in the remarkable rate of asylum seeking until recently, which was the second highest <i>per capita</i> in Europe, was the fact that if one had a child born in Ireland, the child became entitled to Irish citizenship and the parents could thus make a subsidiary claim to be allowed to stay, even though they might have no other basis for being in the State. It is the second phenomenon which gives rise to the Bill today.</P>
      <P>Irish nationality legislation traditionally had three major aspects, namely, <i>jus soli,</i> the law of the soil, whereby birth in Ireland imparts Irish nationality to the person so born and <i>jus sanguinis,</i> the law of blood, whereby birth to an Irish parent, wherever that birth took place, imparts Irish nationality, and naturalisation, whereby the Minister for Justice of the day might, as a matter of absolute discretion, exercise the executive power of the State once certain statutory conditions had been met and thereby confer Irish nationality on a non-national. Constitutionally, the position traditionally has been that the Oireachtas had largely unfettered power to legislate for the acquisition of Irish nationality and citizenship, which are spoken of in the same breath in Article 9 of the Constitution and are regarded as identical concepts. The manifestation of the exercise of the parliamentary power in section 2 of that article is the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended in 1986, 1994 and 2001. People sometimes ask why two words, nationality and citizenship, are used where one would suffice. This relates to the historical context in which the Constitution was originally framed. One could be a national of a European country without being a citizen. Many countries did not confer full citizenship on women for instance. The concept of citizenship and nationality was a basket of rights which means one thing now but could have meant two things in those <Col N="1602"/>circumstances. This is why the two words are used in a kind of Siamese twin way to mean one thing.</P>
      <P>One of the effects of the 1986 amending legislation was to put certain limits on the absolute operation of <i>jus sanguinis</i> for successive generations of Irish descendants born abroad. In 1986, we provided that for the third and later generations of children born abroad to Irish citizens themselves born abroad, the child would not inherit Irish citizenship unless, before the child&rsquo;s birth, the parent&rsquo;s birth had been registered in the foreign births register maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The unlimited trickle-down effect of Irish citizenship from parent to child, which existed until 1986, was limited by the expedient, namely that after the second or third generation, for citizenship to go any further, the parent had to do a positive act and register as an Irish citizen prior to the birth of the child in question. The Oireachtas was able to modify absolute <i>jus sanguinis</i> because it had power to do so under the Constitution and considered in 1986 that it needed modification. It was like a chain letter whereby if one simply did nothing, one would allow Irish citizenship to trickle down exponentially.</P>
      <P>As regards <i>jus soli,</i> arising out of the former constitutional territorial claim to Northern Ireland, Irish citizenship law conferred Irish nationality on persons born in Northern Ireland as well as within the State. In 1999, as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the people agreed by referendum to remove the territorial claim from the Constitution, and to replace it with a provision that declared it is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, its islands and its seas, to be part of the Irish nation. This change came about in the context of the British-Irish Agreement, arrived at as part of the complex of agreements that is the Good Friday Agreement, between Ireland and the UK whereby both Governments agreed that it was the entitlement of the people of Northern Ireland to regard themselves and be recognised as British or Irish or both British and Irish as they may so choose.</P>
      <P>The effect of the constitutional change made then as far as Irish citizenship law was concerned was that now it was a constitutional entitlement, not a statutory entitlement, as <i>jus soli</i> and <i>jus sanguinis</i> had been as a status up to that point. It was a constitutional entitlement that everyone born in the island of Ireland was entitled to be an Irish citizen. Any law which Parliament might seek to pass which sought to confine Irish citizenship to certain categories of person born in Ireland would be in conflict with the Constitution. The changes necessary to keep the 1956 Act consistent with the amended Constitution were made in 2001.</P>
      <P>It was evident in the past few years that many non-nationals who had no substantial link to Ireland were arranging their affairs so as to give birth to a child in Ireland and thus avail not only of Irish citizenship law but also, in some cases, of <Col N="1603"/>the 1991 Supreme Court decision in Fajujonu that had apparently given the parents of such an Irish citizen child a strong claim, but not an absolute claim, to remain in the State on that basis alone, even though they might have been unlawfully in the State at the time of the birth. This manifested itself most obviously in the rate of applications for asylum made by persons who, following the birth of the child, withdrew their asylum claims. The Supreme Court decision in the L and O case in early 2003 made it clear that a person&rsquo;s right to remain in the State solely on the basis of parentage of an Irish child was not strong, but the court also made it clear that such a parent could not be removed from the State without first giving careful consideration to the effect of removal on the rights of the child.</P>
      <P>Another way in which advantage has been taken of Irish citizenship law is exemplified by the Chen case, where a non-national mother resident in the UK secured the birth of her child in Belfast, which is part of the island of Ireland, thus giving the child an entitlement to Irish citizenship under our Constitution, and then asserted a claim to be permitted to remain in the UK on the basis of the child&rsquo;s treaty rights as an EU citizen in another member state. The European Court of Justice upheld the mother&rsquo;s claim.</P>
      <P>In order to change the law so as to be able to eliminate this incentive for non-nationals to take advantage of Irish nationality law, the Government asked the people, by way of referendum proposal in June of this year, to restore to the Oireachtas the power to legislate for the acquisition of Irish nationality by birth on the island of Ireland in circumstances where neither parent was Irish or entitled to be an Irish citizen. The proposal was approved by an overwhelming majority of the people.</P>
      <P>Before getting into the detail of the Bill, I would like to turn to an issue which was raised during the passage of the Bill through the D&aacute;il, namely, the status of those parents of Irish-born children already in the State at the time of the L and O judgment, and of those who have arrived in the State and given birth since that judgment. I have repeatedly stated, and I emphasise again in this House, that every outstanding claim to reside in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish-born child will be examined and decided individually in accordance with section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, which prohibits the removal of any person who may be subject to <i>refoulement</i>.</P>
      <P>My Department has taken on extra staff on a temporary basis to process these cases in a unit that was set up for this purpose. In examining these cases, factors mentioned by the Supreme Court, such as family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian considerations, are taken into account. I have also indicated on more than one occasion more recently that I will examine the entire situation in a decent, sensible and prag<Col N="1604"/>matic way once this legislation is enacted. This is not a matter directly involving citizenship law; there is no clamour for the parents of the children in question to be made Irish citizens. On the contrary, it is a question rather of the operation of our immigration laws and specifically of the Immigration Act 1999. It is not something this Bill could or should deal with, though I recognise it is a matter of great interest to Senators in the overall context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Let us look, then, at what exactly this Bill before the House proposes. It is designed to implement the people&rsquo;s decision in last June&rsquo;s referendum and to exercise once again this Parliament&rsquo;s power to set the rules for acquisition of Irish citizenship. It does so by setting out the conditions under which a child born in Ireland, North or South, to parents, neither of whom is Irish, can acquire an entitlement to be an Irish citizen. The principal condition is that at least one of the parents must have been lawfully resident in Ireland for at least three of the four years preceding the birth; periods of temporary lawful stay for the purpose of seeking asylum or for study purposes are not reckonable in calculating that period.</P>
      <P>The three out of four rule is there so that people can legitimately leave the State and come back for purposes which are fairly obvious. These proposals are in line with the draft Bill which the Government published as part of its proposals announcing the referendum and the Government is keeping faith with the electorate which accepted the Constitutional amendment by a substantial majority. I emphasise again those essential elements that the Government stated last April it would seek to put in place and is now doing. Those essential elements again are that Irish citizenship of a child born here to non-national parents would depend on a period of residence that is lawful and for a permanent purpose; that precedes the birth of the child; and that is, in duration, at least three out of the four years preceding the birth.</P>
      <P>Along with that, as I have mentioned already, I have included at section 10 of the Bill a provision to address the discontinuance of the future possibility of schemes for naturalisation based on investments in the State. The technique that the section adopts for achieving this is simplicity itself. The theoretical basis for the former investment-based scheme was a decidedly generous interpretation of the expression &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; as it appears in section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, an interpretation which served as the basis for waiving the normal conditions for naturalisation in cases encompassed by the scheme. It is not an interpretation that I, either as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, or in my former role as Attorney General, was ever happy with on a purely legal basis, and the current Attorney General shares my deep reservations on that score.</P>
      <P>The Bill, in section 10, makes future uses of this broad interpretation impossible by giving the <Col N="1605"/>expression a restrictive definition. The term &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; will in future mean simply a connection by blood, affinity or adoption to a person who is or was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen or who, if alive, would be an Irish citizen. While, as Deputy O Mor&aacute;in said, tongue in cheek, in the debate on the Bill for the 1956 Act, drinking a glass of Irish whiskey in a bar in Cairo might conceivably have come within the admittedly loose parameters of the phrase, undefined, this Bill narrows its scope to the specified links only.</P>
      <P>I am happy that this achieves the goal that Senator Quinn and the Government share, namely, putting beyond future possibility any revival of a passports for investment scheme. In its day, many Members on all sides of both Houses were supportive of particular proposals under the scheme and saw it as an important means of preserving jobs and enterprises that were in jeopardy in darker days. I have made no secret of my personal disquiet with the scheme both in principle and as regards the way in which some individual applications were handled and I will not be sorry to see the back of it.</P>
      <P>I will turn now to the detail of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions regarding the entitlement of persons born in Ireland to be Irish citizens. In considering the detail, Senators will find useful the consolidated version of the 1956 Act circulated to them today, which includes all of the amendments of that Act made to date, together with the changes this Bill would make shown in bold print. This is an updated version reflecting the amendments to the Bill made in the D&aacute;il. I am sure this will be an aid to debate. However, I would ask Members of this House to appreciate that this is an aid to the debate. It is not the law as it now stands but the law in draft form as it emerged from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and as it would be if this Bill were enacted.</P>
      <P>The guiding principles of the changes being made in the Bill include conformity with the Constitution as now amended; the need to adhere to our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland, to which the two Governments solemnly subscribed in the British-Irish Agreement; and, importantly, the Government&rsquo;s policy requirement that there should be, to the greatest extent possible, equality in the conditions for entitlement to Irish citizenship north and south of the Border.</P>
      <P>Under Article 1, paragraph (vi) of the British-Irish Agreement, the two Governments recognise the right of the people of Northern Ireland to regard themselves and be treated as Irish or British or both, as they may choose. In this context, the terms &ldquo;people of Northern Ireland&rdquo; is defined at annexe 1 to the Agreement as consisting of those born in the North to parents, at least one of whom is Irish or British, or a person who has a right to reside in Northern Ireland without restriction as to period of residence. Compliance with the Agreement requires that Irish citizenship be available as an entitlement to any person who comes within that definition.</P><Col N="1606"/>
      <P>Section 6 of the 1956 Act as it stands meets that requirement &mdash; and goes beyond it in that it confers an entitlement to Irish citizenship on anyone born in the island of Ireland, which includes persons born in the North to parents, neither of whom is British or Irish, or a person with unrestricted residence rights. This Bill, at section 3, modifies section 6 of the 1956 Act and does so by reference to the new rules set out in the new section 6A, which is one of the sections inserted by section 4 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>That is the section of the Bill containing the main changes that flow directly from the amendment to the Constitution in June. The two new sections that it inserts into the 1956 Act are section 6A, dealing with the entitlement to Irish citizenship of persons born to certain non-nationals, and section 6B, which specifies what periods of residence in Ireland are to be reckoned where that is a factor under the new section 6A. Section 6A(1) provides that a person born, North or South, to non-national parents, either of whom has been lawfully resident in the island of Ireland for at least three out of the four years immediately preceding the birth, will have an entitlement to Irish citizenship. This introduces the new general rule for the children of non-national parents born in the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The exemptions from this general rule are set out in subsection (2) of the new section 6A. Naturally, the first two of these exemptions, at paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), cover those children whose continuing entitlement to Irish citizenship remains unaffected by the proposals in the Bill, namely, at paragraph (<i>a</i>), those who were born before the commencement of the Act, although not before the referendum, irrespective of the nationality or period of residence in the State of their parents and, at paragraph (<i>b</i>), those born to an Irish citizen parent.</P>
      <P>Next, at paragraph (<i>c</i>) of section 6A(2), comes a person born, whether North or South, to parents, one of whom is a British citizen or has an entitlement to reside in the UK, and thus Northern Ireland, without any restriction on his or her period of residence. This exemption from the general rule is dictated by our commitments under the British-Irish Agreement, to the extent that it relates to persons born in the North. However, by applying it also to children born in the South to such parents, we are ensuring that the rules that apply in the North are mirrored in the same circumstances in the South. This means, for example, that if a child is born to a British person at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, the child is entitled to be an Irish citizen and we are obliged to have this as part of our law under the British-Irish Agreement. However, if this change was not made and the same British person went to Letterkenny General Hospital to have the child, we would discriminate between the child&rsquo;s right based on the fact that it was born south of the Border, which would be an anomaly.</P>
      <P>This is also the reason for the next exemption, in paragraph (<i>d</i>) of the subsection, which applies <Col N="1607"/>to a person born anywhere on the island to parents, either of whom has an entitlement to reside in the State without any restriction on his or her period of residence. Irish immigration practice differs from UK immigration and citizenship law in that we grant permission without condition as to time after the person has already completed a number of years of satisfactory residence on foot of regularly renewed permissions, whereas the holders of certain nationalities have permission to remain in the UK without restriction as to time from the moment they arrive in the UK. Persons granted refugee status in the State, however, have an entitlement to reside in the State without restriction as to the period of residence from the date of granting of such status. Thus, parents covered by paragraph (<i>d</i>) of this subsection would almost certainly have completed sufficient years of lawful residence to meet the requirement of the general rule anyway. In regard to each of these exemptions, special provisions safeguard the entitlement to citizenship where one or both of the parents are deceased at the time of birth.</P>
      <P>The last of these exceptions, at paragraph (<i>e</i>) of subsection (2), brings me to a matter that was not originally in the draft Bill published by the Government at the time of the referendum, namely, the question of the entitlement to Irish citizenship of a child born to a foreign diplomat while on service in Ireland. Until the 2001 changes to citizenship law, which implemented the changes arising out of the new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, the children of foreign diplomats were excluded from citizenship here as they are in many other countries throughout the world &mdash; this was and is a matter of international custom and practice for which there are good reasons and which require exploration by those interested in the matter. However, the wording of the new Article 2 was such that, as a matter of constitutional law, that exclusion could not continue in the Irish context because everybody born here had the birthright to be an Irish citizen. Therefore, the 2001 Act put in place a special procedure whereby the children of diplomats could if they wished exercise their birthright entitlement to be Irish citizens. With the change made by the most recent amendment, in June last, we are now able in the main to revert to the former position, which is what has been done in the last exclusion in the new section 6A(2), together with section 3 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The new section 6B sets out what periods of residence are reckonable for the purposes of the new rule at section 6A. The exemptions at the new section 6A(1) address the situation where either or both parents have pre-deceased the birth of the child in question. Section 6B(1) covers another aspect of the question of pre-decease of a parent. Its effect is that if a parent who dies before the child is born was residing in Ireland, North or South, and the period immediately prior to the death was reckonable for the <Col N="1608"/>purposes of section 6A, then the period between the death of the parent and the birth of the child is also reckonable. I draw Members&rsquo; attention to section 9 of the 1956 Act, which at the time addressed the posthumous aspects of Irish citizenship, but did so in a manner typical of its time by referring only to the pre-decease of fathers. Section 5 of the Bill as originally introduced sought to gender-proof the 1956 provision but since the question of posthumous birth has now been dealt with comprehensively by a combination of the new sections inserted by the Bill and the new section 7 that was put into the 1956 Act in 2001, we are now in a position to repeal section 9 of the 1956 Act because it is redundant and surplus to requirements.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of section 6B provides a means whereby the reckonable residence in Ireland, North or South, of parents who are EU, EEA or Swiss nationals can be verified by declaration. Citizens of EU member states are entitled to be present in Ireland in exercise of their treaty rights of free movement and establishment. Nationals of the three other countries of the European Economic Area and of the Swiss Confederation have analogous rights arising out of international agreements to which Ireland and the other EU member states are parties.</P>
      <P>While we have in place a statutory procedure whereby such nationals can obtain residence permits, European law on the matter is very clear &mdash; the residence permit is merely evidence of the exercise of a treaty right and not a pre-condition to its exercise, and exercising treaty rights derives directly from the treaties themselves and not from domestic laws that implement or facilitate those rights. Therefore, there is no obligation on nationals of these countries to register all of their lawful presence in the State or to seek permission from the State to be here. In those circumstances, it would be incongruous if the Bill were to disapply a child from a citizenship entitlement on the basis of an absence only of an official record of his or her parent&rsquo;s residence in the State. The declaration process provides a means by which they can overcome the documentation gap. Members will note, however, that this section does not apply to British citizens, since their children born in Ireland will anyway be entitled to be Irish citizens without the question of periods of reckonable residence coming into the matter.</P>
      <P>Section 6B(3) covers the situation where the EU, EEA or Swiss national parent whose residence is reckonable under subsection (2) is not in a position to make the declaration himself or herself.</P>
      <P>Section 6B(4) sets out the circumstances in which a period spent in the State by a parent is not reckonable. The first of these, at paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the subsection, is the most obvious. A period of residence will not count if it is unlawful, that is, if it is in contravention of section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 2004.</P>
      <P>Some of the comments I received during the summer on an earlier draft of the Bill expressed <Col N="1609"/>concern that this might operate to deny an Irish citizenship entitlement to a person whose parent had, perhaps inadvertently or through oversight, allowed an interval to elapse between the expiry of permission to remain and its renewal. It is precisely to cover this sort of temporary oversight, as well as to cover short absences from the country on holiday, business or family trips, that the basic period of qualifying residence is set at three out of the previous four years, rather than three straight years, preceding the birth.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) excludes from the reckoning periods where the parent&rsquo;s permission to be in the State was for the purposes of study, and paragraph (<i>c</i>) excludes periods where the person&rsquo;s only basis for being in the State was on foot of a temporary residence certificate issued to asylum seekers to cover the duration of their claim. Both of these exclusions apply where the parent in question is a non-EEA national at the relevant times. These exclusions mirror the provisions in place in section 16A of the citizenship Act, inserted in 2001, dealing with reckonable periods towards meeting the residence conditions for naturalisation. The exclusions in paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) were also the subject of criticisms in commentary on the earlier draft Bill and a number of amendments were tabled during the passage of the Bill through the other House aimed at making such periods reckonable for citizenship purposes.</P>
      <P>While I acknowledge the basis on which the criticisms were made, the Government has no proposals to deviate from this policy in either respect. Permission to reside in Ireland for the purposes of study is purely temporary in nature. It is given for the expected duration of the course of study only and the expectation is that the person will return at the end of the course or, in the case of a multi-year course, at the end of each academic year. To simply be present in the State does not imply the long-term attachment to the State which should, as a matter of law, automatically confer citizenship on a child born to a student. However, for example, a person may come to Ireland to study, fall in love with another person and have a child. If that couple lawfully remains in Ireland for five years, they will in the fullness of time be able to apply for naturalisation for themselves and their child.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is not a very exclusionary mechanism. It merely says that people who arrive in Ireland pregnant and planning to attend a short course in an Irish language college or university will not as a consequence of that have Irish citizenship conferred on the child. Most people who arrive in Ireland while pregnant would not be in the country for three years in any event, but people who come here and decide during the course of their studies to have a child in Ireland as a means of conferring citizenship on the child and invoking the Chen and Fajujonu rights will be on notice that this will not work.</P>

	<P>As for asylum, any proposal to include in the reckoning a period spent as an asylum seeker as distinct from a refugee would serve to encourage false claims and the protraction of the asylum process.</P>
      <P>The reckonability or otherwise of periods of residence in the State by non-EEA or Swiss nationals can be easily ascertained by examining the passports of the persons concerned for stamps affixed by the Irish immigration authorities. That is in respect of periods in the Irish State, but as regards periods in Northern Ireland the situation is considerably more complex. As I said earlier, the Government&rsquo;s aim is to mirror conditions for the entitlement to Irish citizenship North and South and as regards this category of parent, subsection (5) of the new section 6B does just that. Immigration laws and practice in Northern Ireland, however, are not the same as those in this State and we cannot rely on them to converge with those in this State or even remain as they are. In particular, the immigration stamp in the passport of a non-EEA national legally residing in the North records a permission to remain in the UK, not in the part of it that is Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We therefore have to put in place a means whereby the Irish authorities can verify that the period of residence of a non-EEA national parent before the birth of a child was lawful and reckonable, and that it was in the North as distinct from some other part of the United Kingdom. The approach that the Bill takes to deal with this is set out in section 14. This inserts a new section 28A into the 1956 Act, adapting the procedure already in section 28 of that Act whereby a person who is an Irish citizen, other than a naturalised one, can seek a certificate of Irish nationality. In any case where the question of the entitlement of a person to Irish citizenship depends on an assertion of reckonable residence of a non-EEA national parent in the North, whether that be for all or part of the three-year period, the first step will be to apply for a certificate of Irish nationality and to support that application with a statutory declaration together with whatever verifying documents are necessary.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to set out in the primary statute what those documents might be since some of them will be UK immigration documents or stamps which the UK authorities have the right to change from time to time to suit themselves, and it would be impractical for me to bring amending legislation before the House every time that became necessary. Instead there is a power to prescribe documentation by statutory instru<Col N="1611"/>ment and a power to require further documentation as may be necessary in particular cases.</P>
      <P>This category of person, where the Irish citizenship entitlement depends on a period of residence of a non-EEA national parent in the North, is the only one where a form of administrative intervention is required in order to establish Irish citizenship. In all other cases, the official documentation necessary to show the entitlement is either readily available in the form of birth certificates, immigration documents and the like or else can be generated by way of statutory declaration supported by the appropriate documents. There is no simpler way around this. It is a practical difference dictated by the fact that the North is another jurisdiction. The important element is that it is a way of implementing the Government&rsquo;s policy of ensuring that an entitlement to Irish citizenship will arise out of similar conditions, whether North or South.</P>
      <P>To go with that new system, there are some new measures designed to address the situation where a person attempts to secure an appearance of Irish citizenship by making false declarations. The first of these is in section 13, which enables the Minister to revoke a certificate of nationality that was based on false or mistaken information. The other important feature is in section 15, which puts a new general offences provision into the 1956 Act, covering the possibilities that will now exist for potential abuse of the system. Consequent on that, we are able to repeal the only offence provision at present in the Act by means of section 12.</P>
      <P>Section 9 addresses a potential anomaly that could arise in the operation of the special naturalisation conditions for spouses of Irish citizens, where the non-national spouse is living with his or her Irish citizen spouse who is resident abroad in the public service, for instance, in an Irish embassy overseas. The nature of postings abroad is such that without the change which I am proposing here to deem time spent abroad in the public service as time spent in the State, the non-national spouse might never build up the periods of residence in Ireland required under section 15A or section 15.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that I asked the Human Rights Commission for comments on the earlier draft of the Bill, published last April. The commission raised a number of general points in its observations on the draft legislation and adverted in a general way to obligations under a number of international instruments such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. I assure the House that the provisions of the Bill are fully consistent with the State&rsquo;s obligations under these instruments and I am heartened by the fact that the commission&rsquo;s observations did not indicate anything to the contrary.</P><Col N="1612"/>
      <P>However, one of the aspects on which the commission commented was a concern that there was no provision in the 1956 Act for the naturalisation of minors. While this concern is in fact mistaken &mdash; section 16 contains specific provisions addressing the naturalisation of minors &mdash; one side effect of the new narrow definition of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; in section 10 of the Bill would be to limit the power to naturalise some classes of children. While section 16 envisages applications made on behalf of minors who are of Irish descent or have Irish associations or who have a parent who has been naturalised, without the change proposed in section 8 other children could not be naturalised. This change permits the possibility of naturalising a child born to non-national parents after the coming into effect of the new rules for entitlement to Irish citizenship in the Bill but whose parents did not at the time of the birth meet the residence requirement for that entitlement. This will ensure that the matter raised by the Human Rights Commission will not give rise to the concern that it voiced.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the proposals in the Bill will result in a fair and sensible citizenship law, one which will acknowledge the stake that non-nationals established in Ireland have in Irish society by ensuring that their children born here have the entitlement to be Irish citizens. We are not concerned with their skin colour, the language they speak or their appearance. What matters is that they have a substantial connection with Irish society and that, accordingly, their children will be part of the Irish nation by operation of law. As a people, we have decided by an overwhelming majority in a referendum that we do not believe the mere accident of birth in Ireland should be the sole criterion in determining Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>Nobody will be left stateless as a consequence of the changes we are bringing about in the law. Nobody who would otherwise be stateless will be deprived of Irish citizenship in any circumstance whatsoever. Under international law we are obliged to maintain that situation. For instance, in the frequently cited case of a Filipino nurse, if she does not qualify because of the shortness of her stay in Ireland, her child will nonetheless be a Filipino citizen under Filipino law. If that were not the case, if we are dealing with some country which did not have <i>jus sanguinis</i> citizenship rights for children of short-stay parents in Ireland, they will be entitled to Irish citizenship as a fallback position.</P>
      <P>Everyone born in Ireland will be a citizen of some state. That important point is sometimes lost sight of and it is suggested that we are producing some second class of children in Ireland who are of an inferior status in the eyes of our law. That is not so. Every child born in Ireland, whether before or after the passage of this legislation, will be a citizen of a sovereign state. If a child is not an Irish citizen because of the shortness of its parents&rsquo; connection with the Irish state, and is not a citizen of some other state on the <Col N="1613"/>basis of descent, then that child will be an Irish citizen because that is the fallback position of Irish law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that there would be some circumstances in which a child would be better off being stateless than having the citizenship of a really deplorable state foisted on him or her?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator cannot continue to engage in a Committee Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Minister&rsquo;s fault. He is so interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the Senator&rsquo;s question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We have decided that there must be a more tangible, long-term and real link between the parent of the child before citizenship, as of right, becomes available. In this respect, we as a people have decided to restore to the Houses of the Oireachtas the power to judge collectively, by legislation, whether there is a sufficient link between a parent and Ireland as a State and a community to warrant the granting of citizenship as of right to the children of that parent.</P>
      <P>The people were told at the time the referendum was being discussed of the broad thrust of Government policy which was to follow upon the licence to legislate in this area that the passing of the referendum would give. What has been put before this House is a realistic and sensible policy based on the establishment of a real link between parents of children born in Ireland and the State and society.</P>
      <P>Some other states have an absolute<i> jus soli </i>entitlement to citizenship but no other state, of which I am aware, combines an absolute <i>jus soli </i>right with the inability to prevent people coming to have children on its soil. By virtue of our common travel area with the United Kingdom and our membership of the European Union, we do not have the right to refuse admission to people coming here in the same way as every state which has an absolute<i> jus soli </i>entitlement to citizenship can control access. That is the difference between this country and the United States. What the legislation puts in place is, of course, more restrictive than the position heretofore. However, I emphasise that it will remain the case that Ireland&rsquo;s citizenship and nationality laws are among the most liberal and generous in Europe and, indeed, in the world.</P>
      <P>The proposals reflect Ireland&rsquo;s high regard for those who have come from abroad to establish themselves in, to share in and to contribute to Irish society by entitling their children born here to be Irish citizens by operation of law. At the same time, they will ensure that Irish citizenship is not something which can be bought, sold, bartered or acquired on foot an arranged birth in order to secure a passport to a wider Europe but something which is important to those who hold <Col N="1614"/>it or, as Article 9 of the Constitution puts it, who have a sense of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the Irish State. For those reasons, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. I read his Second Stage contribution in the other House and I am glad he has not adopted the same confrontational style he did there. It did little for the caring and sharing image the Government wishes to portray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is because I got a decent hearing in this House whereas I did not get one in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that style has not been used in this House. I am sure the Minister will hear a lot more reasoned, calm and constructive contributions on the Bill, to which I look forward. I have no intention of speaking about what should have happened as regards consultation and debate prior to the referendum. The referendum has taken place and the people have spoken and made their intentions known in a clear and emphatic manner. As a democracy, we must implement the will of the people and put legislation in place which will reflect the wishes of the electorate. The people&rsquo;s wishes include actively promoting integration, inclusion, protection and participation in society and a recognition and respect for cultural diversity. My party believes the Bill should be supported and we hope the Minister will address our concerns in regard to it.</P>
      <P>We need an integrated immigration, residency and citizenship policy in place. The Minister said we have some kind of policy but we do not have a clear one. Immigration policy must be applied in accordance with human rights laws. International standards of refugee protection recognises that people fleeing from human rights violations are not always in a position to obtain proper documentation under those circumstances. I ask that asylum seekers are not penalised for not having proper documentation when their applications are being dealt with.</P>
      <P>The fact the EU has failed to agree a comprehensive and coherent policy on immigration does not help the situation. I was a member of the EU committee of the regions and agreement was reached in Tampere in 1999 which envisaged a common asylum and immigration policy along with common border controls. I had hoped that would have been implemented by now but the process seems to have ground to a halt. Nevertheless, it is the duty of the Government to outline a clear and coherent policy, which is lacking. We have a mishmash system which gives rise to total confusion. There is no transparency and, in many instances, there is little criteria.</P>
      <P>I echo the call of my colleague, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, in the other House that an Oireachtas helpline be set up to assist Members. Every Member will have received representations on a <Col N="1615"/>number of issues. Rather than table parliamentary questions and raise issues on the Adjournment, it would be much better for the taxpayer and for everybody else if there was a specific person who we could contact to deal with our queries. I hope the Minister will deal with that matter.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill to end the passports for sale scheme, or investment based naturalisation. The abuse of this scheme, especially under the Charlie Haughey-led Fianna F&aacute;il Government, when passports were given out like snuff at a wake and when procedures were not followed, was a disgrace and it devalued the currency of an Irish passport internationally. I, like the Minister, am glad the scheme is to be abolished. While I recognise it was beneficial in many instances from an economic point of view, the Minister is correct to end the scheme. It brought shame to the country in some cases.</P>
      <P>I turn to the question of non-national parents of Irish born children who applied for residency on the basis of the birth of their child in this country prior to the Supreme Court decision of January 2003. I admit many of those people came to Ireland because the law, as it stood, provided the right of residency to parents of Irish citizens. The Supreme Court decision and the referendum ensures these circumstances cannot exist again. It is estimated that 11,000 people find themselves in this position. I ask that an amnesty is granted to these people granting them the right of residency. The public would not want a hard-headed approach to be taken to this situation and would want compassion and generosity to be shown to these families and their Irish children. I hope the Minister adopts a humanitarian approach to the issue.</P>
      <P>The manner in which work permits are issued is flawed and can lead to exploitation of immigrant workers. We have all seen programmes on television about the exploitation of people. I firmly believe work permits should be issued to employees which would, at least, allow them to change their employer within a particular sector.</P>
      <P>The economy has undergone much change recently and it has made Ireland attractive for economic migrants. Let us face it, the country needs migrant labour to sustain output and growth in our economy. These people must be viewed as a potential permanent members of our society with equal rights &mdash; perhaps just short of citizenship. They must be recognised as a great asset to the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned students. I read recently about bogus students and institutions exploiting the student visa scheme. I hope strong action will be taken against unscrupulous operators who use this scheme to generate a lucrative income to facilitate the evasion of visa and immigration controls. I support strong action in this regard.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will address the thoughts and concerns I have outlined about various aspects of the Bill. I look forward to the debate <Col N="1616"/>and the contributions of my colleagues. Fine Gael will be positive and constructive in the passage of the Bill through the House. We are implementing the will of the people in putting this legislation in place. I shall put down some amendments, possibly on Committee Stage, on behalf of my party. Nevertheless, the Bill deserves to be supported and my colleagues and I will provide that support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach leis an Bhille N&aacute;isi&uacute;ntachta agus Saor&aacute;nachta &Eacute;ireann a phl&eacute;, Bille t&aacute;bhachtach. As Senator Cummins observed, the people have spoken. In many respects, today&rsquo;s discussion is a reflection of the debate that took place in the House, prior to the referendum, on the draft legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to prevent the abuse of the <i>jus soli</i> entitlement to citizenship of any person born in Ireland. The previous debate revealed elements of contention, some not clearly articulated and some others concerned with timing in that the referendum was to be held in conjunction with the local and European elections. At that stage, there were pessimistic comments and fears regarding the possibility of racist or xenophobic influences.</P>
      <P>However, many also felt that these fears were unfounded and that it was opportune to hold the referendum at the same time as the elections. Moreover, the Minister was strongly convinced that such an approach would ensure a far more representative decision. The turnout for the elections bore out this conviction and represents a lesson for the future. If the referendum had been held on its own, there is every probability a much lower turnout would have been secured and, therefore, a less representative pronouncement of the will of the people.</P>
      <P>We should also acknowledge that the ensuing debate during the referendum campaign was calm and mature. It served to address the issues well and avoid any of the racist tendencies that some felt would arise. The outcome of the referendum, whereby some 79% voted in favour, represented a strong endorsement by the people. Moreover, it was an endorsement of the Bill now before us because the Minister had prudently set out the draft legislation prior to the referendum. This ensured that people were well aware when voting in the referendum of the content and provisions of the associated legislation. In considering the people&rsquo;s decision, we are reminded of the value of our Constitution, now 67 years in operation. The thoroughness of the civil servants and politicians of 1937 in constructing it laid the foundations for a democratic operation of the apparatus of the State. The will of the people is sought even in instances where decisions are made by Parliament in other EU member states. This is something I value as a citizen of the Republic.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for his statement on the record that &ldquo;migration may be a phenomenon but, in fact, migrants are people, flesh and blood, and must be dealt with accordingly&rdquo;. In that regard, I welcome his comments to the effect that <Col N="1617"/>the Government is now committed to the development of a comprehensive immigration and residency Bill. This will serve to marry the interests and concerns of our citizens with the needs of immigrants. I am minded of my school history lessons in which we learned that in the last great influx of immigrants in 1169, the Normans, became &ldquo;more Irish than the Irish themselves.&rdquo; Many of us are successors of those early immigrants. It is important in preparing the legislation, including this Bill and that which the Minister now proposes to introduce to deal more comprehensively with residency and so on, to provide both the circumstances and the framework in which the situation of the Norman immigrants can be repeated. In decades to come, those who have come to Ireland in recent times and will do so in the future, including Lithuanians, Poles and so on, should be able to claim that they have become &ldquo;more Irish than the Irish themselves.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with the naturalisation entitlement which, as the Minister has observed, currently applies to those who have resided in the country for five years. This is among the most liberal provisions in this regard in the EU. Hitherto, universal entitlement to Irish citizenship was available to those born here. We should be mindful that this entitlement also secured EU rights of residency, which is part of the reason we were obligated to bring forward the referendum. The Minister has pointed out that the provisions of the Bill compare favourably to those of other EU partners.</P>
      <P>A cursory glance at the situation that pertains in other EU member states underlines this point. A child born in Britain on or after 1 January 1983, for example, is entitled to British citizenship if either parent is a British citizen or is legally entitled to reside in that country. If neither parents satisfies one of these conditions, the child is not a British citizen at birth. A child born in France to foreign parents automatically becomes a French national at age 18. In Germany, if one parent has been a legal resident for at least eight years and possesses a permanent residency permit, a child born to that parent in Germany acquires citizenship at the parent&rsquo;s request. Children born to non-Danish citizens do not receive Danish citizenship at birth. Since 1999, young foreigners aged 18 to 23 years with a minimum of ten years&rsquo; residency in Denmark are entitled to apply for naturalisation. In Sweden, a child born to non-Swedish parents does not acquire nationality at birth. It is accessible, however, by making a declaration when such a child is between 21 and 23 years old. Spain does not grant citizenship to children born to non-Spanish parents. Such children gain citizenship during the ages of 18 to 20 years by declaration. Likewise, Greece provides no entitlement to nationality at birth. Instead, a child can apply for naturalisation when he or she reaches 18 years of age. With continuous residency since birth, a child can apply for Italian citizenship at the age of 21.</P><Col N="1618"/>
      <P>These examples illustrate that the change we have made compares more than favourably to the provisions of our European partners. Here, a child will attain citizenship if at least one parent has been legally resident for three of the preceding four years. The Minister has also pointed to the entitlement to Irish citizenship of people born in Northern Ireland. This is consequential on the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and was part of the Constitution prior to that. The Bill removes the three-year restriction for children born to British citizens and there is no restriction for those entitled to reside in Northern Ireland. This creates an anomaly, which I am aware is underwritten by the Good Friday Agreement, between the sovereign states of Britain and the Republic, whereby people entitled to reside in Britain automatically qualify for Irish citizenship. In this, we are conferring preferential status on certain nationalities not because of any relationship with this State, but because of their relationship with Britain. That is now a <i>fait accompli</i> but it is important that we do not arrogate the decision on Irish citizenship to another State.</P>
      <P>Consequent on this Bill, any changes in the British system which would confer preferential status on nationalities which may have a historic relationship with Britain would also automatically qualify those nationalities for citizenship here. This anomaly should be recognised and rectified at some stage. There are many facets to the Good Friday Agreement and one does not wish to unravel it. Nevertheless, anomalies in the Agreement should be recognised and dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out that the Bill does not affect anyone who has an entitlement to Irish citizenship at present. That is important and the people of Ireland would not want that entitlement to be removed. In the manner he constructed the referendum, the Minister ensured that would not happen. The Bill also reflects the State&rsquo;s commitment against statelessness. Only those born to short-stay parents who hold citizenship elsewhere will be affected by it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the changes in the investment-based naturalisation scheme. As the Minister said, the scheme was a product of another time and was abused. On the other hand, it is acknowledged that it helped companies. F&oacute;ir Teoranta was the bank of last resort when the economic climate was very poor and when the jobs outlook and future prospects led many people to emigrate. This Bill is concerned with immigration. Despite the abuses, much good was done by the scheme to secure jobs which otherwise would not have been secured. Times and circumstances have changed and our economic health has altered dramatically for the better. This is to be welcomed. Such a scheme would now be incongruous and I am sure all Members of the House support its removal.</P>
      <P>In recent debates in the House on this issue comments were made regarding the effect of changes on a child who was entitled to citizenship <Col N="1619"/>on the basis of a parent who had died before the child was born. The Minister has dealt with this possibility sensibly by making provision for such a child to qualify for citizenship and for the period between the death of the parent and the birth of the child to be included in the period needed for qualification. This provision is welcome.</P>
      <P>The immigration laws and practices within Northern Ireland differ from those in this State. The Minister alluded to this difference in his speech and it is his intention to deal with it by regulation, which is sensible. The difference between procedures and regulations in the two jurisdictions presents difficulty in establishing a residency period in Northern Ireland as distinct from other parts of the United Kingdom. As this arises under the Good Friday Agreement, will there be scope at some stage for harmonising the regulations and practices in Northern Ireland with those in the Republic of Ireland, which might assist or facilitate the effective implementation of this arrangement? In the past we have been inclined to follow British practice. There is a historic reason for that as much Irish legislation has its genesis in the period before independence. Nevertheless, we should try to move in the other direction where it is in our interest to do so.</P>
      <P>The Bill is another step in providing the legislative framework to deal with changing circumstances as we move towards a multi-cultural Ireland. Making that move in a coherent and sensible fashion will provide the foundation for achieving the integrated and socially inclusive society to which we aspire. I am sure the Minister will have the full support of the House in pursuing that objective. I commend him for introducing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his informative disquisition in his speech. I learned a good deal from it and followed it with great interest. It was clear and logical. However, the speech left out salient areas and I wish to explore them.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very interesting when he spoke about Garda statistics regarding racist attacks. I welcome what he said and I hope it reflects accurately the situation on the ground. Nevertheless, the perception of vulnerable people, and even of some who are not legally vulnerable, is different. I listened with great sadness to an articulate and distinguished Irish citizen, who is a doctor from Sri Lanka and is married to an Irish person. This person was extensively interviewed on Marian Finucane&rsquo;s radio programme and later on another programme. She made the point that since the referendum and the atmosphere generated by it she has felt so badly about the situation that she has returned to Sri Lanka. In addition to the Garda statistics, we must bear in mind that educated and articulate people have formed this perception.</P>
      <P>Although I completely exonerate the Minister from any charge of racism, certain figures &mdash; prin<Col N="1620"/>cipally outside the two Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; are strongly in support of some of the changes in the Bill and have lobbied for them. I am thinking of groups like the anti-immigration platform, or whatever they call themselves. There is a context in which the Bill must be placed. For that reason, although I accept some of the logic of what the Minister says, I have real grounds for concern.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right when he says many people want to come to Ireland. Why would they not? I think it is a wonderful accident of fate that I have the right to live in this country. It has been adjudged the best country on the planet in which to live. It is one of the wealthiest countries on earth. Why would people who are in awful conditions not want to come here? Of course, Ireland is a small country and we cannot solve the world&rsquo;s problems all on our own. In geopolitical terms, the world must move towards greater equality and justice so that people will be happy to stay at home. It must take a great deal of suffering to drive people out and we must be compassionate in understanding this.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the attraction of Ireland to non-nationals who make their way to our country &ldquo;with plans to share in and contribute to our prosperity&rdquo;. I was glad to hear the Minister add to his prepared speech the words &ldquo;and to our cultural diversity&rdquo;. This shows the humane element in the Minister&rsquo;s own make-up.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about people observing immigration requirements. That is fine, depending on what are those requirements. There has been a notable reluctance on the part of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to spell out clearly and precisely what are the criteria and guidelines and how people who are placed in this anomalous position can effect this decently and legally. We need much greater transparency, clarity and fairness in dealing with people.</P>
      <P>The Minister says our immigration policies have served us reasonably well. I am glad he included the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;. I do not think they have. I am not blaming the Minister but I remember the queues of people in the rain and all that misery and wretchedness. I know the Minister took that very much to heart and was not in support of it.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to work permits. While not directly relevant to this debate, there is a scandal here in that the work permits are in the sole possession and judgment of employers. Very often, these permits are used to militate against rights of people. There was a case involving two unfortunate people from Pakistan who were badly treated. They had concluded an agreement that they would be paid a certain amount of money and would have certain conditions, yet the employer simply said: &ldquo;You can bugger off [if the House will excuse the expression] if you don&rsquo;t like it, because I hold your work permits.&rdquo; This is a regular feature so I ask the Minister to address it. He says these work permit policies are work<Col N="1621"/>ing. They are if one uses a kind of mathematical calculation and says there are more applications but underneath that there is concealed a nasty human problem.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of safe countries. Would the Minister consider Nigeria to be a safe country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Every country in Europe considers Nigeria to be a safe country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There are large sections of it where it is not particularly safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;generally speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They have a very peculiar view and perhaps they do not know that much about it. It is not a particularly safe country. Certain sections of it are extremely dangerous, particularly for women who may be subjected to genital mutilation, as one&rsquo;s female child might be if one is sent back there. There is a constitutional requirement on the Minister and on the Government to protect the rights of such children. I would remind the Minister that whereas the referendum entitles him to take away the citizenship rights of the parent, there is no entitlement to take away the citizenship rights of the child. It is the responsibility of the Minister and the Government to guarantee those rights but there are areas in which there has been a significant failure to do so.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister dealt with the passports for sale issue. It is about time that was done. That is what my colleague, Senator Quinn, was examining in his Bill which he has generously withdrawn for various reasons.</P>
      <P>Why should students be excluded? The Government is encouraging people to come here to study. We have increased enormously the number of students we invite here and now we want to treble that number, yet we are saying that if someone is here for four years, acclimatising themselves, getting to love Irish culture and getting to understand the place, that period will not count. Are these not the very kind of people whose skills would be useful to the country? Why exclude them? It seems daft.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made the point that the rights of the child survive this legislation but I wish to ask the Minister some questions. What about the children who are left behind in Ireland? Who is looking after them? Are any measures being put in place to guarantee the rights of the child in these instances? The Minister has agreed, by nodding, that he is also charged with protecting the rights of the child who is an Irish citizen. How will those rights be protected while such children are outside the country? How will consular officers ensure that such children will be able to realise their rights? They have rights which are clearly specified in the Constitution. These include the right to a proper education, decent health care and protection from abuse, as well as all the other rights under the Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. If they are in one of these wonderful countries &mdash; for example, Nigeria, about which the Minister is so lyrical &mdash; how will he be able to assure the House that he is protecting these legal rights? What will happen to a child who, for example, is forced to move to a country where there is not an Irish ambassador or even a consul? How will we monitor such children&rsquo;s rights?</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the parents for the time being, these children are Irish citizens. What will be done if the Government of a foreign country decides not to accept them? If they find themselves in a country that routinely engages in serious breaches of human rights, what provisions are being made to protect them? I have already <Col N="1623"/>raised the questions of forced marriage and female genital mutilation. These are Irish citizens, as determined under the law and the Constitution, so is the Minister content that they could be subject to such conditions?</P>
      <P>Are any statistics available concerning the number of children left behind here? Do we know where they are? Do we know how these Irish citizens are being looked after here, as required under the Constitution? A child impact review should be undertaken on these Irish citizens. We need to know what the effect of this measure will be on them and only in light of that can we make certain decisions.</P>
      <P>There may be test cases and I am sure the Minister knows much more about this than I do. In a 1999 case entitled Baker <i>v</i> Canada, the Canadian supreme court ruled that insufficient weight had been given to the fundamentally important impact that a migrant parent&rsquo;s deportation would have upon her children and upon their rights. That is a case that is arguable and which creates precedent that is, to some extent at least, persuasive in Irish law.</P>
      <P>The Minister provided an interesting background to the situation, arising as it does from the Government&rsquo;s interpretation of a Supreme Court action in January 2003. That led to the retroactive termination of the procedure which had existed whereby migrant parents of Irish children could apply for residency. That left approximately 11,500 parents in this position, although so far in the debate, nobody has mentioned that fact. Some 11,500 human beings are in this anomalous situation. That is the scale of the problem. Would the Minister be prepared to grant some amnesty to these people, except those who have a prior proven track record?</P>
      <P>In a situation that almost amounts to retrospective or retroactive legislation, the administrative practice of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was to accept applications for residency in the State from the non-national parents of Irish children. They could have been refused but in almost all cases they were granted up to this case. Following the decision in the Lobe and Osayande case in 2003, which confirmed the Government could refuse to grant residency to the parents of Irish children, the Government announced it would no longer accept these applications. More strikingly, considering there will be no fundamental change in the law, the Government announced it would not process any of the 11,500 applications made prior to the Supreme Court decision and which remain outstanding. Now, apparently, the Department considers all those people to be in the State without permission, even though they lawfully made these applications. Worse than that, in human terms, there has been no communication whatever, as I understand it, from the Department to these people who are placed in this anomalous situation. That puts them in an appalling human predicament.</P><Col N="1624"/>
      <P>The Minister has discretion but he is obliged under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 to examine a number of matters. These include, for example, the age and domestic circumstances of the applicant, the applicant&rsquo;s prospects of employment and the length of his or her stay in Ireland. The Minister is also obliged to have regard to the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i> to which he referred in his speech. However, he still retains absolute discretion on whether to grant permission. There are, as yet, no clear guidelines. Perhaps the Minister will now take the opportunity to put these guidelines and circumstances clearly on the record of the House. There are far reaching consequences of a decision to refuse to grant leave to remain or, in other words, to allow for deportation.</P>
      <P>There are also consequences for the families, which need to be able to make a fully informed decision. If a family is deported from Ireland it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for its members to migrate legally to another country in the future, which is a real consideration. In some countries people who have been deported from another country have their passports confiscated.</P>
      <P>Some 3,239 notices of intention to deport have been issued. The Department explicitly states that it does not monitor the impact of the deportations on the Irish children involved, which is an abuse of the rights of Irish citizens. The Department does not retain statistics in respect of the numbers of Irish children who accompany their parents or even the number in the State or wherever they are, which seems frightful. It is very important for people to be granted legal aid.</P>
      <P>If all these people appeal and exhaust the legal processes, it will cost the State a whale of a lot of money. It could be cheaper, more humane, more efficient, more justifiable and more in accord with the provisions of the Constitution safeguarding the rights of those Irish children &mdash; forgetting about their parents &mdash; to take on board the possibility of granting most of these a retrospective right to stay. We can then clear the decks and proceed with what might be a more limiting policy.</P>
      <P>At no stage in my speech have I accused the Minister of being racist or miserable. He made a most illuminating contribution, with some of which I agree. However, much was left out and I am glad that, having been briefed by various organisations, I have had the opportunity to place some of these concerns on the record of the House and I look forward to the Minister answering them.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Bill and I welcome the Minister to the House. As he may have heard stated here before, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is by far the best <Col N="1625"/>Cabinet member to come and stay for debates; he does not just present his Bill and do a runner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I would understand if he did a runner at this stage. The Bill derives from the original Supreme Court case and the constitutional referendum in which the people gave an overwhelming endorsement of the policy now detailed in the Bill. In light of that overwhelming support, it must be supported by almost everybody in this House. I also commend the Minister for the courage he showed during the referendum campaign in enunciating clearly and calmly the issues involved and putting down some of the canards frequently peddled during that debate, which by and large was very reasoned. Thankfully it was not marked by some of the more extreme racist remarks we thought might emerge. It was a good reflection on Irish society in general. While obviously I do not want to reopen the issues raised during the referendum campaign, it was conducted in a good fashion and the outcome was clear.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way since Enoch Powell spoke about the &ldquo;rivers of blood&rdquo;. Society on both sides of the Irish Sea has advanced to the point where we tolerate people with different ethnic and racial complexions from our own and embrace them within our society. These standards are important irrespective of whether the person in the country is a citizen. There seems to be a presumption that citizenship accords a higher level of protection or responsibility with regard to how the State treats people, which is wrong, as I am sure the Minister is well aware. I am sure he and all other Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas would accord those protections to people coming to the country regardless of whether they are asylum seekers, economic migrants or whatever.</P>
      <P>During the last general election campaign it was my experience that asylum seekers, economic migrants and even tourists were regarded as some homogeneous mass and no distinctions were made between them. Some people felt pejorative statements could be made irrespective of the nature of the reason for the person being in the country. It is obvious that some people must flee for their lives and the State has a responsibility to accord them sanctuary and give them due process, as it does. Thankfully some of the Jeremiahs and bogeymen during the campaign were proven wrong. I can recall the Minister having to correct a Member of the other House on the public airwaves when it was suggested that somebody could be left in mid-air, so to speak, without any citizenship, which is obviously wrong. While people might not always have the protection of the state from which they came, they are entitled to the citizenship of that state.</P>
      <P>We also need to consider the effect of the Good Friday Agreement. It is frequently the case, as would be the experience of Members of the <Col N="1626"/>House, that something done with the best of intentions can have totally unexpected side effects. It was only after the Good Friday Agreement that people began coming to the country in numbers and the problem of people coming here to have a baby to accord citizenship to the child developed as an issue. It is appropriate for the Bill to address this aspect also.</P>
      <P>I have some sympathy with remarks about people coming here to study. While I accept it would be wrong to use the short-term course as a way of circumventing the legislation, I have experience of a person who came from Hong Kong, completed all his secondary education here, went to university here, became a doctor and then returned to Hong Kong. When he came back to Ireland after China took over Hong Kong, if that is the correct phrase, it was very difficult to get citizenship for him, which I thought was wrong. Everything about the man indicated he knew very well what his responsibilities to this State were and all his education took place here. While I know the Minister has the power to make decisions in this regard, this area needs further consideration.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that the passports for sale scheme has finished and I commend Senator Quinn on his work in that area. An element of hindsight applies to this matter. When one considers how desperately we needed inward investment, it was understandable by the lights of the time why such a scheme existed. The way the scheme was operated was not understandable or acceptable, which is a separate issue. Given the state of the economy today, the scheme is clearly no longer necessary even if it were desirable.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for work permits lies with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I have some sympathy for the remarks made by Senators Cummins and Norris regarding workers. Nevertheless this is a very difficult issue. While on the one hand nobody should be the property of an employer, which could derive from the way the system operates, against that checks and balances are needed. While on balance I would favour the worker getting the permit, I accept it could be difficult to operate in practice.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I know Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and Senator Cummins raised the issue of a helpline. It would be desirable for the Department to have a system whereby Members of the Oireachtas would have access. The provisions regarding the diplomatic service are good. The area of adoption is fraught. We have come from a position where most adopted children were of Irish parents to one where most adopted children come from outside the State. Obviously if adopted children have Irish parents they should be entitled to Irish citizenship. On balance I believe the Bill is good and I support it wholeheartedly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Dardis for sharing time with me and I welcome the Minister to <Col N="1627"/>the House. I was cheered by the tone of the Minister&rsquo;s speech on which I commend him.</P>
      <P>It is important to put this Bill in a context in which this country is seen to be welcoming to those who come to contribute to it. I look forward to the discussion paper on migration law. Our future economic development will depend on people coming to work here and it is clear that those countries around the world that have sustained economic development have open immigration policies.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spiked one of my guns. I was going to ask for consolidated legislation and I understand from his speech that it is on its way.</P>
      <P>I was concerned about the position of people in Northern Ireland, particularly Nationalists, and I am glad the Bill makes it clear that their entitlement to citizenship has not been diminished by this in any way. Having said that, there is not much point in messing around too much. The Minister is simply following the wish of the people expressed in a referendum that the changes should be made and these flow from it.</P>
      <P>I do not have the definitions section of the primary Act and there is a provision in section 9 for the public service. It is proper that should be covered but to ensure the rights of people in Northern Ireland, does it include the public service in Northern Ireland? It might be defined as the public service of this State and, if so, it might be necessary to make a slight adjustment. There are people in Northern Ireland who would be entitled to Irish citizenship and might not get the benefit from that.</P>
      <P>I too opposed the idea of obstetric tourism and I am glad that the Minister has dealt with that unintended consequence of the Good Friday Agreement. I join with Senator Norris, however, in asking the Minister to deal as sympathetically as possible with those people who have an Irish-born child. There is now a quantified number of people that will not increase and children who were entitled to Irish citizenship should have the benefit of their parents. Those who have had to leave should also have their cases examined. It is possible to make a distinction between those who have shown a commitment to the country and an interest in staying and those who merely used the loophole as a means of getting to other parts of the EU. As Senator Norris said, it might be better, cheaper and more merciful in the long run to deal with these issues by a general amnesty.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House and wish the Minister well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be wrong to re-fight the referendum. It was a clear and decisive decision of the people, although the circumstances under which it was offered to the people and debated, and the haste and the language used on both sides, were not suitable.</P>
      <P>The pressure on the maternity hospitals in this city was cited as the matter that had come to the Minister&rsquo;s attention but the crisis of unparalleled <Col N="1628"/>proportions apparently will occur next year, after the enactment of this legislation. The babies born next summer will have been conceived after the outcome of the referendum was known. The Minister was correct that there were instances of people coming here deliberately but I believe we have not seen the end of the matter.</P>
      <P>I accept that a significant number of the people who voted for this were not driven by any feelings of racism. There is, however, without a doubt, a segment of our society which rallied to this cause with enthusiasm and in whose company neither the Minister, who believes himself to be a card carrying liberal and libertarian, nor I would be happy. The phone-in shows during the referendum uncovered a line of anti-immigrant sentiment that was most unpleasant. If there was a loophole in our legislation, and I am still sceptical about that, the referendum was interpreted by that section of our society as the beginning of a successful campaign to raise the shutters around Ireland. Those in the Immigration Control Platform who were entirely on the periphery of Irish society now believe themselves to have been heeded once and to have a foothold. No one who has spoken in this debate in this House is in that category, including the Minister. The view of those elements of our society is that they have begun a campaign and it is up to everyone in our society, particularly the Government, to say that we have done what was needed to deal with a specific loophole and that this will remain a State that both in its rhetoric and in its laws is generous to those who come to live and work among us &mdash; not just tolerant but generous.</P>
      <P>I am delighted with the draft of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act as it will appear following enactment. It is an idea the Minister might circulate to other Departments. It is helpful to have a draft of complicated legislation and I compliment the Minister on the idea. Whoever thought it up will get the credit for it. That is the nature of politics. It is a good idea and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned asylum seekers and I have one question for him, which I have always wanted to ask. There are reports that the refusal rates for asylum applications for citizens of some of the contentious countries are higher in Ireland than in other states. In other words, we allow a lesser proportion of asylum applications from some of the more troubled countries, in comparison to the United Kingdom, France, Germany or anywhere else. Is that true? Do we say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a higher proportion, because if we do the question must be asked. Why do we refuse a greater proportion of applicants from Somalia, Nigeria or any of the countries where there has been civil strife and persecution? Is there a lesser quality of applicant coming here or are we applying more stringent tests? Perhaps I am wrong, but a number of bodies have said studies show that Ireland is more inclined to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; than other countries. I would like the Minister&rsquo;s comments in this regard.</P><Col N="1629"/>
      <P>There is a wonderful tone of humanity in the Minister&rsquo;s speech about people who are here, with Irish-born children, when he refers to &ldquo;the families of Irish children, whose parents do not have the right to be here&rdquo;. The Minister has said that &ldquo;every outstanding claim to reside in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish-born child will be examined and decided individually&rdquo;, etc. The Department has taken on extra staff and the Minister stated: &ldquo;I have also indicated on more than one occasion that I will look at the entire situation in a decent, sensible and pragmatic way.&rdquo; Nobody with any kind of heart could do other than welcome what the Minister has said. My problem is that the practice and the rhetoric are hard to reconcile. The Department does not know how many Irish children have been removed from the State as a consequence of deportations.</P>
      <P>This State, notwithstanding the wonderful rhetoric of Article 40 of the Constitution &mdash; which I was going to read, but will not, as the Minister probably knows it &mdash; has not done much about the rights of those Irish citizens, some of who are now in peculiar situations. They are Irish citizens and therefore cannot become citizens, in some cases, of the countries to which they have been returned. In some cases, it is alleged they are being denied social and health services because they are not citizens of the country to which they have been returned. The Department either does not know or will not tell us how many children are in this position. I do not know how many children have been left behind by parents who have been deported. At what stage does the State become concerned about those citizens of Ireland? Is it when the children left behind end up on the street? Is it when the children who are sent out of this country end up on the streets in the other country, or is it when they come back later and demand their rights as citizens and, as a number of people have suggested, sue the State because it abandoned them?</P>
      <P>This State has no right to abandon any citizen. I cannot reconcile the humanity of the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on the issue of the parents of Irish citizens with the practice of his Department, which clearly is to obfuscate on the issue of children being removed from this country who are citizens of the State. This is to ignore the fact that the State has obligations to its citizens, just as the citizens have to the State. It would be the ultimate irony if the State used the sanctity of the family as the issue on which to justify its non-interference, having argued successfully all the way to the Supreme Court that this very sanctity should not be allowed to guarantee the parents&rsquo; rights to stay here. It got a decision from the Supreme Court, which, to put it mildly, is difficult to reconcile with ordinary logic.</P>
      <P>I accept that without a deportation policy there could not be a policy on immigration, legal or otherwise. The reality of the serious possibility of deportation is a necessary part of the instruments of a good immigration policy. The problem is this <Col N="1630"/>country&rsquo;s priorities have focused more on that aspect of immigration rather than the other. We seem to be much more enthusiastic about getting deportation organised than about the other harsh realities of immigration. I know a practitioner of Chinese medicine, about the same age as myself, who has been living here legally for a number of years. His spouse has been living with him and has now been refused an extension of her residency visa, even though everyone knows that this man is here to make money so that he can return to the home and the property he owns in China. In this case somebody says, in effect, &ldquo;No, your wife cannot stay here with you&rdquo;. I cannot find a humane immigration policy in that. When I hear of people being told they may work here, but their spouses or children cannot join them, in this so-called welcoming country, where is the humanity in that?</P>
      <P>In terms of its demographic profile over the next 50 years, the United States will see a spectacular increase in population, just as Europe&rsquo;s is undergoing an equally spectacular decline. One of the reasons is that the United States has an enlightened immigration policy. It was interesting to watch the presidential debates in which President Bush and Senator Kerry discussed the issue of immigration. When one considers the hysteria that enters into every debate about immigration in virtually every state in the European Union, and sees the relatively solid consensus between the contenders for the US presidency on the importance of immigration, the contrast is real.</P>
      <P>Turning to more general issues, why does the Minister insist on holding on to absolute discretion, even where people meet most of the other conditions? I am concerned about the issue of Irish associations because a young man I know of Japanese origin, living here from the age of five to 20 years, was finally granted citizenship on the grounds of his Irish association. This happened, despite the fact that his parents were Japanese and they broke up. His mother stayed for a while, but the father went back. He spoke far better English than Japanese, with an impeccable Cork accent. He did not speak Japanese with a Cork accent, or at least I cannot judge that. However, it seems to me that his claim to Irish association will now be removed under this legislation. I do not know whether this was a deliberate or intended consequence of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether the current three out of four years&rsquo; rule could be changed to nine out of ten years? It is no longer a guarantee of anything. It could be nine out of ten. The citizenship requirements in respect of Britain could be changed if that was required as could the citizenship requirements in respect of the European Economic Area. In this regard, we have not just changed a detail to close a small loophole but have opened up the possibility of an enormously more restrictive immigration and citizenship policy in the future.</P>
      <P>I regret that this legislation is going through. The manner, timing and tone of some of the <Col N="1631"/>debate on the issue in the referendum was regrettable but it is a fact of life and we have to observe and respect the will of the people. That is our form of democracy and it is the correct way. However, the country is not operating in a spirit of generosity either in its immigration policy or in the way it has dealt with the children born here who are Irish citizens and their parents, some of whom have been deported. The legality of the deportation of Irish citizens is highly questionable and the apparent indifference of the Government to the conditions under which young Irish citizens live abroad is a matter of great concern and does not augur well for the general humanity of our immigration policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not delay the House for long. I welcome the Minister. I think all Members will agree he deals with these matters in a confident and efficient manner. That this legislation is going through the House has given rise to a number of queries on the general issue of citizenship and applications.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to some of us concerning the long delays in getting decisions made. There has been a considerable reduction in the delays in recent years but there is still a backlog and a delay of, perhaps, two to three years in having applications determined. A matter that has given rise to much discussion on the Bill and the changes in the law generally is whether the Minister will give some indication of what can be done to expedite decisions on applications which are dragging on for many years in some cases.</P>
      <P>There is a necessity for some amendment whether to the Bill under discussion or another Bill. It relates to applications for post-nuptial citizenship. The case in question concerns an Irish man who married in the Philippines in 1971 and is now deceased. His widow applied for post-nuptial citizenship but in order to qualify, the marriage must be in existence.</P>

If the Minister can deal with that issue I can conclude my contribution. I thank the Minister for the expeditious manner in which he is dealing with this detailed and complex legislation. I would appreciate if he could make some effort to expedite applications which are awaiting determination for many years.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1632"/>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for remaining in the House as he always does when dealing with legislation. This Bill follows from the referendum in June. While we will table some amendments on Committee Stage we support the thrust of the Bill as we supported the referendum in June. We must accept that an overwhelming number of the people supported the referendum which is a good thing and makes it easier for us, as legislators, to deal with this legislation.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that as a result of the large number who have come to live here, we have developed a more open and cosmopolitan society, certainly one that I welcome and from which the country benefits. One has only to walk down the street to see many different nationalities and to hear the different accents and languages, all of which bring colour and diversity to the nation. Within our schools it is wonderful for Irish children to mix with children from different countries. That enriches all of us; it opens our horizons and broadens our minds. It is great for young people to grow up in that atmosphere as against the closed atmosphere in which I grew up.</P>
      <P>Immigration brings with it great opportunities for Ireland. Not only does society benefit from people coming here but we rely heavily on large numbers of immigrants coming here. We are dependent on them in many sectors and must welcome them. We have an obligation to offer protection to them and, therefore, we are obliged to have proper laws in place to deal with immigration, citizenship and so on. We were taken unawares and were unprepared for the influx of immigrants and are still playing catch-up. This legislation is necessary and will help the whole process.</P>
      <P>There are a few issues I wish to highlight, which are not included in the Bill, in the overall context of dealing with our immigration laws, to which some speakers have already referred. I wish to add my voice to those concerns. More than 11,000 parents had Irish-born children prior to the Supreme Court decision. I plead with the Minister, as did my colleague, Senator Cummins, to grant an amnesty to those people as they have been in Ireland for many years and have put down their roots here. I ask the Minister to use his humanity, as displayed in his contribution today, and consider granting an amnesty to those. Whenever we hear on the airwaves that a family is being deported, the community in which that person lives pleads with him over the airwaves and, I am sure, by letter to relent and grant citizenship or residency to these people because they have become part of the fabric of the community. At this stage the Irish people would accept that many, if not all, of these people should be granted an amnesty and become full citizens of Ireland.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the numbers seeking asylum whose applications are before the Minister, something should be done to speed up the process. Given that more than 600 officials are employed <Col N="1633"/>in the special unit to deal with asylum applications, I do not understand why it takes so long to assess these applications. We must remember that we are dealing with people who are living in limbo and who are extremely concerned about their future. In the interests of everyone, something should be done to speed up the entire process because the current system is unacceptable and unfair to everyone concerned.</P>
      <P>Another issue relates to work permits. While this is not part of the Minister&rsquo;s brief, one of the problems is that immigration is covered by the different Departments, which sometimes leads to confusion. I recommend changing the work permits system whereby employers are the holders of these permits. This is not in the interests of people coming here to work who are tied to that employer. I would like employees to have greater power over their destiny while in this country.</P>
      <P>Another change I would like to support relates to people who have work permits but are not allowed to bring their family members here. We immediately think of Filipino nurses on whom we depend to keep our hospitals in operation. There are also a large number of people working in child care. I read an article over the weekend about a Filipino person who works in child care. This individual must leave her spouse and children in the Philippines and, out of necessity, come to Ireland to work and look after other people&rsquo;s children. She is not allowed to bring her own spouse and children to this country, which is an aspect we must consider. If people are allowed to work here for a number of years and accept the regulations attached to the permit, they should be allowed to bring their family with them, if that is their wish. This is an issue which should be considered.</P>
      <P>I welcome the end of the passports for sale system, which is a welcome provision in the legislation. I hope the Minister will consider the points I raised. While they are not directly included in the Bill, they involve immigration regulations. I look forward to further debates in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. I compliment the Minister on presenting the primary legislation, together with amendments, which is helpful in terms of understanding the changes being made.</P>
      <P>The legislation follows on foot of the referendum which was passed decisively earlier in the year. The Minister in his speech rightly pointed out that we have a completely different social situation from what existed previously. Much of what is being discussed here would have been entirely academic in the past in practical terms. However, the prosperity of the country has made it inviting to many people from all parts of the world to live and work here.</P>
      <P>The change in the legislation was partly necessitated by the change in the Good Friday Agreement, but only partly, because the <i>jus soli</i> aspect was included in the 1956 legislation. As someone who was heavily involved in the Good <Col N="1634"/>Friday Agreement, the precise nature of the changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution were a necessary part of the agreement. Nonetheless, some regret must be shared collectively that more weight was not attached at the time to a problem that was just beginning to emerge in regard to the knock-on effects of the change in terms of immigration. Underlying the proposed change was a pragmatic correction of what had existed and worked fairly well until then and adjusting to a more multicultural society.</P>
      <P>This aspect goes back to the 1997 Government and the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor. It has been a new challenge with which we have had to deal and there has been an element of trial and error in the response, which is inevitable. By and large, we have managed this area quite well and it is encouraging that the number of racist attacks have decreased. I commend the Department on its anti-racism media information campaign, which is important and should be continued. What is important for a reasonably relaxed society in that regard is that there should be public confidence in the immigration and asylum policy pursued by the Government. It should be considered firm, fair and humane. I do not wish to suggest that everything is perfect. While we are progressing, systems should be adjusted and refined. The principal aspect of the legislation is that it is shifting from a <i>jus soli</i> position to a <i>jus sanguinis</i> element to avoid artificial citizenship acquisition, which quite apart from its effect here is not fair to our EU partners. This is something we must bear in mind, particularly in light of the Chen case.</P>
      <P>There are two or three points I would like to raise, one of which has been referred to by other speakers. There is a certain backlog in processing these citizenship-type applications. Public representatives are approached from time to time by people who have close relationships either of an employment nature or friendship nature with people who are seeking visas either for themselves or their dependants. I hope it will be possible to staff the offices so that the backlog can be alleviated and there can be a reasonably prompt response to various applications, rather than dragging the issue out for months. It would aid efficiency if these offices were located without distraction in Tipperary town. We debated that yesterday, and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be very welcome there.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry correctly stated that one of the less satisfactory aspects of our immigration and employment permit system is lack of mobility. People from the non-EU parts of eastern Europe agree they earn good money which is much appreciated, even if it is not much above the minimum wage. Most of the people concerned are here to earn some money so that when they go home they will be on a better financial footing to start up a business or help with various matters. However, if they are unable to change their employment they become &mdash; I am not sure <Col N="1635"/>whether this is the correct term &mdash; like indentured servants of a particular employer. That is not satisfactory, even in the short term. I accept there is a need to keep track of people coming from outside of the EEA area, but I hope that aspect of the regulations will be reformed and to some extent relaxed.</P>
      <P>I strongly endorse the firm exclusion of a passports for sale scheme. I have always taken the view that while the system had certain superficial attractions in terms of bringing investment to particular places, the idea that citizenship was for sale if one had enough money left a very bad taste. I therefore very much welcome that part of the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Henry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. I also welcome the Bill because it is a practical solution to problems we did not foresee. As Senator Mansergh said, it was not the Good Friday Agreement alone that prompted the introduction of this legislation, but clearly the Good Friday Agreement required legislation and the Minister has adopted a simple and common sense approach to this.</P>
      <P>I will confine my contribution to my interest in this issue. I have listened to the debate today and to the Minister&rsquo;s words. Rather than delay matters by repeating what others have said, I will concentrate on section 10, which deals with passports for sale. The House will be aware of my interest in this and the fact that I felt so strongly about it and believed that nothing had been done to close a loophole that had been abused. The Minister has explained this very well. In the Second Stage debate on my Bill, the Minister was kind enough to give an assurance that he would address the issue in his own way in the forthcoming legislation. I thank the Minister because he has done that and has done it very efficiently and effectively.</P>
      <P>The passports for sale link was the reference in the 1956 legislation to &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;, to which the Minister referred. It is a reminder to Members of this and the other House of our responsibility as legislators to examine what could go wrong with legislation. When the 1956 legislation was being debated the loophole was identified by former Deputy Moran when he gave the example that an Arab drinking Irish whiskey in Cairo could claim to have an Irish association. Another Deputy gave the example that an Asian playing in an Irish band in New York could claim to have Irish associations. The loophole was identified in these Houses and yet the legislation was passed. There is, therefore, an onus of responsibility on us to identify possible loopholes. It should give us pause to recall that such doubts <Col N="1636"/>were not listened to on a previous occasion. It should serve as a reminder to us of what can go wrong.</P>
      <P>In 1956, the then Minister explained that &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; covered three things: first, aliens who may join the Defence Forces, second, aliens who while normally resident in Ireland for prolonged periods may not have a full year&rsquo;s continuous residence here prior to application or, third, aliens who join Irish religious orders with the intention of going abroad permanently as missionaries when ordained but who remain under the direction of the Irish branch of the order. That was the intention of the term &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; and the Minister of the day insisted that the best way to handle these was by using this term. However, it took 30 years or so to reveal that this created a loophole. The way things turned out should give us pause for thought in the future when we do our daily job here of scrutinising legislation.</P>
      <P>The passports for sale scheme came into being as a result of that loophole and continued under successive governments for nearly a decade until it was finally closed in 1998. Since then the Government has given an assurance that it would not reintroduce such a scheme, but until now the loophole that permitted the abuse to take place has been left on the Statute Book. In campaigning for the loophole to be closed off, I was not seeking to tie the hands of future parliamentarians. I wanted to ensure that any future scheme would be subject to the full rigour of scrutiny and of law. If any future government wants to introduce another passports for sale scheme it will have to amend the law the Minister has introduced here today. That will ensure that the matter will be properly discussed and not introduced by stealth as happened previously.</P>
      <P>I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill. I thank the Minister for his efforts in this area and for the manner in which he has introduced the legislation and put it together because it is easier to understand, although getting to grips with it has been convoluted. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time with me. I welcome the Minister to the House, whatever about the Bill. I do not know why so many have said they did not know this would happen. In the debate on the constitutional changes which were required following the Good Friday Agreement I warmly welcomed the fact that anyone born on the island of Ireland would retain the right to citizenship. I do not know what goes on between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children, but I know that from the early 1990s the Department of Health and Children has been told that a very large number of non-nationals were coming here late in pregnancy and delivering their children here. That was at a time when it was almost automatic for people to get the right of residency if they had a child here.</P><Col N="1637"/>
      <P>We need to be more foresighted in the future. When this House discussed the legislation for the referendum I asked what would happen to all the little Irish citizens who would be cast out onto the waters of the world when we began to deport their parents. I am extremely grateful to the Coalition Against the Deportation of Irish Children for all the information it gave us and which was put on the record by Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious issue. There is a tribunal inquiring into the abuse that happened to children in industrial schools and other institutions here. We will have something similar in years to come regarding children we deport who say they were deprived of their rights.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is going to address the general situation regarding rights to Irish citizenship because it is too opaque. One person regarding whom I have been making recommendations to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is very badly needed by the Department of Health and Children and has children who are Irish citizens. He cannot get Irish citizenship and cannot get employment here on a consultant basis because he is not an Irish citizen. It is necessary sometimes to take our own interests into account. These people must be very valuable to get as much support as they do to keep them here. We have terrible problems in the Department of Health and Children because residency and work permits do not coincide in terms of the length of time involved. There are people who were allowed residency for only six years whereas the duration of their course in the College of Surgeons is seven years and they could not stay on to take their examinations. That has been solved. However, such situations should not arise.</P>
      <P>It would be good to welcome an expansion of the genetic pool in this country as we are pretty inbred and few people have come here for a long time. While we all thought we were descended from Celts who arrived with wolfhounds and long blond hair, the department of genetics in Trinity College would tell us that most of our ancestors came from the Iberian Peninsula. Therefore, we should not worry about some genes coming from further south. To take the example of the Olympic Games, not one sprinter without west African blood won a race. We should have foresight in this regard and should perhaps begin training people from west Africa who are currently in Ireland for the 2016 games so that we can take part on a more equal basis.</P>
      <P>I wish the legislation had been left as it was. I am glad the Minister stated he will consider the position of the approximately 11,000 applicants on a case-by-case basis. If any of those who have been deported could be brought back, it should be done. Irish citizens should be brought up in Ireland if that is the will of their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and applaud his diligence in sitting through the debate. Such debates are useful because there has almost never been a proper, <Col N="1638"/>balanced debate on this issue. It is approached at all times from the extremes, making for a polarised debate. Some points need to be recorded and a certain courage needs to be shown in the approach to this issue.</P>
      <P>The reality is that the State cannot be open to all who arrive at our borders, neither can we be seen to take a hard and difficult line. One of the problems is that we have not put in place a system which expresses the humanity we feel in certain individual cases while also protecting the validity and value of Irish citizenship and residency. A poor effort has been made to explain to the people the difference between asylum seekers, economic migrants and other migrants who arrive in the country. Therefore, pressure has been put on all sides to try to exert control over the issue in regard to children born in this country. I do not accept we cannot find a way in which those children can be accepted as Irish citizens who may remain in the State and, in that sense, that their parents can remain with them. We should find some reasonable way of dealing with this issue, which is an example of the wider issues I am discussing.</P>
      <P>The other side of the argument, that of those who have opposed the Minister&rsquo;s position, has also raised questions. We need to be clear that our first responsibility and concern is for Irish citizens, our second line of responsibility is to European Union citizens and our third line of responsibility is to citizens outside the European Union. I have no difficulty in saying this. Even in an equal world, priorities must take their place.</P>
      <P>We must address this in a fair, open and reasonable manner. In all discussions I have had with refugee, immigrant or asylum groups, I have always asked which country offers best practice in terms of immigration policy. In putting that question to some of the most liberally minded people in this area, I have never received a reply that did not include Canada, New Zealand or Australia. Despite the fact that I would push the argument, particularly in the case of Australia with its camps, ships, etc., the representatives of these groups, who would seek an expansive immigration policy, would put forward that view.</P>
      <P>I took the trouble to consider the immigration policies of the three countries referred to and remember having a brief discussion with the Minister on New Zealand&rsquo;s immigration policy. Those countries take a balanced view of the economic needs of the country plus a more liberal view in regard to opening that to a wider group, before considering how they can also give an opportunity to those without any clear talent or qualification to bring with them, but who it is felt could make a contribution and live in a fair and equitable way within the country.</P>
      <P>The three countries appear to have made a better fist of this. Canada is a perfect example of a country with integrated cities, including cities such as Toronto and those in western Canada. New Zealand is also a good example, as is Australia, in the main. However, they are working <Col N="1639"/>with a type of &mdash; I hate to use this word &mdash; quota system. If the Minister was to announce a proposal such as a quota system, after suffering the initial flak which he would definitely take, many of us would be prepared to say that if this system operated in an open, fair and equitable way with which we could all live, there would be a way forward. Any argument brought to its logical conclusion would have to agree that there must be some clear method. The concomitant of this is that there would also be hard times when hard decisions would have to be taken. However, if we all bought into the system, we would all have to live with the hard decisions.</P>
      <P>My difficulty is that in dealing with these issues, some of the decisions being taken currently are too harsh and do not sit easily with me, because they do not form part of a broader context. There should be a broader context in which we would do our business and whereby we could all hold the line on issues because we would feel we were acting properly and correctly. I will deal with this concern more fully as the debate on the Bill progresses.</P>

	<P>I thank Members for participating so actively in what was an interesting debate. I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that a balance needs to be struck on this issue because the debate on it has become too polarised. As I irritate others, I am entitled on occasion to say what I find irritating in others, which in this regard is what I would call the politics of competitive compassion. Some feel they are more compassionate than others and will show this come what may.</P>

	<P>They will posture further and further towards the compassionate end of the spectrum to find whether anybody will be foolish enough to challenge their bona fides.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not a xenophobic society and has responded well to a novel situation. However, we are at times inclined to airbrush events out of our history. I think of the Jews who came to Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and established a significant community in Dublin city, where there were perhaps 5,000 Jews living until relatively recently. They participated fully in our society but it is undoubted they were at the receiving end of social discrimination which excluded them from clubs and otherwise. They were kept boxed in as a community. While I do not know the explanation for it, the decline of the Jewish community in Ireland is a matter about which we have nothing to be proud.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>They were boxed in and discriminated against.</P><Col N="1640"/>
      <P>We should look forward to the kind of society which is emerging. Let us not have ghettos and under-classes which are culturally or ethnically distinct but, instead, let us try to create a new society. We are beginning this process from a simple position. Let us not make the mistakes other societies have made in the wake of immigration.</P>
      <P>Some aspects of immigration are almost natural, namely, that there will be clannishness among immigrant groups, immigrants will tend to stick together and, in the first instance, will be at the lower end of the economic spectrum. That is the nature of migration. Let us not cod ourselves on that issue. By the same token let us remember there is a series of international precedents from which we can learn to ensure we do not make the mistakes that have done so much damage elsewhere in Europe. I am hopeful that Ireland can, with a bit of luck &mdash; the luck of the Irish &mdash; and some commitment, avoid some of the adverse effects of internal social polarisation which leads to racist thought.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I believe I have acted reasonably in all of these matters, as has the Government. If we had not enacted this legislation, the opportunity for right-wing racism to enter Irish politics would have been enormous. Our system, like most systems in the northern European political world, is wide open for people to campaign on anti-immigration issues. It is very strange that Holland, Denmark and other countries, which we would regard as bastions of liberalism, have seen the emergence of a <i>revanchist </i>right achieving quite significant parliamentary representation because of a perception that the society was somehow inadequate in its response to internal migration. Irish people should reflect on the fact that the few people who put their heads up over the parapet with the intent to exploit race in an electoral context, in the European, parliamentary and local elections, got nowhere. They did not register.</P>

	<P>That is not true. Not in my city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>One only has to look at what happened to the candidacy of Justin Barrett in the Leinster constituency to see that there is no rich seam of votes to be obtained by exploiting race or fears about immigration. That is an encouraging feature.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding what will happen now, I have indicated that we will take a common sense, decent and pragmatic approach to the numbers of people in this country who in effect arrived before the Supreme Court decision when the law was different &mdash; as perhaps were expectations &mdash; to what it will now be. It is not reasonable to think that everyone was reading the Irish reports in foreign places. We must have a decent, pragmatic approach. As time goes by it is clear <Col N="1641"/>that where children are being brought up in an Irish school, have Irish friends and so on, common humanity says that we should not then start disassembling those families, breaking them up and sending them away. Equally, I could not just have some kind of legislative amnesty. For instance, that would simply have the effect of saying to Mrs. Chen, who came to Northern Ireland to have a child, that if she is in any difficulty she can come to Ireland again, just like that. There are also many people who came to Ireland from Nigeria and have gone back with passports in their back pockets, saying to Ireland, &ldquo;Thank you, that is one in the bank&rdquo;. An amnesty would allow them to suddenly return to Ireland with their entire families, siblings and so on and announce they have now arrived by right in the European Union.</P>
      <P>I will not do something of that kind but I will address on a pragmatic basis the people who are now in a form of limbo. I will bring forward proposals to deal with their situation in a decent way. That is all we can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I must first halt the process we have been facing until recently. That is why, when this legislation is passed, one of the first steps I will take is to bring a memorandum to Government to show how we will quickly deal with all the problems left in the aftermath of this controversy and the legal development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very exemplary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Just in case people get the contrary impression, no Minister takes any pleasure in destroying someone&rsquo;s dreams, irrespective of whether people exploited the asylum system or behaved in the most proper manner. They are human beings and are entitled to have their dreams as well as the ambitions for their families and children which one would expect.</P>
      <P>I am reminded of the Swiss architect and writer, Max Frisch, who commented on Switzerland&rsquo;s <i>Gastarbeiter</i> policies, which I think are fairly typical of central Europe. He said &ldquo;<i>Wir suchten Arbeiter, und es kamen Menschen</i>&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;We sought workers but what came were people&rdquo;. That is the big problem. One can have an economic analysis of migration but one must remember that it is people who come in response to whatever situation is created for them.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with 11,000 people who had an Irish-born child before the referendum. I am not clear on how many of them are still in Ireland. Since the referendum we are dealing with some 6,000 or 7,000 people in the same situation. They involve a parent or two parents making applications to reside in Ireland. One could therefore be talking of some 17,000 people, some of them one-parent families. By the time one allows for siblings and so on being brought into the equ<Col N="1642"/>ation, perhaps siblings abroad, in Nigeria for example, one could be talking of between 25,000 and 40,000 or 50,000 people. As I said on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il debate, it will clearly be a matter of some concern whether, if a mother has a child in Ireland who is an Irish citizen, that person should remain in Ireland and also bring in her spouse or partner and perhaps her four other children which she has somewhere else in the world. One would have to make up one&rsquo;s mind about such an issue on a pragmatic basis.</P>
      <P>Likewise, if someone in Ireland has an Irish child but has been seriously misbehaving, perhaps engaging in credit card fraud, drug dealing, prostitution and so on, I will have to decide whether it is in the interests of Ireland for that person to remain in the country simply because he or she has produced an extra Irish dependant. I must have a system which will distinguish between one situation and another. It will not be a simple line across a page, but must be based on an expedited examination of each of the cases involved to see who the people are, whether they have more children outside Ireland, whether they are married or single and so on. These aspects must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the delays in dealing with immigration matters &mdash; visas, employment permits and asylum and naturalisation applications. There is significant delay across the board. However, we are now dealing with a substantial problem which engulfed a Department which was not prepared for it. We now have approximately 600 civil servants dealing with the issue and those now redeployed will use better administrative practices to deal with all of the complexities of a migration service.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Immigration and Residency Bill, to which I will quickly return, we are actively looking at the possibility of establishing a single immigration and naturalisation service for Ireland as a single agency within my Department. By definition, one of the major issues which will arise in that context is whether the employment permit or green card situation, as it might be, will be dealt with by the same agency which decides whether one comes into the country, or whether two Departments should, as at present, deal with these matters as two independent republics. That is a matter we must deal with very soon.</P>
      <P>I accept that it is a bit strange that one can get into Ireland on the basis of a work permit to work for a single employer, with one&rsquo;s subsequent status contingent on remaining in that employment. I accept that is strange but, equally, there are implications in terms of social partnership to adopting an approach based on the Australian and New Zealand models where, for example, I or another Minister decides that the country needs 12,000 more construction workers and decides to go to the international market to bring them in. There are social partnership implications to decisions of that kind.</P>
      <P>Perhaps next year we will make statutory provision for quotas along the lines of the Australian <Col N="1643"/>and New Zealand models but if we say there are 4,000 slots available for people from sub-Saharan Africa to come to live in Ireland and we get 60,000 applications, who will go through those applications fairly and work out whether a person from Malawi is more entitled to come here than a person from the Democratic Republic of Congo? Without conducting interviews, who will make a fair decision?</P>
      <P>We must think all these issues through because they are easy to talk about. I am constantly amazed by people who say there should be a simple policy and that we should establish quotas but they must look at the other side of that equation and ask who will go through 40,000 applications, as the Americans have done on occasion. They have ended up holding lotteries and saying there is no way they can deal with all the paperwork. They have randomly selected the first ten, or the first 10%. It is fair but arbitrary.</P>
      <P>Members should not imagine all these issues are easy to settle. Although they are difficult, it does not mean they should be avoided nor should complexities be minimised. There are serious issues of policy which this and the other House will have to address next year in the context of the new legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome what has been said in the House and I compliment my officials on drawing up consolidated legislation which has helped to make this a rational debate. I look forward to the Committee Stage debate and to getting the legislation through the Houses not because I am trying to rush it through, but because it allows me to address my mind to the common sense, pragmatic and decent business, which is work undone and must be addressed sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">I am glad to be here to outline the provisions of the budget to Senators and to have the opportunity to listen to the debate to come. Most Members have heard what the Minister said in the D&aacute;il and are no doubt forming their initial reactions.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1644"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>My initial reaction is that the budget is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>As an aid to that process, I will highlight some of the more pertinent points.</P>
      <P>To begin with, we must be clear what exactly it is we are about. The Government wants to continue to ensure that we protect and increase employment in the increasingly competitive environment in which we find ourselves. We must also continue to modernise our economy through major capital programmes. These objectives can be fulfilled in many ways but our aim is to distribute the fruits to all through better services and a fairer sharing of resources, while being mindful of those most vulnerable in our society, particularly those with disabilities. This budget meets those aims.</P>
      <P>Before discussing the main budgetary measures, I draw attention to the economic backdrop to the budget. As is always the case, we must be conscious of the international economic outlook because our economy is significantly influenced by what happens around the world. It would be foolish of the Government if it did not acknowledge that there are always risks to any forecast. These include such issues as future developments in the level of oil prices, the evolution of international exchange rates and the international response in terms of interest rates. We must be mindful of all these risks and act accordingly so as not to undermine the future prosperity of all. If there is no major shock from these or other international factors, the prospects for the economy over the next few years are favourable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has forecast that in the coming year the economy will grow by 4.7% in GNP terms and 5.1% in GDP terms. Employment is expected to increase by some 35,000, thus ensuring that unemployment will remain low at 4.4%. Price inflation is also expected to average 2.5%, close to the EU average. We must do the right thing and be mindful of our international competitiveness, which must be a key priority for all.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this economic view, the Minister has set a number of budgetary targets for 2005. An allocation of almost &euro;45 billion is provided for gross spending on public services, a more than 9% increase on last year. The Exchequer borrowing requirement is set at just under &euro;3 billion, or 2.3% of GNP. A general Government deficit of 0.8% of GDP and a debt ratio of 30% of GDP are set. The objective is to keep growth in spending correlated to revenues while being prudent regarding the level of debt. In this context, the Minister&rsquo;s targets are aimed at helping to contain inflationary pressures, a central theme of Government policy.</P>
      <P>Before turning to the specific measures in this budget, it is appropriate to make a few brief comments about overall tax policy. Much has been said in recent times about taxation and what the Minister should or should not do. The key principle is to ensure the burden of taxation is low <Col N="1645"/>and has a broad base, thereby ensuring the amount of revenue generated is sufficient to meet the many important social needs faced by society. This budget targets resources at the lower paid. Accordingly, the Minister has increased the employee tax credit by &euro;230. Moreover, the personal tax credit is increased by &euro;60 for single persons and &euro;120 for married couples to bring them to &euro;1,580 and &euro;3,160 per annum respectively. These improvements in the credits ensure that all those on the minimum wage are fully outside the tax net, a key commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government. As a result of the changes, more than 650,000 of the 1.9 million income earners will be exempt from paying tax on their earnings. In recognition of our inability to do so in the last two budgets, given the more difficult economic circumstances that prevailed, the standard rate income tax band is increased by &euro;1,400 per annum for all earners, together with increases for single parents and widows. This band-widening takes 52,100 taxpayers off the higher rate of tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister also made a number of changes to specific tax reliefs for the aged, the disabled and for widows. Senators will find the details set out in the budget book. A further change that will be of benefit to low paid workers is the substantial increase in the threshold for the health levy. To those who claim this Government does not care, I point to one significant fact in this area. Since 1997, the percentage of the total income tax bill paid by the lower paid has fallen from 14% to less than 6%.</P>
      <P>Senators are aware that there has been much debate in recent times concerning the role played by tax reliefs in the tax system. The Minister has sought a thorough evaluation of the effect of all relevant incentive reliefs and exemptions and asked his Department and the Revenue Commissioners to bring forward proposals that will achieve a balance between the benefit to the investor and the benefit to the common good. Senators will note with interest the Minister&rsquo;s intention to act upon such proposals and his related commitment that the termination dates for various schemes laid down previously in this year&rsquo;s Finance Act will not be changed.</P>
      <P>Tax reliefs have a role in promoting fair play. In this regard, I point to the changes made in the area of residential stamp duty. For first-time buyers of second-hand houses, there will be no stamp duty on purchases of up to &euro;317,500 in value and reduced rates on purchases up to &euro;635,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>This will result in stamp duty savings for first-time buyers of second-hand properties and is another measure targeted at the lower end of the market. Changes are also being made to rent relief to help those living in rental accommodation. These improvements will make a real difference to those concerned.</P><Col N="1646"/>
      <P>In recognition of the cost of third level education, the maximum amount of qualifying fees allowable under the scheme of tax relief for such fees paid is increased from &euro;3,175 per year to &euro;5,000 per year for the academic year 2005 to 2006.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Finance Bill 2005 will provide for stamp duty relief from the double charge arising from the switching of financial cards such as credit cards. This will facilitate greater consumer choice and improve competitiveness in the area of retail banking.</P>
      <P>Regarding indirect taxation, it is significant that the Minister has decided to make no changes to the main VAT and excise rates. This will help to maintain the low level of consumer price inflation, while also being mindful of the impact such increases in indirect taxes have on the less well off in our society. However, the budget contains an excise relief to benefit small craft breweries.</P>
      <P>In the area of social welfare, the Government continues to address the needs of the vulnerable in society. This budget demonstrates that the Government is keen to target the resources available at those most in need by announcing an additional full-year spend of &euro;874 million in welfare payments.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the full personal rate of old age and related pensions will be increased by &euro;12 per week. This means that the old age contributory pension will be &euro;179.30 per week from January 2005. The old age non-contributory pension will now be &euro;166 per week. Unemployment assistance and all other personal weekly social welfare rates will be increased by &euro;14 per week. The lowest full personal social welfare rate will now be &euro;148.80 per week as opposed to &euro;83.04 in 1997.</P>
      <P>In recent years, there have been major increases in the level of child benefit. In this regard, I am happy to see that the monthly rate for the first and second child will increase by &euro;10 to &euro;141.60. The comparable rate in 1997 was &euro;38.09. The rate for third and subsequent children will increase by &euro;12 to &euro;177.30. A range of social welfare improvements is set out in the budget summary. I highlight the increase in the family income supplement income thresholds, improvements to the maternity benefit scheme and to the support provided to carers, particularly in respite care.</P>
      <P>Citizens rightly expect that they will get value for the money expended by Government on their behalf. There has been considerable improvement in public services in recent years and this year&rsquo;s Estimates as well as today&rsquo;s budget build on this development. The Minister has already indicated that he wants Departments and offices to intensify their efforts to ensure the best possible value for money from the very significant funds being provides in the Estimates. In this regard the Department of Finance will shortly be issuing revised guidelines on the appraisal and management of capital projects to Departments. <Col N="1647"/>Work is also ongoing on changes in public sector capital project contracts to ensure that risk is transferred to those best able to manage and control it. Striving for value for money is an ongoing process.</P>
      <P>Last year the Minister for Finance announced the introduction of rolling five year multi-annual programmes for all capital investment areas. One result of that decision is that there is a carryover of funds from 2004 to 2005 of &euro;237 million. Together with the additional Exchequer capital spending announced by the Minister, this means that almost &euro;6,300 million will be available for capital spending in 2005.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to improving the infrastructure of the country, thus benefiting the quality of life of all in society. Specifically on transport, an area of great importance for the economy, I note that the 2005-2009 capital envelope includes almost &euro;10.2 billion for investment in transport infrastructure. I am pleased to inform Senators that the Minister has agreed in principle with his colleague, the Minister for Transport, that an extended capital envelope of ten years in the case of transport is appropriate and proposals on this will be put to Government shortly. This is an important initiative which I anticipate will help to improve the planning and delivery of infrastructure in this area. This proposal better reflects the needs of a modern economy.</P>
      <P>As Senators are well aware and as we debated at length last evening, decentralisation is of particular interest to me in my role as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works. During the last number of days we outlined the progress in this area, putting an end to the speculation of those who are sceptical about this important regional policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are still sceptical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been demonstrated clearly that there is substantial interest in the programme among civil and public servants and this year&rsquo;s budget contains provision for the property related costs associated with our policy on decentralisation. Considerable progress has been made and the implementation of this multi-annual plan is well on track.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that the budget contains a special focus on those with disabilities. In the limited time available to me, I will highlight a couple of the significant developments in this area. Senators will be aware that considerable information on this topic is set out in the budget book published today. In the recent Estimates process, the Minister announced an increase in resources for this area of &euro;290 million on the 2004 figure. Today, the Minister has announced a special disability multi-annual funding package with a total value of close to &euro;900 million over the years 2006 to 2009. This includes guaranteed additional current spending of almost &euro;600 million together with an allocation of &euro;300 million <Col N="1648"/>out of the revised capital envelopes. I am sure that Senators will join me in welcoming this decision. The bulk of this funding package will go towards investment in services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities and mental health services. It is to focus, in particular, on the provisions of extra residential, respite and day places, extra home support and personal assistance and extra places in community-based mental health facilities.</P>
      <P>Finally, I will highlight a number of important measures for the agricultural sector. It is important that we recognise the need for vibrant rural communities. The Estimates process has already delivered a gross Estimate provision of over &euro;1.4 billion for the Department of Agriculture and Food in 2005. In addition to the national Estimates provision, EU direct funded payments to farmers and market supports will amount to almost &euro;1.9 billion in 2005. Some of the features in the Estimates include a significant increase in funding for the rural environment protection scheme and an increase in the allocation for the farm waste management scheme.</P>
      <P>In this budget, in order to ensure the viability of a competitive farming community in our modern economy, the Minister has announced the following measures: A new stamp duty relief for exchanges of farmland between two farmers for the purpose of consolidating each farmer&rsquo;s holding will be introduced in the 2005 Finance Bill. This concession will ensure that there is no charge for two years on exchanges of farm land of the same value for consolidation purposes. At present, each farmer is liable to the full stamp duty on property he or she receives. This will be a once-off relief and will apply for a two year period. The measure should assist those in the farming sector to consolidate their holdings in a more sensible and efficient manner; the writing down period of the special tax relief scheme for expenditure on farm pollution control measures will be reduced from seven to three years. This will be of assistance to farmers to help them comply with the EU nitrates directive and is also a welcome environmental development; a provision will be included in next year&rsquo;s Finance Bill to enable farmers not already using income averaging for income tax purposes to average certain payments outstanding under FEOGA direct payments schemes in three equal instalments over the three years 2005, 2006 and 2007; the farmer&rsquo;s flat rate VAT will go up from 4.4% to 4. 8% from 1 January 2005. The rate change will ensure that unregistered farmers are compensated in full for the VAT they bear on their business inputs. There will also be a corresponding increase to 4.8% for the sale of livestock by VAT registered farmers; and finally, the 100% stock relief for young trained farmers and the general 25% for farmers are to be continued for a further two years from 1 January.</P>
      <P>I remind the House of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a fairer share of the resources for all <Col N="1649"/>in society. The budget honours this commitment in a number of respects. We have taken those on the minimum wage out of the tax net. Through the widening of the bands we have taken 52,100 taxpayers off the higher rate of tax. We have focused funding on those in most need, such as people with disabilities, and targeted expenditure on increasing social welfare rates well above inflation. We have taken an appropriate approach towards managing the economic conditions which allow for these improvements. We have taken the responsible decisions demonstrating our commitment to invest in our community at all levels.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said earlier today, the budget once again demonstrates that the well-being of this society and all of its citizens is in safe hands. I hope Senators will welcome this budget and I look forward to hearing their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He will not be surprised to learn that I am not as enthusiastic about the budget as he expects Senators to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Government Senators did not applaud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>They did not, which is surprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been applauding all afternoon. We cannot keep applauding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>They did not applaud here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome a number of the measures contained in the budget, which have been highlighted by the Minister of State. I welcome the changes in services to people with disabilities. The Minister of State referred to yesterday&rsquo;s debate in this House on decentralisation. Last year, decentralisation was the budget. I listened today to hear what its equivalent would be in this year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      <P>There are two issues over which the Government appears to be gloating. I noticed the expression on the face of the Minister of State as the Minister for Finance announced the stamp duty relief for first time house buyers. This is the first time the Government or its immediate predecessor has done anything to improve the lot of people who are buying houses. After an eight year wait, perhaps we should applaud the Government for realising there is a disastrous problem in this area. However, as Deputy Richard Bruton said in the D&aacute;il, eight years is too long to wait for change. The Government should not pat itself on the back to the extent it is. In my part of the world one would expect to pay approximately &euro;250,000 for a second hand home.</P>
      <P>The savings for someone buying such a house will be in the region of &euro;7,000, which is twice the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant that was removed by the Government some years ago in its previous attempt to do something for people trying to buy a house. If people buy a second-hand home in <Col N="1650"/>County Kilkenny they will have to renovate it and may wish to extend it, so they will end up paying significant charges as a result of development levies imposed by local authorities. Therefore, most of what the Government is providing in relief in today&rsquo;s budget on stamp duty will be gobbled up.</P>
      <P>While it is perhaps significant, optically, that the Government seems to be acknowledging the fact that there is a problem in that area, what it has done is insignificant. As Deputy Richard Bruton rightly pointed out in the Lower House, in the context of Dublin, where the average cost of second-hand homes is greater than the exemption limit, it will have a much more negligible impact than elsewhere. The Government has acknowledged the difficulty so I will give it a star, albeit for slow learning in that area.</P>
      <P>The other budgetary provision in which Government Members in the D&aacute;il appeared to take particular pleasure was the removal from the tax net of those on the minimum wage. As Deputy Richard Bruton correctly pointed out, however, this is another con job because in the middle of next year they will be back in the tax net when the minimum wage is increased again. While visually it looks fantastic that these people have been removed from the tax net &mdash; we all agree they should be &mdash; in a few months they will be back in the net, so what was achieved today will count for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not be completely for nothing but it will not achieve the objectives the Government is trying to portray it as having accomplished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They will have to get their rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>No reference was made in today&rsquo;s budget to those people who continue to pay no income tax. The time has now come for the Minister for Finance &mdash; I would be interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It was mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it was mentioned, although I did not see it. Nothing has been done, however, to redress the balance to deal with those who continuously get away with not paying any income tax. Under this budget they will continue to do so. It is wrong and I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on the issue.</P>
      <P>Reference was made in the Lower House to the changes made last year by the previous Minister for Social and Family Affairs, and the failure of today&rsquo;s Budget Statement to make any significant reversal to the miserly cuts in last year&rsquo;s budget. It is noteworthy that the Minister did not seek to reverse the decisions made last year. In most cases, we are talking about small amounts of money that would deliver meaningful benefits for people on the margins of society.</P><Col N="1651"/>
      <P>We heard much from the Minister for Finance today and I suspect that we will hear a lot from Government Senators about the new caring, sharing Government. If they want the Government to be caring and sharing, however, they should have done something to reverse last year&rsquo;s cutbacks.</P>
      <P>Of particular interest to me and other Members is the area of special educational needs. I was disappointed the Minister did not use the largesse at his disposal to make a significant announcement in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He did so in the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Schools throughout the country have problems in getting special needs assistants for those children who require them. There was nothing in today&rsquo;s Budget Statement to offer any hope for families whose children require special educational needs.</P>
      <P>Child care is referred to every time we discuss the economy. I do not know if the Minister mentioned it in passing but he certainly did not deliver any reform in that area. Given the opportunity he had today, I am disappointed that he did not do anything in that regard.</P>
      <P>In fluffy language from the Department &mdash; such as we heard about decentralisation yesterday &mdash; the Minister announced he will implement a review of tax relief schemes. I remain to be convinced, however, that there will be any significant change in many of the current schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Fortunately, the Senator will shortly be in a position to find out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of those tax relief schemes have served their purpose at this stage. We have heard woolly talk before from the Minister, Deputy Cowen, about initiating a review. I was hoping that some significant changes would be announced in that regard today. We heard nothing either about any reduction in stealth charges that were imposed last year, such as increases in bank charges and the cost of passports. Such increases were announced across the board last year as a way of sneaking an extra couple of million euro here and there to help balance the books. I am happy the Minister did not use his Budget Statement to increase stealth charges further but he could have used the opportunity presented to him today to reduce them.</P>
      <P>I was amused by the Minister of State&rsquo;s reference to micro-breweries. I do not see any reason behind today&rsquo;s budgetary proposals on micro-breweries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is to encourage competition in the brewing trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it to promote competition? Most people would acknowledge that we have a drink problem in this country. For the Minister for Finance to promote the idea of competition <Col N="1652"/>in the brewing industry &mdash; he used that sentence in his Budget Statement &mdash; was shocking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely we are allowed to have a drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think we need more competition in the brewing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The next thing the Senator will be talking about is rip-off Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are lots of areas in which we need more competition but there is already significant competition in the brewing industry. The Minister should not have referred to it today and neither should the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the poor cereal growers in the Senator&rsquo;s constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>No mention was made in today&rsquo;s Budget Statement of beleaguered motorists. There was a reference to hybrid engines getting special treatment for VRT. However, given the fuel and road tax increases we have seen in the past few budgets, something tangible should have been provided for motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s time is up. He should conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want to register my disappointment that there was no apparent reference to justice matters, including the extra 2,000 garda&iacute; we were promised. Justice was not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That was provided for in the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of extra funding for new justice initiatives was not even mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has exceeded his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the whole, while there are many positive aspects to the budget, I have not seen anything of significance in it. The Minister has tried to provide a little bit for most people but he has not concentrated his fire on specific areas. He should have done so and I am disappointed he did not take that opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The sign of the strength of the economy is that it is now growing again at 5%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a strong financial position with general Government borrowing at 0.8% of GDP. The EBR is 2.3% of GNP but the difference is accounted for by the money put aside for pensions. We have average inflation of 2.5% and it is important that we maintain that level. Employment is to rise by a further 35,000. The 9% increase in expenditure is at the upper limit of what is prudent and at the upper limit of expectations.</P>
      <P>If I have one criticism of the budget arithmetic it would be the same as my criticism this time last year and I was proved right far beyond even my expectations. The revenue projections for 2005 show an increase of 5%, which I find incredible. If all the worst case scenarios mentioned in the Minister&rsquo;s budget speech come to pass, that might be a credible figure. Revenue for this year was &euro;2.3 billion more than anticipated. No doubt the defence for that is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has not taken into account the stealth taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senator Bannon does not cease interrupting I will ask him to leave the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The other aspect indicating a strong economy is the social welfare package of &euro;874 million and the tax package of &euro;682 million <Col N="1654"/>which comes to between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;1.6 billion. To be able deliver such a package is a sign of how well the economy is now going again. We have come through two difficult years with our basic economic strength intact.</P>
      <P>From a strategic point of view, while the details have not yet been fully announced, the &euro;6.3 billion for capital investment, representing a 20% increase on what will be spent this year, is important. The IMF identified such investment as a strategic need for the economy at this stage. It will go into the areas of transport, health and environment, which will see increases of &euro;140 million, &euro;40 million and &euro;60 million, respectively. The Minister referred to the &euro;70 million that has been put aside for decentralisation and which was debated here yesterday. I am glad the Minister has confirmed that is motoring ahead and people around the country will also be pleased.</P>
      <P>The next significant aspect of the budget is the social package. Old age pensions have increased by 7%, or &euro;12 per week, which is well on track to achieving the target of &euro;200 per week by 2007. Significantly, an even greater increase has been given to the lowest rates of social welfare payments, for example, a 10% increase in unemployment assistance. Child benefit will again increase by a substantial amount. I accept the criticism that can be made that this increase will not quite achieve the targets. However, it is more than &euro;100 per month more than it was in 1997, which represents an incredible increase in that period. In the coming year many people, including the social partners, will debate whether the rationale for the freeze on child dependant allowance, made by the rainbow coalition which felt that was creating a poverty trap, is still valid.</P>
      <P>The most important and significant aspect of the budget is the &euro;2.8 billion spending on disability and a multi-annual programme of investment in the health services, education, employment support, adapting accommodation and providing 800 residential places. This is being expanded as fast as we are realistically able to do. A major emphasis has been placed on this area, which is very welcome. As a society we are deficient in what we are doing in that regard. We have a long way to go and we need to take quite large steps from here on in.</P>
      <P>I welcome the tax measures in the budget. This is probably the first budget in which no tax increases of any kind have been made. While the employee PRSI ceiling has been raised, PRSI is not strictly taxation as it is a social welfare contribution. For the sake of competitiveness and to keep inflation down it was important not to increase taxation. To remove those on the minimum wage from the tax net is a major achievement and was rightly applauded in the D&aacute;il. The Minister was faced with two possible choices of priorities. He could either have done as he did or provide full indexation of the tax bands back to 2002. I have no doubt that the Government made the right choice and it can do more on the tax bands next year. If some people now on the mini<Col N="1655"/>mum wage fall back into the tax net again in a few months time, further corrections can be made. The principle has now been established that those on the minimum wage will not and should not be in the tax net.</P>
      <P>The widening of the band represents significant progress. In the limited coverage I have heard since the Minister&rsquo;s speech, this has been welcomed by employers. This is part of the thinking behind several social partnership agreements. The feeling is that the combination of tax relief and the agreed wage rises will reduce pressure on employers. This is a good budget for business and farming partly for that reason. The 0.5% reduction in stamp duty has also been welcomed.</P>

The stamp duty changes for first-time buyers of second-hand houses have long been sought and will be welcomed by many first-time purchasers. The changes in rent relief will also benefit many young people.</P>
      <P>We are all very pleased with the budget. It is a real sign of resumed progress and will also underpin further progress.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>To put down my markers on this matter, leaving home this morning I said that if the Minister took the minimum-waged out of the tax net, gave &euro;20 to the old-age pensioners and made some gesture in the area of disability, I would welcome the budget. He has certainly achieved two out of three of those targets. In general I welcome the budget. It would be incorrect to do otherwise just for political reasons. For the first time those on the minimum wage have been removed from the tax net, a move I have called for repeatedly in the last five years. The increase in the threshold for stamp duty for first-time buyers of second-hand houses is a positive gesture that should be welcomed and acknowledged as creative and important. If the package of disability measures works as well as is intended, I <Col N="1656"/>will welcome it. I was particularly impressed by the Minister&rsquo;s passion when talking about disability and removing people from mental hospitals. I trust someone until I find otherwise so I congratulate the Minister on giving these issues high priority.</P>
      <P>I asked earlier if there will be any votes in the D&aacute;il tonight because there were no excise duty or tax increases. Normally on budget night, the bells are ringing all night.</P>
      <P>Those are the positive aspects of the budget. I would, however, question the Minister&rsquo;s passing reference to everyone making an appropriate contribution and the statement that he would look at this area. As Senator Phelan pointed out, he let some people off the hook. It would have taken one line, which could still be included in the Finance Bill, and I ask the Minister of State to arrange this. This is not about money but about how we perceive the taxation system. Everyone should pay a minimum amount. I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s point that all these tax reliefs are not for the seriously wealthy. J. P. McManus and Denis O&rsquo;Brien do not have houses in Courtown and Westport but we do not need some of these schemes anymore.</P>
      <P>There was no excuse for not introducing a measure to catch everyone in the tax net. When I talk about percentages of people paying tax at various levels, I am talking about a percentage of the number of people earning an income. That is the only fair way to do it, particularly when we are taking people out of the tax net. Now, approximately 600,000 people will not pay tax, 600,000 people will pay at the standard rate and 600,00 will pay at the higher rate. It is wrong that 50% of taxpayers pay at the higher rate. The ratio should be 2:1, with only half as many paying the higher rate as pay the standard rate.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the old age pensioners did not get &euro;20 and that the stamp duty on bank and credit cards was not abolished. Also, I cannot see why microbreweries got a special mention. There was no need for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I frequently find myself in the awkward position of supporting budgets introduced by the Government and then listening to speeches by Senator Mansergh and doubting my judgment.</P>
      <P>Only an idiot or someone who has a political axe to grind could oppose this budget. It is obviously a deliberate, calculated and perhaps humane effort to reposition the Government by giving away money. Luckily for Fianna F&aacute;il, the Government is in a position to do so.</P>
      <P>The only quibble with the budget is where the money was given because no one can say he disapproves of what the Government did for people with disabilities or old age pensioners. All of these things are laudable and Senator John Paul Phelan or Deputy Richard Bruton or any of the people who opposed this budget would die to be able to do what the Government did today. That is the truth. If we lived in an honest world, we <Col N="1657"/>would all welcome this budget and say it was good. We might prefer if the Government did one or two other things but it is good overall and credit is due to the Government for building the economy so this can be done. It should be applauded for bringing the economy to such a stage, as should the former Minister for Finance whose management allowed his successor, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to give away such an incredible amount of money.</P>
      <P>It does not make matters easy for the Opposition but it is a budget few of us can realistically oppose. I would prefer to have seen certain commitments. The era of tax reform and radical thinking in the area is over. We will now have a series of budgets geared towards an election. That is the natural political instinct and we will see a steady as she goes series of budgets plugging the gaps referred to by Deputy Richard Bruton.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the Government did not take the opportunity to tackle tax incentives. I do not accept the explanation of the Minister that all these things are to be examined and we will look at them next year. Some of these, particularly the stallion industry, regardless of the results of the examination that has already been going on for a year, should on principle be taxed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity the Minister did not tackle these incentives head-on instead of falling back on the idea of a review. That is a fudge. In general, however, it would be churlish to dismiss or oppose this budget. On the whole it has done good things that the economy can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many good aspects to the budget but I will concentrate on the widening of the standard band of income tax. A recent election manifesto claimed that the aim was to have 80% of taxpayers pay at the standard rate. To the best of my knowledge 37% are still paying at the top rate. The pressure on the wage rates in Ireland comes about because people jump from 20% to 50% at the top rate when PRSI is included. That is also a huge disincentive for people to work overtime.</P>
      <P>The answer is to introduce an intermediary tax band at 30% but we have lost the opportunity to do that. If that was in place, people would not <Col N="1658"/>jump from 20% to 50% in one go. Two major stresses on the economy are that this is an expensive State because of our wage rates and the cost of living. The jump in the tax rates from a low to a very high rate is one reason for the increase in wage rates. We could do something about that and it would take the pressure off inflation, a challenge the Minister mentioned.</P>
      <P>Capital expenditure on infrastructure deserves the money that has been put into it. The Minister spoke about value for money. Last week I said in this House that we should not measure the amount of money we spend, we should look for value for money.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister speaking today but I did not see any action. There must be action on the tax bands to avoid people jumping from 20% to 50% tax rates; we must reduce costs and wage rates and secure value for money. If we can take those actions and add them to the good aspects of the budget, it will be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I was explaining to Senator Norris that if he came to this side of the House he would get his full ten minutes. He has not accepted that invitation, obviously.</P>
      <P>I welcome the budget and will seek to put it in an overall context before discussing its detail. It is within the overall context that I find most to celebrate. What is being done in the area of disability, social welfare and the more needy in society in terms of the old age pension and so on is very much to be welcomed, particularly the fact that those increases are well in excess of the predicted level of inflation. The main achievement, however, is that the economic ship that has been so well steered by Deputy McCreevy when he was Minister for Finance, continues in the same direction under the Minister, Deputy Cowen. As the Minister explained in his concluding remarks, it required balanced, consistent policy, fairness in the distribution of resources and efficiency in the delivery of public services. That summarises well what the budget is doing and what the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has done.</P>
      <P>If we were to increase public spending by an enormous amount, and not to control it, allowing inflation to run rampant, all the achievements that have been gained over several years would have been lost. There is a significant figure here, namely, the relationship between gross domestic product, GDP, and gross national product, GNP. The figures for this year are for GDP to increase by 5.3% and GNP by 4.9% compared to 2001 where GDP increased by 6% and GNP by 3.8%. The significance of that is that the Irish domestic economy is contributing to the engine of growth, whereas previously external investment was the main growth contributor. Those figures are singularly gratifying and something I believe both the previous and current Ministers for Finance can take a great deal of satisfaction from, as indeed can the entire Government.</P>
      <P>That overall economic governance has allowed resources to be allocated to the areas most in <Col N="1659"/>need. I reject the proposition that this is a repositioning. If one looks at the figures in terms of increases in social welfare, the old age pension and children&rsquo;s allowances over the lifetime of this and the previous Government, one sees that this trend has been consistent right from the start. One figure demonstrates that point while there are many others in the budget which support it. In 1997, a family with two children got &euro;672 per year in children&rsquo;s allowances and now it gets &euro;3,400. The same is true of old age pensions. It means the targets that were set under An Agreed Programme for Government can be met. We are well on the way to achieving those targets. I accept some of the caveats Senator Mansergh outlined with regard to the levels, particularly regarding the old age pension. I accept that point, but we are well on the way to achieving the targets provided overall governance maintains its steady course.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his concluding remarks summarised well what the budget was about. It radically improves the funding for the delivery of services for the disabled and increases social welfare rates by well above the rate of inflation. It frees those on the minimum wage from income tax. It seeks to reinforce the equity of the tax system, through the plan to reform, which he outlined. It keeps inflation low to help those on lower incomes and that is a key point. Everything can be lost if inflation increases and the Government contributes to inflation.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said the budget enhanced capital spending to improve the public services. He made a point earlier in his speech, which I regard as important, when he said we should not be shy about our achievements. Those of us who are on the Joint Committee on European Affairs were in Turkey the week before last. Countries much larger and much more powerful than Ireland are still fascinated as to how this economic miracle was achieved. That is something to celebrate, irrespective of what party one belongs to, that Ireland plc is being held up as a model to the world.</P>
      <P>We saw what the economists had to say about us when previously they were talking about the &ldquo;sick man of Europe&rdquo; and the fact that the International Monetary Fund would have to intervene and take over. There has been a radical change which has transformed our self-esteem, the vision of our place in the world and which has taken us out from under the shadow of the power across the water. At least now we have a global view. We look to Europe and beyond, and have a self-confidence which my generation thought we would never see. We argued for it back in the 1960s and had particular difficulty in convincing people that we would ever achieve that transformation.</P>
      <P>The economy will grow by 4.7% in GNP terms and by 5.1% &mdash; although the table says 5.3% &mdash; in terms of GDP. Employment will grow by 35,000, so there is still the requirement for people <Col N="1660"/>to come in and help this economy. Unemployment will remain low at 4.4% and price inflation will come in at 2.5%, which is close to the EU average. There is much to be grateful for and much to celebrate. The Minister said our economic growth rate was more than twice the average in the European Economic Area. The rate of spending increase in 2005 is three times the European average. The rate of public investment, at nearly 5% of GNP, is almost twice the EU average, our unemployment rate is half the average and our debt burden is among the lowest in the European Union. These are among the positive indicators in the budget.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister had to say about the review of the sheltered tax areas. While there are wealthy people who avoid tax, many of them are doing it by being non-resident. I do not approve of that. I believe if one is a patriot, one should pay tax to the country in which one is born.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Nevertheless, if that vehicle is available to people I cannot see it being closed off in terms of double taxation treaties and so on. Perhaps it may be closed and, if so, well and good, but I do not know how it can be done. Some of the rhetoric on this issue is wide of the mark. However, there is a commitment in the tables with regard to the review. It says the Minister for Finance will consider the outcome of this work and bring forward proposals for the 2006 budget next December. So it is not a review that will go on indefinitely. There is a commitment as to when the results will be available and as to the measures to be taken. Apart from the lack of value for some of those schemes, there is a general desire on everybody&rsquo;s part to at least have coherence with some system in place rather than the &ldquo;ad hocery&rdquo; which has characterised matters in the past.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions on agriculture, particularly with regard to stamp duty relief on consolidation. That is an important matter, which has been discussed already. I come back to a point raised by Senator Quinn regarding value for money. There is no spotlight on the Departments themselves, however, and how they spend their money. It is not a question of how the money is allocated to the people in receipt of payments, in terms of social welfare, but how the Departments are themselves administered. A strategic management initiative, SMI, existed and made some positive achievements in terms of the delivery of public services. However, a great deal of work has still to be done in terms of what goes on within Departments and how money is being wasted, as I believe it is at times.</P>
      <P>The provisions regarding disability are something for which we can be grateful to the Minister. Since I came into this House, some time ago, I have argued every year for increases in the moneys devoted to disabilities. I believe the Mini<Col N="1661"/>ster has done that in a unique manner. The increases are of a completely different order to anything that has been experienced before and that is to be welcomed, particularly with regard to respite care. A great deal needs to be done to at least give people some relief from the burden of having to look after, on a daily basis, members of their families who are disabled. Resources are finite, but &euro;682 million is being given in tax allowances.</P>
      <P>The initiative with regard to the minimum wage is particularly welcome with 650,000 people being affected. There are another 874,000 people on social welfare, in addition to disability benefit.</P>
      <P>The initiative with regard to the minimum wage is particularly welcome with 650,000 people being affected. There are another 874,000 people on social welfare, in addition to disability benefit.</P>
      <P>That major resources are being devoted to these areas is welcome. I could speak at length on these matters but overall the budget is a good one and we are back on target to achieving the commitments set out in An Agreed Programme for Government. I look forward to those being delivered over the next several budgets of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Senator McCarthy, may be here to share time. Having listened to the members of the Government side one would think we were living in Utopia. There is no doubt the position has improved enormously in recent years, through the combined effort of all partners. I agree with Senator Dardis when he refers to the other members of the European Union and particularly the new member states who ask how we did it. We know how we did it and we have come a long way.</P>
      <P>However, the fact is there are glaring inequities in society which we could tackle but which the Government chooses not to tackle. I welcome the additional funding provided in the area of disability, in particular. How long have people waited for it? It is long overdue. There are other issues which are long overdue for assistance and for which the Government could do something.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>On Monday a lady visited my office in a state of considerable distress. She and her husband are pensioners in their late sixties and their pension is their only income. They have returned from England. Their son is 22 years of age and they decided to support him in going back to college. He receives no grant and they are unable to support him. He has attempted to live on very little while attending college in Cork. She told me they had arrived at a position where they simply could not afford to support him in college any more and he will probably be forced to give it up. That is the reality for a person in Ireland today who is not living in Utopia. For all the advice I could give, the amount she could get amounted to very little because of the system and the fact that he is a mature student. That he remained in employment <Col N="1662"/>until September means he does not qualify for support.</P>
      <P>According to the lady, an official public servant informed him that he should have given up work six months previously in order to qualify. That is indicative of the quirks in the system. If he had been unemployed for six months he would qualify for support but he chose not to be unemployed because he wished to support his parents who were pensioners. They want to give him the support he needs in college but they cannot afford it. The cost of living, particularly bills, is so high it is eating into their income and any savings they may have.</P>
      <P>This is an extraordinary state of affairs in terms of the kind of country we think we live in versus the reality for some people. Many of them have high medical bills and do not qualify for a medical card. In the recently announced Estimates hospital charges were increased. This is the reality. A two-tier medical card has been introduced and fewer are getting the kind of support to which they would have been entitled. The medical card scheme has been steadily eroded while stealth taxes have increased. The Estimates and this budget show no sign of dealing with that issue. While I welcome the increased investment and increased spending, particularly in the area of disability, it is long overdue.</P>
      <P>An indication of the kind of country we are is evident from how the Government chooses to spend the country&rsquo;s wealth and there are many examples. I shall deal the area of child care on which I have done some research recently. According to a survey from the Central Statistics Office carried out less than two years ago and published last year, over 42% of all families with pre-school children rely on non-parental care to mind their children. A large number of working parents rely on unpaid relatives to care for their children. The number who pay a carer, relative, cr&egrave;che or Montessori school to care for their children on a full-time basis has reached a high figure compared to what it was in the past. Some 50% of women of child rearing years are in the workforce. It is great that people have that choice. On the issue of pre-school children, including babies, 20,000 families pay a carer, 15,500 pay cr&egrave;che and Montessori fees and 8,000 pay a relative. According to the survey 23,000 have a relative who is not paid to care for their child. The cost of child care is so high that it is becoming a disincentive for couples to have large families and to remain in the workforce.</P>
      <P>I am aware from anecdotal evidence that the cost of child care in Dublin is approximately &euro;150 per week. If one has two children the cost may not be &euro;300 because of economies of scale and so on but it is a considerable amount of money. If one has a third child, one of whom is school-going, and the two younger children are in a cr&egrave;che, the amount one has to pay for child care is prohibitive. There is evidence, particularly after the birth of a third child, that one parent, usually the mother, opts to stay at home.</P><Col N="1663"/>
      <P>On the European league table Ireland ranks lowest in terms of support for working parents. Not only that, we have yet to look at how we might invest in a programme of pre-school education. The voluntary sector, the nurseries and the Montessori groups, have provided great leadership in this area and there are many good quality pre-school arrangements in place. However, State support does not exist except in some pockets of disadvantage. A report by the National Competitiveness Council entitled the Competitiveness Challenge 2004, in a section dealing with pre-primary initiatives, refers to pre-primary education and the importance of investment. It refers to how governments across the world have developed pre-primary policies that stimulate early childhood development and the importance of it. It states: &ldquo;There is strong evidence, therefore, that targeted pre-primary interventions could help to address educational disadvantage in Ireland, and in particular help to lower the still unacceptably high drop-out rate from secondary level education in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In fact, the drop-out level is 18.2% and has remained at that level despite improved economic performance and an improved standard of living and so on. The experts would say we have a stubborn problem in regard to school drop-out levels particularly in teenage years which is not being addressed. One of the reasons is that the origin of the problem is not at second level but at pre-school level, as the Leader will be aware.</P>
      <P>The report further states:</P>
      <P LI="1">While the merits of such interventions [that is, pre-primary interventions] have already been considered in Ireland from a social policy perspective, their potential long term competitiveness benefits have not received much attention. As knowledge becomes the basis for competition, education is increasingly important to economic performance.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I put it to the Minister that our failure to invest in pre-primary initiatives is having and will have a detrimental effect on our ability to compete. This is not my opinion, it is the opinion of the National Competitiveness Council. The report goes on to state:</P>
      <P LI="1">As knowledge becomes the basis for competition, education is increasingly important to economic performance. The 18.2% of students currently not completing secondary level education represent an untapped resource for the economy. They represent a decrease in the average productivity of our workforce. Furthermore, our innovative and entrepreneurial ability as a nation is below its potential as the educated proportion of the workforce, from which the majority of ideas and business start-ups flow, is not maximised. It is imperative that we increase the numbers of our citizens that can participate fully in the knowledge economy.</P><Col N="1664"/>
      <P FLI="0">This is a plea from the competitiveness council to invest in pre-primary initiatives. Given that we have a world class economy, or so we are told, why do we not have a world class pre-school education system? We place very high value on our primary school system. Everyone agrees this should be the case because we all want our children to get the best possible primary education. While we know the importance of pre-school education, it continues to be ignored to our cost. The words &ldquo;child care&rdquo; did not appear in today&rsquo;s Budget Statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Budget Statement. The correct note was struck by Senator Ross who said it would be difficult for anyone to say anything against the budget, and people will have to swallow hard. This is difficult because I recall spending 1982 to 1987 in opposition when I thought the Government would never be dislodged. However, politics has a way of turning itself on its head from time to time.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on record that we would not be in this expansive period of financial improvement today but for the decisions taken by the previous Minister for Finance in the years leading up to this budget. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, began his speech by stating this clearly. We can talk it up, talk it down and talk around it but it is a very good budget. I thought I would have an easy time during this five years because I would not have much constituency work. However, the work has begun to pile up as a result of young couples trying to buy houses. It is extremely difficult for them to purchase a second-hand house. As a result of the budget proposals, stamp duty will not apply to first-time buyers of second-hand houses up to &euro;317,000 in value. This will be of significant benefit to people trying to buy a house in towns throughout Ireland. It is a very helpful measure. I did not think the exemption would be included in this budget, but more work will need to be done in this area next year.</P>
      <P>Significant provision has been made in the budget for the disabled and people who are intellectually challenged &mdash; the words keep changing and one must get them right. Whoever is in Government &mdash; I hope it will be Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; in the period 2006-09 will find this will not change because the spend for the period has been set out. Much of the credit for improving the measures relating to people with disabilities goes to the Minister of State here tonight. He has taken a great interest in this area. Equally, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, spoke passionately in the House today on the issue. Difficult as it was, his time as Minister for Health and Children helped in this regard. He jokingly refers to it from time to time as his time in Angola. This is because of the constant strife that goes on in that country.</P>

The Cabinet&rsquo;s determination to be inclusive shines through in this document. We can joke about Fr. Healy and talk about Inchydoney. I have not seen Fr. Healy on television so I am not aware of what he has been saying, but there is no doubt we will hear from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed we will for instalment number two. The Senator did not tell me they were coming to Athlone, which was very mean. I would have been out blowing a trumpet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The people of Athlone are always blowing their trumpets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Part of Athlone is in County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I know. Fr. Healy will be pleased with the budget. He may have to say a prayer tonight so that he will praise the budget tomorrow. He cannot but be pleased at what has happened.</P>
      <P>I was pleased with the mini agricultural package. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, had a hand in it because he has not forgotten where he came from. It is a good package which will help young farmers in particular.</P>
      <P>I am sure the aspect which will be highlighted is taking those on the minimum wage out of the tax net. Senator John Paul Phelan made a point which I hope the Minister will answer. He said that these people will be out of the tax net in the middle of the year or following the next review of the minimum wage, and when their wages increase, they will go back into the tax net. I do not think it is as tightly honed as that. I am sure there will be some flexibility involved.</P>
      <P>I will be honest and say that I agree with many of the points made by Senator O&rsquo;Meara about child care. I know that Senator White feels the same way because she put a significant amount of work into a document which she brought to our parliamentary party meeting. I did not speak on the document but I seconded it. My two sons have very young families, and one is expecting his second child next week. One parent will have to stay home from work because they cannot afford the cost of child care. The Senator said that child care costs &euro;150 a week but it costs much more. I was amazed at that figure. My son is paying &euro;800 a month for one child and they will not be able to afford to pay for a second child. One parent must decide to stay at home. Both of them need their salaries, otherwise they will not be able to sustain a comfortable standard of living. It is a major dilemma and they have nobody in their immediate family to take over.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no notion of doing so. Senator Bannon&rsquo;s remark is sexist and indicative of how far his mind has or has not developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a derogatory remark as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did Senator Bannon make such a suggestion to me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have every reason to believe the Government is developing its thoughts on child care and there could yet be some measures in the Finance Bill. I do not know that for certain. I am only guessing. This is an important issue for people aged between 25 and 40 years and it is certainly prohibiting them from having any more children. If they have one child at school and two in a cr&egrave;che, there is still all the time after school. School ends at 2 p.m. and a regime of child-minding must be put into action.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being here. I particularly applaud the budget. It makes very fine provision for disability, for those who are really at the edge. When one thinks about that and then about the difficulties of child care, people can scrimp and save and somehow provide for it, but they cannot do anything about it if there is a disabled person in their household. Something had to be done about that and the Government has now put in place a definite programme of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O&rsquo;Malley, to the House to take this debate. With the guillotine looming and the sound of anger echoing through the country the Government has been forced to recognise the wrath of the people and is seeking to appease them in this budget with attempts to reach out to voters who rejected the coalition Government in the local and European Parliament elections. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is attempting to bury the McCreevy image. However, in terms of the reality of people&rsquo;s lives, he has not succeeded.</P>
      <P>For the past seven years this Government has ignored the marginalised, the poor, the ill, the disabled, the elderly and carers. Something we expected in today&rsquo;s budget was the abolition of the means test for carers. That has not happened. The voices of these people were heard loud and clear in last June&rsquo;s elections. The results for Fianna F&aacute;il were the worst ever in a local election since 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>For what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The PDs were too cowardly to put forward candidates in the European Parliament election, despite having always portrayed itself as <Col N="1667"/>a pro-Europe party. Now appeasement by the Government parties is under way. That appeasement seeks to balance the scales which have been weighted towards the wealthy in the form of dozens of tax breaks. This has led to the perception that this Government is one that favours the rich. It certainly does not favour the vulnerable in society. There are several sectors, for example, the sick and the elderly, that are not properly looked after in this budget. However, a softly, softly approach is evident, with the next two very important years of canvassing in mind. Senator Mansergh mentioned that there will be greater surpluses than anticipated in today&rsquo;s budget. I believe this money will be targeted at voter-sensitive areas.</P>
      <P>This budget is a well organised attempt to promote the much trumpeted new caring face of Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs and the newly discovered socialism of the Taoiseach, both of which ring hollow. To paraphrase that well-known saying, beware of Greeks bearing gifts &mdash; we are today wary of the newly converted Government evident in this budget, which has proved to be mostly empty words disguising an unpalatable reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is saying the Government is bearing gifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year we were told much about what would be done and the budget was applauded. However, the truth came out and the Minister who introduced last year&rsquo;s budget has been got rid of. Sooner, rather than later, the Government will suffer the same fate at the hands of the electorate.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, would like us to believe he is bearing gifts in budget 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was Senator Bannon who raised the question of Greeks bearing gifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>However, this budget is far from a giveaway and the tight purse strings across a full range of Government spending is concealed beneath the whole facade. There is evidence of this in several areas. Far be it from me to suggest that the Minister for Finance is finding the Department of Finance to be foreign territory, but it is essential that he recognises that our economy is entering another period of rapid growth and the mistakes of his predecessor must not be repeated. Last year&rsquo;s budget relied heavily for its impact on the announcement of decentralisation, another pre-election promise which hit the dust last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not hit the dust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue was discussed here last night, almost a year ago to the day. It was doomed to failure and has proved to be just what it was, an empty promise.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1668"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>How could it be when 3,500 people are moving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Those triumphal reforms will not do much good for those most affected. It is incredible that the plans for decentralisation were first mooted prior to the local elections in 1999 and that in the run-up to the last general election they were part of An Agreed Programme for Government to be delivered by 2002. Prior to last year&rsquo;s local elections it was announced yet again with much fanfare in the budget. It must go down in history, and I said this last night, as the most promised broken promise. The electorate, however, is waiting in the wings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want decentralisation or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to give the verdict it gave to the Government last June in the local and European Parliament elections. If our economy is once again entering a period of prosperity, dubbed &ldquo;tiger II&rdquo;, the resources the Minister will have at his disposal are a direct result of the effort and industry of the people. That must not be forgotten. We should not applaud politicians all the time. We must applaud the people who worked hard to make our economy work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the Minister said today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The people are watching their hard-earned money and the Government is accountable to them. We will be keeping an eye on it over the next two years of this Government&rsquo;s term of office; I do not believe it will last even two years.</P>
      <P>A false loosening of the purse strings will fool no one. The apparent pre-budget increases of &euro;2.5 billion shrink dramatically to &euro;1.5 billion when automatic pay rises for public servants are deducted, a figure hardly likely to make much difference to public services. The Government has cut funding to local authorities yet again. It has opened the floodgates to higher local charges and this will be evident over the next couple of months. When councils strike the rates there will be higher business rates and a worrying deterioration in local public services. Once again we will see crippling, unfair stealth taxes in higher charges to householders and higher charges for local businesses. As always these charges will hit the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society. However, as is manifestly obvious, this Government simply does not care.</P>
      <P>The increase in the permitted local authority expenditure is a meagre 1% but the local authority pay bill would necessitate an increase of approximately 3%. The allocation will not even cover inflation. With 11,393 applications for disabled person&rsquo;s grants received in July this year, some &euro;60.94 million would be needed if 10,000 were to receive the grant at the same average cost <Col N="1669"/>as last year, yet the Minister allocated a mere &euro;52 million in the Estimates. Likewise, funding for the task force on special housing aid for the elderly is hardly enough to cover inflation. The allocation of &euro;348,000 will only cover 116 grants for the installation of central heating for the elderly, at a cost of approximately &euro;3,000 per house. The outcome is as always that the least able must bear the brunt of the Government&rsquo;s ineptitude.</P>
      <P>Despite Government hype, there is no funding in the budget for the promised 2,000 extra garda&iacute;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was in the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not in the Estimates. Close scrutiny of the Estimates reveals a mere 5% increase in the allocation for Garda salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>How will that cover the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The increase is 8%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This is consumed by inflation due to the existing pay agreements. By the end of 2005, there will be 92 additional garda&iacute;, which would account for the normal annual increase. The promise of 2,000 extra garda&iacute; echoes as hollow.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, on his first budget. It was a big day for the Minister and we all appreciate that he has done a good job. I also wish the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, well in his new portfolio. As stated by Senator Ross, Deputy McCreevy and the Government set the tone for this budget, for which the work was carried out over many years.</P><Col N="1671"/>
      <P>I welcome the increases in social welfare, particularly child benefit. Senator O&rsquo;Meara referred to child care and children dropping out of school. As I have stated, the first responsibility is on parents to ensure children go to school. No matter what problems exist, it seems to fall to the Government to try to resolve them. However, parents must take some responsibility in this regard. Child benefit is a substantial payment to parents and there should be an obligation on parents to ensure their children go to school. The payment of child benefit could perhaps be tied to children&rsquo;s attendance at school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The money is for the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The money is for the child. In many cases, it is not the fault of the child if he or she is not at school. From my experience of voluntary organisations, I know what can happen. I spent many years involved with that great organisation, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which often dealt with alcohol-related problems in homes where no responsibility was taken for ensuring children attended school. Perhaps there should be a link between child benefit and school attendance. If this ensured that children attended school, it would be worth doing. While it is not a popular point to make, some action may have to be taken in certain cases.</P>
      <P>The increase of &euro;14 in unemployment assistance is a positive one. I warmly welcome the increase in the threshold for the payment of stamp duty to &euro;317,500 for first-time buyers of second-hand houses. This duty was an awful penalty for young couples starting out and it also put pressure on the sale of new houses, which were exempt up to a certain figure. While a second-hand house might suit a first-time buyer, stamp duty forced him or her to buy a new house. I welcome the fact that stamp duty will be phased for houses costing from &euro;317,000 to &euro;635,000 and, overall, the measure is a major improvement. It is also positive that workers on the minimum wage have been taken completely out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated his commitment to the area of disability. Some &euro;240 million of the Estimates for next year is for people with disabilities and some &euro;300 million per year has been committed for the period 2006-09. As Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, the Minister was compassionate in this regard. Given the manner in which the Minister spoke when he announced this measure, I have no doubt he is totally committed to it. If he is in a position to do so, he will ensure the funding for disability is ring-fenced.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the area of tax incentives. I am glad he will review this area because there is no point throwing out the baby with the bath water. For 25 years, not one house was built in my home town of Ballymote in the <Col N="1672"/>north west, which is in a rural renewal area. However, because of the rural renewal incentive, some 150 houses have been built there in the past three years, with planning permission granted for another 200. Three bedroom semi-detached houses are still selling in Ballymote for &euro;155,000, which provides a great opportunity for the young.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement in regard to the taxation of farmers, including that of the accredited tax relief on farm pollution control measures to assist the EU nitrates action programme. The flat rate of VAT refund, which goes back to farmers and is not an increase, was raised from 4.4% to 4.8%, stock relief for farmers, including young trained farmers, was extended for a further two years from 1 January 2005, and stamp duty relief was introduced for the exchange of farmland between farmers for consolidation purposes. In addition, farmers are to be allowed to average certain direct payments for tax purposes. This is all to be welcomed. Given all these improvements and the fact that there is no increase in indirect taxes on fuel, drink, cigarettes or otherwise, it is a marvellous budget which is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>At the macro level, in 2005 the Irish economy will grow by 5.1% in GDP terms, employment will grow by approximately 35,000, unemployment will remain low at 4.4% and inflation, to keep us competitive, will hover at 2.5%. These are key indicators of economic stability and, as the Leader stated, of the new Minister for Finance continuing to keep the tiller steady after the departure of the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
      <P>The biggest issues facing young people in Ireland are the cost of housing for first-time house buyers and the cost of child care. Stamp duty relief has been provided for first-time house buyers. They will incur no stamp duty on second-hand houses costing up to &euro;317,000 and will pay reduced rates on second-hand houses costing up to &euro;635,000. That is a positive move.</P>
      <P>I am aware there is only a paltry reference to child care, although Senator O&rsquo;Meara said there was no reference at all. In page B10 in the budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Henry has indicated that three minutes will be enough for her. I hope it is not churlish of me to take most of the time.</P>
      <P>It is a privilege to be allowed as a Member of the Seanad to attend the other House because there is a certain drama and sense of occasion about budget day. That was very evident today. I will note some local colour. I looked up at the Visitors Gallery at one point and it was crammed with middle-aged, male, middle-class people. There was one woman on one side of the Gallery and one on the other. The budget went a long way but it tells one something about Irish society that so many of the decision makers, so many of those who had lunch in Leinster House today and were in the Gallery, were male. Women were very sparsely represented.</P>

	<P>They were at home minding the babies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very valuable work but it is not the entire contribution women should be making to Irish society. I was very glad that departing from the printed script which we have before us in this very efficiently produced booklet, the Minister paid tribute to his predecessor, former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who laid the foundations for this budget. Although it must be gratifying for him to be sitting in Brussels it must also be dreadfully irritating and aggravating to see someone else spending the money his policies were involved in generating.</P>
      <P>This budget is a significant achievement and there is no point in us trying to pretend otherwise. I found it amusing that some of the Opposition representatives in the D&aacute;il claimed that the budget delivered too little too late and so on. That is nonsense. They should accept that the budget is good and that the Government lived up to its promises. The most significant element, which greatly delighted and heartened me and is a major step for this country, was the removal from the tax net of all those on the minimum wage, which is pretty scant. It would be niggardly for us on this side of the House not to recognise this as a remarkable step. I do not care which party took this step and it would be mean to deny that the Government did so.</P>
      <P>We must pay tribute. Of course there was an element of politics in the decision, a reaction to local election results and so on but that is the way democracy works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the way people make their feelings felt on the doorstep and if the Government responded, I am not complaining. I would complain more if it did not respond.</P>
      <P>It was significant that Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy was involved in the discussions. In an article in <i>The <Col N="1675"/>Irish Times </i>recently he wrote that all the hoopla surrounding the budget each years tends to obscure the most important fact that decisions are underpinned by a vision of a future Ireland. Towards the end of the article he wrote that the vision of the future that should guide Government budget decisions this year should be one where Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure and social provision deficits are addressed. I think they were, very largely. However, there was an absence of any clear specific reference to child care. I could not find it &mdash; even on page B10, C10 or E10. I do not think it is there.</P>
      <P>More significantly, there was a regrettable failure to put in a budget envelope to protect the clear unambiguous statement in the major international forum of the United Nations that Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid contribution would reach 0.7% of GNP in the next two years. That is a shame. With the money we have we could and should have done that. It is a reproach that such a provision was not contained in this budget.</P>
      <P>I am not particularly partisan on this issue. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which unanimously made that point. The Chairman, who is not notable for his antagonism to the Government or for his desire to ruffle Government feathers, actively supported that point. I regret that it was not possible to make this provision.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to be helpful I will make a suggestion. Regarding motor vehicle taxation, why do we not follow the French example and abolish all tax on motor vehicles? That would be popular with the people. One could balance it by increasing the tax on petrol. That would directly target the gas guzzlers, the SUVs. It would be environmentally friendly and very much the right thing to do.</P>
      <P>With those two mild reservations, I welcome the budget. We see the Government moving in a healthy, humane, decent and civilised direction and I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time with me. I echo his remarks about money for overseas development aid. I regret that it was not possible to see the contribution increased and I hope that the Minister involved will do the best he can to fight his corner for development aid.</P>
      <P>I welcome the aid given to the disabled although I regret the provisions will take so long to implement. We will also have many more disabled people surviving year on year thanks to the improvements in medicine.</P>
      <P>With such a formidable person as Senator White in the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party I felt sure that child care would have been adequately dealt with in this budget. I speak in particular as the president of One Family, formerly Cherish. Senator White is quite right when she says it is essential that we have adequate child care to get people off social welfare and back into the workforce. While I welcome the increase <Col N="1676"/>given to single mothers, to do anything in line with the Government&rsquo;s action plan against poverty and social exclusion, and Sustaining Progress, much greater increases would have to be given in this budget. The budget should have increased child income support to &euro;149.90 per month for the first and second child and to &euro;185 for the third and subsequent children. The current levels are much too low for the plan to come into being.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of income support for one parent families, which is less than &euro;150 per week. We all talk about obesity in children but, as Owen Keenan of Barnardos pointed out to me the other day, many children are malnourished and go to school hungry. Many of them come from these families. While they have been given something, they have not been given enough. We must break that cycle of poverty and having read the Government&rsquo;s excellent manifesto, I thought that was what it wanted to do.</P>
      <P>It is important we try to make sure people retain secondary benefits. The figure has been frozen at &euro;317.40 per week since 1994, but they should have been increased to over &euro;400 per week. Medical cards for all children would make a huge difference. While I welcome what is in the budget, I very much regret the situation regarding child care. It is disastrous for women. Nothing has happened for years. I will have to rely on Senator White who, I am sure, will keep after the Minister for Finance to do something about it as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senators Jim Walsh and Daly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister on the first of his three budgets. This budget builds on the very strong foundation laid by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor. It firmly underpins the Government&rsquo;s support and commitment to prudently and wisely spend &euro;45 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money. It is to the benefit of sections of our community to ensure investment in areas of real concern to people such as health, education and infrastructure, which have been prioritised.</P>
      <P>After the past seven years of improvements, particularly the growth in public services which have been provided and which, as other Senators pointed out, are the envy of Europe, I am delighted the Minister has continued the commitment to getting value for money for the taxpayer while at the same time further enhancing the position of those who are marginalised or who are less well off. That fine balance between growth and revenue and expenditure has been maintained in this budget &mdash; if anything, it has been even more finely tuned. It takes account of the more vulnerable areas and ensures the maxim &mdash; used by Se&aacute;n Lemass &mdash; that a rising tide lifts all boats is almost a reality. The result are there <Col N="1677"/>for everyone to see. I see them in my area where, following two or three generations of unemployment, children now have the opportunity to go on to third level where it was never heard of before. These things did not happen by chance and Senator Ross fairly acknowledged how they have been managed. There are, however, still areas which have to be worked on. This Government and the previous one can take credit for these changes. By targeting the resources and by ensuring services provide value for money, benefits have accrued and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Speakers have said they cannot comment adversely on the budget. The difference the changes have made to people&rsquo;s lives are as a result of previous budgets. I commend the Minister on continuing the work done to date. I look forward to his next two budgets. It is a good day for the country and for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Brady for sharing his time. This is a good budget which has been acknowledged by commentators on the national airwaves who usually would not be that sympathetic to the Government. I am glad it reflected the republican ethos of our party. That has been illustrated by the redistributive aspects in that the tax bands have been widened and, as other Senators have acknowledged, those on the minimum wage have been excluded from any taxation, which is a very welcome development. First-time buyers will no longer have to pay stamp duty on second-hand houses, which is welcome, as are the extra provisions for the disabled, particularly for those with intellectual disability. The increase in the old age pension brings it close to the target in the programme for Government of &euro;200 per week. I welcome the increases in child benefit while acknowledging that more needs to be done in the child care area. The budget heralds the continuation of the maintenance of the strong economic progress under the stewardship of Deputy<?oasys [jy?>Charlie McCreevy from 1997 to 2004.</P>
      <P>On the macro issues, it is good to see the convergence of the growth rates predicted for GNP and GDP, as stated by Senator Dardis. That is welcome because it shows the domestic economy is contributing well to the growth in the economy. Inflation has been maintained at 2.4%, which is welcome, as is the unemployment rate of 4.4%.</P>
      <P>In regard to unemployment, there are regional disparities. I know the 35,000 which have been created is very welcome but coming from the constituency of Wexford, there is a need for greater emphasis on economic and unemployment blackspots. Being excluded from the BMW region is disadvantageous to Wexford. I would like that disparity to be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Brady for giving me the opportunity to briefly welcome the budget and congratulate the Minister for Finance on a good job in getting the balance right between, as Senator White said, economic stability, the development of the economy and sharing the <Col N="1678"/>benefits of a thriving economy among people in most need. Most of the issues have been mentioned but it is important to recognise that 650,000 people have been taken out of the tax net. That is a remarkable achievement in such a short time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not dwell on the multi-annual funding being put in place for people with disability across a range of activities. What is important in that area is that it is a multi-annual programme, which means that if funding is not spent in a particular year for whatever reason, it can be carried forward to 2009. On many occasions, we have heard delegations from the disability sector trying to get action from Government. The Minister has taken that action for which he should be congratulated.</P>
      <P>I heard some of the comments in the media immediately after the budget and the only people to criticise it were those in Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>

	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to some of the points made but before I do, I wish to make a number of comments. In the past the Government has been wrongly criticised for not looking after the ordinary man on the street. This budget proves that is not the case and shows the Government&rsquo;s concern for the ordinary man on the street.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The budget is focused on lower income households. Since 1997, the Government parties have brought about a position where the proportion of those exempt from tax, that is, taken out of the tax net altogether, has increased. This is against a background of huge growth in employment &mdash; an increase of approximately 400,000 since 1997 &mdash; substantial growth in <i>per capita </i>incomes over the period and the introduction of a statutory minimum wage. The Government is now fulfilling its commitment to exempt the minimum wage from the tax net and I, for one, think this is a very substantial step in today&rsquo;s budget. The widening of the bands has taken 52,100 taxpayers off the higher tax rate.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan made a number of points to which I wish to respond. Regarding motorists, there is no increase in excise duties.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1679"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware there is no increase. I said there was no mention of a respite for motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Every budget that I can remember had a sting in the tail for motorists. That is not the case today. The Government was very concerned not to add to any of the inflationary pressures that exist.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan also mentioned the excise relief for small breweries. If the Senator is pointing to such small details, he must have had to look hard to find an issue about which to argue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>My concern is not with the provision. It is not for the Minister for Finance to mention breweries in his Budget Statement. That was my point.</P>

	<P>Small brewers employ some 130 people and are competing against some of the significant players. They do not enjoy the same scale and this provision is an attempt to provide the opportunity for them to compete in the market. We all appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s remarks about the dangers of alcohol and so on. However, this is an equitable measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>

	<P>I understand there has been universal approval for the provision of stamp duty reliefs for first-time buyers. The bands account for the houses which the majority of young people are likely to afford.</P>
      <P>The 2005 budget is about helping and respecting people. It is concerned with new investment in hospitals, schools and roads. It serves to cut taxes, an area in which my party has a strong view. It is about a comprehensive and sustainable approach to the issue of disability. It aims to continue the strategy that has made Ireland a global economic success and the envy of other countries in Europe and worldwide. I am delighted to be a member of a Government that has introduced such a positive budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for taking this motion. It concerns the need for approval of a feasibility study for Ballymacormack Community Centre, Stonepark parish, County Longford, an issue of great concern to the people of that parish and which I fully support. This community centre would be the sole provider of recreational facilities under the Leader programme, the remit of which is to enhance such provisions in rural communities. People with the dedication and commitment of the Ballymacormack committee are the backbone of rural communities and deserving of all the unstinting support we can offer.</P>
      <P>Ballymacormack is a parish of some 850 people with its own individual identity. It is patently unfair to ask parents to take their children to community halls with which they have no affinity, situated several miles from their homes. The parish is a thriving community with a school, GAA club and various sports and charity organisations. The addition of a community centre would be a valuable asset for the youth, the elderly and everybody in the area. There is a strong demand for such a facility, which would maximise the potential of the community and provide a safe environment where young people, parents and grandparents can congregate.</P>
      <P>The national school in Stonepark has a current enrolment of 232 pupils. Some 32 are enrolled to date for next year, which proves the area is growing at a great rate. The school has no green space and must use the facilities of the local GAA club. The pupils are housed in nine classrooms, including five prefabs. There are three new housing estates due for development adjacent to the proposed site for the community centre, which will comprise the building of approximately 87 houses, excluding any additional once-off houses in the parish.</P>
      <P>The proposed centre would be situated in the centre of Ballymacormack parish, on the R397 to Athlone, across the road from the school and beside both local churches. There is a thriving supermarket and other facilities in the centre of the parish. Verbal assurance was given by the planning department of Longford County Council after an inspection of the site that it was suitable for a community centre. The committee has actively worked to raise funds for the feasibility study, which is estimated to cost only &euro;5,400. A contribution of &euro;3,800 has been made by the committee towards this cost.</P>
      <P>In view of the Minister&rsquo;s avowed commitment to rural communities, I am sure this project is not one he would wish to overlook or see abandoned. Such a project represents a well thought out effort to enhance active community facilities <Col N="1681"/>within a thriving area without the danger of breaking community bonds which result from having to travel for recreation outside the natural grouping. This is at the heart of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to rural Ireland. I ask him to use his influence to ensure the necessary funding is granted for the feasibility study. The committee will be applying for lottery funding and significant fundraising projects will be undertaken over the coming months and years. The commitment and goodwill of the Minister&rsquo;s Department can be displayed by granting the &euro;5,400 necessary for the feasibility study. If this is not granted, the committee will forge ahead itself but it would be a great bonus if the Minister could provide assistance and give his blessing. I hope he can give me a positive response on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, as do dhea ghu&iacute;. Senator Bannon makes a compelling case. However, the decision in this case does not rest with my Department although it is the funding agency in such matters.</P>
      <P>There are two Leader programmes in the current round of structural funding, the Leader+ community initiative and the area based rural development programme, a sub-measure of the regional operational programmes. Funding for these programmes is provided by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. These programmes aim to help rural dwellers to think about the potential of their area in the longer term. They also aim to encourage the implementation of integrated, high-quality, original strategies for sustainable development. Such strategies are designed to encourage experimentation with new ways of enhancing the natural and cultural heritage, reinforcing the economic environment in order to contribute to job creation, and improving the organisational abilities of communities.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon is correct that I am very committed to these issues. As he is aware, a matching scheme operates under the CL&Aacute;R programme whereby if the local Leader company approves a community grant for a building, the Department automatically doubles that grant. We must be clear about one matter, however. There is always a significant demand for bottom-up development and localised decision-making. However, as soon as this is facilitated and a decision is deemed unsatisfactory, everybody wants the centre to get involved again. Decision-making should be either local or not local. If it is local, it should be left as such.</P>
      <P>The entire basis of the Leader programme, at both the European and national level, is that decision-making is undertaken at a local level in accordance with detailed guidelines issued by my <Col N="1682"/>Department. These guidelines set out the aims of the programmes, how the Leader companies should operate at a local level and the obligations of those companies with regard to issues such as the Data Protection Act 1988, the Freedom of Information Act, the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997 and the provision of a bilingual service. We lay out guidelines and good practice but the decision on any application is made locally.</P>
      <P>In County Longford, the programmes are delivered by Longford Community Resources Limited. It has a budget for the period 2000-06 of &euro;3,211,000 for Leader programmes. This is made up of approximately &euro;2.5 million for Leader+ and &euro;770,640 for the area-based rural development initiative. The decision making process is autonomous of the Department and I do not interfere with it. At times, the advice of the Department is sought as to whether a scheme comes within the guidelines of a programme. That is a technical issue and not a decision making issue.</P>
      <P>My Department clarified the position with Longford Community Resources Limited with regard to this project. The board of the company considered the application for funding for a feasibility study from Ballymacormack Community Centre at its meeting on 24 June 2004 and decided that the application should be rejected as there are a number of community centres within a four mile radius and some displacement of existing services needed to be considered. I understand Senator Bannon appealed the decision on behalf of the applicants on 28 October and the manager of Longford Community Resources Limited wrote to the Senator on 2 November, confirming the decision of the board and the reasons therefor. It was pointed out that under the operation of the Leader+ programme a grant is prohibited if it distorts competitiveness and usage of other similar local<?oasys [jy?>facilities.</P>
      <P>Leader operates on a decision making basis at a local level and I am satisfied that Longford Community Resources Limited took its decision on this application after giving it due consideration. I also understand that the question of whether the application was within the rules was not referred to my Department. The local company made the decision on the various issues involved and I must respect the localism of decisions on the Leader programme. As Minister of State and as Minister with responsibility for rural development, I have been very careful not to interfere with the programmes of the local Leader companies. The programme was intended to be autonomous. If it is intended to be a bottom-up programme, it must be so.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the local group continue its contacts with the Leader company. Unless the Department is requested to give an adjudication on a technical issue it does not have a role in the matter.</P>

<?oasys [fp?>    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I made representations on behalf of the local community. This project has the complete support of the parish. The people of the parish feel they are being victimised. A local community is enthusiastic about having a community centre to serve the people of the area and to keep the identity and spirit of the community and parish alive. Very few parishes have a facility such as this. The enthusiasm of the people should be respected.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister use his influence to accommodate them? They have the commitment to raise the necessary funds. Will the Minister meet a delegation from the local committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought I made myself clear. Next week, this House will debate other issues which run parallel to this. For very good reasons, I do not interfere with Leader groups or try to pressurise them into decisions. If I did, there would be howls from the Opposition of ministerial interference in bottom-up companies.</P>
      <P>Longford Community Resources Limited has decided to reject the application. Any change must come through persuasion of the company, by Senator Bannon and other local people, to revise the decision. Unfortunately, I must be adamant in this case. It is not my practice, and for good and valid reasons I do not intend changing that practice, to try to pressurise Leader companies. They were given autonomy. It was Europe&rsquo;s wish that they have autonomy and I do not want to impinge on that autonomy.</P>
      <P>I am not giving a personal view of the application. I am hugely in support of community development. I cannot adjudicate on this case. Even if I think an individual decision is wrong &mdash; one can always feel that &mdash; I still do not interfere as long as the decision has been made within the rules. Local autonomy is a precious thing which has been given to local community groups. There are community representatives on every Leader company and they are very local.</P>

      <P>However, I disagree with his announcement not to fulfil the Government&rsquo;s promise to meet the UN target for the overseas development aid budget. The Government should honour its commitment in that regard. Last year, with a group led by the former Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, I visited Lesotho. It was wonderful to see the work being done by the Irish voluntary agencies <Col N="1684"/>in that country. Today, in discussing the budget we have used the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; but one must visit a country like Lesotho to understand the meaning of the word. I urge the Minister of State to honour that commitment as soon as possible. Ireland should lead the way in overseas aid. Our own chequered history should give us the impetus to do so.</P>
      <P>If Senator O&rsquo;Toole comes to the House I would like to share a minute of my time with him.</P>
      <P>The other day I spoke to a friend who intends to visit Lanzarote on holiday over Christmas. When he booked his holiday his travel agent told him his passport must be valid for six months after the date of his return to Ireland. He queried this requirement because he felt a passport must be either valid or invalid. He went to his local Garda station in Carlow where he was told the garda&iacute; have been besieged with similar requests for clarification. As far as the Garda is concerned, a passport is valid if it is valid for the period spent travelling.</P>
      <P>Countries operate different systems but I would have expected EU member states to apply a standard system. A member of the staff of the House has told me that friends of hers were not allowed to disembark from a bus while passing through Kuala Lumpur last December because their passports were valid only until the following February. Irish citizens when travelling abroad should not be required to comply with this stupid rule.</P>
      <P>This matter may be beyond the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs. We are very lucky to be members of the European Union and the Minister should insist at Council of Ministers meetings that the rules which apply to Irish citizens when travelling abroad should be the same as pertain in our own jurisdiction. The requirement that a passport be valid for six months after the end of a foreign journey should not apply.</P>
      <P>Ireland did not sign the Schengen Agreement because Great Britain did not sign it. It may be time to look at that issue again. I ask the Minister of State to address that point in his speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Browne for his kind comments. The 0.7% target is real and will be achieved. It is a matter of profound regret to me that it cannot be achieved within the timeframe set out, that is, by 2007. I have no doubt we will achieve it. It is a great sign of our country&rsquo;s progress that we are in a position to achieve the target. It is timely to hear Senator Browne say that the poverty we know in Ireland is as of nothing compared to what he saw on his journey in Africa. I hope to be travelling there as soon as next week.</P>
      <P>The simple answer to the issue raised by Senator Browne is that there is a technical requirement to have a valid passport as one makes one&rsquo;s outward journey but there is no absolute requirement that it be valid for the return journey. Clearly, in all prudence and for <Col N="1685"/>practical purposes citizens are well advised to make sure their passports are valid for the full duration of their stay abroad so that they can come back to Ireland. That applies in particular to countries that are not members of the European Union.</P>
      <P>It is also a requirement with some airlines for proof of identity. Clearly, a passport is not a valid travel document once it has expired and that also applies for travel within the EU. My speech, which is somewhat technical, will reaffirm that fact. If the House bears with me I will read it into the record.</P>
      <P>My Department issues passports to Irish citizens at home and, through our embassies and consulates, to our citizens abroad. Passports are issued with a validity period of three years to children up to three years of age, and a validity period of five years for children up to 18 years of age. Thereafter, passports are issued for ten years.</P>
      <P>Provided the passport is valid at the time of a person&rsquo;s departure from Ireland there is no formal requirement, as far as the Irish emigration authorities are concerned, that it should be valid for any minimum period beyond that. As far as our authorities are concerned, it is not essential for the passport to be valid for the full duration of the person&rsquo;s journey. If necessary, they can renew their passport at one of our embassies or missions abroad.</P>
      <P>However, leaving aside the formal position, it is clearly desirable that the passport be valid for at least the duration of the journey. Simple prudence and common sense would dictate this. In the case of EU countries, all citizens of the Union have the right to enter and reside in the territory of any other member state for a period of up to three months, simply by presenting a valid passport or national identity card. No other formality is required. Member states cannot set additional conditions concerning the minimum validity or duration of an EU passport.</P>
      <P>However, countries outside the European Union are of course entitled to set specific requirements for the entry of non-nationals into their territory. These may include a requirement that passports of visitors should be valid for a certain minimum period after the date of entry. Six months is the usual period in question.</P>
      <P>Senators will appreciate that my Department is not in a position to know all the precise requirements of each individual country world-wide. It is up to every person to check with the embassy or consulate of the country to which they are travelling before they depart. Common sense applies, both in regard to passport validity and visa requirements.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office provides general advice, which is available on the website, to the effect that some countries now insist that passports should be valid for at least six months after the start of a visit. It therefore advises citizens to check the validity of their passports well in <Col N="1686"/>advance of travelling to ensure that requirement is met, thus avoiding subsequent difficulties.</P>
      <P>I appreciate it is frustrating for people to be told when they arrive, either at the airport of departure or at their destination abroad, that they do not have sufficient validity on their passport to enter the country concerned. However, the reality is that the Passport Office cannot always know the precise requirements of all other countries. These can and, indeed, do change from time to time. The responsibility must, therefore, rest with the individuals concerned to check that they satisfy the relevant entry requirements before they travel.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office provides a responsive and helpful service to Irish citizens. The staff there are always willing to go to great lengths to facilitate people who have lost their passports or have forgotten to renew them, in order to ensure they do not have to change their travel plans. We are currently implementing a major project to modernise the passport issuing system, which will see the introduction of a much more secure passport booklet and an improved service to the public. Details of this will be announced shortly.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the arrangements in place in the Department of Foreign Affairs. In a European and global context, it is unusual for someone to be able to renew his or her passport on the date of departure but that is possible here nowadays. While a comprehensive service is offered in that regard, we cannot be expected to check the requirements of every country. That is a matter for the individual concerned. If it is in order, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I would be glad to take questions should Senator Browne wish to pose them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow Senator Browne just one question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I can understand that far away countries may have drawn up their own local rules and, therefore, people travelling to such destinations would have to check the details. However, such rules should not be applied to Irish citizens travelling within the EU. It is outrageous to apply that rule to, for example, my friend who is going to Lanzarote for a week&rsquo;s break at Christmas. The difficulty is that travel agents are saying that is the rule, yet when people check with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na they are told it is not the rule. That is where the confusion arises. I understand the point the Minister of State is making &mdash; that the onus is on the passenger to clarify regulations when they are travelling &mdash; but anyone travelling from one EU state to another should not have to go through that nonsense. Once their passport is valid for the return date that should be the end of the matter.</P>
      <P>We should examine the Schengen agreement as part of the wider picture. Ireland opted out of that agreement purely because Great Britain was not going into it. At this stage, however, we are <Col N="1687"/>well able to think for ourselves. We joined the euro without waiting for Britain to go in, so perhaps it is time to re-examine the agreement. The Minister of State could discuss the matter with his British counterpart to see if the issue could be re-examined to ensure that Irish citizens will not encounter such nonsense in future. This confusion should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if I can offer too much satisfaction to the Senator in that regard. He used the phrase &ldquo;once a passport is valid&rdquo;, which is the problem even within the EU. In other words, if one does not have a valid passport and one is asked to produce it, whether by an airline or whoever within the EU, if the passport is not up to date for the return journey it is difficult for the carriers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the rule refer to the passport being valid for six months after a person is meant to return?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be valid for six months beyond the arrival date in a country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some countries apply that rule but it can only be applied outside the EU, not within Union. I think I made that point clear. One can only apply that kind of validity beyond the journey date outside the EU but within the EU it cannot be applied. I am not clear about <Col N="1688"/>Lanzarote. I understand that while Lanzarote is technically part of the EU, it may have some protocols arising from Spanish accession, making its visa and migration matters somewhat different. I am not <i>au fait </i>with what those might be. The requirement that a passport must be valid for six months after entry cannot be applied within the EU. In other words &mdash; unfortunately or fortunately, depending on which way one looks at it &mdash; the garda in County Carlow was correct in proffering that advice to the citizen who inquired. All one requires to leave this country is a valid passport on the date of departure and there is no requirement for it to be valid after that. Clearly, however, if one wants to get on a plane or boat in the other country to return here, those authorities may seek the production of a valid passport. Within the EU, some airlines ask for valid passports. Outside the EU it is an absolute requirement. For example, if one is waiting in JFK airport hoping to get on a plane home, one must produce a valid passport. A valid passport is one that is in date, not out of date. Therefore, merely carrying a passport that declares the holder to be an Irish citizen does not carry much weight once it is out of date.</P>
      <P>I will attempt to take up the Schengen issue. Although I am not quite clear about the matter the Senator raised, if he communicates with me directly on it, I will take it up.</P>
