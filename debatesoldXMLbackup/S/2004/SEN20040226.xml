	<P>I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the position regarding the eligibility of mature students for higher education grants or other schemes of financial assistance where they were employed in the year before they commenced studies.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I consider the matter as being suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have received notice of a matter of concern from Senator Ulick Burke under Standing Order 30, namely, that funds amounting to $14 billion, earmarked for development purposes in the Third World, have been dormant for two decades within the European Development Fund and have not yet been allocated to development projects. This matter will be taken at 12.50 p.m.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 4 p.m. There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>We will deal with Committee Stage of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 today. We are scheduled to deal with Report and Final Stages of this Bill between 12 noon and 2 p.m. tomorrow. Will the Leader examine the feasibility of taking Report Stage after a short sos this afternoon? Judging by the number of <Col N="1218"/>Committee Stage amendments, I think it would be feasible to conclude the Bill today.</P>
    <P>I welcome the meeting the Taoiseach had with Martin McGuinness and members of Sinn F&eacute;in. It appears that a &ldquo;get tough&rdquo; policy is being adopted on Sinn F&eacute;in and its almost <i>&agrave; la carte</i> approach to the Good Friday Agreement. We all applauded the Good Friday Agreement, signed on 10 April 1998. In the forthcoming local and European Parliament elections, Sinn F&eacute;in will be competing for seats all around the country. If the party wants to enter the whole democratic process, it will have to sever its links with the IRA. This is the commitment and belief of everyone within these Houses.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tohill, who was involved in the recent kidnapping incident, received 93 stitches arising from the assault by the Provisional IRA. Obviously, he would have been executed but for the intervention of the police force.</P>
    <P>The Independent Monitoring Commission was set up by both Governments to investigate incidents of this nature. Yesterday, members of the commission met the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Kenny, and indicated to him that Sinn F&eacute;in would not co-operate with the investigation. This is a further classic example of the <i>&agrave; la carte</i> approach of Sinn F&eacute;in to the whole issue. We can no longer pander to its whims; a get tough policy must be taken. I welcome the direction of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement yesterday and hope it will become the policy of the Government and all parties in the House.</P>

	<P>I have not said anything yet.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator mentioned congratulations, which is not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not mention that Fianna F&aacute;il, the republican party, is in the news headlines. I extend congratulations to the Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is in not in order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be guided by the Cathaoirleach and ignore my notes. I recently raised the question of housing statistics with the Leader. It has been brought to my attention that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is too busy with other matters to count or keep track of the number of housing starts or completions, and that we largely rely on organisations such as Threshold and ESB data on the number of connections to obtain this information.</P><Col N="1219"/>
    <P>As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, planning sections of local authorities must be notified of housing starts and at regular intervals thereafter. Given that these figures are available, all that would be required to collate them would be for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to require each local authority planning department to made a quarterly return. We need to examine this issue given the widespread discussion on housing. The matter is crucial in terms of planning for the future and it is not good enough for Ministers to use figures which cannot be checked in their Departments. I ask that the Minister come before the House to explain the position and the lack of progress on the issue of affordable housing, which is a commitment under partnership. Land for this purpose has been available. When will the starts occur?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come before the House to explain the reason he is spending more than &euro;4.5 million on a public relations campaign on electronic voting when only &euro;160,000 was spent recently on the registration of voters. In a survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office following the previous election, more than 20% of those questioned cited the fact that they were not registered as a reason for not voting. If one extrapolates this figure, it could mean that as many as 250,000 people cannot vote because they are not registered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for interrupting, but a debate on electronic voting took place yesterday on the Order of Business contrary to procedure. I ask the Senator to refrain from over-elaborating on her request as it could lead to a debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to request that the Minister come to the House to explain why so much money was spent on a PR campaign on electronic voting when so little is being spent on the important issue of registering voters. The Minister&rsquo;s priorities are wrong.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the important issue of AIDS and the massive impact of the epidemic on Africa. Although the matter may have been raised earlier in the week, I ask that the Leader give it priority in light of the comments made at the world conference on AIDS in Dublin this week that countries in Africa are effectively dying on their feet due to poverty and cannot afford to pay for drugs which are keeping people in the west alive. We should debate the responsibility and role of the western world in changing world policy with regard to this disaster.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Finucane&rsquo;s comments. It would be useful to debate the <Col N="1220"/>situation in Northern Ireland and the peace process in general. I am aware a similar call was made earlier in the week. I heard a Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson state on radio this morning that the party is committed to the Good Friday Agreement. Has Sinn F&eacute;in ever read the document because it has things to say about weapons and so forth? An unacceptable degree of spinning occurs.</P>
    <P>We also have the position of Sinn F&eacute;in stating it cannot be responsible for the actions of the IRA but when the IRA makes a gesture towards the peace process, as it has in the past, Sinn F&eacute;in seems to be able to take credit for it. The party cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Last night when asked on radio if he had ever killed anybody, a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy replied that he could not say because one could not be sure in an ambush. That statement links Sinn F&eacute;in to the Provisional IRA. Certain issues need to be debated honestly and openly because terrorism persists in this country and needs to be rooted out. Sinn F&eacute;in must decide once and for all whether it wants to pursue democratic politics.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ascertain the current position of the discussion document on regional boundaries for new health boards currently before the interim health services executive? Will she arrange for a debate on the issue in the coming weeks?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoin d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar an Ghaeilge san Eoraip. As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, the ongoing debate on the status of the Irish language in the European Union was initiated in the Seanad by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others. If I recall correctly, the Leader made a commitment to pursue the matter. Not a day passes without the newspapers referring to the debate which is also taking place in the other House.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose making the Irish language an official language of the European Union on the basis that it would not be practical should be aware that even now &mdash; the Cathaoirleach may be aware of this as a result of his participation in the Council of Europe &mdash; there is no practical barrier or objection to the Irish language being translated because a translator is not required during proceedings for each language. After accession, for example, 25 translators will not be required during proceedings. I understand the position to be that one interpreter interprets and his or her text is then copied by all the other interpreters. Those arguing that making Irish an official language would add to the burden of bureaucracy are not correct. There is no practical problem and I am now even more convinced that we should have the right to identify Gaeilge as an official language of the European Union.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mooney&rsquo;s request for a debate on this issue. Exciting possibilities are opening up. I received a letter <Col N="1221"/>yesterday from a group called the Decentralisation to Brussels Unit, C&uacute;pla Focal Limited, which indicated it is in possession of a language used only in officially sanctioned documents and now available under licence. Anything published in the language, it stated, will never be read by anybody and confidentiality is thus guaranteed. It continued:</P>
    <P LI="1">The licence holder will benefit from a Language Support Organisation, with staff employed by the Government of Ireland on a permanent and pensionable basis, and whose numbers have been greatly expanded. This highly professional organisation lays claim to eighty years&rsquo; experience in the use of government language, without any leakage of the official language into the surrounding community.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Governments can, therefore, be assured of confidentiality. This is clearly from someone with a strong entrepreneurial streak who, like Senator Mooney, believes there will be a use for the Irish language in the future as, I hope, there will be a use for Temple Bar.</P>
    <P>I note a report has just been published on the future of Temple Bar. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on Temple Bar, which is now experiencing the problems some of us prophesied some time ago. I can definitely make that claim because I took a lease in the area in 1978 when we established the Hirschfeld Centre. We were the only group not to receive funding and we were ruthlessly extirpated, while money was poured into pubs and cheap plastic public sculpture. The atmosphere created in the area was described on radio this morning as &ldquo;Pints, puke and paintings.&rdquo;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The area has the Irish Film Centre.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to examine how Temple Bar will be handled by Government in future. We should also have a debate on the future of the Abbey Theatre. Last night the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue, indicated there would be very severe difficulties in developing on the Abbey site. That is a great pity historically, but if it is to be moved, it must be moved to some place on the north side of the city. It should not travel southwards, and the development of the Carlton site should be examined. It would be a superb jewel in the crown of O&rsquo;Connell Street if we had our historic national theatre right in the centre of a revitalised O&rsquo;Connell Street plaza.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Some months ago Members became quite exercised over the impending war in Iraq. There was a great deal of discussion on the primacy of the United Nations in this regard. Given the information which has now come to hand, that the Secretary General&rsquo;s telephone was being tapped, which obviously raises very serious <Col N="1222"/>questions, it would behove this House to have a general debate on how world order is regulated and the respect there must be for institutions whose primary function is to assist in trying to ensure that world order is properly maintained. The situation that has arisen now gives rise to serious questions in that regard. It would be a useful exercise if we addressed those issues in a debate. I therefore ask the Leader of the House to arrange for such a debate at an early stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Miles com="ah"/><Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the request of Senator Finucane to take Report Stage of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 this evening following a short sos in view of the small number of amendments so far proposed. Will the Leader indicate when the electronic voting Bill, the Civil Liability and Courts Bill and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill will be brought before this House?</P><Miles com="xh"/>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent times in Britain there has been a proposal for random drug testing of school children. The reason is that figures in Britain suggest that 40% of children between the ages of 14 and 18 years of age take illegal drugs. The question of whether or not it is a good thing to have random drug testing in schools is currently being debated very strongly and seriously in Britain. I suggest it is something we should debate in this House. We owe it to young people to be aware of the problems of drugs and to protect them from the abuse of drugs. Perhaps the way to do that is with random drug testing in schools. If it is, we should be debating it ahead of time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the fact that the committee charged with implementing the decentralisation policy to Roscrea has been recently informed that a section of the Equality Authority that was to move there will not now be going because nobody wants to move and they have refused to do so, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister concerned, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon &mdash; even though the Minister for Finance might say he has nothing to do with it &mdash; to come into the House and explain progress on decentralisation to date. I hope this is not the beginning of the unravelling of that policy. It is very important that this House debate the issue and support the decentralisation policy. Given that the Equality Authority is not being decentralised to Roscrea, will the Leader of the House ask the Minister to consider decentralising the Garda Complaints Board or the proposed new Garda Ombudsman Commission to Roscrea to make up for that loss?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>A few weeks ago I raised the question of appalling conditions in some puppy farms throughout the country. Yesterday we learned of another find in County Wexford where seven dogs had to be put down and another 30 were found in appalling conditions. When is it <Col N="1223"/>intended to introduce legislation governing animal welfare, given that the current legislation dates back to 1911? It is time we had regulations laying down proper conditions for animal welfare.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to the House for a debate on the future role of the regional tourism boards which have, I believe, outlived their usefulness. Throughout the country counties are setting up county committees because they have lost confidence in the boards. A new structure needs to be put in place to focus on regions with a product to sell, for example, the Shannon region, the garden county of Wicklow, the Slieve Bloom region, the ring of Kerry and so on. There should be more focus on the identity of regions, as happens on the Continent.</P>
    <P>It also concerns me greatly that none of the tourism boards here have guides with foreign languages. If we depend on people from Europe and further afield to visit here, guides with foreign languages are necessary. That is something we lack compared to mainland Europe. There is much to be examined regarding the development of tourism.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s call for a debate on the issue of random drug testing in schools. Drug abuse in schools is quite a serious issue according to all reliable sources. I am aware, as others are, that both at primary and secondary level teaching staff have had ongoing discussions on formulating policy to deal with this issue and they are reporting back to the Minister. I understand that most of these reports should be on the Minister&rsquo;s desk by now. It would be an appropriate time for us to have a debate so we can ask the Minister to account for what has been happening in the debates in staff rooms throughout the country and to indicate what proposals he has to enable teachers to move forward in dealing effectively with this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane, the acting leader of the Opposition, asked me to consider taking Report Stage of the pensions Bill following a sos this afternoon. That sounds sensible and in principle I agree. However, I must speak to the other leaders and perhaps we could have a brief meeting outside following the Order of Business. I thank the Senator for raising the matter. It is a sensible suggestion and if possible we will go along with it.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the matter of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting yesterday with Mr. Martin McGuinness and the tough stance he adopted during but certainly after that meeting. Everyone wants the Good Friday Agreement to stick and the peace process to move forward and, generally speaking, that has been happening. As we listen to debates and to other speakers it is often difficult to be definitive in what one says. It may well be that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s stance, remarks that <Col N="1224"/>have been made here in this House regarding the apportionment of blame and other matters have made these issues sink home. I hope that will happen.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the matter of housing statistics and the seemingly random way in which housing Ministers obtain information. We are hoping to fit in debates on that issue and on the drugs issue in the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara raised the issue of electronic voting, about which the Cathaoirleach has spoken. The Senator was concerned about the small amount of money being spent on the process of registering would-be voters. There is huge movement in Ireland now, not just from estate to estate but from county to county and from electoral area to electoral area. It seems there should be a sustained campaign, not just in the run-up to elections, but constantly on such matters.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy and others raised the issue of AIDS yesterday. It is hoped to have a debate on that issue also as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis agreed with Senator Finucane&rsquo;s comments and referred to a particular Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy who spoke on radio last night about armed combat in the past. In answer to Senator Browne&rsquo;s question on the delineation of the boundaries of regional health boards, there has not been a debate on health in the House for some time and it would be useful to have one.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke on the status of the Irish language and explained what would be needed in Europe. I believe there is a definite movement to block this happening and it does not emanate from Government circles. I note so-called learned articles and informative pieces in various newspapers and periodicals on the subject. There is no doubt that there is a definite move to undermine the movement to enhance the status of the Irish language. There has been a debate on the matter in the other House and in my view, the D&aacute;il copied the Seanad because we were the first to hold one. There was all-party agreement.</P>
    <P>There is now a real opportunity for conferring great status on the Irish language, not in a snobbish sense but in the belief that it deserves its rightful place. I am equally aware there are many so-called sophisticates who do not want this to happen and who are putting forward all kinds of perceived insurmountable obstacles to the achievement of that status. We will review the situation after the debate this week on the Private Members&rsquo; motion in the other House.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also asked a question about the Irish language and requested a debate on Temple Bar. He also asked for a debate on the future of the Irish theatre&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Abbey Theatre.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I saw a marvellous performance of the Druid production of &ldquo;The Playboy of the Western World&rdquo; last night in the Gaiety Theatre. <Col N="1225"/>It proves there is a great future for Irish theatre and it will last forever when it produces masterpieces such as that production. There were many overseas visitors in the audience. The Senator made the argument for the Abbey Theatre to remain on the northside of the city. I would think the Taoiseach has a plan close to his heart. I have no idea what it might be but it is my impression that he would have one&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also have a feeling about that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is good. Senator Jim Walsh asked for a debate on the regulation of the world order. I watched a television programme last night about the woman in the UK who blew the whistle on the situation in Iraq. She was not penalised nor was there any condemnatory statement or action taken, because it is believed that she could blow another whistle or two and that would cause more trouble.</P>
    <P>In answer to Senator Coghlan, we will meet to decide on the timing for Report Stage of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill will be before the House next week. It is a big Bill and it is hoped to commence Second Stage on Tuesday next. The House will also deal with the Aer Lingus Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader confirm if the Industrial Relations Bill will be dealt with next Tuesday?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know about that. The Senator asked about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked for a debate on whether there should be random drug testing of school children. This testing is being carried out in the UK on secondary level students. Senator Fitzgerald also spoke on that subject. I suggest a combined debate on AIDS and drug abuse. Senator Quinn asked if random drug testing of school children would be effective in this country. Perhaps it would be.</P>
    <P>Senator Coonan asked for a debate on decentralisation. I was not aware that a section of the Equality Authority did not wish to be decentralised. I understand that union conferences are being held today and at the weekend on the subject of decentralisation. Decentralisation will take some time to bring to fruition. The House debated a Private Members&rsquo; motion on the matter last week. The Government is very much in favour of decentralisation and I presume the Senator is also in favour because he has asked if another body, such as the Garda Complaints Board, could be decentralised to Roscrea. It will take time to co-ordinate and progress decentralisation. I have no doubt that the energy and commitment of the Government, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, will cause it to find favour.</P><Col N="1226"/>
    <P>Senator Cummins asked a question about puppy farms, particularly in County Wexford. That is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to outline his plans in that regard.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Bannon about the regional tourism boards. They are very large and are not centred on the identifiable attractions of an area which are what attract people to a region, not a vague mid-west or mid-east description. I know that in Clonmacnoise there are guides who are proficient in German and French as well as English. Senator Mansergh has informed me that the Rock of Cashel guides are also proficient in those languages. This is necessary because we cannot expect everyone else to speak English just because we do.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, I wish to speak to the party leaders for a few moments. Thank you.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister of State speaking to the amendment or to the section?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to that interpretation, we seek to change &ldquo;2001&rdquo; to &ldquo;2003&rdquo; in the references to the Companies Acts 1963 to 2003. This amendment is to take account of the Companies Acts in the definition of &ldquo;public service body&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P el="5" LI="1">In page 6, subsection (1), line 35, to delete &ldquo;2001&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2003&rdquo;.</P>
  <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the definition of &ldquo;public servant&rdquo; excludes five positions, namely the President, a member of the Judiciary, the Master of the High Court, a taxing master or a county registrar. Why have these five positions been excluded from the definition of public servant? There is no obvious reason for this.</P>
    <P>Schedule 2 makes substantive amendments, running to almost five pages, to old enactments. Most pension laws date back to either Victorian times or the early days of the State. The 1980 regulations substantively amended the Victorian legislation and post-Victorian legislation. Why has it been decided to go about it in this way with this Bill? With 16 sections, the Bill is short, yet substantive amendments are listed in the Schedule, which is difficult for most of us to understand. Is there a bold or clear definition of the general retirement age? In so far as I can tell, it derives from the 1860s Acts as amended by the 1980 regulations. Without getting into the details of how one can amend a Victorian Act, which may not have survived the introduction of the Constitution on the establishment of the State, <Col N="1228"/>with a regulation in 1980, it is not obvious to the lay person how this comes about.</P>
    <P>In dealing with amendments Nos. 2 and 3, the Minister of State said that the definition of a body in paragraph (<i>g</i>) under the definition of &ldquo;public service body&rdquo;, set out in section 1(1), refers specifically to the Companies Acts. He suggested that there are commercial semi-State bodies to which the Act may apply. Which bodies, other than the semi-State ones excluded, are included in the definition of public servant?</P>
    <P>Does the definition of a secretarial office set out in the Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices and Oireachtas Members (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, which amended previous Acts, refer to people who hold secretarial office within the Houses of the Oireachtas? If so we could usefully spend some time teasing that out. There are people who have been working for some time in these Houses as members of staff, whether called secretaries or not, who have very unsatisfactory pension arrangements. Will the Minister of State elaborate further on this?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McDowell referred to the definition of the term &ldquo;public servant&rdquo;. On Second Stage, I said I was pleased that, for the purposes of this Act, I have been a public servant for over 25 years and, as a Senator, I continue to be one. One might ask why the President and members of the Judiciary are not public servants because if Oireachtas Members are they are too. I assume the Senator is referring to the meanings applied to this legislation, therefore, it is a purely practical definition. One would like to think that taxing masters are public servants when they approve high fees, but one sometimes wonders about that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The rationale for the exclusion of members of the Judiciary from this legislation is that judges are different to other civil servants, primarily because they are appointed under Article 34 of the Constitution, which guarantees their tenure and terms of office. Their conditions cannot be varied by Acts of the Oireachtas. The retirement age for judges of the District Court is already 65 but for those in the Circuit, High and Supreme Courts it is higher. The position is the obverse of that with which this legislation deals.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister of State say where that is set out?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Courts of Justice Act, wherein the retirement ages of judges are specified. In the Supreme and High Courts, retirement age is 72 and in the Circuit Court it is 70. In the District Court it is 65 but there is a statutory provision enabling the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to extend the tenure of a District Court judge from year to year after the age of 65. All these arrangements are set out in the Courts of Justice Act and there would be a major question about whether we <Col N="1229"/>could even embark on amending them given the constitutional position of the members of the Judiciary, who are independent in the exercise of their duties. They can be impeached but not removed from office otherwise than for stated misbehaviour if the Oireachtas adopts appropriate resolutions. For that reason it is not suggested that they are not public servants but simply that they are not so for the purposes of this legislation. Their legislation, enacted under the Constitution, regulates their position regarding tenure of office.</P>
    <P>The tenure of office of members of the Judiciary goes back in constitutional history to the Bill of Rights in England in the 17th century. It is a constitutional fundamental, reflected in our Constitution, that the terms of office of members of the Judiciary are a matter with which the legislature cannot interfere. It would not have been open to us to pursue that course.</P>
    <P>The President must be 35 years of age to be eligible for election to the office and the view has been taken that if a person serves as first citizen he or she should be entitled to a pension regardless and irrespective of the age of retirement. This might have interesting implications were the people to elect a 35 year old President, which has not yet happened. It is a constitutional office and it was also decided to include with those offices the quasi-judicial positions of the Taxing Master of the High Court and county registrars. This is true also of the Master of the High Court who for many though not all purposes has the position of a High Court judge, and while not a High Court judge exercises many judicial functions.</P>
    <P>The Schedules are a tribute to the Parliamentary Counsel because the primary provision, which the Senator mentioned, was contained in section 3 setting out the abolition of the obligation to retire on age grounds, and section 10, which deals with pensionable age generally. Instead of simply enacting the core provisions of this measure as an express provision, the principle is contained in each of those sections, namely, the removal of the compulsory retirement age in section 3, and the 65 year old pensionable age in section 10. Rather than rely on the doctrine of implied repeal, the Parliamentary Counsel has catalogued the previous enactments which this repeal affects and has set them out <i>in extenso</i> in the schedule. The measure cannot be criticised on the basis that the Parliamentary Counsel went back through the Statute Book and identified the items with which those core amending provisions dealt. All the bodies excluded are listed in the schedule.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or if it does not fall within the definition of a public service body. I discussed that provision when I moved the technical amendments regarding the Companies Acts. Some commercial sponsored bodies could fall within the definition and for that reason there was an express exclusion in Schedule 1. Otherwise it is a matter of interpretation.</P>
    <P>The definition of a qualifying office refers to the Taoiseach, Minister, Minister of State and former parliamentary secretaries, the predecessor post to that of the Minister of State. It does not refer to staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not trying to make arcane points about the law but I raised this matter because it seems that the basic statement, in so far as there is one, is that the retirement age is not 65 or that it could be lower in some circumstances, seems to derive from the 1980 regulations. Is that fair?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Specific bodies such as the fire brigades and so on seem to be dealt with by separate legislation but the basic statement is contained in the 1980 regulations. Is that correct?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Minister of State choose to use primary legislation to amend the regulations? It seems odd that the regulations would have amended primary Acts in the first place but that being the case, why the opposite approach now? I am not sure that something of this nature should be an issue for legislation. It is primarily a matter of industrial relations and for negotiation with particular bodies or groups of workers within the Civil Service. I imagine the trade union movement would take that position. Rather than reducing what is a very important issue to workers, many of whom work in extremely diverse jobs, to one sentence in one subsection of a Bill that states that everybody should retire at 65, we should just allow industrial relations to take it course and acknowledge that many different cases have special circumstances, which will require particular regulations, public service agreements etc. While I accept we are not yet discussing it, section 3 represents a blunt instrument and is inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about judicial appointments legislation. While I do not intend to delay the House on this matter, if the provisions for the retirement age of judges are set out in legislation then surely it has to be open to the Oireachtas to amend such legislation. There can hardly be a general principle that while <Col N="1231"/>judges are entitled under the Constitution to work forever, nobody else is so entitled, notwithstanding the fact that it is a constitutional office. I made the point to highlight that judges, the President and the Taoiseach are separate. If we accept there are particularities relating to many different offices, why go down the road of making a general rule?</P>
    <P>I asked about commercial bodies, as I could not think of any that might be affected. I am sure there must be some.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reluctant to interrupt. I want people to address section 1. We cannot have a Second Stage discussion on the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not doing that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to confine his comments to the section.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We decided to deal with a number of queries on section 1, which relate to particular definitions, together. Perhaps we should have dealt with them discretely. However, we are taking them together as the Cathaoirleach asked me to do so. I am following up on the response the Minister of State gave on commercial bodies that are included. I cannot think of any. I ask the Minister to give some examples, as I am sure this information would be of interest to the workers in those bodies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Part of the dimension of the Bill is what one might call economic confidence. We are dealing well in advance with pensions that will create considerable liabilities for the public finances in 20 or 30 years&rsquo; time. I accept the Senator&rsquo;s point that in practice many matters will be negotiated with the social partners.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not aware of any commercial bodies that are included. Essentially, the purpose of the definition is to exclude all non-commercial bodies. The Senator is quite right in what he says about judges and court officers. It is open to the Oireachtas to amend the courts of justice legislation for new entrants to the Judiciary. However, I made the point more generally to stress that it has always been the legislative practice to deal with the Judiciary under the courts of justice legislation rather than as a subset of some other legislation. This would appear to be appropriate legislative practice given the constitutional mandate to provide by legislation for the Judiciary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The term &ldquo;general age&rdquo; is confusing. I have never come across the term before in previous legislation. Senator McDowell raised a very valid point. Through the legislation there is mention of raising the general age to 65. Is that not correct?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1232"/>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this in section 1?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the interpretations section not contain a definition of the term &ldquo;general age&rdquo;? Is this not needed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not in section 1.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I am making is that is not in the section. By way of interpretation we have excluded certain people by name. We have special measures attaching to people from other groups in other parts of the legislation. There might be a reason for that lack of consistency in approach. The Minister has explained that the President, members of the Judiciary etc. are included as they were dealt with in previous legislation. However, later in the Bill other groups are mentioned and we have amended legislation. Why did we not make reference to the relevant legislation? As we are amending legislation in one place, I would assume that any legislation, which is not amended and on which we are silent, stands. If these people were covered by earlier legislation, why are they included in the interpretation? The Minister said their entitlements and age of retirement are covered by legislation already and some parts relate to the Constitution. Therefore that clearly stands. However, if we go to the trouble of amending legislation to cope with other groups, why did we not do the same for this group?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about the definition of a public servant in this section. The definition of a public servant might be taken to encompass a judge, the President, the master of the High Court, a taxing master or a county registrar. For that reason they are expressly excluded in the definition of a public servant. The other categories referred to by the Senator can clearly be addressed in the appropriate sections in which they are mentioned. For many of the other categories, the pensionable age is addressed in section 10. Within the definition of a public servant it was considered desirable to include an express reference to these individual office holders, who are addressed in previous legislation, lest they be construed unintentionally as public servants for the purpose of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I should have replied to Senator McDowell on the question about the regulation. The 1976 Act gave power to the Minister to make regulations and the 1980 regulations were made under that legislation. However, the Attorney General has advised we should not use regulations to amend primary legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We could happily open a Pandora&rsquo;s box in this area. I seek more information on the point I mentioned concerning the definition of a public servant. What is the status of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, who are or will shortly become staff of the <Col N="1233"/>Houses of the Oireachtas Commission? From experience of dealing with Labour Party staff, there is a range of different pension arrangements. Are these people public servants and what regulations or enactments govern their pension arrangements? To what extent will they be affected by this legislation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I declare an interest as a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission are civil servants of the State. They are not civil servants of the Government, but of the State. They are within the definition of civil servants in section 1(1). The legislation applies to them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this include Members&rsquo; secretaries etc.?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not quite clear about the secretaries and I would have to check whether each is engaged under a contract to a particular Member.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to check this between now and Report Stage. There is an increased difficulty because of the legislation passed last year dealing with fixed-term contracts and the need to roll those into a permanent contract. I understand that rolled over fixed-term contracts cannot exceed four years. There is some doubt as to how this applies to Members&rsquo; secretaries. If they became entitled to permanent positions presumably employed under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, clearly there would be implications as to how the pension arrangements would apply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is whether this category of people is covered as public servants under section 1.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McDowell has opened up a very tricky area, which is crucial. I did not understand that those working in our offices as support staff were all civil servants of the State. This has many implications, including possible gains for members of staff. The question, as Senator McDowell says, deserves a fuller answer. This would give clear rights to people in terms of their entitlement to apply for positions, to be retained in positions and so on, which I would welcome. I would like clarification on this issue so we do not get ourselves into a mess.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole. I was making clear to Senator McDowell that the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas are civil servants of the State, but it is far from clear that where a Member engages a secretarial assistant by way of contractual fixed-term arrangement, such a person is a member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and therefore a civil <Col N="1234"/>servant. My understanding is that the contract is drafted in such a way that he or she is not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That means these people are not covered by this legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not covered, strictly speaking.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not labour the point, but it would be interesting to obtain some clarity before we come to Report Stage, or perhaps in the other House.</P>
    <P>To elaborate on the point I made earlier, under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003, the State is obliged to offer full-time jobs to people on fixed-term contracts once they have been renewed several times. What about people who have been on fixed-term, year-on-year contracts, who are taken into the Civil Service because of this Act? Are they considered new entrants under the Bill? If one is on a fixed-term contract now and is offered a full-time job in a year, is one a new entrant?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We might return to this matter on Report Stage. Civil servants of the Government or of the State are a defined, ascertainable group of persons. I am not clear about whether the group of persons to which the Senator is referring are in that category or not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to be helpful. I can give examples of two groups about which there is doubt. One, as Senator McDowell mentioned, consists of people covered by the legislation we passed last year, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act, which ensures that employees become entitled to permanency after a number of years of continued contracts. People covered by this Act may be temporary but they will eventually become permanent. Another group about which there is doubt is unestablished civil servants, which are not mentioned in that part of the Bill, although there is reference to civil servants of the Government and of the State. There is a process under which unestablished civil servants can become permanent civil servants. It is not clear whether these are considered new entrants.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of clarity in parts of the legislation. The Minister&rsquo;s six advisers and those in every other Department know that nothing is as complicated as trying to sort out legislation such as this in a few years&rsquo; time when people begin to wonder about their entitlements. We have been through this before. The points raised by Senator McDowell must be dealt with so they may be clearly understood and people will know where they stand.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McDowell and Senator O&rsquo;Toole have raised an important point. Will they accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s last comment that he will obtain clarification and return to the matter later? It might be better to <Col N="1235"/>deal with it in this way rather than trying to obtain a spontaneous answer if further research is needed. Will they agree to this? We will return to the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to advise the House that an unestablished civil servant is not covered by this legislation. That is the current position, but they will later fall within the scope of the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Once they become established?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Once they become established they are, by definition, civil servants.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they considered new entrants if they become established after 1 April?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is clear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If they are not public servants now and they are becoming public servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are civil servants. They are unestablished civil servants. They are not established under legislation; that is why the expression &ldquo;unestablished&rdquo; is used to refer to them. They have already arrived as civil servants.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is clear and on the record.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (4)(<i>b</i>)(ii), lines 15 and 16, to delete: &ldquo;the last day of service prior to&rdquo;</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with starting times when the Bill comes into operation. On Second Stage we discussed the importance and unimportance of the time period of 40 years. For the Minister to plan 40 years ahead showed him to be a visionary displaying good planning and management, but when I raised problems that might arise in 40 years I was met with the response that the plan would not come into operation for another 40 years, so what was I worried about? For this reason I am not sure how to pitch what I am saying.</P>
    <P>We are talking about something that will only come into operation in 40 years. Rather than referring to some vague period six months after 1 April, the Bill should refer to six months after 1 April. This has the advantage of clarity and it is tidier, although it will not make a huge difference down the line. We will know that if there is doubt in the matter of when people take up employment and so on, the date will be set at 26 <Col N="1236"/>weeks after 31 March rather than 26 weeks after the last day of service prior to 31 March. The latter introduces variables and is difficult to implement. There is no great principle involved. It also gives people a chance to settle in and obtain a feel for the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the intention behind Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment, but there is an issue of principle involved. In the budget, 1 April 2004 was announced as the effective date after which the new arrangements would apply and the Minister sees no reason to depart from this. Besides, if the amendment was accepted it would undermine the current link between a non-new entrant and the existence of an employment contract, whether explicit or implied, because the 26-week provision mirrors the periods used to define continuous employment in other employment legislation. The amendment would have the effect that any former public servant could rejoin the public service within 26 weeks of 31 March 2004 without being treated as a new entrant, regardless of the length of time between the ending of his or her former service and the commencement of the new period of service.</P>
    <P>The intention of this subsection is to take account of persons who have been in recent temporary employment in the public service and who will be employed again the public service in the near future, but are not actually serving on 31 March 2004. I am satisfied that the subsection as currently drafted achieves this effect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the six-month ruling apply, for example, to people who go to Australia? Normally people go to Australia for a year. How will they be fixed when they come back? Why is a period of six months specified? For example, if a teacher who has not been granted a career break or leave of absence goes to Australia for a year, what will happen when he or she comes back?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If a person resigns his office he has made a conscious decision to terminate his contract of employment, so he can only come back as a new entrant in that instance. Naturally, if a person is on leave, paid or unpaid, there is no difficulty under the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that people who go to Australia usually go for a full year? Things have changed dramatically since the time, years ago, when people emigrated because they had no other option. Now they make a choice to go. I am concerned about this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If they have gone for a year without obtaining leave of absence, paid or unpaid, they have resigned from their position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Under section 2(3)(b) a person is entitled to resume his or her office or position, or another office or position, within the public service. This refers to returnees in certain <Col N="1237"/>situations. It covers the right of people to return to a job in, for example, teaching, the public service or Civil Service. Does the Minister know what is being done here? I have listened to Members on the other side of the House and particularly to these go-ahead, progressive, market driven Ministers. Why not get some movement in the public service and allow people to leave and return? Let them go out into what the Ministers call the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ministers think that teachers and nurses do no work. We are aware of what they say so there is no need for this Minister to make excuses for them. They think nurses and teachers do not do anything and that they should go out into the real world. What does this legislation say to people who decide to take a break of four or five years? I am not referring to a career break but to somebody who decides to leave a public service position to start a company. It might or might not work out or the company might be sold but ultimately the person may wish to return to the Civil Service and will be a much wiser person with a great deal more experience to offer. However, that person will return with a deteriorated level of pension expectation. Is that a good idea? Will the Minister admit it is a good idea? He knows it is not. It is daft.</P>
    <P>My suggestion of the 26 weeks prior to it softens the impact. I cannot find anybody in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party or in the Cabinet who considers this good legislation, with the exception of the Minister and I have told him this. Nonetheless, we are charging ahead. Senator McDowell mentioned earlier that it should be left to industrial relations. A minefield is being opened with this Bill. People will spend the next 40 years negotiating in the Department of Finance on Merrion Street to sort out the problems that are being created by this section. My amendment would be a tiny amelioration, which is not an issue of principle.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the principle in the budget and sees no reason for departing from it. However, he has made at least five significant changes in the Bill which contrast with what he said in his Budget Statement. They are on the record and, by the way, they were good ones. I approve and applaud each one. However, let us not stop there. Let us do whatever is necessary to ensure we make this in some way applicable.</P>

	<P>I am sure the Minister has a high regard for nurses and teachers. I would not entertain the idea that there is any member of the Government who does not have the height of regard for them. I have great regard for the work done by teachers and nurses.</P>

	<P>Our view about their work motivation has nothing to do with this legislation. The Bill has to deal with the demographic timebomb we face in the future.</P>
    <P>If there is leave, paid or unpaid, this legislation does not apply. The person does not become a new entrant if he or she is on paid or unpaid leave. If a public servant opts to resign, that creates a different position. Extensive mobility within the public service is provided for in the Bill. There are arrangements throughout the public service for leave of absence but if a person resigns, the contract of employment is severed. There is no need to explain that. Persons who sever their contract of employment generally, as adults, are aware of the step they are taking.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a full answer. I have to refer to the section. There is no other way of dealing with it.</P>

	<P>It is germane.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>All right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>People can only come back into the public service if they are entitled to resume their office or position or another office or position. There is no entitlement to resume if somebody leaves. It has nothing to do with the contract of employment. The contract of employment covers the safe issues, such as career breaks, and matters that have been approved by the Department of Finance or the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Government is trying to get people to look beyond that type of thing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If we amend the definition of a new entrant to dilute it even further, we will give an advantage to a particular group at the expense of other groups who might wish to join the public service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand how any group would be disadvantaged.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We would give rights which are above and beyond those provided for in existing employment legislation to other workers in other contexts with regard to the continuity and discontinuity of employment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I utterly reject that. Last night I had in my hand an offer which a person working in a financial institution received. The offer was a retirement of 33 sixtieths at 50 years of age. I will fight to the death the prevailing attitude that the public sector pension, which is good, is somehow above what is available in the private sector. I can produce a list of jobs at all levels in <Col N="1239"/>the private sector which have far better deals. It does not apply in all cases and building workers recently argued that point. However, it is unacceptable for somebody to decide not to do something for nurses, teachers, garda&iacute; and civil servants because it would disadvantage the private sector. We all know people working in banks and other places who have far better deals.</P>
    <P>We are not creating disadvantage for anybody. I am not asking for anything extra. There are many cases in private industry where people are encouraged to go to work in other parts the private sector. If they wish to return and a position is available, they will be given it. They do not return with rights but they have the same pension entitlement. However, that will not happen in the public service and the Civil Service. If a teacher leaves a position, tries to add something to the economic growth of this country in another venture but it does not work out and he or she wants to return to the service, he or she is utterly disadvantaged. That is wrong and is contrary to everything we are trying to do to grow the economy and in terms of flexibility. This is a belt and braces means of imprisoning people in positions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We are opening a debate on the Bill in general. There is an amendment before the House and the Minister should respond to that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask a question related to the amendment. This subsection appears to deal with situations where people are working for a public service body listed in the Schedule and moving into the Civil Service at some point in the next six weeks or in the six weeks before 31 March. Some arrangements have been made over the years with bodies which were moved or partly moved out of the public service. Team Aer Lingus is an example. It was separated from the public service and the Aer Lingus scheme and was effectively privatised. Employees were given letters of comfort and were told they would be entitled to return to the public service on terms that would apply to public servants. I am not asking about that case but I am aware that such an arrangement was made. The Minister will be aware that it was subject to legal challenge. Are there any other such arrangements involving bodies which were in the public service where people still hold letters of entitlement which allow them to return to the public service in the future? If so, it appears that those arrangements are being superseded, intentionally or otherwise, by this legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the terms of such arrangements for the purposes of today&rsquo;s debate. However, if such arrangements are contractually in existence and agreed upon, they are not in any way affected by this legislation. <Col N="1240"/>They continue to stand. That issue is not germane to this Bill.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Civil Service Commission and Local Appointments Commission arrange for recruitment to public service positions. If we were to legislate that in the case of a resigned public or civil servant, he or she had an extensive right of return to the service, it would be to the disadvantage of others such as school leavers who might wish to join the service.</P>
   
    <P el="10">Question, &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (4), between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) a person who immediately before 1 April 2004 was enrolled in a recognised course of training as a primary teacher.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The issue is simple and deals with equity. The Act gives recognition to the fact that people in the Garda training college in Templemore are deemed not to be new entrants. The same recognition should be extended to trainee and student teachers in colleges of education. I can give many reasons for this. First, there is no equity in the Act. People doing their B.Ed. are only qualified to do one job when they finish. They have made a decision and have the clear expectation on the basis of the decision they took when they entered college. They have a legal case in terms of expectation and of the position that existed when they started college. Little would be lost by extending to them the same approach and understanding as is properly being extended to recruits in the Garda college.</P>
    <P>I asked somebody why the extension was granted to people in the Garda college and not to other groups and was told that it was due to the fact that they were covered and recognised by legislation. That is irrelevant to whether they will be covered by this legislation. This is a question of equity and the provision as it stands is grossly unfair. Any reasonable person can see that these student teachers have made a decision to enter a college of education and that their qualification only entitles them to be employed in a primary school. On that basis they should be regarded as being new entrants on the day they walk into the colleges of education. I ask the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole. Unfortunately, a B.Ed. degree is of no use outside of the teaching area. People who have committed themselves to teacher training colleges will be snookered by this. If an exception is made for trainee garda&iacute;, the same should be done, on the grounds of equity, for students who have <Col N="1241"/>committed themselves to the different colleges of education, whether Froebel, Col&aacute;iste Mhuire in Marino, Col&aacute;iste Ph&aacute;draig in Drumcondra, Mary Immaculate College of Education in Limerick or the Church of Ireland college of education. I urge the Minister to give careful consideration to the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Browne made an eloquent plea on this issue. However, the Minister is of the view that he must stick to the strict contractual link that exists in the contract of employment. The person who attends a teacher training college does not have a contractual link until he or she is engaged as a primary school teacher. That distinction is reflected in the legislation. The Minister is not disposed to accept the amendment because it would undermine the current link between the non-new entrant and the existence of an employment contract, either explicit or implied.</P>
    <P>In the case of a person training to be a primary school teacher, there is no direct link with employment on completion of the training and an application for a position has to be made. The Minister is not prepared to make a special arrangement for a particular group in a particular type of training establishment where no contractual employment agreement exists. Provision has been made in the Bill for trainees from the Garda college in Templemore because there is an implied contract of future employment in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, subject to satisfactory completion of training.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there an implied or actual contract?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is also the holding, in the case of such a person, of a statutory office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I missed that point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a statutory office in the case of a garda trainee.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to move from that point to teachers. In fairness to them, does the Minister of State know of any case of a newly qualified teacher walking into a job unrelated to education on the day after qualifying with his or her B.Ed.? I do not know of any. The qualified B.Ed. must also spend the first year after qualification doing a diploma before being recognised as fully qualified.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am joining this debate without having done much reading on this issue. Senator Browne stated that he does not know of anybody who entered training college and qualified with a B.Ed. who did not go into teaching. The area is wide open. Many people make different choices. At 18 years of age a person may enter training college but at 21 the person may have a different philosophy regarding the direction his or her life should take. Some come out from teacher <Col N="1242"/>training college and do not enter the teaching profession.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator hear what I said?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the message? My understanding of what the Senator said is that those who leave training college automatically go into teaching. Is that what the Senator said?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>My point was that 99% of graduates with a B.Ed. go into teaching, because unfortunately, the B.Ed. degree is not useful for getting jobs in areas outside of education. That is the specific point I made. I genuinely do not know of anyone who left college with a B.Ed. who entered a different area of work without having to do some other course. My point is that a B.Ed. degree is specific. It allows a person to get a job in the teaching profession and curtails the person from joining other areas. Many teachers who wanted to leave teaching found afterwards that the B.Ed. degree was not worth much to them outside of the teaching profession.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that two thirds of the graduates would enter the teaching profession after graduation. However, it is possible for many&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The possibility is there for a garda also.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>May I finish? I listened&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a stupid point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not. How dare the Senator presume&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must withdraw that remark.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I withdraw the remark, unreservedly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that it is possible for people who have completed a course, whatever course it is, be it teacher training or whatever, to decide to enter other professions after they qualify. I do not see anything stupid in that statement. If the Senator does, I might revert his comment to him, but I will not do that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the point made by Senators Browne and O&rsquo;Toole. It does not matter much whether an individual decides to stay in the teaching profession or not. The fact is that when they entered teacher training they did so in the expectation that certain conditions of employment would be available to them and, by and large, they do go on to be teachers. It is reasonable to preserve that expectation, which is the principle behind the amendment.</P>
    <P>On the question of nurses in training, will the Minister of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1243"/>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not allow that as it does not relate to the amendment before us. The Senator may raise the issue in some other way later.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise it under the section. The point at issue with this amendment is the preservation of the expectation of people in the public service who are in a course of training. I wanted to ask about nurses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment is specifically related to primary school teachers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that. However, we must deal with this by relation to the provision for garda&iacute;. That is where this arises.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may debate that under the section if he wishes but at this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been debating the issue already. The Minister of State has justified this provision on the basis that a provision has been made for garda&iacute;. We must relate it to other professions and other courses of training to which it is clearly relevant. We are not saving time if I have to go back on it later.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I rule that it is not relevant.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise it again in a few moments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I tabled an amendment to which in his response, the Minister of State justified why recruit garda&iacute; were dealt with in a certain way. He went to great lengths to explain their contract and the reasons this could not be related to the teaching profession. In terms of the response, it is perfectly in order. I intend referring to that connection made by the Minister of State who was not ruled out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the point, which is one of information rather than order. In the presentation of his amendment, Senator O&rsquo;Toole specifically correlated the primary teacher and the garda, which prompted the Minister to respond to that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither of us was ruled out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If the issue of nurses had been raised in this regard, no doubt the Minister of State would have been allowed to respond on that basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a ruling which I stand by.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to delay matters so I will save the issue of nurses for a few moments. I wish to ask the Minister of State <Col N="1244"/>about the issue to which he referred, which the Acting Chairman deemed to be in order, namely garda&iacute;. He specified that garda&iacute; had an implied contract. I am not quite sure what that means. Does it mean they have an actual contract of employment before they enter Templemore or does the contract begin on completion of training? If it is only an implied contract then it is simply an expectation that could also be applied to other bodies, including teachers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a mere expectation. It is an implied contract that on completion of satisfactory training that person will take up duties and be assigned as a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a definite post.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand what the phrase &ldquo;implied contract&rdquo; means. Is a contract in place beforehand?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The contract implies a legal right, it is not a mere expectation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it in writing?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a right to serve with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on completion of training. I am not clear if it is written, but there have been numerous court decisions in this area. The position of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is more analogous, but not in all precise terms, to a person who is enlisted in the Defence Forces under the 1954 Defence Act. Where a person is attested in the Defence Forces he or she immediately becomes a member of the Defence Forces subject to full military discipline. The question of training is simply a part of the general aspect of military duties. Once a person commences training at Templemore he or she is subject to the full disciplinary rigour of being a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. On satisfactory completion of the training course the person is assigned to a definite posting in the force.</P>
    <P>I realise we are not meant to mention nurses, but the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State not to mention nurses. I have made a ruling that we will take it under the section.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to discuss nurses, but I wish to employ them to illustrate a point, which is, the dangers of extending this category beyond the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bodies which have expectations. If one extended the categories, as in the proposed amendment, this would encourage a type of debate that would be replicated in other categories.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about an exception and I ask, therefore, that another exception be made. The relationship between different categories has to be a fair reference point. Will the Minister of State indicate what is the position of Army cadets? Are they similar to <Col N="1245"/>teachers? The aim of my amendment is to protect the position of teachers. Army cadets are not included in the legislation in the way garda&iacute; are. Are they new entrants when they finish their cadet and college course, let us say if they do a degree course in NUI Galway? Are they new entrants when they come back into the system at that point?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Army cadet is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, that is out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry. I will not accept the ruling.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making a ruling and I will take it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make this clear. This will not go away. We will go through debates for the past 17 years where it will be seen to be perfectly in order to make appropriate references and connections with different groups in order to illustrate cases. I cannot accept that something can be ruled out of order in that way. It is not fair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a ruling in regard to Senator McDowell. I will allow him to raise the matter when we discuss the section. It is relevant to the section but not to the amendment. I make the same ruling regarding Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point on the Army.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Excuse me, a Chathaoirligh. If my point were out of order then the amendment would have been ruled out of order. The aim of the amendment is to create an exception and, in terms of argument, it is necessary to make comparisons and relativities with other groups which may be excluded under this section. There is no other way to present the argument.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in the Chair.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole tabled an amendment on which I allowed discussion. The points raised by the Senator are germane to the section and I will allow them under discussion on the section. I will also allow the Minister of State to respond. That is my ruling and I ask Senator O&rsquo;Toole to respect it. This is not intended to obstruct the debate in any shape or form, but I am in the Chair and this is my ruling.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have to make this point clear. On a point of order, and with due respect to the office of Chair, I ask the Chair to respect my position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I use the same approach to connecting arguments, as is normal parliamentary procedure in this House, the other House and any other parliament I have seen. I am clear on what can be ruled in or out of order. It would be <Col N="1246"/>completely out of order for us to discuss at length the issue of nurses, cadets, garda&iacute; or whatever, but it is quite in order to raise issues about them to make a connection and to seek information. The Minister of State has taken one group in the section, which I accept and do not wish to discuss, but I say that there should be other groups and I proposed one. In terms of justifying the argument for that, I inquired about the position of other groups. The House needs to know this in order to help it reach a conclusion on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with that point. However, from the point of view of structuring this debate, I ruled that this matter will be discussed and the Minister of State will respond when we discuss the section, which is after the next amendment. I ask Senator O&rsquo;Toole to respect that decision. It does not obstruct debate in any way or adjudicate on the quality or relevance of the question, but it is not germane to the amendment. Is the amendment being pressed?</P>

	<P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, the principle of an exception has already been established in terms of the garda&iacute;. All this side of the House wishes to establish is that it be extended to new entrants in the colleges of education.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Ormonde, far more garda&iacute; are involved in other duties outside the force than teachers working outside of teaching. The point I made was about the B. Ed. being very specific in terms of getting jobs afterwards. People who enrolled in the colleges, including those who registered in the postgraduate course last September and this month, were thinking of 35 or 40 years ahead. Retirement age would have been a factor in the making of their decision. That goal post has now been moved and it is proper that an exception is made for that group of people.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1247"/>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that we have to take this through as we see it. When students are making decisions about their future at leaving certificate stage, as Senator Ormonde said, they might change their minds many times along the way either before they make a final decision on filling in the form or when they make their choices afterwards. There are choices to be made at all times and we have to allow for that. The focus of our interest is those who followed through on the choices they made. If these people do not continue on to become teachers then, as Senator Ormonde said, it does not affect them. This is a group of people who opted for a profession. After making a decision they need to get themselves trained and qualified. At that stage they have given a life commitment to a chosen career, although that might change along the way. However, it does not matter because even if they entered the profession in the current circumstances for five years, they would still have a preserved pension entitlement which they could draw at 60 years of age. That is a simple example of what I am talking about. There is a clear statable legal case in this respect and we should be mindful of this when processing legislation. It is reasonable that we should make sure young people are employed on the basis of the conditions that obtained when they opted in. This is not rocket science but simply involves treating people in a fair way. We have, in the legislation, allowed garda recruits to be treated differently to those in teacher training college and I ask that they be treated in the same way.</P>
    <P>Students make a choice to become teachers, they spend three years attending college and then they take up their duties. I do not know if the same applies to Army cadets. All I am saying is that the system is not fair. My amendment would introduce some equity into the system and I appeal to the Minister of State to accept it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened with great interest to Senator O&rsquo;Toole and have great sympathy with his position. There is a degree of inequity in the separation of teachers and garda&iacute;, both of whom are employed by the State after their training. I appeal to the Minister of State to reflect on the contribution made forcibly by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. Will he consider some form of transition period, perhaps of 12 or 18 months, that might offer some flexibility to those who signed on for teacher training prior to the commencement date for new entrants? This would at least introduce some flexibility to the proposed arrangements, which are very arbitrary.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the very valid comment made by Senator Ormonde that one might not become a teacher in the short term or long term after attending teacher training college, young people considering a career are certainly of the view that they will commit themselves to the teaching profession after signing up for teacher training college, notwithstanding that this view might <Col N="1248"/>change when they are a little older and other opportunities might present themselves.</P>
    <P>At the precise time a student signs up for teacher training college, there is also a student signing up at the Garda Training College in Templemore. The latter student might also leave the Garda after a year or two but he will be treated differently under the proposed legislation. This is discriminatory and there is a valid case for revisiting the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I admit to being a little confused. Given my background, I am very sympathetic towards some of the sentiments expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. However, I am not at all sure that there is such a closeness between the different circumstances outlined. Consider the case of a primary teacher and a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I have always understood that there is no contract involved when a leaving certificate student enters training college and that there is no job involved until such time that the student graduates and seeks a job thereafter. I had experiences lately that showed me how tenuous my position in the House is as a former teacher. I will not go into the details but it reinforces the point I am making.</P>
    <P>I have always understood that a student&rsquo;s entry to the Garda Training College was part of a contractual arrangement &mdash; maybe I am wrong and I am open to correction &mdash; and that there was a continuum between one&rsquo;s training and one&rsquo;s entering the workforce. Until now, I have not understood that there was such a continuum pertaining to primary teachers. While I am very sympathetic towards the principle of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point, I anticipate a number of difficulties. Perhaps the Minister of State will enlighten me. If we were to allow the same continuum to operate in the case of primary teachers &mdash; I was one and still officially am &mdash; as operates in the case of garda&iacute;, would we not be faced with the same dilemma with regard to university graduates who become secondary teachers or third level teachers? What distinction can we draw legally, constitutionally if relevant, or in terms of equity between primary and secondary teachers? If we can draw a distinction, it is great.</P>
    <P>If a leaving certificate student enters university to do a primary degree with a view to becoming a teacher, should he or she not be in the same position as my daughter, who has just entered teacher training college? Should that student not have an equal case in terms of equity and legal definitions of contracts? Am I missing the whole point? If such a student does not have an equal case, the question that has been posed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, as I understand it, covers much more than primary teachers. Sympathetic as I am to the issue of primary teachers and the need for Government to make a commitment to them and support them, I anticipate difficulties. If my reasoning is wrong, will the Minister of State indicate this to me clearly? If it is wrong, I will <Col N="1249"/>be very supportive of an amendment on Report Stage to support the proposal being put forward.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his contribution. He has certainly reconfirmed my beliefs and has certainly made a valid point about existing Higher Diploma in Education students. They could be included also. There is an exception being made regarding garda&iacute;. If a survey was carried out on the number of people who trained as garda&iacute; but who are no longer in the Garda and the number of teachers who obtained a B.Ed. degree as opposed to a BA degree &mdash; this is because a BA presents a different range of possibilities &mdash; but who are no longer in the teaching profession, I would love to know the results. A B.Ed. is a very specific degree for primary teaching. As the Minister of State well knows, there are very few jobs one can get with it, apart from in politics. One needs to supplement such a degree with another.</P>
    <P>I believe I am correct in saying that the students who attend colleges of education to do a B.Ed. are subsidised by the Government because the Government knows they will enter teaching after they qualify. Does this not in effect constitute a sort of contract? The idea of the contract is a bit spurious. We all realise those who do a B.Ed. are doing so to teach. All we are asking for is an extension of the exception to a small group of people who are already in the system who were not aware that the goalposts would be move when they entered it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Having worked in RTE for the past 25 years, I realise that if a survey were carried out, it could be guaranteed that three quarters of those with a BA are not teachers. I question whether those who do a BA in university only end up as teachers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the inference.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to those doing a Higher Diploma in Education. I actually stated that a BA gives a wider qualification.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should address his comments through the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Browne. I stand corrected if I am wrong. I understood the Senator to have said that those who take BA degrees become teachers as there are few other job opportunities open to them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I was talking about a B.Ed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Senator said BA. I bow to the greater wisdom of Senator Fitzgerald who works in the teaching profession. I made my intervention with the Minister in an attempt to argue within the narrow context of the amendment, which is specific to teacher training <Col N="1250"/>colleges. Of course, one can argue about another range of categories where people with the necessary skills could, and do, work as teachers. However, the proposed legislation refers to the Garda Training College and the amendment refers to teacher training colleges. Notwithstanding any of the valid arguments that have been made vocally and eloquently by Senators Fitzgerald and Browne, I suggest that the Minister of State revisits the issue in the narrow context of the amendment proposed. I suggest that this affects the vast majority of those who wish to take up primary school teaching.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point I was making. I was looking at the precise terminology. The colleges of education are there for the single purpose of producing teachers. When I was in college there was a requirement that qualifying teachers commit to teaching in the State for at least the first five years of their career. This was seen as a payback for the costs of the development. The B.Ed. is a specialist qualification that qualifies the person for one job only. What the graduate decides to do is another matter. It is precisely analogous to the Garda college, nursing colleges and cadetships. I understand that nursing colleges are in some way covered if they are attached to hospitals.</P>
    <P>It seems reasonable to approach this as a matter of equity to ensure that the expectations of students currently in college are maintained and preserved. I ask the Minister of State to consider this. Perhaps the Department can look at it between now and Report Stage and give some indication of movement on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see the analogous precision that Senator O&rsquo;Toole does. While there is a close analogy, the big distinction is the continuum. I consider this to be relevant and await a reply from the Minister of State. I am supportive of what he says and I hope his suggestion is workable. I hope it can be introduced and that the Minister for Finance sees the wisdom and relevance of what he is saying.</P>
    <P>This argument is strongly supported from a number of perspectives. The difference I see is that there is no continuum. I understand there is no continuum in nursing colleges either. It was not my understanding that a nursing student was automatically guaranteed a continuum into employment from nursing college. Irrespective of the specific nature of the primary school teaching degree course, a student in a primary school teaching college is not given a guarantee of a continuum into employment. Therefore, there is no contractual arrangement other than a commitment entered into by the student to take the degree programme with the specific target of working as a primary school teacher.</P>
    <P>This distinction remains in my mind and I would like the Minister of State to address it. Perhaps I am posing unnecessary and <Col N="1251"/>unwarranted questions. I am supportive of the sentiments the Minister of State has expressed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate the point that when a student enters a training college, there is no contract guaranteeing a job on graduation. Students sometimes undertake a Higher Diploma in Education simply to do a module in an area that interests them. While a majority of students that undertake the higher diploma in education may teach when they graduate, the principle is that a BA or B.Ed. provides a rounded<?oasys _jy?>education that will allow students to do other things. It is different for students at the Garda college.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators Ormonde and Fitzgerald that a person starting training in any area, including teaching, has no guarantee regarding the jobs market or the terms or conditions that will apply to their employment on the completion of training. There has always been a chasm in law between a right and an expectation. The provision of this legislation deals with those who have rights, not expectations.</P>
    <P>The point Senator Fitzgerald makes is correct in so far as Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment brings us on to the slippery slope between the right and the expectation. When secondary school teachers and nurses were introduced in the discussion, we found ourselves well down the slippery slope. This is the difficulty the Minister has on the issue. It is much easier to have a clear-cut rule that those who have a clear position of right are defined on one side while those with expectations are on the other. The legislation has been drafted in this way. For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fair to say that 100% of B.Ed. graduates will end up teaching at primary level or in another area. I am sure that if a survey was conducted in the college of education and asked B.Ed. graduates why they were taking a course, they would respond by saying that it is because they want to teach at primary level. It is disingenuous to introduce the BA argument. I <Col N="1252"/>picked up Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s point about existing Higher Diploma in Education students who are going to do secondary school teaching.</P>
    <P>To return to the contract element, the bottom line is that there are far more garda&iacute; involved in areas other than policing &mdash; such as the security industry &mdash; where they use their training than there are teachers in other areas. Senator Mooney has spoken with a good deal of common sense. Perhaps the Government is following the Ryanair example where it has recently asked cabin crew to pay for their training. As far as I know, B.Ed. students are greatly subsidised by the Government in their training. The Government knows it will get a return on its investment as B.Ed. graduates will become primary school teachers. This surely proves there is an effective contractual arrangement in place.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the figures for the number of graduates from the teacher training and Garda colleges for the last few years to determine what percentage has stayed specifically in the area their training prepared them for. It might be entirely different to what the Minister of State and Senator Ormonde have said.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>While it supports the argument, it does not establish the right and this is the problem. There is a chasm between supporting the argument and establishing the right. While I would be delighted to support the closing of this gap, I foresee enormous difficulties. The Minister of State referred to slippery slopes and I would be inclined to agree with him. I am extremely supportive of the principle involved, if we can close the gap.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys _dc20-?><Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The B.Ed. degree consists of education and arts elements. While one may have qualified with a B.Ed. degree including, for example, French, the arts content would only account for, at best, an exception for a first year arts course at UCD. A person with a B.Ed. degree in French from St. Patrick&rsquo;s College who wishes to do a pure French degree in university must go back into second year. The point is that because the degree is specific to teaching, it is ultimately of little value outside the teaching profession.</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for accepting this request and the Leader of the House for taking it this afternoon. It arises out of concerns expressed at the meeting here of the Council of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, during the past week. Yesterday we debated the issue of the existence of dormant accounts in our own jurisdiction. There are dormant accounts of far greater proportions within the EU. In excess of $14 billion worth of funding lies unspent that was originally earmarked for very worthy projects throughout Africa, in particular, south-east Asia, and the Third World generally. That is a serious indictment of the structures within the EU.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister of State to force through whatever measures are necessary to ensure these funds remain dormant no longer. A reply in the European Parliament from the Commissioner last year on why this money was not spent was so woolly as to beggar belief. All sorts of excuses have been made, from wars to security and whatever else. I ask that the Minister come here for a full debate or to make a statement of his intention to ensure that the Irish Presidency will not pass without every penny being spent so that the 6,000 people who die daily in the Third World will not continue to do so while there is money that could alleviate that difficulty. It is an indictment of EU structures and amounts to criminal negligence.</P>

    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(6) Where before 1 April 2004 a person had been employed in the public service for a period of not less than 15 years, then that person shall not be treated as a new entrant if he or she resumes his or her office or position, or takes up another office or position within the public service on or after 1 April 2004.&rdquo;.</P>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0">This is a simple proposal. It is important to create a sense of flexibility and movement within the public service. If we are to introduce this legislation, on which I am not too keen, at least we should not make it less likely that people will take time out to do something else such as becoming involved in the private sector, in the economy, pursuing a business idea and so on. I have argued this before and will not therefore go into great detail. The Minister seems to have set his mind against the idea. All I am saying is that what I am proposing is completely in line with Government policy and with the often stated position of Ministers and others on the importance of people from the public sector gaining experience in the private sector. They should be able to do that without being disadvantaged in terms of their current circumstances. It is an open and shut case. I presume it will be kicked out, like all the other good ideas I have had this morning.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very important amendment. What is being done in the Bill contrasts with Government and ministerial policy as stated over a number of years. Under the strategic management initiative, the Government has always said that it liked the idea of people taking a few years out to go into the private sector and coming back to the public sector. I can think of a whole range of professional jobs within the public sector where people get a certain experience and want to go away, sometimes to make money, sometimes to gain greater experience which will ultimately be of benefit to the public service if they choose to come back. We should be actively creating opportunities and encouraging people to take five or six years out because it is of benefit not just to the individual but to the public service.</P><Col N="1255"/>
    <?oasys _dc20-?><P>I wonder how a provision such as this, which is a clear disincentive to people to take a few years out, sits with all the rhetoric we have heard from the Minister for Finance over the years about cross-stream mobility and the sharing of experience and so on.

	<P>I agree. There is much sense in this amendment. If there is any flaw it is perhaps that it refers to an almost unlimited break, which raises the question of whether that is desirable. If the break is a relatively short one of a year or up to four years, there is much <i>prima facie</i> sense in the amendment. I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a discussion about the chasm between a defined right, entitlement or status as a member of the public service, whether on paid or unpaid leave, and a mere expectation that having relinquished and resigned from that position, one should have a special recognised legislative right to be treated unlike anybody else by virtue simply of the fact that one had served 15 years in the public service. There are lateral mobility schemes within the public service and various arrangements to encourage the many desirable personnel schemes which the Minister extols.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that a former public servant who has had at least 15 years service should not be treated as a new entrant upon rejoining the Civil Service. The whole purpose of the legislation in providing for a new entrant is to provide for a revised pension arrangement for public servants in the light of the Pensions Commission report.</P>
    <?oasys _dc20-?><P>A person who has at least 15 years service in the public service already has accrued to himself or herself a preserved pension and that is not affected by this legislation in any way. By virtue of his or her departure from the public service, they re-enter the public service in that contingency as a new entrant and acquire a pension in that context. There is a fundamental distinction between the status of a person who has a continued employment relationship and a person who has severed the employment relationship.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by the Senator would have the effect that any former public servant who had at least 15 years prior service could rejoin the public service at any time after 31 March 2004 without being treated as a new entrant, regardless of the length of time between the ending of their former service and commencement of their new period of service. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>

It states: &ldquo;where <i>paragraph (a)</i> applies, the terms of the offer of appointment would be contravened if <i>subsection (1)</i> were to apply.&rdquo; This suggests that a specific contract which sets out the terms of employment needs to be in place. I am not sure to what extent that is normally the case within the Civil Service or the public service. I am also not sure that employees are told their pension arrangements in black and white terms. There seems to be a requirement that there should be such an expectation and those terms should be clear from the start if someone is to benefit from that.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) concerns a public employee who returns to the public service after a break. The Bill proposes that if someone leaves the Civil Service after 1 April 2004, yet returns later, they are deemed to be a new entrant. It is not clear how this relates to subsection (5), which deals with Oireachtas Members. I understand the Minister&rsquo;s intention is that Oireachtas Members elected before 1 April 2004 are not caught by this. Oireachtas Members not re-elected at the next election but elected at a subsequent one would still be saved by virtue of the fact they were here before 1 April 2004, thereby qualifying for early payment of pension. From the way subsection (6) is phrased, it is not clear that Oireachtas Members are excluded from it. Subsection (6) sets out the general provision that if one departs from the Civil Service and returns, then one is deemed a new entrant.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister of State understand the word &ldquo;seconded&rdquo; to mean? The Bill provides for where a person on 31 March 2004 stands seconded from the public service to a body. Does that require a specific agreement in writing and that the secondment be clearly set out? There is no definition of &ldquo;seconded&rdquo; in the Bill and the <Col N="1257"/>argument could arise of what is meant by a secondment as distinct from, say, a career break. Does it require that all the terms of departure from one body and the terms of employment in another should be agreed in advance, including the return date to the original body? Are more flexible arrangements also covered by it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Subsection (5) deals with the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament and holders of qualifying office. A person is not deemed a new entrant once the person was a Member of either House or the European Parliament or the holder of a qualifying office before 1 April 2004. Even if they lose their seat or are appointed a Minister subsequently, they are not captured by the general provision of the Bill, which is reflected in subsection (6) and does not affect the specific terms of subsection (5).</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not clear from the way the subsections are drafted. I appreciate that is the intention but subsection (6) deals with public servants and the public service includes Oireachtas Members.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The category of a public servant is much wider in the legislation than the category of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or holders of qualifying office. The very specific reference to them creates the break that allows them to continue to function as not new entrants for future purposes. That is my understanding of these sections.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the secondment arrangements. Current and former Oireachtas Members if re-elected will not be new entrants. For example, in the unlikely event that Senator O&rsquo;Toole were to lose his seat in the National University of Ireland panel as a result of the reform of the Seanad he could still then contest the following general election and become a Deputy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us hope that we are not driven by self-interest. Let us look at the people who are disadvantaged by it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Precisely. Secondment usually means that one&rsquo;s employer continues to pay one but there exists also the concept of unpaid secondment or leave. It usually relates to continuity of payment by the main employer and usually there is a written agreement between the bodies when there is a secondment. Sometimes it can be used to cover unpaid leave where, for administrative reasons, a person moves to the payroll of another party. That is the understanding. It is a matter of custom and practice within employment. It is not necessarily a designated form like a legal deed. It can be gleaned from correspondence exchanged between the parties and from statements made.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1258"/>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to accept that. The Minister of State did not deal with my first point, probably because I did not put it very clearly. I have had an opportunity to look at it again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 2(4)(II) refers to the definition of a new entrant. The transitional provisions are referred to in section 2(4). Section 2(4)(<i>b</i>) refers to a person serving in a public service body. It states:</P>
    <P LI="1">[Where] a person was serving in a public body or a body to which <i>Schedule I</i> relates prior to 31 March 2004 and left such an office or position and took up appointment as a public servant on or after 1 April 2004&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="2">(i) under the same contract of employment, or</P>
    <P LI="2">(ii) no later than 26 weeks following the last day of service prior to 31 March 2004.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That is the primary provision. I apologise, I am discussing the wrong paragraph.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not express myself clearly. Perhaps I could try again. The relevant parts are set out in section 2(4)(<i>a</i>). It states: &ldquo;[Where] a person duly receives a written offer of appointment as a public servant before 1 April and takes up that offer after that date,&rdquo;. Section 2(4)(II), which can be read in conjunction with this, states: &ldquo;where paragraph (<i>a</i>) applies, the terms of the offer of appointment would be contravened if <i>subsection (1)</i> were to apply,&rdquo;. It requires that the terms of the offer would be contravened before the saver was to apply. I am not clear what is meant by &ldquo;the terms of the offer of appointment&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is to clarify that the offer of appointment is a binding offer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 2(6)(<i>a</i>) refers to the &ldquo;same contract of employment&rdquo;. What exactly does the word &ldquo;same&rdquo; mean here? Does it mean similar?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this is to provide for seasonal workers who are called back each year, for example, temporary clerical staff who are employed seasonally at the passport office. While they may receive a new contract each year their rights and entitlements accrue from year to year so it is, in effect, the same contract of employment. It is to ensure there is no break in this provision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this apply to part-time workers who work for a certain number of months each year? When they come back into employment after being away for a year they are employed under the same terms of contract. It is not the same contract.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not new entrants.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1259"/>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I know what the Minister of State is saying. It is much more complex than that. We are talking about a contract whereby somebody takes up employment in the Passport Office for example, for three months and returns the following year. Does that person&rsquo;s initial contract identify, relate to and cover the fact that he or she will be employed for three months each year?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those people are on panels.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a flaw in the Bill. I have no objection to this but I am trying to establish how it might relate to other factors.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not get any easier.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is well down the chasm and he is swaying in the breeze on this aspect. This is a good idea but I assume the Minister of State recognises that it will have wider application, that the people who have come back into the identical terms and contract of employment they held when they left would also be covered by that section.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If not why not?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the public service there are many instances of persons who are on panels for relief work and so forth, or work in the passport office. They have accrued employment rights, must be given first refusal each year, are entitled to incremental credit and seniority claims and they are pensionable. There is a category of staff within the branches of the public service of this type and references are made to this concept of the same contract of employment, not only in the section to which the Senator referred but also in the earlier provision in section 2(4)(<i>b</i>)(i). The purpose of it is to protect that particular group. It is a distinct category.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that and have no argument with it. I know what the Minister of State has in mind but I want to know what it means. I am clear that it has a much wider application than he has just outlined. I am sure what he said is right and I have no objection to it. However, the term &ldquo;the same contract of employment&rdquo; is used twice in the Bill. The public service regularly has a contract of employment, a <i>pro forma</i> contract for any employees in whatever the job happens to be. That is the basis on which they are employed. People might leave and return under precisely the same contract as they had when they left. That is fair enough. The Minister of State can tell me whether I am wrong. I am reading the phrase and giving an explanation of it to establish the fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has in mind people in seasonal employment but what if someone decided that he or she had first refusal, in the Minister of State&rsquo;s words? If, for example, I work <Col N="1260"/>in the passport office for three months of this year and I have first refusal for the next three years but do not take it up for the first two years, I can return in the third year under the same conditions of employment and am still covered. That is fair enough. The Minister of State must recognise this has application and implications well beyond that. There are analogous cases in many different places. I presume that those who leave employment with the intention of coming back, who are not seconded and not on career breaks, and who return would be protected under the terms of this section and would not be regarded as new entrants.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This does not apply to a person who has resigned from the service. It applies to a circumstance where there is an established custom and practice concerning the person who happens not to be at work on the operative date, but has a right to take up employment there. Someone who resigns from the public service does not have a right to return to the service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are the details in writing about an established custom or practice?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not employed under a contract. We are back to our chasm.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is in the chasm. Is this a flaw in the Bill or a very good part of it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately it is neither. Someone who resigns from the public service does not have a right to return to the public service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was legislation providing for such rights for those who were disadvantaged by the marriage bar.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister said, we do not mention rights here, as we do not want to get stuck in the chasm between rights, duties and responsibilities. However, people will return.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I admire the Senator&rsquo;s industry in constructing this Trojan horse. However, I can assure him that when a person resigns from the public service, a resignation has occurred. This section does not apply to resigned civil servants.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>At this point, it may be time to hear from somebody who resigned from the public service about 23 years ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Senator not a public servant all along?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>In one sense it was final. Having entered by way of competition, I could not re-enter in the same way. However, some months <Col N="1261"/>later I was appointed as a political adviser, which was somewhat different. I am not sure whether that is constituted as a new entrant under the terms of the legislation. Another case bothers me somewhat. People, who did not resign voluntarily but were forced to resign under the marriage bar, which I believe was only lifted in 1974, are still returning to the public service. There is a special scheme for those women to return to the public service. Do they come back as new entrants?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>When I broached the issue of nurses earlier in the debate, the Acting Chairman felt I was out of order. It could be usefully explored in this context. It is common practice, particularly outside Dublin, for nurses who no longer work full time to be on a panel, which makes them available for work whenever a hospital or health institution requires them. I am not clear whether these people are deemed to have resigned and foregone all rights or whether they would be covered by the Bill and treated in the same way as workers in the Passport Office. These nurses seem to be in regular work for the State as health workers and presumably are recipients of benefits from the State when they are working.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for cutting across the Senator&rsquo;s point. If people who were in the Passport Office for three months during the peak period last summer were to return this year, would they not be considered to be new entrants?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If they are on the panel.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the most interesting section in the Bill. In the recent past we have heard much about the benefits of benchmarking, particularly from the Senators present. I subscribe fully to the notion that those in the public service who do good work should not be disadvantaged when compared to the private sector. However, benchmarking must be applied to all aspects of the terms and conditions of employment and not just to salary, which may be what some people had in mind. A person leaving employment in the private sector whose employment is broken loses all benefits subsequently.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator were in the Chair, he would rule himself out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is trying to dominate this debate and he is coming from a particular viewpoint because of his previous employment. In this instance the commencement date in respect of any new benefits for those who return after having left the public service or private sector employment is the date of re-employment. There should be no beneficial arrangements attaching to the public service as against the private sector. Ultimately those in the private sector pay all the wages and salaries of those of us in the public service. Having accepted <Col N="1262"/>the principle of benchmarking, this must apply across the board, including in this instance to those who sever their employment. Earlier in the debate the Minister made it clear that those on leave of absence who return subsequently do not lose the benefits accrued. We need a clear distinction between these people and those who leave the employment of the public service.</P>
    <P>Those who start a career and pursue a particular path by way of education should not find the rules have changed from the time they started. The composition of the Houses of the Oireachtas is such that there are significant advocates for particular professions here. However, this should not confer any benefits on those pursuing such professions. There is an onus on us to ensure impartiality so that nurses, teachers, cadets and trainee garda&iacute; are treated no differently. I have strong reservations about the legislation making exceptions: it should not do that. It would be far more equitable to look at the starting date. People with an expectation at this stage could be accommodated by changing the starting date from 1 April 2004. This would be a much fairer approach than singling out specific professions and excluding others simply because there are stronger advocates here for those professions than for other professions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot allow that comment to go without some sort of rebuttal. The State has a dual role. We must consider this matter from the point of view of the employers. This proposal would unilaterally change the terms of employment for future employees. As the employer of civil servants, the State must ensure that the Civil Service continues to provide the best possible service and that those employed, sometimes for 30 or 40 years, have terms of service over which we are willing to stand.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Strategic Management Initiative, there has been much discussion in recent years about lifetime balance. I believe there are advertisements on the radio as we speak about lifetime balance, which is clearly geared at introducing greater flexibility by allowing people to take career breaks, for example to look after their children for ten years and then return. The argument being made from this side is that all of that would be set at nought if we introduce a serious disincentive for people to leave the service and subsequently return. This would be the result of insisting they would have to remain at work for five or ten years after they would have chosen to leave.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable for us to point out a clear inconsistency in Government policy. Benchmarking was originally proposed to find a way to prevent the leakage from the Civil Service we have seen in recent years. It was acknowledged that public servants had fallen behind in terms of their remuneration and conditions of employment. There was a recognition that we needed to re-balance. That is what benchmarking was all about. However, we <Col N="1263"/>are now throwing into the mix a disincentive for people who want more flexible working arrangements. It is reasonable for those on this side of the House to make the point that the disincentive should not be there.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a point about contracts. A person does not have the same contract if he or she resigns. The same contract applies to a person in seasonal or part-time employment who still has a continuity of entitlement within the public service. That is what these subsections are trying to protect. The chasm to which I referred is that between a person with this entitlement and a person who has resigned or intends to enter the public service. That person is the one with the expectation. The whole Bill is pivoted on that distinction.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh raised the interesting question of the marriage bar which operated until 1973. At the time of the removal of the bar, legislation was enacted to give priority to people who had been disadvantaged as a result of the bar in regaining access to the Civil Service. That was worthy legislation, but unfortunately the European Commission took a different view and required Ireland to repeal it on the basis that it amounted to discrimination in our entrance requirements for the public service. From time to time the Civil Service commissioners have conducted special examinations for that group on an informal basis, but the formal statutory basis has disappeared since 1996. It therefore follows that after the enactment of this legislation, a person who decides to return to the public service having served and been disqualified by the marriage bar &mdash; there will be fewer such people in the future &mdash; will be considered a new entrant for the purpose of this legislation. If the person spent a long enough time in the Civil Service before her marriage, which is unfortunately not often the case, she might have preserved a pension right.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell raised the question of nursing. Again, this is a matter of basic labour employment law contracts. The health boards engage nurses on various terms and conditions. If the nurse is in service and remains in service in respect of when he or she is called, he or she has a legal entitlement to be considered by the health board. That is clearly a relationship of continuing employment. If he or she has resigned &mdash; if a termination of the relationship is clear upon analysis of the relevant documents &mdash; the nurse in question becomes a new entrant on returning to work at that hospital. Senator Walsh made an interesting case about the date of commencement of the whole operation. The Minister has fixed on 1 April as the commencement date, as announced in his budget speech. That is his stated position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not given a clear answer on certain matters. Let us once again use the example of the staff employed seasonally <Col N="1264"/>in the Passport Office. Despite what was said by Senator Walsh, I have no objection to these people being looked after. It is quite right that they should be. I am simply trying to understand the implications. It was the Minister who mentioned them as an example. I have no problem with that; it is a good idea. The Minister did not answer my question about those who were there last summer. Is it the case that they are not new entrants?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not new entrants if they have an entitlement to be considered as part of a panel. Panels are constituted in a certain way: a person on the panel has a right to be sent for prior to the engagement of a person not on the panel.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they currently under contract if they are not in the office at the moment?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator uses the phrase &ldquo;under contract&rdquo; but, as he must be aware from his extensive experience in industrial relations, not every employment relationship has a definite deed in a box with a label saying &ldquo;Contract.&rdquo; These matters are often dealt with via circulars or correspondence. There is not always a binding document with a signature at the bottom. I am not aware of the particulars of the situation in the Passport Office. As a matter of law, the personnel side of the Department of Finance takes the view that there are rights, and there is an employment relationship, within the category of those employed in the Passport Office. There are people on panels who have a right to pre-empt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem whatever with that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Once that relationship is not terminated, the person cannot be a new entrant. If someone wrote to the Department of Foreign Affairs saying he no longer wished to be on the panel for employment in the Passport Office, the relationship would be terminated. The person would have terminated his entitlements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand all that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Were that person then to re-seek employment in the Passport Office he would be a new entrant.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>All those things are quite in order; that is not the issue. The Minister said not five minutes ago that a person re-entering the public service would not have the same contract. This prompted me to ask whether the person returning to employment would have a different contract. If it is the same contract, is the person still under contract? I do not know what goes on in the Passport Office either; I referred to it because it is the example the Minister gave. The <Col N="1265"/>Minister said that because these people were employed in the Passport Office last year they will not be considered new entrants if they come back. Are they under contract at the moment or will they return under a new contract? To use the Minister&rsquo;s own words, he has been dealing with the law long enough to know there does not have to be a piece of paper in a box marked &ldquo;Contracts.&rdquo; The contract need not even be signed, or even implied. It can be a real contract without being written or signed. Is there a contract?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very technical point. Of course there may be a new contract dealing with the actual payment of wages and the implied terms of the relationship, but there is a wider relationship, with legal consequences, which is acknowledged by the Department in that context. It is a labour law contract relationship. The employment relationship which entitles a person to be considered for return is sufficient in the view of the Department to constitute a legal obligation and therefore an ongoing employment relationship for the purposes of the operation of this section. That is the key. Once a person resigns, as I said a few moments ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is wasted in this job.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe what the Minister is saying. He is making it up as he goes along. It makes no sense at all. I do not think he is deliberately deceiving, simply trying to make the best of it. However, if this applies to the people the Minister is talking about, with all his lovely phrases such as continuation of expectation &mdash; he is a credit to his father &mdash; why does it come into effect on 1 April 2004? We are talking about people, by the Minister&rsquo;s own example, who were employed last year but will not be employed on 1 April 2004. We have not seen them since. They will come back in six months. The Minister is telling us they are covered. There are two things wrong with this. First, they are not coming back to the same employment. Second, they were not public servants on or after 1 April 2004. It is all over the place.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s reply on the matter of the marriage bar raises an interesting, if largely theoretical, question. A person who comes back into the public service through a special scheme and resumes employment after 30 years will, unlike his or her contemporaries, have the right to go on serving past the age of 65. We might have a small early crop, not in 40 years but in five or ten years, of people able to continue working beyond the age of 65 simply because they have come back into the Civil Service as new entrants. There is nothing wrong with that because if they have been out for 30 years, many of them will wish to catch up on lost time and <Col N="1266"/>there is nothing inequitable about them being able to serve a little longer. People who come back into the workforce in that fashion are in no hurry to retire from active employment again.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this intrigues me. There is a special category of public service employee, not always highly regarded, called special advisers. There is a large number of them and they are reasonably well institutionalised at this stage. The Governments they serve go into Opposition from time to time and an adviser can have a contract of employment which is, for all practical purposes, identical after a period of, for example, two and a half years, such as between 1994 and 1997. My clear impression is that the pension contributions in the periods when one is a special adviser are accumulated to calculate the pension. Obviously, the Civil Service equivalent rank one ends up with is relevant, as well as the number of years one serves. The different periods are accumulated even though there might be a discontinuity of service. If an adviser has been serving for five or ten years and this is followed by a gap of two years, I do not know if he or she is a new entrant on their return. It is a point for consideration.</P>

	<P>A famous jurist once pointed out that most confusions about law derive from the confusion of the physical and the legal.

   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>He should focus on the employment relationship. If he focuses on the terms of the legislation we are considering, he will notice that the phrase &ldquo;under the same contract of employment&rdquo; in both contexts is linked with the concept of &ldquo;last day of service&rdquo; in the next sentence. If there is a day of service and a person happened not to be in the building during a defined period of time, there is a difficulty. It was to address that difficulty that the concept of the same contract of employment was introduced by the Parliamentary Counsel. Those who are in the custom and practice of working for a regular period each year in a defined branch of the public service have their rights protected and are not deemed to be new entrants.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh posed a question about political advisers. They are civil servants of the Government attached to Departments in unestablished positions. They have somewhat different pension arrangements but there is nothing in the Bill to detract from the rule that henceforth they will be new entrants. That is clear. No special provision has been made for that category. Once again, the political class appears to be paying homage to the necessity for the enactment of this legislation.</P>

We are left with the words &ldquo;under the same contract of employment&rdquo; so we will have to go to another place, which is not in this building, to sort out what is meant. Undoubtedly, somebody in the Minister of State&rsquo;s profession will make a great deal of money from that.</P>

  <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a point which is a little less arcane than some of the points we discussed earlier. This section gives a facility to people to remain at work beyond the age of 65 years if they choose to do so. It is not clear that this is exactly the case but that is how I read it. However, it then restricts that facility to new entrants. It does not apply to anybody who is currently in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>We accept the principle that one does not unilaterally change people&rsquo;s terms of employment to their disadvantage. However, this facility is being offered to new entrants and it seems reasonable that it should be offered to existing workers in the public service, many of whom might like to continue working beyond the age of 65 years. There is no logic in saying that people who are currently working in the public service and Civil Service who wish to stay working beyond the age of 65 may not do so simply because of the date on which they were first employed but that people employed after 1 April next can do so. I urge the Minister to give serious thought to extending this facility to existing public servants.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Senator&rsquo;s point. These are the issues which show the weaknesses in the recommendations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. It refused to take a creative approach to creating a stage between full-time employment and full-time retirement. The issue raised by Senator McDowell is another issue that should be dealt with. There is no reason that people should not have certain options. However, it raises new problems. At some stage somebody will have to tell an employee who wishes to remain working that he or she is not up to the job for some physical reason. Nevertheless, these problems can be dealt with. We should be seeking flexibility. The reason I first raised this issue 20 years ago was to try to create a grey area between full-time work and full-time retirement. That would save more money than the &euro;300 million in today&rsquo;s terms which this legislation is expected to save.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1268"/>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the views expressed by Senator McDowell and Senator O&rsquo;Toole. There is no good reason for discriminating between current and new civil servants in this regard. As Senator O&rsquo;Toole correctly pointed out, the capacity of the individual to continue to do the job effectively should be the criterion applied, perhaps on an annual basis, beyond the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>However, I recall a time when the country&rsquo;s economic fortunes were not as good as they have been in the past decade and we were encouraging people to retire early to generate job opportunities for young people. Hopefully, the economy will continue as it is but if that problem were to emerge in the future, it would be a sensible mechanism to use. I concur with what has been said subject to the caveat that if economic circumstances in the future indicate that it would be a more pragmatic and beneficial policy to implement a compulsory retirement age of 65, the Government would have the discretion to reintroduce it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Walsh used the word &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo;. The Bill is, in a sense, an act of discrimination because it discriminates or distinguishes between the present and future corps of public servants. This variation of status with regard to extension of service, which is voluntary, is seen as part of the overall set of measures which applies to new entrants. The option has not been created for existing employees. Of course, the Minister is open to examining the creation of that facility for existing public servants and there have been some tentative discussions with the unions about it. However, if we were to take that road there would be problems such as blocked promotional opportunities. It is possible to state a clear rule in this legislation for the future Civil Service and public service. I accept that it devalues somewhat the immediate practical import of this provision because it will not come into operation for a substantial period. However, the Minister is receptive in another context to an approach in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>The Minister referred to current public and civil servants. There are also retired public servants who are willing to return to their profession. The Minister for Transport spoke in the Seanad about creating a dedicated Garda traffic corps composed of retired garda&iacute;. How would they be affected? I am aware retired people may earn a certain amount of income without an effect on their pension. Has the Department any thoughts on that issue? When <Col N="1269"/>the Bill is passed, how will previous public servants be treated if they wish to return to work in the public service?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of a retired member of the Garda, he or she would be a new entrant on taking up a new position after retirement. That would be a new position and not an extension of an existing position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a huge shortage of teachers in the teaching profession and many unqualified teachers have positions in schools. Some teachers who retire on age grounds would love to return to the profession and continue teaching, although this might be the exception rather than the rule. When this Bill is passed, how in light of the shortage would a teacher who retired at 60 or 65, who now wanted to return to teaching, be affected?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not affected by the legislation in any sense. If a teacher wishes to stay on, that can be arranged but the teacher does not draw a pension. However, if a different public sector position is sought and obtained, then the teacher could draw the pension and engage in the other position. I do not quite see how this matter arises on this Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am wondering and thinking of the context when the Bill is passed. Take for example a teacher who retired last month because he or she was 65 years of age. When the Bill is passed, it will remove the cap on the maximum age for retirement. If that teacher decides next September that he or she wants to return to teaching, he or she is still entitled to the pension because of having worked the required number of years. It would be somewhat unusual if the person returned to the profession as a new entrant.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We must be clear in passing this legislation that we are adopting, in some instances, a highly artificial definition of a new entrant into the public service. I will give a specific example and feel the person concerned would not mind because it is objective fact. This person served in the Department of the Environment for 30 or 40 years and became Secretary General of that Department. The person retired and a year or two later and became director of the National Library. To refer to that sort of person as a new entrant in the public service stretches language. I accept this language is purely for the purposes of this Act. However, not a soul on the streets would regard such a person as a new entrant to the public service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Serving public servants who were obliged to retire at 65 years of age could compete again for public service posts provided they wait for 26 weeks after retirement. Then they would be new entrants under the Bill and <Col N="1270"/>would have no retirement age. That is the practical answer to the queries posed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an artificial definition.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like clarification on a point which relates to drafting as much as to anything else. Can the Minister of State clarify whether, subject to what is in the section, it is the option of the individual garda whether he or she chooses to retire at 55 years of age or stay on for a continued period? It appears from the way it is drafted that it would be open to the commissioner, superintendent or local employer to require a particular garda to stay on, subject to the person being able to work, until he or she was 60 years of age. I assume the intention is to give the choice to the individual garda as to whether to stay working.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention is to allow the garda to make an election at the age of 55. The important proviso is that although the garda can elect to continue working up to the age of 60, this is subject to the powers of the commissioner. The commissioner must be satisfied that the member is fully competent, available and capable of undertaking the relevant duties.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation does not make it crystal clear that a garda may choose to leave at 55 years of age. As written, the legislation would allow the commissioner to require the member to continue until he or she was 60.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not our understanding.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not clear that the option is the garda&rsquo;s and not the commissioner&rsquo;s.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a question of amending the Bill but a matter of justice. I have some reservations. Some extremely fit and capable middle ranking and senior garda&iacute; must retire at the age of 60. In the interest of the public they should not necessarily have to do so. The question of fitness is a priority and an important criterion. However, I question the assumption that if one is a garda, one is not fit to do the job after the age of 60. While many garda&iacute; are happy to retire at that stage, others would be fit and capable to work on if they chose and would give great public service. The point of the Bill in general is that 60 years is much too early a retirement age for most people, subject to the fitness criterion.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 12, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(6) Subject to <i>subsection (7)</i> when a teacher is a new entrant, no superannuation benefits shall be paid before he/she reaches age 60, other than the death benefits.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The two groups that are most disadvantaged by the legislation are teachers and politicians. We have been through a number of special arrangements for garda&iacute;, members of the Defence Forces and fire officers. Nobody disagrees with those arrangements being made. In raising the compulsory retirement age to 65 for all public servants with all the bells and whistles we talked about earlier taken into consideration, the minimum age at which a politician can retire at present is 50. It is 55 for teachers and 60 for civil servants.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that this did not happen by accident. I can go back to 1895 on the pensions arrangement. I can go back to the foundation of the State to the time when politicians were paid an allowance as opposed to a salary, which in fact, is still in the Act. Certain things developed from all of that. Teachers had their own pension scheme until a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, I am sorry to say, grabbed it when things were bad and said it would supply pensions on a pay as you go arrangement. This was despite the fact that teachers, being prudent people with a broader view of the world, were making a saving in order to look after their future. We should never have agreed to that. I was not <Col N="1274"/>around at that time in the 1930s and would never have agreed to it.</P>
    <P>At the time there was a pension fund. I tried to find the exact basis on which the Government of the day dealt with that and what kind of commitment was given. All manner of hoops have been jumped through until we arrived at the situation where in 1992 when I was involved in the negotiations, a minimum age was introduced for the first time for politicians, so that no matter what their situation they could not draw a pension earlier than the age of 50. There was no objection to that in either House. People thought it was a reasonable thing to do. As part of a national negotiation and agreement in 1996, early retirement for teachers on a reduced pension at age 55 was extended to second level teachers. I repeat, &ldquo;extended&rdquo;. The matter was examined by the Department of Education and Science, the school management authorities, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach. It was done on the basis of consistency. I failed to convince the Commission on Public Service Pensions of the importance of that. There is at least one person in this room who was there when I made that argument on a number of occasions. To my immense frustration, I failed to convince them.</P>
    <P>I will use examples for both teachers and politicians. We are now saying that every teacher should work until 65 years of age. We are all agreed that teachers be allowed to work beyond a certain time, if they feel healthy and energetic enough to continue. That is the positive side. The down side is that every 64 year old teacher, irrespective of how they feel about it, should be well able to cope with a classroom of 35 mischievous, energetic four year old junior infants or a challenging group of 17 or 18 year old students. It does not make any sense that we should have that same arrangement. Over a period of 100 years we came to recognise that some people would not be physically able to continue teaching. Apart from the intellectual demands, teaching is a physically demanding job. The concept was that they could leave on a reduced pension at an earlier stage. It is important to note that a small number of people took up that option.</P>
    <P>I have no interest in this matter because, as the Minister of State is aware, this does not affect me in any way in terms of my personal pension, nor does the position in regard to teachers&rsquo; pensions. I am interested in the professions of teaching and politics. I have a responsibility, as we all do, to protect the profession of politics. I previously used the example of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, who I know will not mind me using it in an objective fashion. She left college in her early 20s and went straight into a life in politics, which is a very demanding life. She went on to become party leader and T&aacute;naiste. I do not agree with many of her political views, but I admire her work and commitment as a public servant, as we all do, irrespective of our opinion on her views. I am <Col N="1275"/>aware that what we propose will not affect her. When the new system we are discussing is in place somebody in that situation would now be in his or her early 50s after giving 35 five years to politics. He or she would not have any source of income if the electorate were to decide to elect somebody else, which it has a perfect right to do. It is appalling that politicians in that position would not have any source of income for the following ten years. This is, effectively, handing politics over to people with their own source of income.</P>
    <P>Most people enter politics in their late 30s or early 40s, although many people start at an earlier age, as evidenced by the two young men on the benches in front of me. It is also the age at which people might well be looking at their teenage sons and daughters looking forward to going to college or there may be other commitments. It is a hard enough decision in terms of the work-life balance to decide to enter a life of politics and work seven days a week with the impact that has on families, besides also going into one that may be insecure in terms of continuation of income.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State cannot disagree with me on these points. I accept that he cannot publicly agree with me because he has been given a clear Government line to follow. If we have to raise the age at which people get a pension, I accept the arguments for that and I always have, instead of pushing everybody up to 65 which disadvantages politicians by 15 years, teachers by ten years and everybody else by only five, surely we can show some level of equity and raise everybody by five. This is a fair and honest compromise attempting to meet the Government&rsquo;s needs and also to address the needs of the political and teaching professions.</P>
    <P>Somebody said to me earlier that the House has strong advocates, which I know was a reference to me in regard to teachers. I will fight for teachers. I know the profession well, but I promise I will also fight for any other group. There is no great media support in putting forward a proposal that tends to look after politicians. If any journalist is still awake one can imagine the great press I will get on this one; &ldquo;They are lining their own pockets again&rdquo; even though this has no bearing on my income or pension. We have a duty and responsibility to debate these matters honestly. We should bear in mind future Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il and we should be trying to attract people into politics and presenting it as a career. Just because we are protected by this Bill, which will not come into operation for a couple of decades, does not mean we should ignore the issue. What has made this country poor is the fact that people say they are all right without bearing in mind the next generation. This is to the detriment of politics and education and is not a good idea. I am putting forward a fair proposal and I ask the Minister of State, having listened to the arguments, to accept <Col N="1276"/>it and take on the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole. He has spoken very eloquently about these two amendments. They go to the nub of the Bill, which is obviously about increasing the age at which one is entitled to a pension. The Bill reflects the attitude that one size fits all. Having been a teacher for a while, I note that this approach will not work in all circumstances. Senator O&rsquo;Toole has outlined how exceptions can arise in respect of teachers and politicians, in this House and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is an attitude in the Bill that smacks of, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, Jack. We will forget about the guys who are going to come after us.&rdquo; I look forward to being in the House for as long as possible, but we all know there is no certainty regarding how long any politician will be involved in politics. It is not acceptable for those currently involved in politics to close the door behind them.</P>
    <P>I have grave difficulty with the part of the Bill under discussion. It has not been thought out correctly and it certainly does not demonstrate forward planning. It deals a great blow to the effort to get people involved in politics or teaching. I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what others said. Those of us trying to make this argument are in some difficulty. The case is incontrovertible that there are special circumstances affecting teachers and politicians. These circumstances were identified through experience over the years and were dealt with by negotiation with the trade union movement, particularly in respect of teachers. Former members of the teaching profession in this House have spelt out their own experiences and have stated there are teachers who would like to retire or who should not be teaching any more. This is why the facility was introduced.</P>
    <P>Our difficulty is that the Minister has decided that one size fits all without engaging with or trying to defeat this argument. The particular arguments that relate to teachers and politicians are not being contradicted in any way or dealt with &mdash; we are simply being told that the Minister has made a decision in principle that there is to be a general rule and that he will not engage with the exceptions. Perhaps I am misreading the matter and perhaps the Minister does intend to deal with the exceptions Senators have alluded to today. It seems wrong to ignore the experience which brought about the special arrangements in the first place and all the more wrong to do so without giving any justification. This, I suspect, is what the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is doing.</P>

   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke at length on this issue on Second Stage. I agree with many of the points being made regarding those who will enter <Col N="1277"/>politics. As I said some nights ago, politicians will be affected unless they have plenty of money or a business to which they can return. If they enter politics at the age of 25 and find themselves no longer in politics at 35 &mdash; perhaps they never had a career before entering politics and had hoped it would be their career &mdash; they will have to wait until they are 65 to get a pension. I have difficulty with this proposal.</P>
    <P>A working group was set up to try to iron out these problems in so far as they affect teachers and politicians and it seems no agreement was possible. A special agreement was reached with the primary teachers in 1934 and in 1996 there was an OPW agreement on a special arrangement that those reaching the peak of their careers at the age of 50 plus could be facilitated. Some formula should be introduced so teachers who find themselves in such circumstances and feel they cannot carry on teaching until they are 65 could be given less responsibility or the chance to wind down. However, according to this Bill, if they leave the profession before the age of 65, they will lose pension benefits.</P>
    <P>It would be great if teachers could retire at the age of 55 plus to allow them a little leeway. Not only are they teaching their subjects, but they are also dealing with many other factors in the classroom. In light of this, some mechanism or formula should be introduced to accommodate them. I would like to hear the views of the Minister of State on this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is worth noting that the average length of the career of a politician at national level is only 11 years. I know the Minister of State comes from a very distinguished family. His grandfather, father, brother and aunt have all been in the D&aacute;il. His father had the unique distinction of having been in the D&aacute;il before his grandfather. This family is an exception to the rule. The days of political dynasties are definitely coming to an end.</P>
    <P>If I am not mistaken, there was a turnover in the last general election of almost one third among Deputies, which is fairly frightening. Given that the dual mandate has been abolished since that election, we will see a huge turnover in the Seanad as well. This remains to be seen. Everybody acknowledges that Fine Gael did very badly in the last general election, but Fianna F&aacute;il lost ten seats. In the case of Fianna F&aacute;il, party colleagues took the seats, but it is worth bearing these points in mind to demonstrate the volatility of politics. There is much more pressure on politicians nowadays because of all the media scrutiny and other political developments. In the early 1980s, very few seats swung and one could almost guarantee how many seats a party would get, with the exception of one or two, and this was the difference between forming a Government and not forming one. It is worth noting that if this were the 1980s, we would have fought three general elections and three Seanad elections in the period between now and the last <Col N="1278"/>general election. This is fairly terrifying for somebody like me.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands will alter the age profile in politics in years to come such that politicians will be much older because it will be very hard to entice young people or even middle-aged people into politics who will have to wait until they are 65 to draw a pension. Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point about the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, spending of 30 years in politics is frightening. This will be very unlikely in the future. However, one could spend 30 years in politics, having entered at the age of 25, and not be entitled to a pension for a further ten years. The Minister of State might revisit this area.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot support either of these amendments in the precise form in which they are drafted. However, the amendments do contain points of substance. I am not quite sure why the age of 60 is included in the amendment. I do not know at what age people entered the teaching profession 40 years ago. I admire teaching and think it is an exceptionally demanding occupation &mdash; 40 years would probably be enough for most people to spend in it. Some teachers are in full flight at 65 and are happy to continue teaching while others have contributed all they can by the age of 50 or 55. There must be a detailed early retirement rate so that those no longer in a position to contribute can retire and be reasonably looked after financially, although not on terms as advantageous as those who work until 65. This has probably been negotiated and may require further negotiation. I doubt whether this provision in all its baldness will survive until new entrants reach the age of retirement.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the issue of politicians, of whom there are different categories. I take two examples from the Opposition benches, namely, retired Deputies who have made large sums of money by running a successful string of night-clubs and bookmakers. I also think of former Members from all parties that take up directorships. The public does not understand that well-off people in occupations that pay better than politics can nonetheless collect a pension.</P>
    <P>Equally, there are people who face a complete loss of income if they lose their seat. I met a prominent former member of the Northern Assembly who made a big contribution to politics <Col N="1279"/>there. He is effectively without income and survives on what his wife earns. Fortunately for him his family is reared. I think of someone who was appointed to this House some years back because having lost a D&aacute;il seat, this person would have been destitute. That is not right. However, we must be aware that when the public reads the list of recipients of political pensions, it sees comfortably well-off people adding to their incomes and getting pensions long before they are entitled to them. Members see individual cases where former Members, having given good service, are hard up. As I suggested on Second Stage, pensions should be paid to people who have reached the age of, for example, 55 and do not have other means of support or income. This is a little like the cnuas in Aosd&aacute;na. If one is earning money from artistic and literary activity and does not need the income, then one does not collect it. There should be a safety net for those caught in difficult circumstances and do not have readily available means of employment after losing a seat in politics. I do not see any case where those who have a successful career in politics and go on to have even more successful career in business, should receive a pension at such an age. To this extent, I support what is contained in the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wholeheartedly support these amendments. In recent years we have found that the Minister responsible for certain areas has effectively lost control over his Department owing to everything being subject to the Department of Finance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This has always been the case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>When we hear the word &ldquo;review&rdquo; or any of the other references the Minister of State has made, we immediately understand it to mean cutbacks, or the withdrawal of supports that had been available. There is obviously a complete misunderstanding about the case of teachers. Teachers&rsquo; unions at all levels have earned recognition from the Department that people must be treated humanely and individual circumstances must be recognised. If we are to introduce a blanket scheme as is proposed, we will do away with this for new entrants.</P>
    <P>A number of changes have occurred in the teaching profession, and many other professions, over the past ten years. Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about the physical demands that currently exist and this is in addition to social and other pressures. There is no realisation of these demands in a proposal such as this. While I do not foresee this being acceptable to the Department of Finance, it would be useful if provision were built into the proposal that teachers could opt out for short periods of regeneration at intervals during their professional career.</P><Col N="1280"/>
    <P>The Minister of State should look at the number of teachers who have tried to leave the teaching profession in recent years. He should also look at the scourge this has led to, namely, circumstances where many untrained teachers are working, particularly within the primary sector. The number of untrained teachers is decreasing and this is to be welcomed. Untrained teachers are used to fill positions because teachers are forced out by the tension, pressure and demands made of them. If we continue with this course of action, we will compound a recognised difficulty that currently exists at primary level.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable to put in place any scheme that cannot be deviated from. This issue requires simple thinking and understanding. The changes in curriculum have made demands of people. Look at the circumstances many teachers have had to operate under for years. The funding that has been promised may bring this to an end and we will welcome it if it happens. Negotiations have taken place over many years that give small entitlements in recognition of service. If this is to be set at nought for new entrants, it will force people into resistance and unrest. I do not think this can be allowed to happen. Through his diktats and demands, the Minister for Education and Science has caused much stress within the profession. This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In a sense, we are revisiting Second Stage, although the matter arises on Committee Stage. While the current Minister for Education and Science is a determined man, I am not sure he will be a significant feature on the political landscape when these provisions bite in 2044. This is a fundamental point with regard to the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government cannot renege on the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not reneging on anything. It was suggested that the Minister was not engaged. The Minister and the Government engaged with the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions and acted on its recommendation, albeit not a unanimous one, that 65 years should be the retirement age for teachers. A group of persons who examined this issue decided it was a reasonable proposal.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that there are and must be provisions to deal with teachers who suffer from incapacity or burn-out, to use the current rather unpleasant noun. Arrangements have always been made in such circumstances and nothing in the Bill affects them. The legislation is concerned with the pensionable age for teachers, on which the Government and the Minister accepted the commission&rsquo;s recommendation of 65 years. Where ill health is involved, the added years are taken into account, and where a person suffers from burn-out, it is a matter for negotiation between the Department and the staff side as to how much leeway can be given. All these matters <Col N="1281"/>will continue to operate after the enactment of the legislation. Where the Bill introduces change for the teaching profession, and I accept this is the case for new entrants, is that the basic, primary pensionable provision will now be 65 years, in line with the commission&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>
    <P>As regards politicians and those in public life, just as members of the teaching profession are concerned about the future of their profession, which I understand, similar concerns are expressed about the future of public life. Originally politicians were not salaried. Later, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, allowances were introduced, often at the behest of socialist and republican parties in western Europe who wanted representation of the people, by the people, for the people, but found it difficult to participate in parliaments which operated as exclusive clubs for wealthy individuals. When one considers all those who laboured on behalf of this country, whom we often criticise, one group of men who travelled across the Irish Sea for a long time to represent our country in Westminster often had to live in deplorable conditions in London because no payment was made to parliamentary representatives at the time. As a result, Parnell, his party and their successors in the Home Rule movement had to represent the country and the nationalist interest virtually without subsidy for a substantial period. This has changed dramatically. Notwithstanding the views and reservations expressed about the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s proposal in this area, it is undeniable that he, more than any of his predecessors, has recognised the need to provide a good basic salary and a good basic system of expenses for those elected to political office.</P>
    <P>Reservations, which I can understand, have been expressed about the impact and effect on the vocation of politics of not providing for pensions before the age of 65. Senator Mansergh made a fair point that not everyone under this age is impecunious. There are those who can repair to the Law Library, commercial life or other forms of activity, and others whose reputation in public life is so great that, notwithstanding their rejection by the electorate, they are willingly embraced by others. Many of those who pass through this establishment have a happy passage elsewhere, while others, as Senator Mansergh stated, can fall on hard times. Provisions for severance payments for former Ministers and Members are in place and can extend for up to two years after leaving office or the Houses. As these will also be available for new entrants, there is no change in this respect.</P>
    <P>We are exposed to considerable public criticism concerning the early pension arrangements, which stem from a different age. I am not sure they are as great an incentive to persons entering public life as is represented and we do not do ourselves any injustice by removing them. I appreciate the concern expressed by Senators but the Minister has decided to adopt <Col N="1282"/>this initiative. While I am sure many Senators would not accept the proposition that one should close one&rsquo;s eyes and trust the Minister for Finance on any public question, on this matter he has done a good job in advancing the entitlements of Members and the status of Ministers, and in ensuring that those who find themselves on the benches of either House are properly remunerated for what is, as one Member pointed out, a seven-day per week job, which continues without cesser. He is entitled to some consideration on the view that if we are asking other public servants to accept a pensionable age of 65, it is only just that we apply the rule to ourselves.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has a great and admirable facility for soaring off into issues that are barely relevant. His response, notably his little history lesson, was interesting but an example of an old trick, which is ingrained in him, of saying 95 things with which we all agree and ignoring the five things with which we fundamentally disagree.</P>
    <P>I will briefly explain the difference between the two amendments. In the case of the amendment on teaching, as I informed the Minister of State, the marginally earlier retirement for teachers developed over many years and following lengthy consideration. The matter was, as the Minister of State pointed out, considered by the Commission on Public Service Pensions. He failed to state, however, that the representative of education on the commission was utterly opposed to the position it adopted on teachers, or that this position received no support from education management, education practitioners or parents&rsquo; groups. Moreover, no agreement could be reached during consultations with the teaching unions afterwards.</P>
    <P>The sequence of events, therefore, was that considerable discussion took place, including the deliberations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, a body on which I recently expressed my view that while they are decent individuals, as a group they are by no means pro-teacher. The recommendation was then inserted in the legislation without any movement being achieved in the consultations, negotiations and discussions, which brings us to the current position, with which I utterly disagree.</P>
    <P>Public representatives and politicians are an altogether different matter. There is no doubt that the best Minister ever to deal with the career prospects, conditions of service and pension entitlements of politicians is the current Minister for Finance and I would defend him on that issue anywhere. Incidentally, the second best Minister in this regard was the late John Boland, who was also prepared to take a strong and unpopular stand on public representatives. We can now leave this issue to one side.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister of State read what the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions stated on politicians?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1283"/>
   <Miles com="cl" par="113"/><Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator refresh my memory?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>At least the Minister of State has the sense not to wing it. The report does not contain anything about politicians because the commission was not allowed to deal with them. Although it offered no view on politicians, the individuals on the commission were more negative about politicians than teachers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made his own decisions on that issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pursuing a similar line to that taken by the Minister of State regarding teachers and the role of the commission and consultation. Now that we have established that the commission did not address the issue of politicians, we can address the issue of consultations with Members on the proposed changes in pensions. Can anyone in the House indicate what consultation process we were involved in with the Minister for Finance and his Department in this era of partnership?</P>
    <P>Having spoken to the Minister ten times on this issue, he has developed a sore ear from listening to me. In many ways, he is a great man and I am fond of him, but he is completely wrong in this regard. The commission did not express a view on the matter, no consultation took place with Members and the proposed changes have been simply dumped on us. The most attractive aspect of this is that one can do anything with politicians and they will never fight back. If the matter in hand relates to politicians at a personal level, they will put up with anything thrown at them. Even when his party colleagues question the reason he has taken this approach, the Minister of Finance tells them he has taken a decision, which is final, and gets away with it.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that it is coming down the line at us like this with no consultation. No other group of workers would put up with it. It is not that he disagreed with or rejected representations. It was as if we did not exist. He has told us what the story will be, that we will find it in the post on Tuesday week and that we should read it and get on with it and that is that. That is wrong. I am sorry to have taken up so much time. I believe that my most reasonable and <Col N="1284"/>visionary amendments will be at least helpful in moving this forward. I recommend them to the House and ask Members on the other side to reject party affiliation for a short while in the interests of the future.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senator Norris to be brief as this Bill must be completed by 4 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be as brief as my nature allows. It was a pleasure to hear the Minister. He has been instructive in a number of ways. First, what he said was beautifully crafted English. Second, he was able to depart from notes, something Members of this House could profit from because far too many speeches are read from prepared scripts. It was a pleasure to listen to him. However, I will be supporting my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, because I found his arguments more convincing. I did not shed any tears for Charles Stewart Parnell. I understand he gave extremely lavish shooting parties at Avondale in his day so he was not exactly put to the pin of his collar when he was in London.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe he had a fairly good time. He also enjoyed female company from time to time. Senator O&rsquo;Toole made very effective use of the fact that there was an absence of consultation with Members. That is a pity. It is a drawback as is the lack of any view from the commission. More important, it would be terribly hypocritical of us to expect a new generation of people to enter politics under conditions less advantageous than those we enjoy. I believe early retirement with pension entitlement is an extremely good thing from which I have benefited. I retired from teaching at the age of 50 and it did me an enormous amount of good. Other people should be encouraged to do the same and make room for younger people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Subsection (2) deals with the Permanent Defence Force. However, when discussing section 8 of the Bill the Minister of State indicated that arrangements for the Defence Forces were still under negotiation and consideration by the Minister for Defence. However, there is a provision in section 10 that specifically provides for a pensionable age from 50 years. Is the matter still under negotiation and discussion? Why has the Minister for Finance chosen to make a specific provision in section 10 to deal with the Permanent Defence Force?</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Subsection (6)(<i>c</i>) allows any Minister in the future to ignore the provisions of this Act and to reach agreement to pay pensions earlier should they choose to do so under any scheme breached or negotiated after 1 April 2004. It is not necessarily making a nonsense of the Bill but it provides for the Bill to be set aside as part of some partnership arrangement or pensions scheme that may be negotiated in the future. One wonders what are we doing when this Bill may be entirely abrogated by industrial relations processes within the Civil Service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator McDowell&rsquo;s analysis and for that reason I believe it is a sensible provision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McDowell should address his question to Senator O&rsquo;Toole. This was the precise point I endeavoured to make during the last debate. Specific arrangements will be made in specific contexts in the future. The purpose of the pension commission was to determine a pensionable age and make a recommendation, which the Government accepted. This was notwithstanding some degree of unease as expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole within educational circles.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Department of Defence, the provision for the scheme is within the overall limitation of 50 years as the retirement age. The schemes will be drawn up by the Minister but the overall retirement age for the Defence Forces will <Col N="1288"/>be 50 years under section 10(2)(<i>a</i>). No benefit would be payable in respect of a new entrant before he or she reaches that age. The Minister would then draw up the scheme for the release of the relevant payments in that light. The commission recommendation was that 50 years was the age of retirement for the Defence Forces, which the Government accepted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has been helpful in clarifying the matter. However, it seems remarkable that the Bill will contain a provision which will, in effect, negate its impact. The purpose of the Bill is to do away with existing special arrangements. However, if the Minister for Education and Science decides on 3 April 2004 to put in place the arrangements for new entrants that already exist, then he has liberty to do so without having to change the provisions of the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be in the education sector but in a specific arrangement for a specific purpose.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 of the Bill stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael Party opposes section 11 of the Bill because of the overlap with section 10. I note from some of the amendments tabled that there is widespread agreement among all Senators that the position of politicians is different from all public servants. I am conscious of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks and am thinking of myself and other Senators. I am 25 and 65 is a long way off but I hope to see it. This provision does not apply to me because I am here. It smacks of a self-serving attitude that would ignore the future generation of politicians. It is difficult to get people involved and legislation such as this will deter new people from becoming involved and will not be good for the future of politics. Senator O&rsquo;Toole gave the example of the T&aacute;naiste who came into politics in this House after graduation and has remained in politics ever since. She is unusual in that she has stayed so long in politics. If she were to leave politics now she would receive offers of other non-political positions.</P>
    <P>Many who have been involved in politics have left because the electorate did not want them here any more and have ended up in unfortunate positions. Senator O&rsquo;Toole said that the pension policy in other areas has not come about by accident and certainly it has not in politics, which is very different. There are many teachers speaking on this Bill but politics includes people from all walks of life. I agree with, and welcome, Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s comments that politicians who do not have other businesses or fortunes to fall back on if they leave politics should be looked <Col N="1289"/>after. Most people involved in politics do not have any great wealth on which to lean if their situation changes.</P>
    <P>I laugh every year when I receive the Standards in Public Offices Commission document to complete with questions such as how much property or land I own, or in how many companies I hold a directorship, and what other incomes I have because I have none. It is funny but serious too, if in less than five years time the people of Kilkenny or the councillors of the country, or whoever will elect the Seanad at that stage, decide that they do not want me here. It is a long way to 65 for me and others in my position.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Raising the pensions age will not encourage good new people into politics. Reports of corruption and tribunals of inquiry deter many people my age and younger from involvement in politics. If we put another obstacle in the way of people who may want to take a career break and go into politics, knowing the risks involved it will be a negative step from the point of view of public service. Accordingly, this section should be deleted.</P>

	<P>I do not wish to add to what I have already said. I do not know whether Senator Phelan was present when I replied. We are discussing the issue again.

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I mentioned past members of local authorities and pensions for them in our previous debate on this Bill. This is loosely relevant to section 12 of this Bill and I hope the Minister of State will consider it again for people who served on local authorities when there was no salary. They spent many years, sacrificed a great deal personally, commercially and financially, to give public service. Perhaps the Minister of State would consider some sort of pension scheme for them, less for the money than as an acknowledgement that they gave public service and were not lucky enough to spend time in the Oireachtas.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This covers the situation where someone is working beyond 65 and whether those years are taken into account for reckoning service. Is that a correct estimate? It brings into play the related situation whereby people have served 40 years and attained the maximum entitlement to a pension. Do they, or should they, continue to make PRSI contributions or contributions to a defined benefit or contribution scheme? The commission debated this issue but what is the Minister of State&rsquo;s view of it?</P>
   <Miles com="cl" par="105"/></Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not covered in the Bill one way or the other. The staff have raised the question of payment of PRSI contributions by those over 65 in future, which will happen if the PRSI regulations are not amended in an appropriate fashion. Pension contributions arise too in the context of those discussions but this legislation does not deal with them.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>These are technical amendments and are proposed because the schedule as drafted does not fully reflect the purpose of section 2(5) whose intention and meaning is that all persons who held an office post before 1 April 2004 will not fall within the category of new entrant. This would include persons appointed as attorneys general who were not Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time they held office. The current wording does not fully reflect the purpose of the section. That text would have the effect that a former Attorney General re-appointed as Attorney General in the future without being a Member of the Houses on either occasion would be treated as a new entrant.</P>

I thank the Minister of <Col N="1294"/>State and his officials for their full and committed engagement with the arguments as we proceeded. It is crucial to have such engagement when legislating. There are issues more of a political and policy nature than of a drafting nature that need to be considered. Unlike Senator Mansergh, I hope that any adjustments to the Bill would not be left for months and years. There is another opportunity in the D&aacute;il next week. Some of the arguments made here should sink in, particularly those relating to the two groups we discussed. I will not reopen that argument.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <P>The significant point related to age. As social circumstances and life expectancy are now different, change is needed.

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Senators in thanking the Minister of State for the way in which he dealt with the Bill today. I appreciate it can be difficult to come into either House with what I expect are overriding instructions from the Department of Finance not to give a great deal. Even in that context we have had a useful discussion and at least started the process of teasing out the details. Details remain which need to be teased out further and no doubt that will happen in the other House.</P>
    <P>In today&rsquo;s short debate we have seen that legislation is not the appropriate way to deal with this issue. There are many special circumstances which need to be considered and cannot be reflected in legislation. In the latter stages of our discussion, it was clear that the legislation itself accepts that principle. This makes me wonder why the legislation was introduced in the first place. I suspect we will see the Bill back in this House in coming weeks and I look forward to seeing the Minister of State at that time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their courtesy and help today during the discussion on various amendments and points of clarification that we sought. Some valid points were raised on this side of the House and I hope the Minister of State and his officials will reconsider them before the Bill goes to the D&aacute;il. If such amendments are made and the Bill comes back to us, it will be well received. While Senator McDowell made the point that the provisions of the Bill will not apply for another 30 or 40 years, that might not be the case. We will see many changes and variations of the Bill in the next few years. By the time people reach retirement age, the legislation might be radically different.</P>

In its technical aspects the Bill is sufficiently robust to perform the required tasks. The wider questions raised confirm the wisdom of the Government in initiating the Bill in Seanad <Col N="1295"/>&Eacute;ireann.

	<P>I was unclear about the position of mature students from reading the documentation from the Department of Education and Science. Mature students obviously will form a growing part of those engaged in third level education. This issue arises frequently. Mature students are obviously in a different position from younger students; they often have financial commitments they would not have had when they were younger. They have families to keep, mortgages to pay and so on. The problem of support for mature students needs to be further investigated.</P>

	<P>I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is chairing the meeting of EU Education Council in Brussels. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to set out the position of the Department of Education and Science on this issue.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the higher education grant scheme administered by the local authorities, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions of age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. A mature student for the purpose of the scheme means a student who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course. Mature <Col N="1296"/>students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined as a student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding his or her entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents&rsquo; income or address.</P>
    <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the student&rsquo;s means and those of his or her parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case in which the student is not an independent mature student. Under the means test provisions of the higher education grant scheme in 2003, a candidate&rsquo;s reckonable income is that for the year ended 31 December 2002, which is the 2002 tax year. However, the scheme contains a change in circumstances clause whereby the eligibility of a person may be assessed or re-assessed by the awarding body in the event of a permanent change in circumstances in, <i>inter alia</i>, the candidate&rsquo;s reckonable income.</P>
    <P>In general, the students referred to by the Senator who cease full-time employment prior to commencing their third-level studies are eligible to be assessed with reference to the change in circumstances clause of the grant scheme. In such cases, the student provides the relevant awarding body with a copy of his or her P45 and that income would be disregarded for grant-reckonable income purposes. In the case of a mature candidate dependent on parents, the candidate is assessed with reference to his or her parents&rsquo; income. Students who are in receipt of maintenance grants may, in addition, apply for funding through the millennium partnership fund for disadvantage. This fund supports students from disadvantaged areas attending further or higher education courses. Partnership companies and community groups manage the fund locally. Information on these groups can be obtained from Area Development Management Limited.</P>
    <?oasys _dc24-?><P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which the Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance fund. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Further information on the fund, including details on the application procedure, is available to students from the access officers at approved colleges. If the Senator wishes to provide full details of an individual case, I will arrange for a more detailed and specific response based on that person&rsquo;s particular circumstances.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
