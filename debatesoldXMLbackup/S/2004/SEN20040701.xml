   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader provide time next week for a debate on the proposed EU constitution? Now that the various leaders in Europe have agreed the constitution, it will have to be <Col N="590"/>formally ratified in each of the member states. The Taoiseach stated yesterday in the D&aacute;il that it could be up to two years before a referendum on the issue is held. This House should at least debate the implications of the constitution. There is a responsibility on pro-European parties in both Houses to come together in some kind of alliance in respect of the upcoming campaign. There are many neo-nationalist and EU-sceptic forces in this country &mdash; people who want to take us out of the European Union. We must plan and work at a campaign over the next year or so. The Nice debacle occurred because pro-European parties did not put a sufficiently strong case to the people. We got a wake-up call at the time. When the referendum is announced, there will be a responsibility and onus on us all to work hard for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote. I ask the Leader to provide time next week for a debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>This morning we heard from the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy <?oasys [ch?>Parlon, who in an arrogant and dismissive way appeared to put to one side the comments of higher civil servants. Will the Leader agree that the best way to proceed on decentralisation is for an Oireachtas committee to go through the concerns of senior and other civil servants on the issue? The last time the finance committee attempted to do so, the big Government whip was taken out, people were told they could not do their job and the whole issue was put to one side. It is now the responsibility of a committee of the House to work through the genuine concerns of civil servants. We are not talking just about people&rsquo;s livelihoods, but their homes, children, family and roots in the community which will now be upended as a result of the arrogant and dismissive comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and others. There needs to be a wake-up call on the issue and an Oireachtas committee should be established to work with civil servants and the Government to bring about a proper form of decentralisation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We raised the issue of decentralisation in this House yesterday with the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. The House will be pleased to hear that his position changed somewhat on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning when he explained why we were outvoted in the finance committee when we sought to have a debate on decentralisation, which was warmly supported by the Fianna F&aacute;il chair of the committee. Suddenly the whip came from on high when a Deputy from one of the Government parties was afraid the number of Bus &Eacute;ireann employees was lower than the number of people who would be transferred to the middle of his constituency in Mitchelstown. He was afraid that Senator Bradford and others might embarrass him with the figures so a debate on the issue prior to the election was refused. I understand they are now prepared to have a debate. It would be helpful to have an open debate on the issue in order to stop the Government messing up another good idea. <Col N="591"/>Decentralisation is a good idea, so we should not mess up the implementation process.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago, I raised the issue of the report of the Mahon tribunal which outlined clear means to reduce to a couple of years the potential 15 years of hearings and to dispose of the matter. This could be done by giving the tribunals the authority to decide whether to pursue publicly and openly examinations of certain aspects required under the terms of reference. They need to be able to decide it is not worth wasting time going down a particular track and to move on to the serious issue. This is an example of where politicians could do something the general public would understand. No one would object to what is being proposed because it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest. It would save money for the State, get the tribunals to focus on the real issues and they would get their business finished in a couple of years rather than 11 or 15 years.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader cast her mind back to 1987 when she was made Minister for Education? At the time she struggled to deal with a huge number of cuts. One of the things that bothered her at the time was that primary schools were being forced to use general purpose rooms and gyms for classrooms. In recent weeks, the House has debated issues of obesity, alcohol and substance abuse and tobacco awareness. However, we are preventing schools from teaching the curriculum. We are denying them access to physical education, which they badly need. While we are still picking up the pieces in regard to the funding of GP rooms in schools, it would be a serious error to turn the clock back on this issue.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be happy to have a debate on the European constitutional treaty when we have a full version of it in English. The first concern is to make sure an authoritative English language version and, I hope eventually, an Irish language version are produced.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader tell the House whether the State Airports Bill, which deals with Aer Rianta, will be taken next week? It is a matter of major concern.</P>

	<P>We live in hope.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Much concern has been expressed in regard to the cost of the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s proposed roads investment. I have never been able to obtain the precise figures on land acquisition costs associated with this. However, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, grinned from ear to ear in the House when I made the point that I had not heard a farmer complain for a long time about the price being paid for land acquisition. I would like to know to what degree the deal which the IFA did regarding land acquisition costs contributed to the huge underestimate of the cost of the roads building programme.</P>
    <P>The country is currently being prosecuted by the European Commission for 118 different breaches of EU environmental law and is being investigated for another 85 alleged breaches. The capacity of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make a mess of things puts him at the head of the Cabinet in this regard. Could we have him to the House to explain how a country which is critically dependent on tourism and which sells itself as a high quality tourist destination, based on the quality of our environment among other things, is in this embarrassing position? If all the prosecutions proceed to the European Court of Justice, we will end up with no tourism industry and potentially with a reputation as the dirtiest country in Europe. This needs to be resolved urgently and immediately if Ireland is to face that level of European embarrassment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Brian Hayes in his call for a debate on the European constitutional treaty. While it may be a two year process, as Senator Hayes pointed out it is important we engage in proactive debate at this stage. As was the case with the Nice treaty, the &ldquo;No&rdquo; lobby is always well organised, albeit that it only represents a minority. It is time the majority were in favour of such things. We should proactively engage in constructive debate at this stage to build for a referendum which may come in the next two years.</P><Col N="593"/>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House so we can actively debate the review of local government funding, which we understand is under way? It is important we feed into that review now rather than reacting to its findings after the fact.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Like many rural Oireachtas Members, I welcome decentralisation. However, I want decentralisation by consent, not by compulsion. As Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly stated, if the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service will discuss this issue, so much the better. We all remember when the plan was announced in the budget and the signs stating &ldquo;Welcome to Parlon country &mdash; decentralisation for Laois and Offaly&rdquo;. However, if one thought it was going to be a significant political issue, I point out that the Progressive Democrats ran approximately 20 candidates in Laois and Offaly at the local elections but got perhaps three seats. We should be cautious and deal with the issue properly and sensibly. When I inquired recently about decentralisation plans for Newcastle West, I was informed that some 26 people had volunteered. I am glad to hear this and am sure there are volunteers for other locations. However, there should not be decentralisation by compulsion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in seeking a debate in regard to the Mahon tribunal. The debate should not only comment on the report of the chairman; we should consider all of the tribunals. It is a sad reflection on this House that having established tribunals on a number of issues, they are now incurring extensive costs and providing entertainment for many radio programmes, which was not the initial intention. Important matters are being addressed and we need to consider on an all-party basis the terms of reference to ensure the costs are brought back into proportion and to allay widespread public disquiet.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, you had reason yesterday to correct me with regard to a comment I made. I do not wish in any way to breach the rules of the Chair. Therefore, would be in order for me to ask if the printing presses have been decommissioned by the Labour Party yet?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is out of order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>We are glad the Senator got the envelopes back. His detection was excellent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Following from the point made by Senator Ryan, can the Leader confirm that the State Airports Bill will be on the Order Paper next week? She answered recently that this is a matter for the other House, which begins Committee Stage of the Bill today. However, the leaks emanating from various Government sources are confusing and any clarification from the Leader would be welcome.</P><Col N="594"/>
    <P>With regard to the fourth interim report of the planning and payments tribunal, raised by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Jim Walsh, when does the Leader envisage the motion coming before the House to amend the terms of reference as requested by Mr. Justice Mahon?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>With reference to Senator Ryan&rsquo;s point on the cost the National Roads Authority pays for land, it is not excessive in my area. While I have heard figures of &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 per acre being paid for land, no money could compensate many farmers for having their farms divided. I know of old homesteads which have been separated from young families living on the land. Farmers do not want to have their land taken for roads. If they receive compensation, they are entitled to every penny they get.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>An article was published in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> on the profits made by insurance companies. Some 20 companies in the market made combined pre-tax profits of almost &euro;750 million last year. I recognise the amount of debate we have had in the House in the context of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and the many areas associated with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and I thank the Leader for organising those debates. However, after all of the relevant legislation has been passed, I hope we can return to the House in the autumn and look forward to a debate having seen a real decrease in the cost of motor insurance, particularly for younger drivers.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I remind Senators that the printing presses of the Labour Party work quite well. We do not use templates or forged signatures.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased that Mullingar and Athlone will benefit from decentralisation. It is important that this process is carried out, but I do not think a gun is being put to anyone&rsquo;s head. It is not only Departments that are being decentralised. Westmeath County Council has set up area offices around the county. There are now four area offices in Westmeath, which is to be welcomed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Do they provide counselling for those who are being decentralised?</P>

	<P>Do you have a question for the Leader?</P>

   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I always do and it is always answered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the facilities in the county hospital that have been available for three years but have not yet been opened?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great pity that Senator <?oasys [ch?>Bannon&rsquo;s former party leader, Deputy Noonan, was unable to obtain the money to open phase 1 from Deputy Quinn.</P>

	<P>I am speaking, Senator. I remind Senators that yesterday I could not accommodate three Senators on the Order of Business. The same will happen today if there is crossfire such as we have witnessed in the House. I ask Senators to be brief.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The area offices are working extremely well. I have no doubt that when decentralisation is implemented, it will operate in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>There is evidence from a number of local authorities that there is significant leakage of water from the networks. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been requested to come to the House to discuss a number of issues. I ask that this issue be dealt with also. The water supply network in a number of local authority areas is faulty and there is major loss through leakage. I would appreciate the opportunity to have a debate on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>During the recent phase of kite-flying by the Minister for Education and Science, one of his last ideas was to streamline the system of means testing for higher education grants. He said he will make the system more sophisticated and to do this he will involve the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science. The whole scheme will probably be centralised. Does this demonstrate a lack of confidence in the current providers of means tests, namely the local authorities and the VECs?</P>
    <P>If his aim is to provide better access for the disadvantaged and other groups he should consider the statistics, which show that children of those who are self-employed receive 35% or 36% of all grants. The Minister said the system will be reformed during the lifetime of the Government rather than during his tenure in office. Despite the fact that he recently announced an increase of 2% in maintenance grants, which is derisory in the current climate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="596"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister to indicate clearly what he is trying to do in the area of higher education and maintenance grants? He has tried other methods such as the reintroduction of fees, but his current method is to target the assets of applicants&rsquo; parents. It is completely unfair of him to change the rules to exclude people from receiving maintenance grants rather than taking account of the need for greater access.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on decentralisation. We seem to have forgotten how important it was to prevent bottlenecks in Dublin, which would have hampered growth. Too much development in a particular area causes serious problems and works against the development of the nation. Decentralisation has provided opportunities for growth and development to communities throughout the country, including my home town. We are pleased that Garda headquarters was moved to our area. I commend the Minister on his choice of town. We should promote decentralisation, which was called for by the Opposition for years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>There is a strong demand among the public for safer streets and a safer countryside.

Dublin is one of the most crime-ridden capitals in Europe, although we have a Dublin-based Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>Yesterday there was a call for a debate about the National Roads Authority and the cost of new roads and motorways. Senator Ryan referred to this matter. I would welcome such a debate, but it is also important to remember the communities that are being affected by the proposed new roads. There is one area in east Galway, New Inn, in which a new motorway, a landfill site and a gas pipeline are all being built. We should take account of this issue in any debate about the cost of new roads.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday Senator Henry and I attended a conference at the D&oacute;chas Centre, the women&rsquo;s prison at Mountjoy. It was an interesting experience which raised many questions. One of the most obvious and urgent issues is the relocation of Mountjoy Prison &mdash; to where will it be moved? The D&oacute;chas Centre will also be relocated. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come to the House to explain his plans for Mountjoy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the provision of prison places in general. Do we even need to increase the number of prison places, as the Minister is suggesting?</P>
    <P>We urgently need a debate about prisons in general. Why are so many young girls imprisoned for theft? I am not trying to demean the effect of such crimes, but 95% of the women in the D&oacute;chas Centre have been convicted of theft. We have also heard of the many people who are in prison, taking up valuable space and costing the State a fortune, for failure to pay fines. There is an urgent need to discuss the issue of prisons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Terry&rsquo;s call for a debate on prisons. I was also at the meeting in the women&rsquo;s prison in Mountjoy. There appears to be a one-man policy on prisons and prison building. We should have a debate on this issue early in the next session, if the Leader will organise it, and also on the proposals of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the Central Mental Hospital. These are serious issues <Col N="598"/>and it appears that all decisions about them are being made by one person.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the pollution of our lakes. It has been brought to my attention that the Carrowmore lake, in Bangor Erris, County Mayo, which is a renowned salmon fishing lake, is dead for fishing. There are two problems, the felling of trees by forestry companies and the use of aerial fertiliser sprays. This is causing severe problems for some lakes. I call for the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to be invited to the House for an urgent debate on the pollution of lakes throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I support calls for further debate on decentralisation. The proper forum for such a debate is the appropriate Oireachtas committee. However, a message should go from this House that, while there is unanimous support for a programme of decentralisation, there are issues that need to be raised and questions to be answered. That needs to be done in the calm light of day. There was all-party support for decentralisation some weeks ago. In that regard the proposal was hijacked and needs to be put back on the rails.</P>
    <P>I support the call for a debate on the proposed EU constitution. Work on the framing of the constitution is coming to a conclusion, but the issue needs to be kept before the people.</P>
    <P>I also request, as did Senator McHugh yesterday, that time be set aside to debate Northern Ireland issues before the summer recess. It is important that we put on record the issues we believe should be progressed.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we instruct the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to redouble his efforts to find Senator Bannon&rsquo;s jacket.</P>

	<P>Last Tuesday I raised the issue of special needs assistants for schools. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House to clarify whether students who are currently receiving special needs assistance will receive the same service in the next school year and for the remainder of the school term. There seems to be confusion in that regard. I am aware of some parents who discovered their children were not on the list and contacted the Department of Education and Science to be told they had made a mistake and that the children are receiving special needs assistance.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain why a circular relating to a decision on the appointment of teachers and principals which was made last March arrived in schools only this week, because this will have severe implications for procedure. Given how it has handled this whole situation, the Department of Education and Science is not the smartest Department in the class.</P>

	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, called for a debate, if <Col N="599"/>possible next week, on the proposed EU constitution. We are in the process of drawing up a timetable for next week and will try to have such a debate included in some format. The Senator made a valid point. All political parties are inclined to wait until such matters are far advanced before laying the groundwork. If we laid the groundwork we might obviate a repetition of the Nice debacle.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the issue of decentralisation and referred to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon. I thought he was very calm and conciliatory this morning. He said his door was open and that anybody could come in, including the Senators who spoke earlier. I hope that will happen and that the Oireachtas committee will be able to renew its discussion on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated his view that the Oireachtas committee would now debate the issue of decentralisation. These are definitely calmer times, and I expect the debate would be fruitful.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also raised the issue of the Mahon tribunal. The Second Stage of the Commissions of Investigation Bill 2003 is to be taken here later today. Its purpose is to simplify and reduce the cost of tribunals and modify the way in which issues are examined by them. Perhaps the interim report could be debated in that context, given that the Senator asked for a debate on the interim report and wanted to know when the change to the terms of reference requested by Judge Mahon would be made. I am sure that information will come through the Office of the Taoiseach or the Department of Finance. I am not sure whether this will be next week.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the issue of primary schools. When times were difficult PE halls and general purpose rooms, as they were called, were used as classrooms as well as for PE. Physical education leads to the holistic development of people. Now that it is being mooted that the lack of it is one of the main causes of obesity, the issue should be discussed. My colleague, Senator Dardis, raised the issue within his own party. Fianna F&aacute;il Senators have also raised it. We will try to have a debate on it next week, if we can find time to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan agreed we should have a debate on the proposed EU constitution. He also asked whether the State Airports Bill will be taken next week. The Committee Stage debate has just begun in the D&aacute;il. We must await its progress. In the meantime we must move ahead with our business as arranged for next week.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the issue of the cost of land acquisition by the NRA. That was a matter of debate in Cabinet at the time. This could tie in with a debate on the NRA and how the cost of land acquisition added to the cost of road building.</P>
    <P>The Senator also stated that Ireland is being prosecuted for 118 breaches of European <Col N="600"/>environmental law. The European Union issues regulations fairly freely. Having said that, it is a large number of breaches. I will seek precise information on how those matters are being dealt with.</P>
    <P>Senator MacSharry agreed we should have a debate on the proposed EU constitution. He also called for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to be invited to the House to debate the review of local government funding so we can have an input rather waiting until it is disbursed and having in input <i>post facto</i>. I will inquire as to whether the Minister, Deputy Cullen, will come to the House to debate the issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane welcomed decentralisation. In the debate in this House everybody was in <?oasys [ch?>favour of it. We need more debate on how it is to be achieved. There will be no compulsion. That would be ridiculous. Nobody wants decentralisation by compulsion. What is sought is decentralisation by agreement. In the 1970s Athlone was the first centre to benefit from decentralisation when the Department of Education moved there. The people love it. It is a huge asset to the town and everybody has settled in. It is a marvellous facility and is working very well. That took place before faxes, e-mail and modern methods of communication came on stream. Decentralisation can and does work. However, it will require effort to get it right.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh also joined in calls for a debate on the Mahon tribunal. I missed the interchange yesterday and cannot, therefore, comment.</P>

    <P>Senator Coghlan asked about the Aer Rianta Bill. As I said, it is being debated in the D&aacute;il<?oasys [jy?>on Committee Stage and we will await developments.</P>
    <P>Senator Scanlon stated that from his knowledge farmers did not get too much for their land. It is one of the beauties of the Seanad that Senators with different views can put those views forward, and that makes for good debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt called for a debate on the NRA and the cost of new roads and motorways. It would be useful to have such a debate because, according to reports in yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers, the increase in such costs is huge.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy called for a debate on insurance company profits. We will have a debate in the autumn on the real decreases in the costs of insurance, bearing in mind the profits made by insurance companies as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn spoke on decentralisation. He also raised the issue of leakage of water from the networks, which is particularly evident in the midlands. I suppose they are older water networks that need to be upgraded. Such a programme is being carried out so we can ask the Minister for <Col N="601"/>the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for firm facts on that matter.</P><?oasys [cl11.5]?>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke spoke about the streamlining of third level fees and maintenance grants. As he spoke, it immediately came to my mind that there is nothing new in education. When I was six months in the job so many years ago, there was to be a streamlining of maintenance grants. Farmers&rsquo; assets were looked at and so on, but it was agreed that would be incorrect because a farmer cannot sell land to pay for something else. There is confusion as both the VECs and county councils deal with different grant applications. I do not know what happens in Dublin, but outside Dublin each county takes applications for particular types of institutions through its VEC, while applications for other institutions such as universities are processed through the county council. Streamlining this process would be of great benefit to students and parents. That is particularly the case with institutes of technology, as they are not sure whether to approach the VEC or the county council. It is an excellent idea to streamline this process.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin praised decentralisation. I am sorry to hear about Senator Bannon&rsquo;s jacket. I would advise him to bring a second jacket when he comes to Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Senator Terry must have had an interesting visit to the women&rsquo;s prison in Mountjoy and she wants a statement on prison policy, as does Senator Henry with regard to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.</P>
    <P>Senator Paddy Burke spoke about the pollution of lakes. He raised it yesterday in the House during the debate on the inland waterways when he mentioned jet skis. Today he claimed that Carrowmore Lake is being heavily polluted by, the felling of trees and agricultural effluent. The old questions and the ways of dealing with them still remain. Lakes are still being polluted by effluent and the over-zealous felling of trees. I know that from my own area. The same Department deals with forestry and lakes and rivers.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford supported a debate on the proposed EU constitution, as well as an Oireachtas debate on decentralisation and on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Fergal Browne spoke about the parents of special needs children. I had two visits <Col N="602"/>this morning from local parents whose children had been getting special needs provision, yet now seem to be off the list. We need to get clarification on this matter. It is a huge issue for parents. It is summer time now, yet September looms for every parent. Once the holiday period comes, parents have to get ready for September. I will endeavour to get a statement from the Minister for Education and Science on special needs next week.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I spoke on this in detail the last day. The Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 requires prosecutions to be taken within a six month period. It is common for legislation to extend this to one or perhaps even two years. To extend it to five years is exceptional and I do not believe that it is warranted in this case. I plead with the Minister to take this point on board. If people are to be prosecuted, they have an entitlement to put their best case forward. When the evidence is up to five years old, that appears to be unacceptable. If six months is the benchmark, as laid down in the Act of 1851, then we should not divert from that by any more than three years. That is why I propose this amendment and I ask the Minister of State to consider it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of situations where an offence which is being committed may not come to light for some time. For example, the damage caused by a breach of a duty of care regarding a discharge or damage caused to a pipe during building works may not be apparent until some time after a related offence was committed. In the circumstances, it is considered appropriate and necessary to provide for the maximum reasonable period of time, during which proceedings may begin following the committing of an offence. In this instance I believe that five years is a reasonable period of time. This five-year requirement is a standard provision in environmental legislation and is included in the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996. It is a reflection of the nature of certain offences under such legislation which, as evidence of the resulting damage is not readily apparent, may not come to light for some time after they are perpetrated. The five-year limit provided for is intended to strike a balance between the rights of persons accused of committing an offence and the opportunity for supervisory and enforcement authorities to discover the offence and initiate a prosecution. As the limit is well established in the <Col N="604"/>environmental legislation, I cannot agree to change that. Consistency across the legislative code is one of the objectives of the ongoing process of regulatory reform. An application of the five-year prosecution limit across the code of environmental legislation complements the same.</P>
    <P>Following Committee Stage I gave serious consideration to the amendment tabled by Senator Bannon with a view to finding a compromise within the time available, but on the advice of my officials and the mere fact that this is not something new I am introducing but something already in place in the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996, it is not a matter of being consistent but of being realistic. It could take some time before the damage showed up. In the circumstances, I regret I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 21, line 22, to delete &ldquo;a scheme&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;regulations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It seems more appropriate to say that the Minister makes regulations rather than makes a scheme. That is the terminology used in most Bills, and perhaps the Minister might consider this amendment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of subsection (3) is to remove any doubt about the power of the Minister to amend or revoke a scheme of financial assistance. It is unnecessary to insert such a provision regarding the amendment or revocation of regulations, as the necessary powers for that purpose are already provided for under section 15(3) of the Interpretation Act 1937. Section 17(1) provides for the making of a scheme in accordance with regulations. While the relevant regulations may in due course be amended or revoked in accordance with the provisions of the Interpretation Act 1937, technically speaking, there is no similar general power regarding schemes <i>per se</i>.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is intended to remove any doubt in that regard by providing explicitly for the amendment or revocation of a scheme as required. It avoids the possibility of a scheme being struck down on a technicality and ensures the smooth transition from one phase of a scheme to the next in the certainty of due legal authority. I stated on Committee Stage that I was unable to accept this amendment on the advice of the Attorney General, and the same pertains today.</P>

    <P FLI="0">This amendment was debated at length on Committee Stage in this House. It concerns notice by <Col N="605"/>electronic mail. The Bill places a legal obligation on people to check their e-mail. That is totally unrealistic. I know that it is one of the methods, and the Minister present on the last occasion pointed out that there are several alternatives available to notify people. I believe there was a provision regarding another Bill whereby the spirit of this amendment was enshrined in legislation, and I hope that the Minister will forgive me for not being able to recount it. However, I appeal to his good nature to accept this amendment on the basis that it is totally unrealistic to place a legal obligation on anyone to check e-mail, particularly given the prevalence of spam in recent years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McCarthy is quite right to say that we debated this at length on Committee Stage. Many of us may not check our e-mail on an absolutely hourly basis, but a hard copy will go out too. I could accept the point made by Senator McCarthy if a hard copy were not being sent out to those who would receive their correspondence via electronic mail. However, in the circumstances, it is difficult to accept the proposition that a significant modern Bill destined to bring old, 19th century legislation into the 21st century should intentionally exclude provision for the service of notices by the most modern means of communications available.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been drafted against the backdrop of an ongoing and comprehensive programme of regulatory reform, the intention of which is to make legislation generally more accessible and facilitate the conduct of administrative affairs in the most efficient manner possible. It would be contrary to the spirit of that programme to prevent the service of notices under the Bill by the most modern and efficient means. The point of providing for the delivery of notices by electronic means is to facilitate efficient and speedy delivery. Where a person requests, that a notice be provided to him or her electronically, it would reflect badly on a modernised regulatory process if that request could not be facilitated. In short, if that is requested, it will be delivered and forwarded by electronic mail. However, a hard copy will also be issued. I hope this explanation is sufficient for Senator McCarthy at least to consider withdrawing the amendment. Without opening another debate, I can assure him there will be a verifiable paper audit trail.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>

    <P FLI="0">We debated this in some detail on a previous occasion. There is a real issue of accountability and transparency. It is important that this amendment be inserted. The section could result in the privatisation of all water services by their transfer from authorities to another prescribed person, which could be a private company, allowing for no element of accountability. There would not be any democratic controls over the process to ensure such accountability. In the era in which we live, with its very strong emphasis on accountability and transparency in the public sector, for example, in the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and the various methods used in the pursuit of transparency and accountability, it is important that we lead by example in legislative terms. I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of section 27 is to provide for the transfer of functions from a water services authority to the Minister or other prescribed body, or from the Minister to a water services authority or prescribed body as required. It is not intended that the level of democratic accountability for any transferred function should be diminished. Subsection (1) provides for the authorisation of such a transfer of functions by regulations rather than, for example, by administrative order. The powers of the Minister to authorise a transfer of function are governed by section 18(5), which provides that any regulation made by the Minister must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and either House may pass a resolution to annul it within 21 days. The Minister is accountable to the Oireachtas therefore in terms of any proposal to transfer functions and it is a matter ultimately for the Oireachtas to decide whether democratic accountability for any function is lessened by a regulation under section 18(1). I gave some consideration to the case made by Senator McCarthy on Committee Stage but for the reasons I have outlined I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of these amendments is to incorporate transparency into the Bill <Col N="607"/>by ensuring that the Minister cannot delegate his duties of work to other persons or bodies. The legislation provides for the issuing of licences for which I presume a cost will be involved &mdash; for example, a body or group will have to pay an annual fee to renew its licence. If the Minister wants to introduce charges, it is important that he should do so himself rather than be able to claim that the imposition of such charges was the work of another body or authority. There is a responsibility on Government to be transparent and let any charges introduced by the Minister be on his own head.</P>
    <P>We have a situation where many State bodies are being broken up and handed over to private and semi-private companies and all of those changes have involved charges. I fear this is the route the Minister wishes to pursue. On the Order of Business I observed Senator MacSharry, a Government Senator, calling for a debate on the funding of local authorities and I could detect the prospect of the introduction of water charges.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a long debate on this issue on Committee Stage during which I outlined clearly that the Bill does not deal with water charges, nor is it a vehicle to introduce charges at some later date. Water charges are provided for separately under other primary legislation, namely, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997, which precludes charges for domestic water services. Even if the Government wanted to introduce provisions purporting to change these existing arrangements, it is impossible to do so by regulation and recent case law attests to this. I reassure Senator Bannon and all Senators in this House that the proposed legislation is not a mechanism to introduce water charges by regulation in the future and such charges are not part of the Government&rsquo;s agenda. The proposed amendments are therefore unnecessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister is honest in his reassurances that this Bill will not result in the imposition of water charges, there is no reason he should not accept this amendment. That is what the amendment is all about.</P>

	<P>The common thread running through these amendments is that they are based on the misconception that the Bill either does or should contain provisions on water charges. As this issue arose on several occasions during the Committee Stage debate and again this morning I thought the matter had been comprehensively dealt with. However, I will reiterate the position.</P>
    <P>The Bill is primarily designed to regulate the delivery and supervision of water services, to enable operating standards to be set and public health and environment to be protected. It deals literally and metaphorically with the nuts and bolts of water services delivery. Water charges are an integral part of the local government financial matrix and are inextricably linked to the broader issue of public financing. It makes sense, therefore, to provide for them by way of financial provisions legislation.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997 precludes the charging of domestic users for water services. This is in line with Government policy. There is no intention on the part of Government to change that scenario. The charging of commercial users for water services is provided for in existing legislation. The Bill does not propose to amend that position. The Minister, during the course of the Second Stage debate, went to great lengths to assure Senators that the Bill would not in any way change the current situation regarding charges. I, too, have given similar assurances. I hope the Senator will accept that the amendments are unnecessary and somewhat inappropriate. If, however, he decides to press the amendments I will be opposing them not for the sake of opposition but for the reasons outlined this morning and on previous occasions.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Minister of State have such difficulty accepting the amendments, which seek to guarantee the public that the system will not be privatised? Given his statement that no water charges will be introduced and that the system will not be privatised why then does he have a difficulty accepting the amendments? I have no doubt that the licensing system proposed in the Bill will be used for the privatisation of water services. The legislation puts in place the structure required to do so and passes responsibility in that regard from the local authorities to the new water services authority. That is a good way of disengaging the two in terms of future privatisation.</P>
    <P>The amendments seek to ensure privatisation will not come on stream in the future. The Government reneged on many of the promises it made prior to the last general election. How can we trust it on this one?</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 40, line 16, to delete &ldquo;executive&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;reserved&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I raised this point on the last occasion we discussed this legislation. A critical issue arises in terms of how local authorities do their work as regards the functions of elected members and officials. Many people, of whom I am one, believe the executive has too much power. Giving powers to unelected officials thereby enhancing the role of county and city managers takes from the role of members. The large turnout in the recent local elections demonstrates a strong belief in the local government system and places enormous trust and faith in the elected members of local authorities, of whom there are almost 900 throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to ensure that difference is narrowed somewhat. Legislation recently enacted removed powers from councillors. Councillors not alone from the Opposition side but from the Government side are aggrieved about that. The representative bodies such as LAMA, the General Council of County Councils, the AMAI and various local government constituent interest groups have made strong representations on the matter. This provision is also applicable to other legislation. A provision in recent legislation took from elected members and gave to county managers the power to set the price for refuse collections. Local authorities, which are under financial pressure will, in their next budget, set prices at unrealistic levels. They may set them at levels above and beyond what elected members would set them at. It is in these areas that accountability, transparency and democracy comes into local government. I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

  <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I dealt comprehensively with this issue on Committee Stage. I accept that it is a fundamental matter of concern to everybody with an interest in the role and functions of local government. I acknowledge Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s concerns in this regard. I assure the House that I am not undermining the role of elected representatives, or excluding them from the process, by providing that the compilation of water services strategy plans will be an executive function. Members will be included in the process. It is a question of pitching their input at an appropriate level.</P><Col N="612"/>
    <P>Water services strategy plans are management and operational plans, in effect, rather than policy plans <i>per se</i>. The primary role of the plans is to outline the level of demand for water services in the functional area of each water services authority. The plans will detail the proposed level of response to the demand. The strategy planning process will be based on a partnership between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the water services authorities. The bodies will ensure that national and local water services agencies are fully synchronised. The relationship between the organisations complements the role of the Minister, who has overall responsibility for supervising the provision of national water services.</P>
    <P>The system will help to ensure that plans for adjoining functional areas are properly integrated and that potential synergies and efficiencies are maximised. It will guard against cumulative impacts, which might have an adverse effect on sustainable development and environmental protection in the surrounding region. The Minister will have the final say about what goes into a water services strategy plan. It would not be appropriate, therefore, to involve members of local authorities directly although they will be involved in the process indirectly. As I said earlier, the involvement of members of local authorities in planning for water services will be at a different level. Their input will take place more appropriately at a broader strategic level, in the context of their input into planning and development issues affecting their local areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires water services authorities to have regard to proper planning and the sustainable development of their areas when they are compiling water services strategy plans. In particular, they must have regard to the relevant county development plans, regional or spatial planning guidelines, housing strategies, special amenity orders and river basin management plans. It is envisaged that consultation will take place at strategic policy committees. It is appropriate to have consultation at that level, in the course of making the plan. It will facilitate co-ordination with strategic policy issues affecting the functional areas of water services authorities. The input that will be pitched at this level will ensure that the strategic overview of councillors is ultimately taken into account in the formulation of water services strategy plans. I am sure county managers will consider the views expressed by members of local authorities when they are preparing the water services strategy plans.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that section 36(3), which states that the making of a water services strategy plan is an executive function, simply reflects the practical distinction that exists in many organisations between operational functions and higher level policy development functions. Similarly, one can distinguish between the management team and the board of directors in a large modern company. I stress that I understand the concerns of <Col N="613"/>Senator McCarthy and other Senators. In this instance, it would not be appropriate for the making of a water services strategy plan to be a reserved function. I hope Senator McCarthy will accept the explanation I have given, bearing in mind that members of local authorities will have an indirect input. It is not a question of sidelining members, as they will have an important role to play in county development plans and strategic policy committees.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply. I would like to speak about the consultation that may or may not take place between a county manager and the members of a local authority. If the decision is an executive one, it will be taken by the county manager irrespective of the views of members. This is particularly true of contentious issues, such as refuse collection services, which will be an extremely controversial issue on Cork County Council. It was controversial in the past when councillors had the power to set the cost of such services.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one could examine the granting of planning permission and the allocation of houses in this context. The Minister of State referred to a practical distinction between the members and the manager. Those of us who have served on local authorities have appealed to county managers on behalf of constituents who have applied for planning permission or are looking for a house. All we can do is make representations, or attempt to influence the manager&rsquo;s decision.</P>
    <P>The critical issue is the role of members of local authorities, which has been reduced somewhat by recent legislation. I will raise this issue every time this House debates Bills that have a direct impact on county and city councillors. I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks and I will withdraw the amendment on that basis. I will make this case when we are dealing with the issue of executive and reserved functions, irrespective of the legislation under discussion.</P>

	<P>The wording of section 45, to which amendment No. 15 refers, was altered on Committee Stage. It now provides that &ldquo;a person who causes any damage&rdquo; to a pipe &ldquo;is guilty of an offence&rdquo;. The change addressed the intention of Senator Bannon&rsquo;s original Committee Stage amendment, which raised concerns about damage <Col N="614"/>being caused to a pipe indirectly by the actions of a third party. Senator Bannon argued that such a person should also be liable. The amendment proposes to add a reference to damage being caused &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo;. Such a reference is unnecessary. If somebody causes damage, it is irrelevant whether they did so &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo;. The introduction of such a distinction would frustrate prosecutions and provide an unintended avenue to escape conviction. The Bill as it stands addresses the intention of Senator Bannon&rsquo;s original amendment. The Bill would be weakened, which I do not consider to be Senator Bannon&rsquo;s intention, if we were to go further by inserting &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo;.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I propose the deletion of the initial words of this section. Legislation is supposed to bring greater clarity to matters but section 46, as drafted, does not do so. I pointed this out when we discussed a similar amendment on Committee Stage. We need clarity because the section is said to mean one thing and then it is said to mean something else. It goes without saying that another enactment may say something different &mdash; it may muddy the waters. I ask the Minister of State to bring clarity to the Bill by agreeing to delete this conditional statement.</P>

	<P>As I pointed out when we debated this matter on Committee Stage, the amendment purports to remove any possibility that another provision in this Bill or another enactment might provide for a change in the <i>status quo</i> established under section 46 and enable alternative consultation requirements to apply. The amendment is not considered appropriate. On the contrary, it is considered reasonable to acknowledge that such a change could occur. The tightening of the provision as proposed could and would, in any event, be overruled at any stage by a future Act of the Oireachtas. In such circumstances, a danger of conflict between section 46 and the relevant new provision would arise and would necessitate a specific amendment to take section 46 into account. While I appreciate the intention of Senator Bannon&rsquo;s amendment, I consider it to be an unnecessary administrative exercise.</P>

    <P FLI="0">This section provides for ministerial discretion, which I would have thought is inherent in every power. Why are we providing for ministerial discretion in the Bill? Am I to presume that the other powers of the Minister in the Bill are not to be exercised at his discretion?

	<P>Senator Bannon is correct that I indicated on Committee Stage that I would consider this amendment and seek advice on it and I have done so. I reviewed the amendment on the assumption that it would be re-tabled but I point out to the House that if the amendment was accepted, the wording of the section would state &ldquo;so as to require the Minister to consult with any Minister of the Government prior to agreeing any regulations&rdquo;. There is a potential ambiguity in that regard in that &ldquo;any&rdquo; might be interpreted as one or all Ministers. Such ambiguity would lead to difficulty in the interpretation of this section. In any event, a requirement for the Minister to consult with all members of the Government before making regulations would not be necessary and would place an unnecessary administrative burden on all concerned. In light of that explanation, I hope the Senator will reconsider his position regarding the amendment.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 53, line 18, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, for a fixed charge,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">As I pointed out the last day, this is a very important amendment, particularly in these times. We are all familiar with the spiralling costs of large and small scale contracts entered into by this and the previous Government at the expense of the taxpayer. We only have to look at what is happening with the cost overruns in the contracts for roads infrastructure. We are told that this country does not have the best system of tendering and some would say our tendering systems are corrupt. I propose that the Bill should stipulate that all contracts entered into must be fixed price contracts. It is important to have more transparency in this area.</P>
    <P>We pointed out the procedures that are in place in local authorities with regard to opening tenders etc. It is important that we have more transparency and that we have fixed price tenders. The overruns are unacceptable because they are at the expense of the taxpayer and I tabled the amendment to bring some control back into this area. There could be five, six or even ten tenders for a particular job and it is not fair on those who are rejected, who may have put in a more realistic tender, to discover subsequently that costs under the successful tender had increased by up to 50%. That is unacceptable and it is time for us, as legislators, to take a stand. That is the reason for the amendment.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the principle behind the amendment and the case being made by Senator Bannon, but I wish to outline the reasons I cannot accept it. We had a long discussion on this amendment on Committee Stage and while peripheral issues were raised at that time, I understand the substantial issue has been dealt with fully.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my view that the insertion of a provision restricting agreements under the section to fixed charge agreements is unnecessarily restrictive and could pre-empt any ongoing development in public procurement policy. I point out to the House that the introduction of fixed charge agreements would pose the question as to the number of tenders we might receive. There may not be too many and competition is the spice of trade. It is important to have a competitive edge in the free market which ensures that we get the best price.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not intended to address public procurement policy and inclusion of a requirement for fixed cost agreements in subsection (2) may <Col N="617"/>lead to a lack of synchronisation between section 50 and what is current public procurement policy. I cannot countenance a situation where procurement policy for water services is out of line with other areas of public procurement policy. It must be applied in a uniform manner and not in a piecemeal way across the different sectors. Regardless of the changes that may be needed in public procurement policy, this Bill is not the appropriate vehicle through which to undertake it. It would have to be dealt with at another time when decisions are being taken on any alterations to public procurement policy. I understand but do not share the Senator&rsquo;s concerns for controls over costs as they are exercised within the framework of a uniform public procurement policy. If this amendment were accepted, it would mark the end of pc sums and contractors would not tender. Public procurement policy has served us well in the provision of water services. This Bill is not the vehicle for any changes, as they will only occur if the public procurement policy is amended.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments as I too query the value of introducing fixed charges. My experience of looking at tenders as a member of a local authority is not the same as Senator Bannon&rsquo;s. I have seen the high and the low tenders. Contractors may not tender if a fixed charge is introduced. Senator Bannon should withdraw this amendment as it is against the public procurement policy that has served us well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this amendment is to end cronyism, which is rife in this country. Members of the public mistrust the format used for tendering. It is their money that is spent to cover project overruns. A halt must be called to overruns of 30% to 40% where expenses are incurred to finish a particular contract. The Minister of State claims that one particular Bill cannot be singled out to do this. However, it must be seriously examined by Government.</P>
    <P>The power of upkeep of primary and secondary roads was taken from the elected local authority members and given to the National Roads Authority. This and other quangos meet behind closed doors and are not accountable, while their annual reports inform of overruns. The onus is on the Government to improve the system in the interest of the taxpayers as they bear the brunt of overrun costs. Members of the public are crying out for these project overruns to be halted. It is not just in roads construction but also in telecommunications, bus and rail service projects with vast amounts being spent on administration, which is the main cause of wastage. Rather than spending money on much needed classrooms and educational services for pupils, it is spent on administration and under the heading &ldquo;miscellaneous costs&rdquo;. The Government must ensure that those miscellaneous costs are teased out from the various bodies and a halt brought to wastage.</P>

	<P>While Senator Bannon did not intend it, the words &ldquo;cronyism&rdquo; and &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; &mdash; I am not sure if &ldquo;nepotism&rdquo; was used &mdash; are sweeping. It is important that no impropriety arises out of the public procurement process. I have always recognised the importance of the private sector as the driving force in the economy. If allegations are made about the process, they should be substantiated. All Members who served on local authorities would have been present when tenders were opened. Such a process would have conformed to the provisions outlined in the 1994 public procurement booklet. Any instances where this did not occur should be brought to attention.</P>

	<P>This is a technical amendment to clarify the subsection on licensing of discharges to sewers. The purpose of this amendment is to take into account circumstances where it might be used in a negligent manner. There are circumstances where the licences have been abandoned. Renewal of licences can be a vehicle to introduce charges. The Minister of State has not elaborated on whether there will be a cost for the registration and annual renewal of these licences with the water service authority. It will apply to large group water schemes with membership over 50 participants. However, this could be reduced to include group schemes with membership of just three participants. My amendment proposes to avoid the potential for this development. On Committee Stage, the Minister of State agreed to re-examine this amendment.</P>

	<P>The provision in subsection 7, which is based on the existing provisions for trade effluent licensing under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 and will be consolidated into this Bill, is intended to weed out old dormant licences and ensure that all licences are relevant and current. It is possible that a particular operation may be legitimately licensed for occasional, sporadic discharge over a four year period but may not be discharging for a cumulative period of more than three years. In such circumstances it is not envisaged that a licence should be considered to be dormant or have ceased to have effect. The existing provision, based on the 1977 Act, has stood the test of time. The three year requirement proved to be effective and has not caused any operational difficulties. Why fix it if it is not broken?</P>

The current service is fairly good but there is a need to improve sewerage systems throughout the country. The Minister of State might indicate if there will be a cost involved in the licensing operation of the water services. People would like to know if another stealth tax is to be introduced by the Minister and the wool pulled over their eyes for the umpteenth time.

We have drawn a line in the sand and are consolidating legislation in a Bill of some 100 sections. I made it clear last week that if some legislation were to turn up, even going back as far as 1250, we would draw a line in the sand. To be fair to the Department and all concerned, this is fine legislation that will serve us well for many years.</P>

	<P>Senator Bannon is right. We discussed this on Committee Stage in conjunction with a Government amendment to give greater flexibility to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in dealing with appeals regarding trade effluent licensing under <Col N="620"/>section 63. The revised provision in subsection (2), as amended on Committee Stage, now enables the board either to allow or refuse an appeal altogether or, alternatively, separately to direct a water services authority as to the granting of a licence or the variation of a licence by amendment, deletion or addition of specified conditions. That Government amendment accepted on Committee Stage essentially covers the point raised by Senator Bannon in his amendment. If he reads section 66 as amended on Committee Stage he will see clearly that the intention of his amendment is now covered in the Bill.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 74, line 1, after &ldquo;unoccupied&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or comprises of a rented dwelling,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It clearly should be the duty of any landlord to ensure that this section is complied with. It is very unfair to impose these burdens on tenants of rented houses. If one has a property, or is the owner of a farm or a house, it is one&rsquo;s duty to see that everything is in order because one has responsibility for what one owns, whether it be material goods or a bank account, for example. One should be in control and know exactly the state of affairs in one&rsquo;s own business. The responsibilities of an owner cannot be imposed on an occupier of a rented property. Everyone should accept the responsibilities of ownership.</P>
    <P>If we accepted more responsibilities in this country, in every area, we would have a better country. This is a shifting of responsibilities to other parties. One can prove that an owner is accountable or has control and if something goes wrong, it is the owner or landlord who should be penalised. He or she should deal with the people accommodated and if they break the law, it is up to him or her to take action. The lines of communication and contact should be directly between the owner or landlord and the State.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate my position as outlined on Committee Stage. If we were to accept these amendments they would place an unreasonable obligation on the owner of a premises to ensure that the actions of a tenant would conform with the requirements under section 70 which deal with the general duties of an owner or an occupier. This would mean that if the tenant were responsible for any damage, an unreasonable burden would be placed on the owner. It is appropriate that liability for breach of a duty of care should be placed fairly and squarely on the perpetrator of that action rather than on a third party. It would be unfair to a landlord to hold him or her responsible when, for example, a tenant <Col N="621"/>discharges a noxious substance into a sewer which could cause a risk to human health. In such a case the tenant should clearly be held liable for his or her actions. To provide otherwise would place a landlord in an invidious position and could leave him or her open to abuse of such a provision by a tenant in the course of a tenancy dispute.</P>
    <P>The current wording offers the most direct means of enforcement of section 70 and therefore the most direct means of ensuring that human health and the environment are adequately protected. I am loath to introduce any provision which would blur these lines of enforcement and in the circumstances cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I propose this amendment because it is clear that the Minister intends to introduce metering and charges for water. He may say I am a doubting Thomas because he has given certain assurances. However, we are talking about the Minister, the water services authority and the transfer of powers to that body. The amendment seeks to safeguard the interests of the public against the reintroduction of water charges. I have documentary evidence that circulars and memorandums have been sent from the Department to local authorities throughout the country in regard to the reintroduction of domestic water charges. I can produce evidence of two recent memorandums to local authorities and I am forewarning the public on the matter.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope there was no forgery involved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention of section 72 is to give water services providers adequate powers to install meters and to have access to them subsequently for maintenance or taking readings. It is based generally on existing provisions in section 68 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878 and section 14 of the Waterworks Clauses Act <Col N="622"/>1863, which have been repealed and consolidated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Such a framework of provisions is essential to enable water service providers to measure the value of services provided and protect the integrity of their services from criminal interference for the purpose of fraudulent diversion of supplies. Provision of meters will also play a vital role in monitoring supplies for water conservation purposes. I pointed out in the House on a number of occasions that at present the loss of water from the time it leaves its source until it arrives in the taps is approximately 50%. It is above this figure in some local authorities and below it in others.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that if meters are required to try to ascertain where water is being lost, conservation should take place and funding should be provided to protect this essential supply, they should be provided. It is not intended to introduce water charges for domestic use. Similar provisions operate in respect of other public utilities such as electricity and gas supply. All of these are essential prerequisites to the provision of well managed and efficient services.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to facilitate and regulate the provision of water services. As I said earlier, it deals literally and metaphorically with the nuts and bolts of the delivery of water services. Metering is central to the delivery of water services. It is essential, therefore, to provide for the powers necessary to implement a proper metering policy from both the perspective of the water services provider and consumers. Section 72 addresses these requirements.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon referred last week to metering of group water schemes. This is a matter for the group water schemes. If the group water trustees decide there should be meters, it is a matter for them. Group water schemes, which were helped by funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, have served us well over the years. If they insist there should be metering, it is a matter for them. We have no intention of interfering in this regard. No one will be more surprised than me if Senator Bannon can produce the circulars that are alleged to have been issued by my Department. I will deal with the matter if the Senator provides me with the circulars. I will refrain from comment until I see the circulars. There will be opportunities in the House in the future to clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>Meters can help to pin down leakage and stem wastage, which will reduce the operating costs of group schemes. If this is the intention, it is only right and proper that they should be allowed to continue without any interference from my Department.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what the Minister of State said. There was a discussion on the Order of Business this morning about water wastage, including leakages and old water schemes. A Senator described major leakages in the midlands. If the Department of the Environment, Heritage and <Col N="623"/>Local Government means anything, it must mean it is concerned about this issue. Metering is one way of dealing with the problem. I do not understand why Senator Bannon is opposed to the installation of meters. I am very familiar with group water schemes in County Galway, which has the largest number of group schemes in the country, where meters have been used to try to deal with the issue. One of the problems with group water schemes is that there is not enough people to maintain or supervise them and, therefore, leakages can go unnoticed for days. It is important to take whatever steps are necessary to deal with leakages and wastage of water. I am reassured by what the Minister of State said in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State spoke at great length in this regard. Local authorities throughout the country are working at a furious pace to put in place a programme in respect of metering supplies. This is an ongoing feature within local authorities. Some people are singled out in year one, year two, year three and year four. We hear much from time to time about EU directives. I am afraid the Government will use EU directives and the fact that we will not get various EU grants as an excuse when it introduces water charges in one or two years&rsquo; time. There have been discussions at local authority level that we may not be able to draw down the maximum grants from Europe for sanitary services and so on if there is not some charge on domestic water supplies.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister would clear the air on whether there will be a shortfall in EU funding if we do not implement an EU directive to charge for water. The nationwide water conservation programme is money well spent. We need an update on how successful the programme has been to date. I have been informed that, following recent studies, approximately 47% of all water processed in reservoirs, etc., is unaccounted for. If this is the case, is the water conservation programme a success?</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 92, line 33, after &ldquo;arbitrator&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;whose decision shall be binding&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to responsibilities. As I said previously, what is the point of engaging an arbitrator if his or her decision is not binding? It is all about taking responsibility and deciding where the buck stops. We need to make clear in the Bill that the decision of the arbitrator will be binding on all parties. We have seen Ministers fall from time to time because they were blamed for decisions. We have seen Ministers across Europe resigning because the buck stops with them. As the buck stops with the arbitrator, it is important to ensure that his or her decision is final. At the <Col N="624"/>end of the day, we want people to take responsibility for their decisions. There have been several examples of no one taking responsibility. A typical example is what happened in Wexford. A typical example which has been highlighted on the Joe Duffy radio show, the news and elsewhere concerns the Taoiseach&rsquo;s signature on letters of one kind or another.</P>

	<P>It did not surprise me that the Senator deviated to other issues. I was not expecting this amendment as I thought I had explained the matter fully on Committee Stage. I thought the Senator had accepted my assurance during the debate that the proposed additional provision is unnecessary as the provision is <Col N="625"/>already included in the relevant legislation governing the appointment of arbitrators. The relevant provision is contained in section 6 of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919, which provides for the intention of amendment No. 27 to section 96. I realise that I, like the Senators, must abide by the rules and will refrain from making any other contribution in regard to the issues raised.</P>

    <P FLI="0">Although I am not happy with all of the Bill, it is likely it will be passed as it is a numbers game at the end of the day. This section effectively confers power on the Minister to unilaterally suspend or amend provisions of the Bill. As a legislator, I have difficulty with this as it goes against the idea behind our role in the House. If we are to permit this section, we need to make it very clear that it can only be used in exceptional circumstances. The Minister acknowledged the wording was weak and, having consulted with those with experience in these matters, I feel the amendments would strengthen the section and hope the Minister can accept them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of section 99 is to ensure the Water Services Act is not at any stage an impediment to the implementation of responses to situations of an emergency nature affecting the national interest. Such provision may be needed from time to time, for example, in situations such as arose during the foot and mouth disease crisis some years ago, when statutory obligations to carry out certain monitoring or inspection functions may be contrary to the national interest. In containing the spread of disease by minimising the instance of entry onto land, it is envisaged that the provisions of section 99 would only be used in rare or exceptional circumstances which resulted in the Houses of the Oireachtas being sufficiently concerned to bring an order under this section into effect in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The procedures under the section are fully transparent and allow for maximum possible accountability via the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="626"/>before an order is made. To this end, therefore, section 99(3) provides that a draft order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the order shall not be made until each House has passed a resolution to approve it. The process proposed, therefore, subjects every order to full due democratic process before it is made.</P>
    <P>I reiterate this will only be used in rare and exceptional circumstances and it will be a matter for both Houses to decide. The value of this section will only come to light in the event that its provisions are needed. While we hope they will not be, we are realists and realise they may be. In the meantime, it is essential that section 99 is retained.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might elaborate on emergency orders. When a water services authority is in place, do the powers rest with the Minister?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will not have the powers but will have the responsibility to bring an order before the Houses. However, it will be a matter for the Houses to decide whether to accept it. Even in exceptional circumstances &mdash; foot and mouth disease is a practical example &mdash; and even if the Oireachtas were not sitting, it would be a matter of recalling the D&aacute;il and Seanad so the decision would be taken by both Houses.</P>
    <P>We are sometimes criticised for taking powers away from Members and giving them to the Executive. In this case, the powers are being retained by the Members of both Houses. When Senator Bannon reflects on this, I think he will agree. I am not opposing this for the sake of opposition but because it is the right thing to do and in the national interest.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 94, to delete lines 29 to 38.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The amendment concerns section 100 which Fine Gael totally opposed on Committee Stage and again opposes on Report Stage. The section effectively states that any pre-1922 legislation which conflicts with the Bill will no longer have effect. Will the Minister tell the House whether there are any pre-1922 statutes which conflict with the Bill? He previously referred to legislation going back to the 12th and 13th centuries but did not greatly elaborate on this. Group water schemes only came into being in the 1920s and 1930s after the State was founded, and I was not aware that the only system of water supply was the old, traditional well, many of which have become obsolete. The correct approach is to repeal the individ<Col N="627"/>ual Acts in an up-front way, not in the indirect way proposed in this section of the Bill.</P>

    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I made it clear on Committee Stage why it is necessary to include this section in the Bill. Section 100 clearly removes any possibility of old, obscure legislative provisions being used to undermine the intent of this Bill. It prevents such provisions from being used to impose legal technicalities on the service. Much of the old legislation dates from the 18th or 19th century, but some, as I stated the last day, goes back to the 13th century &mdash; 1258, to be precise. This Bill draws a line to establish the Water Services Act as the definitive water services legislation which will eclipse all other such legislation.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the detailed research carried out by the officials in my Department which led to this Bill. They worked extremely hard to unearth the old Acts affecting water services, some of which are centuries old. We may all be surprised if something is unearthed, but if it is, section 100 will ensure it does not have any effect. It is possible, going back all those centuries, that obscure local Acts remain in place. We do not want any attempts to interfere with this legislation. Section 100 is necessary as a safety valve. It will prevent the use of any subsequently discovered legislation to derail the new Act. In the circumstances, I do not regret I am unable to accept the amendment. To do so would not be in the public interest or that of the Oireachtas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister will give us an indication of which pre-1922 Acts are being referred to. He must have a list of old Acts provided by departmental officials. Any Government should be able to find this out; the research facilities are there.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Any Acts that are being repealed are clearly referenced in the legislation. If we knew which other Acts were involved, they would also be referenced. We are trying to ensure that in the event of the discovery of a relevant Act after the enactment of this Bill, it will not affect the operation of the legislation. There may be some local Acts that have not yet been discovered. The officials have done a tremendous job of trawling through old legislation to find the Acts that are being consolidated into this Bill. <Col N="628"/>There may be more Acts that are not mentioned in the Bill but we have not yet discovered them. If they were discovered in the future and found to affect the operation of the Act, whoever is here is 20 or 30 years would be highly critical of us for not including this section.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators, particularly those who took an active interest in this debate &mdash; the Opposition spokespersons, Senators Bannon and McCarthy, and on the Government side, Senators Brady and Kitt &mdash; and monitored the passage of the legislation through the House. I thank everybody who contributed to the debate. Although all sides did not always agree about the various points, they approached the debate with the aim of getting the Bill right. The numerous amendments from the Opposition were tabled in good faith and without political interest or intent. I have been happy to accept whatever amendments I could and deal with Members&rsquo; concerns with a view to improving the legislation following our collective deliberations.</P>
    <P>The subject of this Bill may not have been the most enthralling to come before the House in recent times. Nevertheless, it will be seen as an important piece of modernising legislation. In addition to updating the legislative code to underpin modern standards of service delivery, it gathers under one cover, for ease of access, all relevant provisions dealing with the delivery and supervision of water services.</P>
    <P>The Bill paints a clear picture of the responsibilities of both service providers and consumers. It puts in place a robust planning and supervisory regime to ensure that services are delivered in accordance with the best modern standards. It also represents another milestone in <Col N="629"/>the roll-out of the Government&rsquo;s regulatory reform agenda. The introduction of water services licensing will have a significant impact on the standard of water services delivery in rural areas, with benefits for consumers and group water schemes alike.</P>
    <P>I did not have the opportunity to reply to Senator Bannon&rsquo;s reference to what Europe may do in the future. Our position is accepted by Europe and covered in the water framework directive. In the matter of conservation, I must point out that of the &euro;4.4 billion being provided by the Government between 2000 and 2006, we will be providing &euro;300 million for water conservation purposes. This reflects the importance of conservation. The problem of the loss through leakage of up to 50% of water being treated must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>This legislation is of fundamental importance and replaces a venerable legislative code. Let us hope it proves to be as robust as its predecessor. I thank the Senators who took part in the debate and the officials from my own Department who have worked extremely hard and helped the passage of the legislation through the House. There were 104 amendments to be dealt with. The officials have been working on this Bill for a considerable time and it is a credit to them.

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming to the House and dealing with this Bill. The amendments put down by my own party were for the betterment of the Bill and I am glad the Minister accepted some of them and took our concerns into account. There is an onus on the Minister to ensure that waste management plans are in place in the various regions, along with sludge management strategies for counties. This is something that should be prioritised at local authority level when county development plans are prepared. Water conservation plans should be implemented at local authority level because that is where the buck stops. Proper planning and construction of schemes will result in an improvement in the quality and supply of water in different regions. It is important to have groundwater protection plans in place. There are problems in some lakes and rivers. This morning on the Order of Business the Leas-Chathaoirleach mentioned a lake in his area that is partly dead. That should not be allowed to happen. We need catchment management schemes and drainage studies in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I will be a little parochial and ask the Minister to advance some of the water supply schemes in County Longford. When the Seanad adjourned last evening, I contacted the sanitary services department of the local authority in Longford and obtained a copy of the most recent county development plan. It shows that a total of 18 <Col N="630"/>sewerage schemes are at an advanced stage. Some have been approved and are awaiting funding from the Department and there are eight additional schemes in the pipeline for progression within the Department. I hope the Minister and his officials will carefully examine those schemes and get them up and running in the interests of improving the water supply. Longford is part of the midlands with the Shannon on one side and the River Inny on the other. It is important that the projects I mentioned get maximum attention.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in thanking the Minister and his officials for bringing this Bill to the House and for the work they put into it. It is important to have this legislation consolidated. We have discussed the conservation, leakage and wastage of water, on which local authorities have, over the years, done much work. I hope the Minister will take on board our suggestions regarding old networks and provide the necessary funding.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not bother to give an overview of the debate which has gone on for almost eight hours. I thank the Minister for the manner in which he handled this legislation and acknowledge the work of his officials. It is a very technical and detailed Bill. Differences of opinion and debate are important. It is equally important that amendments put forward in good faith and seen to be constructive are accepted. It makes our job here that bit easier and helps to achieve the overall objective of providing good legislation.</P>

   <Title>National Monuments (Amendment) Bill 2004: Second Stage.</Title>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The protection of our archaeological heritage has been a primary concern of Government since the foundation of the State. This is clear from the considerable body of protective legislation which has been enacted over the years, in particular the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 1994. Ireland has also ratified the European convention on the protection of archaeological heritage, known as the Valetta Convention. In implementing this legislation, the national monuments section of my Department has developed a broad administrative and professional structure to oversee the protection of our archaeological heritage.</P>
    <P>The scale of development in recent years as a result of our economic success has presented a greater challenge to the protection and preservation of our archaeological heritage. Over that time, we have striven to maintain a good balance <Col N="631"/>between development needs and archaeological protection in order to achieve sustainable development. The high level of excavation for development purposes has added considerably to our store of knowledge of the past. There are many examples of a good balance being achieved between conservation and development.</P>
    <P>The background to this specific piece of amending legislation, while complex, is familiar to Members of the House. I will summarise the main issues. On foot of an injunction granted by the Supreme Court in February 2003 restraining D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council from undertaking any works in the vicinity of Carrickmines Castle, work on the section of the south eastern motorway in the vicinity of the site was suspended last year pending the granting of a consent under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930. The work involved had been carried out under section 26 excavation licences, but the effect of the Supreme Court judgment was that a consent under the much less frequently used section 14 was appropriate in this case.</P>
    <P>At the request of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government joined in a consent for works at Carrickmines Castle. In accordance with the legislation then existing, the Minister also made the National Monuments (Approval of Joint Consent) Order 2003 on 3 July 2003. This was then laid before each House of the Oireachtas as required. I assure the House that the decisions were not made lightly. A total of 23 submissions on the case were received and considered. Of these, 17 submissions supported the early completion of the project and there were six objections. The Minister also had regard to the advice of his Department&rsquo;s national monuments section that further conditions be inserted in the joint consent to ensure that the works to be undertaken at Carrickmines would be carried out in accordance with best archaeological practice.</P>
    <P>The national monuments legislation has always envisaged that it may be necessary, in certain cases, to interfere with a national monument. These can be for reasons of public health and safety, in the interests of archaeology or for other reasons. In this case the application from the road authority, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, was expressly made on public interest grounds and it was in this context that the order was made. The decision at the time was based on the overall assessment that the public interest in allowing construction of the south eastern motorway along its approved route justified consenting to the works impacting on archaeology at the site. In the Minister&rsquo;s view it had been satisfactorily demonstrated that a systematic approach was adopted by the county council to the archaeological resolution of the Carrickmines site and that the archaeological work undertaken would preserve the main archaeological elements of the site either by record or <i>in situ</i>.</P><Col N="632"/>
    <P>On 23 December 2003 an application for a judicial review of these decisions was made. Following hearings in the High Court and Supreme Court, the High Court held that the Heritage (Transfer of Functions of Commissioners of Public Works) Order 1996, in so far as it purported to transfer the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works under section 14(1)(<i>a</i>) of the National Monuments Acts to the Minister for Arts, Culture and Gaeltacht, was outside the powers conferred on the Government under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts. A 2002 transfer order was similarly found to be invalid. Consequently, the High Court quashed the approval order issued by the Minister. The court stated that a technical glitch had led to its decision. One of the purposes of this Bill is to resolve this matter.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that legislation which is more than 70 years old needs amendment to meet modern regulatory requirements. For example, environmental impact assessments, which include assessment of archaeological impacts and appropriate mitigation measures, are requirements for development consent for some considerable time, but were not a feature in the 1930s.</P>
    <P>The Bill clarifies the roles of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Minister for Finance and Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism as well as the Commissioners of Public Works under the National Monuments Acts so that there is no doubt raised arising from previous transfer of functions orders. A new section 14 consent process is set out which resolves the technical difficulty to which I referred earlier, while also being in line with current best regulatory practice. The Bill also provides that road schemes, where an approval process includes an environmental impact assessment setting out archaeological mitigation, do not need further licences under the Act. However, the Minister can issue directions regarding the mitigation. A procedure for dealing with newly discovered national monuments on such approved road schemes, which have not been identified in the EIS is also provided. The Bill also contains a specific provision regarding the completion of the south-eastern motorway at Carrickmines.</P>
    <P>I will now elaborate on the individual sections of the Bill. Section 1 is a standard provision which defines the term &ldquo;principal Act&rdquo; as meaning the National Monuments Act 1930. Section 2 deletes the definition of Minister from the 1930 Act because it is now dealt with in section 3 and defines the word &ldquo;works&rdquo; as including development works of national, regional or local importance. Section 3 is to clarify the roles of various Ministers following a number of transfer of functions orders. It defines the Minister, for the purposes of the National Monuments Acts, as being the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, unless the context requires otherwise.</P>
    <P>Where a reference in the Acts relates to the function of the day-to-day administration of any <Col N="633"/>property in the guardianship, ownership or management of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister for Finance is defined as the Minister. That reflects the agreement last year that the OPW is responsible for the operational aspects of heritage properties. The functions vested in the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism under the various transfer of departmental administration and ministerial functions orders, and other functions of the Minister for Finance under the Acts, are not affected by this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4, for the avoidance of doubt, confirms the transfers of functions previously vested in the Commissioners of Public Works under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 1994, and which were not previously transferred to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or to the Minister for Finance, as appropriate. Section 5 replaces section 14 of the principal Act. Section 14 of the 1930 Act allowed the Minister to grant a consent for the carrying out of works to a national monument notwithstanding the fact that such works may involve injury to, interference with, or the destruction in whole or in part of the monument. The Minister proposes replacing section 14 with a new section 14 and section 14A, B and C. I will explain those in turn.</P>
    <P>Section 14 now sets out a single-tier process for consenting to works which interfere with national monuments in the ownership of the Minister, a local authority or where a preservation order is in force. This section sets out the factors which the Minister may take into account in reaching a decision on the matter. Those include archaeological, environmental, cultural, social, recreational and economic reasons. Where a consent under this section is granted, a separate excavation licence will not be required. The Minister is, under a new provision in the Bill, obliged to consult with the director of the National Museum of Ireland before granting any such consent. There is also provision for increased penalties in respect of interference with a national monument without the necessary consent. For example, the penalty arising from a conviction on indictment will rise from &euro;62,000 to &euro;10 million.</P>
    <P>The new section 14A provides that the consent of the Minister is not required for works affecting a national monument where the works are connected with an approved road development. That is because the approval process for such roads includes consideration of an environmental impact statement, which will have identified the archaeological impacts involved and the extent of the mitigation required. Neither will a separate excavation licence be required. That approach is in line with Government policy on better regulation, which seeks to avoid duplication of approval processes. However, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be able to issue directions regarding any works of an archaeological nature to be under<Col N="634"/>taken on such a road development to ensure that best practice is followed. The Minister will consult the director of the National Museum of Ireland regarding directions.</P>
    <P>Much time and effort goes into locating sites of archaeological interest during the route-planning process for road schemes with a view to avoiding such sites to the maximum extent possible or, where that is not possible, to mitigating impacts. Scrutiny of old records, site walk-overs and aerial photographs have, in recent years, been supplemented by techniques such as geophysical surveying to gain an impression of what may lie below the ground. However, that approach is not entirely conclusive, and the full picture can only be determined accurately when the topsoil is removed or other intrusive investigation techniques employed.</P>
    <P>Given the nature of archaeology, often unknown and beneath the ground, it is necessary to provide for the mitigation of new monuments of national significance notwithstanding the rigorous environmental assessment and approval process regarding road development. Section 14A, therefore, sets out the detailed procedure for dealing with national monuments newly discovered as part of the road development but not anticipated in the environmental impact statement. The Minister is empowered to issue directions relating to the preservation, mitigation or removal works required, having regard not only to archaeological considerations but also to the public interest considerations set out in the section.</P>
    <P>Where such directions require a change to the original approved road development, the road authority is obliged to inform An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The detailed procedure to be followed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is set out in section 14B. The board can determine if the changes arising from a ministerial direction are a material alteration to the approved scheme and, if so, whether the change has significant adverse impacts on the environment and should be subject to an EIS. Section 14C covers previous provisions enabling the Minister to consent to interference with a monument in the interests of public health and safety.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends section 23 of the 1930 Act, which relates to the reporting of the discovery of archaeological objects. In essence, archaeological objects found will be dealt with under the Minister&rsquo;s directions, which can deal with how those objects will be delivered to the National Museum. That reporting arrangement did not apply to discoveries made during licensed excavations. In line with that exemption, section 6 provides that the reporting requirements do not apply to finds made under sections 14, 14A, 14B and 14C.</P>
    <P>Section 7 updates the provisions for the making of regulations prescribing licence fees. Section 8 provides that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will not need to seek any further consent or licence under the National Monuments Acts regarding the completion of the south-eastern section of the M50. However, the Bill empowers <Col N="635"/>the Minister to issue directions regarding archaeological mitigation and sets out the factors which he may consider when deciding on the nature of such directions. While we are all familiar with the issues relating to the south-eastern motorway; lengthy and very detailed considerations have been given to heritage protection as part of that motorway scheme.</P>
    <P>The European Union directive on environmental impact assessment, or EIA, Directive 85/337/EC, as amended, requires the assessment of environmental effects of certain projects likely to have significant effects on the environment. The directive sets out requirements regarding the type of projects to be subject to EIA, the information to be contained in such an assessment and the procedures to be followed. Regarding road development, those requirements are transposed into Irish legislation through the Roads Act 1993 and the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
    <P>The south-eastern motorway, or SEM, is the final part of the M50 C-ring motorway around Dublin. It extends from the end of the M50 southern cross route motorway at Ballinteer to the M11 Shankill-Bray bypass at Shankill and includes the construction of 10 km. of dual, two-lane motorway, four motorway interchanges, 16 bridges and two underpasses. The south-eastern motorway will form a strategic element of the national road network, providing a safe, high-speed link between the M11 and the other national primary radial routes around Dublin.</P>
    <P>While the legal situation regarding Carrickmines has restricted the contractors&rsquo; access to the site, work on the motorway either side of the site is progressing well with both sections expected to be open to traffic by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The environmental impact statement for the south-eastern motorway was prepared by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in accordance with the requirements of sections 50 and 51 of the Roads Act 1993. The EIS was published in 1997 and approved by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government in 1998 following a public inquiry into the scheme. The EIS contains a non-technical summary, sets the background to the scheme and gives an overall description of the project and an outline of the alternative route options considered. The EIS goes on to deal with specialist environmental topics in detail, including impacts on human beings such as community severance, visual intrusion and noise and vibration. It also discusses impacts on flora and fauna and on the aquatic environment, soils, air quality, climate, landscape, material assets and cultural heritage including archaeology. The EIS also presents information on the interactions between the various environmental sectors as well as the proposed measures to mitigate the significant environmental effects.</P>
    <P>In the planning process leading up to the preparation of the EIS, a number of alternative routes were examined. The options for alternative routes for the south-eastern motorway were <Col N="636"/>restricted to the gap between the extensive housing developments on the southern fringe of Dublin and the Dublin mountains. The available gap was particularly restricted at Carrickmines because of the housing at Brighton, Brennanstown and Glenamuck Roads to the north and the housing and steeply rising ground to the south. The process of consideration of alternatives is set out in detail in chapter 5 of the EIS and a copy of the EIS has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The section of the EIS dealing with archaeology sets out the results of a series of archaeological investigations and surveys during the period 1992 to 1997 aimed at informing the road planning and route selection process. In all, eight archaeological assessment reports were prepared by the archaeological consultants. The assessment process involved desk studies, including examination of all available National Museum of Ireland and departmental files as well as An Foras Forbartha reports. The process also included the field inspection of the route options, terrain potential assessments and aerial, topographical and geophysical surveys. The extensive nature of these procedures was not standard practice at the time. They were adopted in this case so as to allow a more comprehensive assessment to be conducted using state of the art methods. It was, in fact, the first time topographical and geophysical surveys were utilised in the preparation of the archaeological section of an environmental impact statement in Ireland in respect of a road scheme proposal.</P>
    <P>A report issued by the archaeological consultants in April 1996 provided for ameliorative measures regarding archaeology on the scheme. The main archaeological recommendation was to avoid all archaeological sites. Full archaeological excavation was recommended for those areas where avoidance would not be possible. In addition, special recommendations were issued regarding geophysical, topographical and architectural surveys on selected sites. The archaeological studies confirmed that the only known upstanding remains of Carrickmines Castle was the fragment of the gatehouse incorporated into farm sheds on the site in a later period. The castle at Carrickmines was destroyed in 1642 and as such it is to be expected that only subsurface remains exist. On the Carrickmines site, the EIS concluded that &ldquo;this significant and extensive complex will warrant excavation&rdquo;. It also stated: &ldquo;The possibility of taking measures to alter the design of the scheme in this area should be addressed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The preservation of the remaining upstanding element of Carrickmines Castle, namely, the gable wall of the gatehouse, was achieved by the road designers with the introduction of two back to back curves in the motorway in order to create an undisturbed area of 1.5 acres around the only upstanding remains of the castle, between the motorway and the link road north of the motorway. This area is also thought to be the most <Col N="637"/>likely to contain any remains of the castle foundations. This consideration was a major factor in leaving this 1.5 acre site undisturbed.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the practice at the time, non-invasive testing took place on the site of Carrickmines during the course of the EIS. D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council arranged for full archaeological excavations to commence in August 2000. These have been carried out in accordance with methodologies approved and licensed by my Department following consultation with the National Museum of Ireland. As the excavations progressed, the full extent of the work necessary for the complete archaeological excavation and resolution of the area and recording to my Department&rsquo;s requirements gradually became clear. While this had implications for the time and cost of the road project, the National Roads Authority immediately agreed to the excavation of the areas concerned having regard to their potential archaeological significance. The original estimate by the consulting archaeologist and the licensed site director for the completion of the excavations was ten months, to the end of May 2001. However, in May 2001 the period was extended by a further 12 months. The revised completion date of the end of August 2002, involving a further extension of three months for excavation, was agreed in May 2002 by the Department following consultation with the National Museum of Ireland and extensive discussions with the archaeological consultancy and licensed site director responsible for the on-site excavations and the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s project archaeologist.</P>
    <P>Up to 200 archaeologists were involved in the south-eastern motorway at any one time, including as many as 130 on the Carrickmines site. Close contact was maintained at all stages during the process of the excavations between the National Roads Authority, the county council and my Department to ensure that best practice was observed regarding the archaeology uncovered. The final phase of archaeological resolution on the site of Carrickmines Castle entailed further archaeological hand excavation and a finds retrieval strategy to excavate the archaeological deposits of the defensive ditches. In early December 2002 there were up to 60 archaeologists employed on this phase of work on the site. The excavations were completed in January 2003 by which time all accessible areas to be affected by the motorway scheme had been archaeologically resolved either by preservation by record or preservation <i>in situ</i>. Further archaeological excavation will be carried out once limited areas become available which are not currently accessible, for example, under the existing Glenamuck Road.</P>
    <P>The extensive excavations at Carrickmines have uncovered a wealth of information. It is believed that the remains of Carrickmines Castle, which was destroyed in 1642, lie within the area where the existing farmhouse stands. The only upstanding element of the site, the gatehouse, is <Col N="638"/>also extant in this area. These were the findings of the archaeological assessment leading into the environmental impact statement. It was recommended by the archaeological assessment that this area of high archaeological potential be avoided by motorway construction. This recommendation was implemented and the motorway design was altered to avoid the nucleus of the site.</P>
    <P>The result of the extensive excavations at Carrickmines verifies this because, for a large part, it has been the remains of the outer features that have been discovered and excavated. Among the structures discovered were a revetted fosse, mill, mill pool, kiln, avenue and well as well as extensive burials dating to around the early 17th century. A very large material assemblage of finds has also been recovered from the Carrickmines excavations. These are currently being subjected to extensive specialist examination and conservation and include medieval pottery, post-medieval pottery, glass, coins and metal finds, including buckles, brooches, buttons, arrowheads, musket balls and cannon balls. Organic material such as worked timbers, leather shoes, and textiles in the form of unprocessed wool, have also been recovered from the waterlogged areas of the site.</P>
    <P>In July 2002 a submission from An Taisce to the NRA and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council sought changes to the motorway and associated ancillary roads, the main objectives of which were to conserve the archaeological features at the Carrickmines Castle site intact in so far as possible. The specific objectives indicated concerned the preservation of the medieval wall under the roundabout; the fosse, which is part of the castle&rsquo;s outer defences; and the 18th century farmhouse.</P>
    <P>One of the main proposals put forward by An Taisce was for the alignment of the motorway to be shifted to the south west. The NRA and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council assessment established that such a change could not have been accommodated within the motorway scheme and EIS as approved by the Minister in 1998. The NRA and the county council in the course of giving careful consideration to An Taisce&rsquo;s submission identified additional mitigation measures and engineering responses to achieve most of the preservation objectives while respecting the terms of the October 1998 motorway scheme statutory approval and EIS. The measures concerned were approved in September 2002 by the Minister for Transport and provide for the preservation of the following features <i>in situ</i>: the section of fosse over a length of approximately 50 m, which is located within and extends under the Glenamuck Road roundabout; the section of medieval wall located within the above mentioned roundabout; two medieval structures adjacent to the aforementioned roundabout; the 18th century farmhouse; and the section of the remains of the defensive structure under the Glenamuck link road.</P><Col N="639"/>
    <P>The Seanad will therefore understand that extensive archaeological excavations have been carried out at Carrickmines over a period in excess of two and a half years. This work is largely complete with the exception of limited measures relating primarily to the investigation of the area under the old Glenamuck Road and the dismantling and reconstruction of a section of fosse. In view of the provisions of section 8, it would be the intention of the Minister to issue directions to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council as to the manner in which outstanding archaeological works are to be carried out. In this regard he will give special attention to the advice of the archaeologists in the Department.</P>
    <P>These investigations and those already completed at Carrickmines are consistent with the conclusions and recommendations of the approved EIS. I am satisfied therefore to recommend to the Seanad that no further licences under the National Monuments Acts are required for the completion of the south-eastern motorway. The Minister is anxious to ensure that completion of the outstanding archaeological work at Carrickmines will further contribute to the enhancement of the national archaeological record, the understanding of the history and changing settlement patterns of south County Dublin and the knowledge of medieval and post-medieval frontier castle life in the area. I am satisfied the Bill fully caters for this objective. The remaining excavations, such as in the area under the old Glenamuck Road, must await the enactment of this Bill. They will affect less than 10% of the remaining monument which will be preserved for the future.</P>
    <P>Given the rigorous route selection process and EIA, the considerable effort and investment into mitigating the impact of the road development on the archaeology at Carrickmines and the significant public interest in preventing further delay in the completion of this project, I am satisfied to recommend that this section be enacted to allow the south-eastern motorway to be completed.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 9 defines the Short Title, construction, and collective citation of the Act. A number of issues have been raised since this Bill was introduced. I must emphasise the Minister is not being given new wide-sweeping powers to authorise the demolition of national monuments. A power to grant consent to works on national monuments has rested with the Minister since the founding Act. This Bill retains that power but establishes clearly defined procedures and criteria to be applied in the whole process.</P>
    <P>I highlight the fact that under the previous national monuments Acts the National Museum of Ireland had no consultation role regarding a section 14 consent. In this Bill, there is a new provision for the Minister to consult the National Museum of Ireland on section 14 consents and directions. Under the Bill, 14 days are allowed to facilitate this consultation. This time can be extended through agreement with the director of <Col N="640"/>the National Museum. This has already been the case with the consultation for the discovered archaeological site at Woodstown on the N25 in County Waterford. Indeed, my Department already consults the museum on some 2,000 excavation licences a year and this normally takes place over a two to three day period. Therefore I do not envisage that this timescale will be an issue.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention later this year to introduce a Bill to update and consolidate the existing national monuments legislation. This will provide an opportunity to consider the whole national monuments code. In the meanwhile, the Department continues to make good progress in protecting the archaeological heritage. The archaeological survey of Ireland is proceeding well. Some 18 surveys have been published covering over half the country and surveys for part of County Sligo and County Longford will be published this year.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Department do not simply relate to research. Over 8,000 development applications are examined annually to assess the impacts on the archaeological heritage and up to 2,000 excavation licences are issued so that this activity is carried out to professional standards. Codes of practice have been agreed with Bord na M&oacute;na, the NRA, Coillte, the Irish Concrete Federation and EirGrid, the ESB national grid, and the Minister expects to conclude one with the Irish ports authorities later this year.</P>
    <P>Greater public awareness is also important. The survey information is published and data is available to planning authorities to make informed decisions. A summary of all excavation reports in a given year is made available on the web and the Minister will be announcing further initiatives in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. He never rises in this House without referring to my native county of Longford. I thank him for that and would point out that I am a member of Longford Historical Society. Indeed, I was a member of the county council when we moved a resolution for the retention and refurbishment of the 1798 courthouse, a landmark in the centre of Longford town. We recently acquired a grant of &euro;30,000 for the protection and refurbishment of the 12th century Cistercian abbey in Abbeyshrule in County Longford, for which I thank the Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>The National Monuments (Amendment) Bill 2004 is an extremely worrying and indeed suspect piece of legislation, which has been drawn up without consultation. Never has the clash between present and past been greater. The drive to create and expand our horizons is aided and abetted by our increasing knowledge and technological advances. However, the destruction of the primary sources of our history is inexcusable in our headlong rush towards progress and econ<Col N="641"/>omic supremacy. It is up to us to continue and expand the work of our past but if a destruction of our history is permitted in the name of the present and future, we will deprive our children of the invaluable knowledge of their heritage.</P>
    <P>There is no greater history lesson than the one visible in one&rsquo;s own area. Archaeological sites provide a tangible link between the present and the past and give an immediacy to history that has an impact far greater than any written word. Our national monuments are unique and irreplaceable. Visitors are conscious of this and it is the factor which draws them to Ireland. They come to enjoy the rich diversity of our history, heritage and culture. They are even prepared to suffer the less desirable aspects of rip-off Ireland to do so.</P>
    <P>There is an air of desperation and haste about this Bill, which the Minister is seeking to rush through before the summer recess. Let us not overlook the fact that this legislation has been forced upon the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government by a series of mistakes which both he and his Department have made over a number of years and the court&rsquo;s decision on completion of the M50 at Carrickmines.</P>
    <P>There is an acknowledged confusion between Departments in terms of responsibility as outlined in the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 1994. The clarification sought in this legislation is akin to handing over guardianship of our past to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a heavy responsibility &mdash; I am sure the Minister of State will admit &mdash; with potential drastic consequences for the preservation of our national monuments.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not in the House for this debate. If his handling of the debacle of electronic voting is anything to go by, I would have the greatest reservations about the preservation of our heritage. This anxiety is further fuelled by the extraordinary lack of definition and clarification of the term &ldquo;national monument&rdquo; in the Bill. Dr. Dave Edwards of University College Cork remarked that the legislation lacks any basic definition of what is a national monument and comes from the ideological mindset which views heritage as a problem. The Minister of State needs to explain what is, in his opinion, a national monument. I do not believe he understands what is a national monument. This issue must be clarified if every road project is not to be open to the accusation that its path goes through a national monument.</P>
    <P>More worrying is the real fear that a genuine site with legitimate claims to national monument status may be judged by the Minister or his Department to be expendable. In other words, the Minister&rsquo;s word or discretion could cause injury to, interference with or the total destruction of a national monument. That this destruction could be attributed to the perceived public good is a moot point. I strongly urge the Minister <Col N="642"/>to include a proposal for an independently assessed grading of sites according to their importance. The Bill, as drafted, contains no such provision resulting in the interpretation of a national monument and the pitfalls that could accrue to this decision being left to one Department without recourse to expert advice.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the explanatory memorandum, section 5 replaces section 14 of the principal Act as regards injury to national monuments and allows the Minister to grant consent for the carrying out of works to a national monument notwithstanding the fact that such works may involve injury to, interference with or the destruction in whole or in part of the monument. The Ireland of saints and scholars is shaking in its shoes. Can the Minister of State put our fears at rest or will time show that the interests of Mammon have been well served here today at the expense of our heritage? This issue has been raised in the past and was raised again this morning.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill arises from a decision made in the courts last January. However, the situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Carrickmines has deteriorated and is now costing taxpayers &euro;1 million a month. The Bill has been introduced as a direct consequence of the courts overturning the Minister&rsquo;s decision to allow work to destroy or remove medieval remains at Carrickmines Castle. I am personally happier when such restraints can be put into place.</P>
    <P>Construction of necessary infrastructure is one thing but the provisions of this Bill could apply in an <i>ad hoc</i> way to any proposed development, private or public. If passed, this legislation will give total discretion to the Minister to determine what endeavour is of utmost importance, an issue about which there is cross-party concern in both Houses and throughout the country. I refer in that regard to the recent e-voting debacle and the loss to the Government parties in the recent local and European elections. The Bill was introduced as emergency legislation to cope with the impasse at Carrickmines caused by the Supreme Court ruling but, unfortunately, it goes further and removes all protection for national monuments in the face of road development with no veto for the National Museum.</P>
    <P>We must have guarantees that where an irreplaceable archaeological monument is discovered, an alternative route for a proposed road will be found.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice in Mulcreevy <i>v.</i> Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government &mdash; the second Carrickmines case &mdash; referred to the amendments effected by the 1994 Act as being effected in a remarkably tortuous and oblique way. By comparison to the Bill before us, it is a model of coherency. The Bill, as opposed to the 1994 Act which reflected the consensus in Ireland among concerned parties regarding the treatment of national monuments, will eliminate that consensus in order to effect a conclusion to the Carrickmines saga.</P><Col N="643"/>
    <P>I have great concerns about the effects of this legislation on the environment, which should obviously also be of concern to the Minister. Heritage is recognised as an important aspect of the environment fundamentally intertwined with all aspects of living, working and recreation in the country. Protection and conservation of our heritage protects and conserves our quality of life, culture and identity. Our heritage includes many aspects of the world around us &mdash; the landscape, hedgerows and field systems, lakes, rivers, plants and animals. We must recognise the limited capability of the rural landscape to absorb new physical development without compromising its unique character and heritage. It should be the aim of every county development plan to conserve and protect its county&rsquo;s heritage through the process of development control and by affording identified monuments, artefacts and areas of relevance full statutory protection. Another part of our heritage is our history of folklore, language and customs &mdash; our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>Planning applications for housing developments should include provision for the naming of estates in recognition of the heritage of the area in which they are situated. Funding must be made available to investigate and promote the provision of improved access to important archaeological sites. The Government, State agencies and local authorities have been negligent in the provision of proper access to national monuments of importance in different townlands throughout the country. Also, the Government has failed to tackle the issue of trespass and insurance.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the National Roads Authority with total freedom to prepare inadequate environmental impact assessments and to have no regard to the merit of archaeological sites encountered. The Act appears to provide the appearance of a safeguard by creating a role for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but that arises only if the Minister issues a direction. The NRA must inform An Bord Plean&aacute;la if a direction is issued. An Bord Plean&aacute;la must then determine whether the approved road development is materially altered as a result. Ultimately, the hands of An Bord Plean&aacute;la are tied. It does not have a role in respect of national monuments, other than having regard to &ldquo;landscapes of historical culture or archaeological significance&rdquo;. It does not have an influence on national monuments.</P>
    <P>When one takes the various concerns into consideration, it seems that the Minister will be responsible for a delicate balancing act between the past and the future, and between the various interests and the proposals. The wishes of the various interests will be subject to the whim of the Minister of the day. My experience of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, suggests that we should have doubts in that regard. I hope that the scales will be weighted properly. I do not trust the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to play a fair game. If he is not removed from office for other reasons, he will <Col N="644"/>certainly be removed because he intends to dismantle our heritage, culture and archaeological artefacts. I have expressed serious and genuine concerns about the Bill, which Fine Gael will oppose.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for a comprehensive overview of the question of national monuments and the need for this legislation. As he quite rightly said, the measure he has brought before us is necessary as a consequence of the court decision on the completion of the M50 at Carrickmines. He said clearly that there is a vacuum following the court&rsquo;s decision to strike down section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930. When people discuss the cost of these matters, they say that we could spend the money on health or education.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon rightly said that we must consider heritage issues. The protection of archaeological finds is one such important issue. The Minister of State has said not only that we should protect archaeological finds, but also that we should put in place a mechanism to stop anyone from bulldozing or otherwise damaging national monuments. Above all, it is important to work with archaeologists. For that reason, I am glad the Minister of State referred to the new legislative requirement to consult the National Museum and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
    <P>The Bill should place a greater emphasis on the role of local authorities. I was a member of Galway County Council for 17 years. Like other counties, Galway had a county monuments committee during that time, although that role has since been taken over by some of the strategic policy committees. My local authority&rsquo;s monuments committee consisted of a mix of people &mdash; advisory members, honorary members and experts in the field. The work done by such people was excellent. They identified monuments, told us about the history of the monuments and provided the Irish language names of monuments. Many plaques were erected on the sites, in conjunction with Bord F&aacute;ilte. In some cases, walkways were put in place to assist people in getting to monuments. The work of the monuments committee should be recognised and I wish to do so today. I would like the work of local authorities to be recognised too.</P>
    <P>The site of the Battle of Aughrim, one of the most famous battles in this country&rsquo;s history, is near Ballinasloe. Many people visit the site, which is of historical significance, to see where the armies were positioned on the battlefield. At a time when we are conscious of trespass laws and do not want people to have accidents on private property, it is important that certain areas should be mapped out well. It is difficult to do so in respect of private property, however. I am glad that a heritage centre has been developed in the village of Aughrim, but people like to see battlefields and everything else connected with the history of Aughrim.</P><Col N="645"/>
    <P>I reiterate that I would like to see more references to the work of local authorities. Above all, I would like to see a major national monuments Bill, which was mentioned by the Minister of State, to be brought forward by the end of the year or early next year. Such legislation is needed to bring the existing Acts up to date. Many infrastructural projects are being pursued, as the Minister of State said. There has been a legislative vacuum since section 14 of the 1930 Act was rejected. We should do everything in our power to protect historical sites.</P>
    <P>Despite the planning and geophysical studies on particular routes, to which the Minister of State referred, one cannot be sure what one will find when one starts to examine a site on which a project will be constructed. We are aware that the unexpected can happen. It is important that someone is charged with calling a halt if it transpires that a more detailed study of a certain area is needed. It is significant that the Bill refers to the N25 Waterford city bypass. I understand that archaeologists have made substantial discoveries in that area. Such finds should be protected and I hope the Bill will be successful in that regard.</P>
    <P>We spoke about the conservation of water this morning and it is also important to conserve our archaeological heritage. It should be the primary concern of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which has a major role in that regard. The National Monuments Act has been in place since 1930. The Minister of State mentioned that Ireland ratified the Valetta Convention on the protection of archaeological heritage. The Department has a professional structure that is responsible for overseeing the protection of our heritage.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to strike a balance between development needs and protection. There are many examples of good balance, such as the famine memorial near Croagh Patrick. Many people were worried about the development when it was originally proposed to erect a memorial, but a good compromise was reached. That was not the case in respect of mining at Croagh Patrick, another contentious issue that has not been resolved. We will always have to try to balance development and conservation.</P>
    <P>It is worth repeating the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that the legislation is based on the understanding that it will be necessary to interfere with a national monument in certain cases. Good reasons for such interference relate to public health and safety, in particular, but also to archaeology. The application made by the NRA and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was proposed on public interest grounds. The construction of a motorway along an approved route can be justified on the grounds of public interest or health and safety, even if it affects the archaeology of the site. The Minister of State said today the archaeological work undertaken would preserve the main elements of the site, by record or <i>in situ</i>. I take it that is the position.</P><Col N="646"/>
   
    <P>There are certain difficulties in dealing with local authorities, and obviously the existing legislation was unable to deal with some of those more complex issues. For example, if a monument is in the ownership of a local authority there has to be joint consent between the Minister and the local authority. An order has to be made by the Minister, the order must come before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a section 26 excavation licence must be issued. I presume what the Minister is doing, and he can reply on this, is introducing a single tier approval process which removes the need for an excavation licence as the archaeological mitigation can be dealt with in any conditions that accompany the consent. It is clear, however, that has not been happening and that this new process must take place. I hope the amending legislation will give a high priority to the protection of archaeological heritage.</P>
    <P>In addition to the issue of the N25 at Woodstown, there is a reference also in the Bill to the M3 motorway which replaces the existing N3 and bypasses Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells. Six route options were examined, four would have had an adverse impact on the heritage and the preferred one had less impact and also caused significantly less interference with dwellings and land holdings.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In regard to Carrickmines, I understand 130 archaeologists were employed on the site to carry out the excavations and over &euro;6 million will be spent on the archaeology. With that number of people employed and that degree of investment, the excavations will make a significant contribution to our understanding of history and the changing settlement patterns of south County Dublin and enhance the national archaeological record. Less than 10% of what remains of the national monument will be removed by the final works. Over 90% will be preserved in an area of one and a half acres, which will not be impacted on by the motorway. The Bill rightly covers a number of issues in respect of Carrickmines as well as the Waterford and Hill of Tara monuments.</P>
    <P>One of the inspector&rsquo;s reports from An Bord Plean&aacute;la highlighted the level of consideration given to the archaeological impact. The report states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Having regard to all the evidence given at the hearing and the cross-examination of the archaeology impacts in the Tara-Skryne area presented at the hearing and in the details set out in the EIS, I am satisfied that the route as proposed would not have a significant impact on the archaeological landscape associated with the Hill of Tara ... I also consider that the route will not impact significantly on the archaeological landscape associated with the Hill of Skryne.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I am happy with what the Minister has done. Nobody wants to have to amend a Bill that was enacted in 1930 but there is need for a new Act. I hope the Minister will come back here, if not <Col N="647"/>this year then next year, and introduce a comprehensive Bill to deal with national monuments. I hope this Bill will get approval in the House as soon as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether I welcome the Bill. It is a matter of direct interest to me because I live about 100 yards from the works we are talking about and it has been an ongoing saga for about five years. I am not looking for any sympathy from Members of the House but one is living in an uncertain environment for a long period, and I would not wish it upon anybody. There have been bulldozers in place for many years, a series of digs going on, court cases and difficulties in getting in and out of the area because of what has been happening and the saga the Minister outlined to us in his contribution. It is unsatisfactory from all sides, certainly for the residents, the motorists and the archaeologists.</P>
    <P>While I oppose the Bill I acknowledge that the situation could not continue as it is currently. The people there and all those involved were living under the threat of court cases going one way or the other and not knowing whether the road would ever be opened, while having a great deal of sympathy with those who believe that the archaeology, the national monument, as we now know it to be, should be preserved.</P>
    <P>This is a case of two rights. It is not as cut and dried as many people in the House make it out to be. There is no doubt that there is an unanswerable case for archaeology of this sort to be preserved and that if we bury it, it will be gone forever and we can do very little if it is decided to resurrect it. The lessons of history will be hidden from us.</P>
    <P>There is also the argument, which the Government side is making with some eloquence, that there is no justification for holding up the M50 forever, that the practical benefits of the Celtic tiger are great but some of the down side is intolerable, that we have to provide the infrastructure which we failed to do and that we cannot justify blocking a major road for decades, which could be the case, on the altar of some archaeological piety.</P>
    <P>We should learn some of the lessons from this, one of which is that while the case of Carrickmines is very specific, such far-reaching legislation makes bad law. This Bill is a response to a specific difficulty, admittedly a major one, over which there was a cock-up by bureaucrats in the contorted planning procedure. We are now being introduced to a shortcut which gives the Minister a great deal more power. We have to ask, without indulging in the blame game, which is fruitless but fun, how this planning procedure went so badly wrong, the reason it took so long and whether we are putting in place a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>It appears there is a case on the Government side for short-circuiting planning applications of this sort and archaeological digs and for ensuring there is a more efficient and sensitive way of <Col N="648"/>building major roads in a shorter period. One of the lessons of the M50, which we are talking about, is that by the time it is built it is not big enough. The M50 is already inadequate for the purpose for which it was built because the traffic has increased to such an extent that at peak times it is already blocked up. However, there is a certain anticipation about this legislation &mdash; the bulldozers and lorries are leaving less than a few hundred yards untouched, obviously anticipating this legislation being passed and signed by the President and the works being done very quickly.</P>
    <P>The myth that those who protested against this section of the motorway were headbangers must be dismissed. These were caring people, who protested at some risk to their employment, and not unemployed layabouts. They were dedicated to these archaeological finds with a genuine interest and concern that they were about to be destroyed. When this legislation is passed, it should be recognised that it was mistake for a short-term measure. Those protesters, many of whom I met, had a deep concern, very different from that of motorists, about archaeology and were not doing it for any selfish motives.</P>
    <P>I am always suspicious of the words spoken by Ministers when written by civil servants. They always sound so innocent but can be translated into something not so innocent. The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech specifically used the term &ldquo;single tier process&rdquo; which sounds pretty sensible when there is a blockage in the system. However, single tier process means that the various powers held by bodies such as the Office of Public Works, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the National Monuments are to be transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This may speed up the process but it also removes a large amount of the input necessary to resolving a problem of this sort that requires archaeological and other expertise. No Minister or civil servant has the expertise to take on these powers and make informed judgments.</P>
    <P>Section 5, which substitutes section 14 of the principal Act, makes me more suspicious. The amended section 14 will require the Minister to consult with the Director of the National Museum. However, the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; in legislation means nothing. Those Members who are veterans of the Universities Act will know that consultation is not worth the paper it is written on. It simply means that the Minister, if he does make a telephone call to the person in question, will ignore the consultation if he or she feels like it. Recently, regarding a Government appointment to the board of the University of Dublin, the Minister for Education and Science was required by law to consult the provost. However, it never occurred because the Minister realised that whatever the provost said did not matter. The call was never made, such was the ministerial contempt for the clause. The amended section 14 requiring the Minister to consult with the Director of the National Museum is just a fig <Col N="649"/>leaf. What the director says does not matter because the Minister can do whatever he or she likes.</P>
    <P>I became more suspicious with the clause on criteria to be used which were referred to in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech. It reads:</P>
    <P LI="1">The Minister is empowered to issue directions relating to the preservation, mitigation or removal works required having regard not only to archaeological considerations but also to the public interest considerations set out in the section.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The public interest consideration means that the Minister will make up his mind on any damn grounds he or she wishes. This section sets out the factors &ldquo;which the Minister may take into account&rdquo;. I noted the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; which means he or she does not have to. All the fluff that is easy to put into legislation is then listed &mdash; archaeological, environmental, cultural, social, recreational and economic reasons. The speech stated &ldquo;where a consent on this section is granted a separate excavation licence will not required. The Minister is . . . obliged to consult with the Director of the National Museum&rdquo;. We have given a complete blank cheque to the Minister. The old rhubarb in section 14 states the Minister may take archaeological, environmental, cultural, social, recreational or economic reasons into account. It is built up with long words to make it sound worthy and politically correct. It then states that, apart from all this, the Minister has to take the public interest into consideration. All the archaeological and other considerations will now be subordinate to political pressure.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this is a good or bad provision. However, the Carrickmines Castle process has been tortuous. The Government has become fed up because of motorists&rsquo; dissatisfaction and has decided to take the power into its hands. There is too much political heat on this one so it has said to hell with the archaeological and environmental considerations. That is a bad principle of law. Whereas those who live in the Carrickmines area have become impatient with the process, it is not a good principle to legislate for others on the basis of a single problem that only affects motorists. This Bill, under the cover of Carrickmines, is changing the whole law as regards planning and archaeology. It gives powers to the Minister which were held by bodies far better equipped to understand the difficulties encountered in an archaeological find of this sort.</P>
    <P>Why is it necessary to give the Minister the power to administer the discovery of archaeological objects once they have been unearthed? This provision has slipped into the Bill for no reason and has nothing to do with the specific problem faced. It has slipped in unnoticed and causes no controversy because of the Carrickmines case. Why have the penalties for damage to monuments been increased when discoveries are far more important? It would be better to catch those who damage sites rather than simply stating the <Col N="650"/>penalties. Why is there no grading system for national monuments? National monuments are graded as either positive or negative. A building is either a national monument or not. This makes life difficult for legislators. A grading system with little bureaucracy which gives a Minister or an administering body the power to give the monument a grade, subject to different standards of examination and care, should be introduced.</P>
    <P>All national monuments cannot be placed in the same category. Some are much more important than others and some must be sacrificed if major roads are to go through. I do not know the value of Carrickmines as an archaeological site. I cannot see the castle when I walk by and I know there is only a small gable end left. One can see a part of the moat and the fosse when walking there, but because I have not got the expertise, I do not know whether this is what Senator Bohan called a pile of old stones or a very precious national monument. There are different archaeological interpretations with people offering entirely different opinions, coming from different bases of expertise, and it is very confusing. It would be very useful if we had a certain grading of national monuments to give lay people some idea of whether this is a valuable historic site or something we could easily let go. All such sites should not have to go through the procedure which Carrickmines has had to go through, or else no roads will be built.</P>
    <P>This Bill is bad because of section 14. Its language is dishonest and it disguises the fact that it gives all powers to the Minister while using the language of archaeology to pay lip service to the environment, in which it does not believe. For that reason, and because it is a massive over-reaction to a specific problem, taking powers to itself which will be used elsewhere and are unnecessary and also because it uses the Carrickmines issue for other areas like Tara and Waterford, the Bill should be opposed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I also welcome the publication of this Bill and the opportunity to speak on it. Varying views have been expressed on both sides of the House but we all agree on the responsibility to preserve our heritage. Senator Bannon noted the different types of heritage we have in Ireland and nobody in this House has ever said that we have no responsibility in that area.</P>
    <P>Early planning is essential in getting the right balance between preservation and development. That is what this Bill is about, particularly with regard to the sites mentioned. Regarding roads, a mechanism is in place to allow for the earliest possible involvement of archaeologists. It is a code of practice in place between the Department and the NRA. Archaeologists are involved from the earliest stages of route selection right through the process, including the environmental impact survey. It also allows for dealing with an unexpected discovery in the course of a development, as has happened recently in Waterford. No matter <Col N="651"/>what type of development in involved, we all know there is always a possibility that some find will be made in the course of it and the mechanisms are already in place to deal with such finds. The Bill underscores and strengthens that process.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross described in detail the Carrickmines situation, which he knows well. Action must be taken because it involves interests of safety, the economy and the greater good. A 10 km. section of road which should have taken two years to build is unfinished in its seventh year, which must make us a laughing stock. Following the court decision in January it was clear that some action had to be taken. This legislation is a wholly appropriate response to what has become a farcical situation. Some 130 archaeologists have devoted time to Carrickmines at a cost of more than &euro;6 million. Despite everything that has gone on, 90% of the site will be preserved and left intact in an area of one and a half acres which will not be impacted on by the motorway. That must be considered preservation of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>Unexpected discoveries can be made, but when a mechanism is in place to remove, research and adequately preserve whatever is found, that is the balance needed. That is what this Bill is about. Regarding the Hill of Tara and the Skryne site, Senator Bannon is aware that the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has heard speakers on both sides of the argument. The general wisdom among the expert opinions I have come across is that the proposed route will have the least impact of all of the proposals regarding what we all agree is one of our most valued national attractions. There are other possible sites which have come up again in the course of excavations currently going on. If these are properly investigated and any significant finds removed or preserved, it is in the wider interest that work should continue on the site.</P>
    <P>One speaker mentioned consultation. There is a great deal of consultation. As Senator Ross noted, anyone is entitled to make his or her opinion known. Archaeology is like other areas of expertise &mdash; one can put ten archaeologists in a room and get ten different interpretations of what is on the ground. That is natural. When we go through the different developments which have taken place, particularly at Carrickmines, someone must take responsibility. The current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has no difficulty taking such responsibility.</P>
    <P>Regarding Woodstown in Waterford, the investigation is ongoing there, again at the behest of the Minister. As this unfolds, the right decisions will be made. There will be as many consultations as possible on the issues. The Bill modernises legislation which could never have envisaged the scale of development we currently have, even up to the publication of the last Monuments Act in <Col N="652"/>1994. Even then, particularly in Dublin, there was not half the amount of development that has taken place in the past ten years. Naturally enough, while all this development is going on, given the nature of Irish history, it is only natural that discoveries are made and will be made far into the future as cities and towns develop. As the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, indicated, this legislation is part of an ongoing process to consolidate all the monuments legislation in effect since the 1930s. When one considers the level of development that has taken place around the country, in rural as well as urban areas, including holiday homes, interpretative centres and recreational facilities, we must have a framework in place. The Minister has indicated that such a framework will be worked on and brought forward either later this year or early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy of better regulation is aimed at avoiding duplication in respect of applications. Avoiding duplication when issuing licences or consent by changing from a three tier system to a single tier system is to be welcomed. It will mean less administration and give responsibility for decision-making to the Minister, in consultation with the National Museum, which is appropriate. One is not asking experts for their opinion just to pass the time of day but in order to make a decision based on the information received. Being in Government is about listening to people and making decisions, based on what one is told, particularly in regard to this legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has not listened in the past.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of developments throughout the country which, in the greater good, must be completed. Due consideration will be given to the different situations these developments will present, together with a comprehensive examination of all their archaeological, historical and heritage aspects. Where small infills took place in the past ten years, particularly in Dublin, no one bothered to examine what was in the ground. Developments took place willy nilly because no guidelines were in place. We now have a framework which is very effective. An indication of this effectiveness is that when major discoveries are made, as in the case of Waterford, which could be of international importance, there will be a mechanism in place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the Bill and look forward to its passage through the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Ormonde.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of what has been said on this side of the House. The legislation is controversial in what it seeks to do because it goes far beyond what is required in this instance. We are well aware of the Carrickmines issue, which is a source of great pain to the many motorists who will <Col N="653"/>benefit from the successful conclusion of that stretch of the motorway. This is an era when we are used to seeing many fine road projects being concluded, not least in my area. These include the Jack Lynch Tunnel, the Watergrasshill bypass, the Rathcormac bypass, the work being carried out near Cashel and the proposed bypasses for Fermoy and Mitchelstown. This is an indication of the strength of the economy, the way the NRA has done its business and the progress made in major infrastructural projects in recent years.</P>
    <P>These projects were necessary and very little sacrifice was made in terms of national monuments, which is not the case in regard to Carrickmines. We must take seriously the implications of the legislation. Some Senators pointed out other archaeological finds and the potential to discover more. I fear the passing of the legislation will allow for a disregard for our national heritage in cases where roadways will be favoured over monuments. It is important to remember that the Minister has responsibility not only for the environment, but also for heritage and local government. We must be aware of the Minister&rsquo;s title in the context of what he sets out to do.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Minister to protect our heritage. Section 5 of the Bill allows the Minister to demolish, destroy or export archaeological or built heritage if he or she deems it necessary. The only caveat is that he or she must wait 14 days for a reply from the Director of the National Museum of Ireland. It is impractical and unrealistic to expect the character of any find to be assessed in detail and to satisfactory levels within 14 days. No one knew initially the extent of the Carrickmines find. I share Senator Ross&rsquo;s view in this context. It is fair to say the vast majority of protesters in this case were genuinely concerned about the preservation of our heritage. As Senator Ross said, very few of them were layabouts or idle. These people made a risky decision in terms of applying time and energy to their protest.</P>
    <P>It was only after considerable time was spent assessing the find at Carrickmines that the full extent of it became obvious. To expect the nature of the find to be assessed in such a short time is totally unrealistic. It makes the political caveat meaningless because the Minister will have absolute discretion to do what he or she wants. This is the thrust of the legislation, which is why there is so much genuine concern about it. Modern technology in terms of geophysics and photography has revealed the greater depth of this type of heritage than one would have previously imagined, and these have been multiplied. The more we engage in improvement works in this area and bring on stream projects, the more we will be involved in digging, demolition and structural changes that will allow us to make these finds. There is a great fear that the passing of the legislation will provide a form of legal safeguard for the Minister to vandalise our national heritage. Priorities change dramatically in this context.</P><Col N="654"/>
    <P>The contents of Lissadell House were sold recently without reference to its future. This is another example of where we have sacrificed heritage over commercial interests. The impact of the distribution of the contents to the highest bidder, including the heritage of the house and its land, was not taken into consideration. Likewise the house was disposed of, despite many cries to the contrary from interested parties and observers. A controversial decision of the Government was the purchase of Farmleigh House. Even though a lot of money was spent to refurbish the house, it was a good and brave decision. Perhaps future generations will appreciate the house more than we do. The pursuit of the preservation of our national heritage far outweighs commercial interests, and rightly so. There are many more buildings in this country of significant interest which are not being preserved. They are being allowed to be pursued in the private market by those who do not have the interests of the country or its heritage at heart.</P>
    <P>While the Bill was originally intended to deal with the Carrickmines case, and the technical issue which arose from the Supreme Court decision, it will now open the floodgates for the destruction of far more of our archaeological and built heritage than was possible under the original Act. It is a bridge too far &mdash; no pun intended. We are pushing the boat out in this regard.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the An Bord Plean&aacute;la inspector&rsquo;s report. I wonder is he or she was the same inspector who gave 28 reasons why an incinerator should not be located in the lower harbour area of Cork city, and we all know what has happened since then. The board, led by a majority vote, decided to ignore this advice and grant permission for the incinerator.</P>

	<P>This gave a huge sense of false hope to those vehemently opposed to the project. However, it shows how the various organs of the State can be used to suit different opinions in what is a long-running dispute. There have been many debates in the House on proper planning and the role of outside bodies, and we have complained about various outside interest groups. Irrespective of the extent of the disagreements, we recognise that in the pursuit of proper planning, taking due cognisance of the institutions of the State, we must balance the preservation of heritage and the short-term needs of the people, motorists in this instance.</P>
    <P>My party will oppose the Bill on all Stages. We regret that the Minister is giving himself too much power. Given that we debated the Water Services Bill in the House today, other issues arise in regard to the decision making ability of officials and elected members and the extent of the abuse of power. This is one case where too much power goes to the Minister of the day and this will not serve the interests of the State. I accept that the Bill will pass despite the many fine words against <Col N="655"/>it. However, in due course, when we realise the extent of fines in other areas, we will understand the huge discretion accorded to the Minister under the Bill. It is regrettable and I will oppose the Bill vehemently. I appeal to the Minister to give due cognisance to heritage, of which the nation is very proud.</P>

   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and thank Senator McCarthy for giving me the opportunity to contribute on the Bill. I listened carefully to the comments being made across the floor and agree with much of what was said during the debate. I live close to the area which has been the subject of the long-running saga surrounding the extension of the M50 to the south-eastern motorway. Given the events of the past ten years, I naturally ask how we are to strike a balance between protecting our monuments and environment and making progress in the common good.</P>
    <P>I am of course an environmentalist and love our heritage. I worked with the county council in south Dublin for 19 years. During that time, I campaigned for the preservation of the magnificent Rathfarnham Castle and am proud and delighted it remains a symbol of our heritage. Riversdale House, associated with WB Yeats, is also in the area and was the subject of a campaign, of which I was part, whereby a preservation order was put on the building. Therefore, it cannot be said I am not anxious to protect the environment and our national monuments.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, we must ask how we can balance the necessary building of roads when excavation works uncover national monuments in their path, which is also now an issue on the motorway route in County Waterford. Would the public want us to delay projects for ten years and not make progress? A balance must be struck. We must revisit the issue and update the national monuments legislation in the future while using the Bill as an interim measure in the context of the decisions which must be made to allow the M50 development to proceed without interference to the common good.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I am concerned it would give too much power to the Minister in the future, although I admire the Minister and welcome his decisions on major projects. Let us go back to the drawing board. If we can send rockets to the moon, we should be able, before we reach the planning and design phase, to determine a proper route which factors in the possibility of heritage sites and excavation works. In this context, we should revisit the national monuments legislation and have a more comprehensive discussion regarding improved co-ordination with local authorities.</P>
    <P>I read of an interesting committee in Cork, the brief of which was to survey and protect all of the monuments in County Cork. All local authorities should become more involved in this area and work with outside experts, the Department of the <Col N="656"/>Environment, Heritage and Local Government and other agencies to try to get ahead of ourselves when deciding on future routes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill only on the basis that it is proper for the type of project under way at Carrickmines. For five years, I have experienced delays on the M50 and there is a significant cost to the public purse in this regard. While the Bill is necessary, we should return to the drawing board to consider how we may make preparations for the future. At the same time, I accept that until excavations are made, we do not know what may be found. I compliment the archaeologists and other heritage experts involved with the M50 project who have a genuine interest in protecting our heritage. However, we must also think in terms of the common good. The dilemma for the Minister is to get the balance right between the common good and protecting our heritage. I know the Minister is very much in sympathy with this thinking.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill has a number of immediately objectionable features. The lack of consultation surrounding the Bill is reprehensible, if not sinister. It is not confined to Carrickmines or even limited to what might be called crisis management in the construction of roads. It is a knee-jerk reaction to the Carrickmines debacle and a profound and radical change to the provisions of the existing National Monuments Acts of 1930 and 1994.</P>
    <P>There is a long-standing consensus in regard to the treatment of national monuments, not merely among political parties but among the broad community of officials and experts concerned with the preservation of Ireland&rsquo;s archaeological and historical heritage. It is proposed in the Bill to dismantle that consensus without permitting a proper national discussion. In legislative terms, the Bill can be characterised as an act of vandalism. The removal of any safeguards beyond the whim of the Minister of the day, in the absence of expert advice, is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>In every other legislative area there is a plethora of independently constituted expert bodies for which major areas of administration have been developed. This is the trend in domestic and European legislation. However, the Minister has chosen to go against international standards in this regard. One might have expected that for a major legislative change of this kind, the Minister, as part of the process of public consultation, would conduct a study into the manner in which other states address these issues. He will not do so, however, for the very good reason that it would expose the gross deficiencies, in the legislation.</P><Col N="657"/>
    <P>This is an extraordinarily sensitive issue. To vest this power in the Minister alone is to issue a death warrant for national monuments. The Bill is not concerned with the protection of our archaeological heritage from the outset of the planning process. It does not address the planning process on an integrated basis. It provides no incentive for local authorities or the National Roads Authority to engage in good practice and ensure matters are dealt with correctly from the start.</P>
    <P>Waterford is the setting for what has been described as one of the most significant finds of Viking remains in Europe &mdash; a complete Viking town. We do not know enough about it; there seems to be a cover-up about what the find consists of. The Department has this information but it seems to have been kept from the public for a long time before it came to light. If it is such an important find, the site should certainly be excavated and preserved. The rest of Europe should be allowed to share in the importance of the site. It could prove to be of significant benefit to the tourism industry in the region. I spoke to Senator Henry yesterday about what has been done with similar sites in York. The potential for the development of this site as a tourist attraction is there for all to see. The site should be developed.</P>
    <P>Of course we want the long-awaited Waterford city bypass to proceed. However, there is no reason both projects cannot exist side by side if we adopt a common sense approach. This can be a win-win situation for Waterford and the whole country. I want to know the Minister&rsquo;s present position on this site. When will a decision be made? When will the Minister explain the rationale behind his decision on this most important issue?</P>
    <P>The National Monuments Bill suggests that the Minister has a monopoly on wisdom when it comes to the protection of our heritage and national monuments. It is a reversal of the tried and trusted method of consultation, which has served the country down through the years. Nobody wants another Carrickmines situation, but this legislation is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Senator Ormonde was correct in saying this issue was all about balance. The Bill could hardly propose a less balanced approach to resolving the potential conflict between providing vital infrastructure, and protecting important heritage sites.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Cummins for sharing time. I welcome the Minister and commend him and his officials on the fact that the environment element of his Department appears to be in action &mdash; his speech is printed on both sides of the paper we were given. The heritage part, however, seems to have made a terrible mess of things. Senator Ormonde is being more than hopeful when she says she welcomes the Bill because it will deal with the Carrickmines situation but hopes that we will then go back to the drawing board. That will not happen. This Bill <Col N="658"/>gives the Minister complete power to decide to destroy and deface national monuments. The part about consulting the National Museum is only a fig leaf. It does not mean the National Museum has a veto.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that the discovery of Carrickmines Castle was not looked upon as a good thing. It was not seen as being important for the area, which, apart from many affluent houses and a good tennis club, has little to recommend it. We could have made Carrickmines Castle an important feature of the area. I am sure all Members have been to see it; the remains are not extensive. The main problem was not with the M50 but the junction with Glenamuck Road and the fact that roundabouts were built to deal with the junction. We seem to be incapable of dealing with junctions in any other way, but roundabouts have not been successful in many cases. For example, the Red Cow roundabout is now known as the mad cow roundabout. There, we are told, a flyover will have to be built to deal with the traffic problems.</P>
    <P>Senator Brady said we must be a laughing stock in Europe over the issue of Carrickmines. I presume he means we are a laughing stock because we did not engage someone in the National Roads Authority to have another look at how this junction could be dealt with. The problem is due to only one of four roundabouts. If one looks at the valley, the possibility of a flyover is obvious. I admit that most of such constructions I have seen were built by the master road-builders of Europe, the Italians. I was in Verona when an important archaeological site was found in a pretty shabby part of the city. The next time I was there the area had become the important Porta Antica Leona. The road had been built in such a way that passers-by could see down into the excavations. A piece of an original door had been found on the side of a building and fixed up. This is so unlike what happened in Jamestown, where, to help the traffic get through, the last little bit of the wall that had once surrounded the town was knocked down. How short-sighted can we be? We keep insisting that we must bring tourists to the country, but we need to have something to show them.</P>
    <P>We should remember what happened in Slea Head the other day, when American tourists were brought there only to find that a whole earthworks had been displaced by someone local. When a motorway was being built in Bolgheri and it was discovered that the proposed route threatened an avenue of cypresses that had been mentioned in a poem by Dante, it was simply decided that the motorway should have a bigger loop so the cypresses could be saved. Everyone knew about the great avenue of cypresses. Bolgheri has not much else apart from a decent beach. An archaeological site was discovered in a busy area of Cologne. The Germans, like, ourselves, are into hefty roadworks, but when Roman mosaics were discovered near the cathedral, they managed to raise the road and preserve what was <Col N="659"/>underneath. Now tourists are able to go in and out of the site.</P>
    <P>We are incredibly short-sighted. I am glad Senator Cummins mentioned the Viking settlement in Waterford. This legislation will be able to deal with that. When we were talking yesterday I mentioned I was one of the foolish people who had tried to preserve Woodquay. Years afterwards, when I was near York, I decided to go and see the incredible Viking settlement there. I went to an area, which would not fill two rooms, but we had to go around in little boxes on a track because the site was considered so precious. All one ever hears about York, apart from its tremendous minster, is, its Viking remains.</P>
    <P>We must look after our heritage because it is not just the past that is important but what we will do with it in the future. I sincerely hope the Minister will reconsider this legislation because it will allow damnable things to happen to many important sites around the country. There are many more which will be affected. The beautifully preserved Trim Castle is one of the loveliest places one could see and we are to have a Holiday Inn beside it. This is a very foolish Bill and I will oppose it.</P>

    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There has been a certain hand-wringing quality to this debate. I intend to be brisk in more senses than one. I compliment the Minister on his speech which gives a detailed explanation not alone of the legislation, but of the background. I also compliment Senator Bannon on his activity in the Longford Historical Society. I am a member of the Tipperary Historical Society. I have no idea what type of car the Senator drives, but one can be a motorist and be committed to history and archaeology.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the National Roads Authority and archaeology is like that between the devil and holy water. It wants to avoid it if at all possible. Where the archaeology is visible, for example, at the Rock of Cashel, it has been given a very wide berth so there is no question of damage to the monument or to visibility from the monument that would spoil the views and perspectives around it. It is a deep paradox that just as the National Roads Authority plants more trees than any other body, with the exception of Coillte, it is by far the largest patron of archaeology in this country. I almost fear to think what the archaeological profession would do without the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>One important provision of the Bill is that it allows more flexibility without going back to square one. That seems to be in favour of rather than against the interests of archaeology.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am quite sceptical about the Carrickmines debate. The castle itself has not been found and identified. There is suspicion about where it is, but it will not be touched. What we are talking about is certain types of outworks. We have hundreds if not thousands of castles in this country in various states of repair. If we have millions of euro to spend on castles, let us spend it on something a little more visible. I am aware that Carrickmines Castle has a very important role in Irish history and that would not prejudice me either for or against it. That is true of many other castles. However, no matter how hard we try, it is underground and we cannot bring it back to life.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for the court judgment is the conflation of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government taking on D&uacute;chas and conflicts of interest within the Department. I have an open mind on where departmental responsibility for national monuments should lie. I am astonished the Opposition is opposing this Bill in principle. That means the M50 cannot be completed because there is no mechanism for doing so. Did the Fine Gael councillors tell people in the recent local elections that they would oppose this legislation?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. I felt compelled to say a few words on this legislation. Over the past year issues have arisen in Ardsallagh, County Meath, and in Woodstown, County Waterford, as well as at Carrickmines. Emergency legislation is essentially being brought in to resolve the situation at Carrickmines. In the Minister&rsquo;s address, he stated the court decision was made on a technical glitch. If we have legislation brought in on an emergency basis as a result of a technical glitch, the Minister is being an opportunist. I am very surprised that Senator Mansergh stated we have given the Minister flexibility. That is one interpretation. I was also disappointed that he could see no difference between history and archaeology when it suited him. Deep down he can differentiate between them, but today he cannot see a difference and that is opportunist.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that we are giving<i> carte blanche </i>to the NRA to row through our heritage and that the Minister is giving his blessing at the same time. The Minister verified that today in many parts of his contribution. The NRA provides a desk-top draft of the route it decides to take and will not vary from it. They sit in their offices, decide on a route and will not change. On numerous occasions criticisms were made of the NRA from the Government benches and they recently claimed we had created a monster. We have created a monster if we cannot control it. Now the Minister has rowed in behind it and allowed it to go through.</P>
    <P>There were loud cheers from the Government benches with the demise of D&uacute;chas, a body in which I had absolute confidence. D&uacute;chas had created difficulties for some people, mainly developers. The reality was that it was an independent body that gave its opinion, which was solidly behind the preservation and conservation of the archaeology and heritage of this country. If the NRA can plough through heritage sites with the blessing of the Government, quibble over the significance of such sites and whether they are historical or archaeological sites, it is a poor look-out. What has happened in Carrickmines, in Waterford and in Meath will repeat itself in other areas through which we have new routes. It will also happen in Kiltullagh, County Galway, which <Col N="663"/>is well known to Senator Kitt. An eminent clergyman from the US has come home and highlighted his absolute professional expertise in the area of archaeology in that area, yet the NRA dismissed him as a crank who had arrived to stifle progress in the provision of local infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The people in the NRA get a notion of a route into their head and they will not deviate from that. I regret the other remaining independent body, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, will only be brought in on a consultative basis. This is a group that would have an independent view on decisions put before it, yet its hands have been tied again. This has all been contrived by the Minister as he wants to drive infrastructure through, regardless of the consequences to archaeological sites. Before it is too late, there is an onus on the Minister and his Department to revisit this. He should sleep on this so-called emergency legislation and someone might be inspired to improve it. We know there is an urgency for infrastructure in certain areas, but it does not have to be at the cost of destruction of so many of our archaeological sites. If we are to talk about flexibility, we should talk about the Minister&rsquo;s capacity to resolve the situation. He will not even think a second time about it. He is determined to go through with it at all costs. That is unforgivable and for that reason I oppose this legislation.</P>

	<P>I was so inspired listening to the debate in my office that I had to make a contribution. I want to make four brief points. Senator Ulick Burke referred to the NRA and the composition of that body. The NRA was established by a former Deputy, P&aacute;draig Flynn, when he was Minister for the Environment. I was opposed to it then and I am opposed to it now. It is an unaccountable quango. There is cross-party consensus that it is unaccountable to anyone, including to this House and the Minister. We should have a Minister whose sole task is to build the roads and who would be accountable to the Houses. We are talking about a country with a population no greater than the greater Manchester area. A Minister should take responsibility from the NRA altogether and vest it in himself or herself. He or she should then go ahead and build the new road infrastructure that is needed under the national development plan. There is widespread political questioning of the NRA and it should be wound down. It is one quango too much. I live in the western suburbs, which includes Carrickmines, and there is a great deal of frustration in those communities. I listened to Senator Ross, who lives right beside the site.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There is considerable disquiet in the communities on the west and south of the city about what has taken place at Carrickmines. The effect has been that Dundrum is now totally bottlenecked, since the M50 exits there, not being able to go any further east across the city. In my constituency, when the M50 stopped at Templeogue, the whole area was clogged up. The problem is not simply one for commuters, since the entire adjoining area is clogged up with rat-running and cars travelling through the area. When the next section from Templeogue was opened, it led to an entirely different environmental situation in Templeogue. We must therefore address this issue. There is no point in our pretending, on either side of the House, that this is not a problem. It must be addressed. Thousands of households are affected in the west and south of the city. One way to do it is to realise that we have a total of over 120,000 sites of importance throughout the country. There must be some way of grading what is significant and what is not. A pile of stones is not as significant as an important small settlement.</P>

	<P>One must establish and grade the significance, since not everything is important, and we must realise that. However, I am totally opposed to the very severe powers the Minister gives himself in section 14 of this Bill, particularly regarding consultation. For instance, I would have no difficulty if it were the Minister with responsibility for culture who had the ultimate power to make such decisions. At least his position would give him a totally different perspective from the Minister responsible for industry and environmental development. If the Minister responsible for culture were to make the final decision, it would often be a good one. However, giving the ultimate power to a Minister whose sole responsibility it is to push through the roads <Col N="665"/>building programme is a conflict that must be recognised.</P>

	<P>We are not that clear on it, and that is the problem. However, my big difficulty is that the Minister is allowing only 14 days&rsquo; consultation with the director of the National Museum, in which time he or she must decide whether the monument is significant. That is totally inappropriate, and it is not possible in such a short period for any august body to come to a determination on the significance of a find. This legislation is rushed. I understand that it is a response to a specific problem in Carrickmines that must be addressed. However, the particular focus of this measure is far too crude, and I hope that in the course of the Committee Stage debate, the Minister will be much more open to amendments and substantive change than he was in the other House. Rushed legislation is bad, and we in this House have a responsibility to restrain the Government when it comes to such matters.</P>

	<P>This has been a most interesting debate to which, unfortunately, I have only about five or six minutes to respond. I would have liked more time, but I will try to cover the various points in the limited time available. It is fair to say this Bill is intended to provide a balance between the protection of our heritage and the necessity to provide much-needed infrastructure, in this case the south-eastern motorway. It has been suggested throughout that other things could be done. I would like to hear an alternative proposal. Everybody is against it and is in favour of the protection of the heritage and infrastructural development that is a credit to our country. At the same time, there is no alternative.</P>

	<P>I have been sitting here since this morning and interrupted no one. I am not in and out as it suits as I am doing my job. No one has asked what will happen if this Bill is not enacted. The injunction will continue, and two sections can continue to be built but not connected. I am sure the Opposition knows there will be sizeable penalty payments to the contractor after the end of July. That is the reality. I categorically deny that this Bill&rsquo;s intention is to give more power to the Minister. No new powers will be conferred on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government by this Bill. Specifically, under section 14(3) of the National Monuments Act 1930, it was and is open to the Minister to grant consent to a wide variety of activities affecting a national monument in the interests of archaeology or for any other reason. This Bill makes explicit the circumstances in <Col N="666"/>which the consents or directions may be given. Furthermore, it gives a formal consultative role in such matters to the National Museum of Ireland, which was never there before.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Two weeks.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with that. The Bill provides that ministerial directions affecting approved road developments must be sent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Those are additional safeguards not provided under existing legislation. Senator Brian Hayes made a reasonable point about the turnaround time regarding national monuments. Of course, the Department is obliged to consult the museum on approximately 2,000 licence applications per annum. The typical turnaround time is 14 days. In extenuating circumstances where that is not considered adequate there is provision for agreement on another period if necessary. I have no doubt that the Minister of the day would be prepared to grant that time.</P>
    <P>I will briefly refer to other road schemes. The route of the M3 from Clonee to Kells is further away from Tara than the existing national route. Only two known sites will be impacted upon. Initial testing reveals some new sites but no evidence to date that those are national monuments. Such new sites can be dealt with efficiently under the Bill by ministerial directions. Reference was made to the M25 at Woodstown in Waterford. An important Viking site has been uncovered during testing. Options are being examined by the National Roads Authority. It appears to have no interest judging by what the Opposition says, but I do not accept that view. The National Museum is also examining options. The new Bill will allow the site to be dealt with by ministerial directions after consultation, once again with the National Museum.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this Bill would reduce protection for our monuments. That is totally incorrect. The Bill aims to achieve the streamlining of a procedure, which, as it stands, is unwieldy and time consuming. The proposed system for protecting archaeological heritage through consents or by direction is intended to provide flexible responses to several potential situations. The Minister and I will continue to be advised by the professional archaeologists on our staff. In granting consent or issuing directions, we will continue to consult the National Museum. We have access to a great deal of advice from professionals in the Department. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, and I value that advice.</P>
    <P>D&uacute;chas still has its staff and it is incorrect for Senator Ulick Burke to claim that it has effectively been abolished. It was never an autonomous entity and was always answerable in the past to the appropriate Minister. Before it came under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government it was under the remit of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P><Col N="667"/>
    <P>Reference was made to looking to other parts of Europe. The arrangements for protecting this country&rsquo;s heritage and built environment are envied by other countries in Europe. This is amply demonstrated by the fact that only 100 excavations may be undertaken annually in countries much larger than Ireland while many more than that are undertaken here. We do not need to look to the situation in other countries, rather other countries are looking with envy at the situation that pertains here.</P>
    <P>On penalties, the indication that we are increasing the penalties on indictment from &euro;62,000 to &euro;10 million is ample illustration of this Government&rsquo;s determination to demonstrate that breaches of the legislation will be dealt with seriously.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion that there should be consultation with An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The role of this body is covered by the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads (Amendment) Act 1997 and there is no incom<Col N="668"/>patibility in this Bill. If the direction of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the approval of a road scheme requires a material alteration to the scheme, An Bord Plean&aacute;la can subsequently require that an environmental impact assessment be undertaken for that alteration.</P>
    <P>This legislation represents a fair balance between protecting our heritage and ensuring we can continue to provide much needed infrastructure. I ask Senators to bear in mind my point regarding the two sections of road that could not be connected. I have heard no credible alternatives from the Opposition benches on this case.</P>

   <Title>Commissions of Investigation Bill 2003: Second Stage.</Title>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to present to the House the Commissions of Investigation Bill 2003. The Bill provides for the establishment of commissions of investigation. The function of a commission of investigation will be to investigate into and establish the facts about matters of significant public concern referred to it for investigation and to make a report on its investigation.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Bill has its origins in the need to provide a means for investigation into the child sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church. It is generally accepted that the public and sometimes adversarial nature of tribunals of inquiry does not lend itself to investigation of matters of such a sensitive and intensely personal nature. Nonetheless, such inquiries need to have at their disposal powers which are no less vigorous and effective in the pursuit of answers to difficult questions. Separate to this, the Government recognised the need to devise a new form and method of investigation.</P>
    <P>The Bill adds in a significant way to the range of mechanisms available for investigations. As Members will note, the Bill contains several new features that will ensure more timely and cost effective investigations without in any way compromising or encroaching on the proper conduct of an investigation. These features will instead enhance the ability of a commission of investigation to meet its objective of establishing the facts about any matter referred to a commission. The interests of justice and accountability will be advanced by a speedy conclusion to an investigation.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the detail of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, it is important to have a clear picture of what the Bill does not do. This legislation does not replace or amend in any way the legislation <Col N="670"/>under which tribunals of inquiry are established and operated. Commissions may be regarded as precursors to, or alternatives to, tribunals but the Bill makes no change to legislation relating to tribunals. It is also important to note that the Bill does not establish a single or permanent investigations body. It enables the establishment of commissions as and when required. Several commissions may sit at any one time investigating into several and varied situations. In other words, this Bill gives the State a very flexible investigative mechanism.</P>
    <P>Several of the new departures and innovative approaches to be found in the Bill are particularly important and worthy of emphasis. I draw the attention of the House to aspects of the Bill which relate to the terms of reference of a commission and to the guiding principles that aim to encourage co-operation. I will explain the way a commission will conduct its investigations and the strong powers available to it and will outline the provisions designed to ensure time limits are respected and costs are kept under control. Finally, I will underline the importance of the reports of commissions. Given these features, I hope Senators will agree that the Bill introduces a timely and effective additional mechanism to ensure accountability and transparency in our public affairs.</P>
    <P>The first and most basic question is when and in what circumstances we envisage commissions being established. The Bill provides that a commission will be established on foot of a Government order approved by the Oireachtas. The subject matter must be, in the words of the Bill, an issue giving rise to significant public concern. An issue giving rise to significant public concern is one of more than mere passing interest to the public. It must instead be an issue that has serious, including long-term, implications for public life. Those implications could include the welfare and safety of a sector in society or the effective and safe operation of a significant public service.</P>
    <P>While the Bill provides the mechanism and structure for the operation of investigations, it will remain the function of the Government of the day and the Oireachtas, as the representatives of society at large and as guardians of the public interest, to make the judgment in any particular case as to whether an issue is of such significant public concern that it requires investigation by a commission.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the terms of reference of a commission. It is recognised that clear and well defined terms of reference, which are tightly drawn, are often the key to a successful investigation. The Bill addresses this issue directly in sections 4 and 5. The process leading to the establishment of a commission starts with the presentation to the Oireachtas of a reasoned statement of the need to establish a commission, along with the draft establishment order. Following the approval of the order by the Oireachtas, the terms of reference are to be set by the Govern<Col N="671"/>ment or the Minister having overall responsibility for the commission in question. There may be consultations with interested parties about the terms of reference but the terms must, in the final analysis, comply with the detailed parameters in section 5.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out very specific matters to be considered in setting the terms of reference. Observance of these criteria will result in tight and well defined terms of reference. Section 5 also requires that the terms of reference must be accompanied by statements setting out the likely duration and cost of an investigation. The terms of reference and the accompanying statements on costs and duration will be published.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Section 6 recognises that the terms of reference may need to be altered on occasions. It states that any amendment must be for clear purposes, namely to clarify, extend or limit the scope of an investigation. The statements of costs and timeframes must be amended when the terms are altered. This will ensure that the full implications of any alteration are clear to everyone. It is worth noting that amendments may be made only if the commission consents to them. It may withhold consent if it is satisfied that the amendment would prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that the overall effect of these important sections is that this legislation is ensuring that the difficulties that have come to beset other investigations and inquiries are met and addressed at the outset. Therefore, the scope for surprises at a later stage should be considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the general aim of the Bill, section 7 adopts a flexible approach to determining the membership of commissions. Under the terms of the section, we will be able to draw on a wide range of skills and expertise. We will be able to achieve the right mix of such skills and expertise. The experience and qualifications of the members can be supplemented by experts who can be recruited under section 8 to assist and advise the commission. The Minister hopes to ensure that all investigations, regardless of their subject matter, will be carried out by, those most qualified to do so. He considers that sections 7 and 8 will ensure that is the case. Section 9 requires that a commission must be independent in the discharge of its functions.</P>
    <P>Section 10 sets out the guiding principles by, which commissions must operate. Commissions will be required to seek the voluntary co-operation of witnesses. The Bill places a responsibility on commissions to facilitate witnesses in that respect. Given the multitude of circumstances in which commissions may operate, it is not possible to say how and in what manner commissions will meet that responsibility. One can envisage that, for example, they will be prepared to hear evidence in locations and at times that are more convenient for witnesses. Subject to certain safe<Col N="672"/>guards, they may accept evidence in forms other than in person. For example, evidence may be accepted by live or pre-recorded video links or by affidavit.</P>
    <P>Section 11, which provides that, in general, evidence will be given to commissions in private, complements section 10. It will support commissions in adhering to the guiding principles I have mentioned. The arrangements set out in section 11 will result in a less adversarial atmosphere. It is hoped that such an atmosphere will encourage witnesses who might be intimidated by the prospect of lengthy and detailed cross examination, for example, to come forward to assist the commission. Section 11 provides that legal representatives of other parties will be present only if the commission is satisfied that their presence is necessary in the interests of the investigation and fair procedures. Similarly, cross-examination by or on behalf of other parties will take place only if the commission agrees. The commission may, however, question a witness on the evidence he or she has given.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the procedures in section 11 represent a departure from current practice in certain respects. The Minister argues that the new approach is designed to assist commissions in their primary task of establishing facts, while ensuring that procedures are fair. As hearings will be in private, generally speaking, the risk of damage to the good name or reputation of another is greatly reduced, as is the need for legal representation. Private hearings have the advantage of avoiding the difficulties, which arise when claims are publicly made, by one party but remain unanswered for a considerable time until the affected person comes to give evidence. In such circumstances, there is a risk that unfounded or inaccurate claims can appear to go unchallenged and the good name and reputation of certain persons can be gravely and unjustly damaged. The new approach should reduce that risk.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that private hearings are not abused in a way that would allow unfounded allegations and claims to be made or to go unchallenged. Section 12 addresses this concern by providing that a commission should inform any person who may be the subject of such claims or allegations of those claims or allegations. It provides that such persons should be given an opportunity to deal with them. While no obligation is being placed on a commission to reveal the source of any evidence given to it, such details should be disclosed on certain occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 15 requires a commission to establish or adopt rules and procedures pertaining to its operation. If a commission has several members, such rules may authorise the taking of evidence by one or more of them. The section provides that evidence given in such circumstances will be regarded as having been given to the commission. This is an important measure that could help to speed up investigations and to save time and cost.</P>
    <P>I would like to discuss the powers the Bill gives to commissions of investigation. While voluntary <Col N="673"/>co-operation is the legislation&rsquo;s central plank, commissions will be in a position to pursue investigations with vigour if co-operation is not forthcoming. Sections 16 and 28 of the Bill, in particular, provide effective powers to deal with a failure to co-operate. Section 16 specifies the powers that will be available to commissions in respect of witnesses. They will have the power to direct witnesses to attend, to answer questions and to produce and disclose documents. Section 28 provides for powers relating to entry into premises, inspecting and securing documents, taking copies of documents and requiring persons in charge of documents or related equipment to co-operate with the commission. All witnesses appearing before a commission will be made aware that in the absence of co-operation, the commission may have recourse to the powers available to it under these sections.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to section 2(2), which provides useful clarification of who has control over documents, especially in large organisations. It states that in the final analysis, the person who can reasonably be considered to have control is deemed to have control, unless there is evidence to the contrary. This closes a potential loophole that could be open to abuse.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates several offences &mdash; failure to comply with directions, giving false statements and obstruction. The offences carry fines on summary conviction of up to &euro;3,000, or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months. On indictment, the offences will be punished by fines of up to &euro;300,000 or imprisonment of five years. Corporate bodies may be prosecuted for offences under the Bill in the normal way. If a person does not comply with a direction to attend or produce documentation, a commission may apply to the High Court for an order seeking compliance. The failure to comply with such an order raises the issue of contempt of court.</P>
    <P>The powers I have mentioned are necessary for the effective functioning of commissions. The Minister recognises that the powers are significant. For that reason, section 27 sets out the principles governing the use of the powers of entry and search under section 28, for example. The powers may be used if it is felt that it is reasonable and necessary to do so in the interests of the investigation. Nothing in the Bill prevents anyone who is the subject of a direction from a commission under sections 16 or 28 from seeking a review of the direction in the High Court.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to section 21 in the context of a commission&rsquo;s powers and operating procedures. The section sets out how a commission may deal with circumstances in which privilege is claimed in respect of information sought by it. The purpose of this measure is to find an effective but proportionate way of overcoming difficulties presented by claims of privilege. Such claims can seriously frustrate and delay the work of an investigation, especially if there is no justification for them. The mechanism proposed in section 21 ensures that genuine claims will be respected, <Col N="674"/>while ensuring that the necessary information will be made available to a commission.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss the control and management of costs, issues which arise under three headings. At the beginning of any investigation, costs will be incurred by the commission. As I noted earlier, the terms of reference must be accompanied by, a statement of the costs that are likely to be incurred by a commission. The statement is to be revised if the terms are altered. The costs covered by the statement will include the costs of staff appointed to advise and assist the commission, in accordance with section 8. Such staff may include barristers and solicitors. Section 8 provides that a competitive tendering process may be used for the recruitment of staff under the section, where it is appropriate to do so.</P>
    <P>Costs can also arise when witnesses seek to have their costs recouped from the Minister. Although the legislation deals mainly with the repayment of legal costs, it makes some provision for non-legal costs. Travel costs and other expenses may be reimbursed under section 16(3), for example.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for guidelines to be prepared by the relevant Minister in respect of witnesses&rsquo; legal costs. The guidelines will be drawn up in consultation with the Minister for Finance, in advance of the commission&rsquo;s hearings. They will set out the legal costs, which will be regarded as being &ldquo;necessarily incurred&rdquo; by witnesses in connection with the investigation. Such expenses are the only legal expenses a witness can expect to have recouped. Legal costs will be necessarily incurred when the good name of a witness is called into question, or when other personal or property rights are at risk of being jeopardised as a result of evidence received by the commission. The guidelines prepared under section 23 may restrict the types of legal services or fees to be recouped and may set limits on the level of legal costs to be paid. Witnesses will be given a copy of the guidelines before they give evidence. This ensures that witnesses who wish to do so can arrange legal representation with full knowledge of the regime under which they may seek to have the costs recouped.</P>
    <P>A commission is obliged, in accordance with section 13(2), to advise witnesses of their legal rights and obligations when they are not legally represented for whatever reason. Even if a commission considers that legal representation is not necessary to the extent that it will approve the recoupment of costs and the witness does not therefore acquire legal representation, it will seek to ensure that the witness is fully aware of his or her legal rights and duties.</P>
    <P>The section 23 guidelines do not automatically guarantee that all or any of a witnesse&rsquo;s legal costs will be met. Each situation will be considered on its merits, having regard to the criteria set out in section 24. In particular, all applications will be subject to the criteria in section 24(3), which sets out a non-exhaustive list of issues to be considered by the commission. The section <Col N="675"/>enables a commission to take account of the level of co-operation provided by the witness, among other things. Having considered an application, a commission may give a direction to the relevant Minister to pay costs at a level that does not exceed the maximum level set in the guidelines. The recommended level may be lower than in the guidelines. The Minister may pay the costs as directed by the commission, or refer the matter back to the commission for reconsideration, after which the commission may reduce the proposed level of payment or confirm its original determination. The Minister shall then pay the witness the costs recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>A person may be held liable, due to obstruction or a lack of co-operation, for additional costs incurred by other parties, such as the commission or other witnesses. Section 17 provides that if a witness is held to have failed to co-operate or obstructed a commission, and the commission or other witnesses have incurred additional costs as a result, the party who causes the delay or obstruction may be held liable for the additional costs. Liability for the costs of a commission or other witnesses may be imposed on persons in addition to that person being proceeded against for the offence of obstruction. In other words, it should be understood that obstruction is likely to have serious consequences.</P>
    <P>Section 24(5) makes a limited exception to the general regime on costs. This will occur where a witness incurs exceptional costs other than legal costs because of the volume or location of documents, for example, documents held outside the State. In those circumstances, the commission may direct that such exceptional costs may be repaid to the witness and, as in the case of legal costs, the relevant Minister may request the commission to reconsider any direction about the repayment of such costs.</P>
    <P>I have been anxious to spell out to Senators in some detail the provisions relating to costs, in particular legal costs. To summarise, in addressing the question of legal costs, the Bill takes account of the overall structure being put in place, including the level of risk to the good name and reputation of any witness because, as I expect, private hearings will be the norm. It is reasonable to say that the lower level of risk to the good name and reputation of any witness should be reflected in a reduced need for legal representation. On the other hand, the Bill ensures costs that are necessarily incurred &mdash; that is the critical phrase &mdash; in the protection of a person&rsquo;s good name and reputation will be recouped. The Bill sets out to achieve a balance between the wider public interest to control costs and the protection of the rights of individuals to their good name, and these proposals achieve that balance.</P>
    <P>Part 5 of the Bill deals with reports and interim reports of a commission. Section 32 provides not only that a commission must prepare for the relevant Minister a written report based on the evi<Col N="676"/>dence received by it but also identify the precise purpose of the report. It must set out the facts it has established in regard to the matter referred to it. It is not the function of a commission to speculate, make findings or come to judgements based on, for example, the balance of the evidence. However, by virtue of having become a matter requiring the establishment of a commission of investigation, there is likely to be dispute about some or all aspects of the evidence.</P>
    <P>Again, there is a balance to be achieved here. It would be unreasonable to expect a commission to merely set out the conflicting evidence and offer no comment even where a certain comment would be justified by the clear weight and quality of some or all of that evidence. Such an approach would undermine the credibility of a commission as it alone would be unable to draw conclusions that would seem obvious to all other observers. Section 32(2) therefore enables a commission to indicate its opinion as to the quality or weight of evidence relating to any area where the evidence is incomplete, insufficient, inconsistent or disputed. This does not go so far as to say that a commission may favour or find that one version of the evidence is more credible than another. It does permit a commission to point out that, for example, certain disputed facts are supported by corroboration from other sources or that a clear majority of witnesses affected by a particular event support one version as opposed to another. Statements of this kind merely summarise where the weight of the evidence lies and they are, to that extent, merely stating what is obvious to all.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to some aspects of the Bill as they relate to the possible identification of persons in reports compiled by a commission. There is no general restriction in the Bill on the identification of persons in reports of a commission. However, section 32(3) sets out considerations that may lead to the omission of certain details from a report identifying persons who gave evidence or any other person.</P>
    <P>Sections 34, 35 and 36 contain provisions providing an opportunity to persons identified in or identifiable from a draft report to submit comments thereon to the commission on the grounds that there has been a failure to observe fair procedures or in order to protect commercially sensitive information. A commission is required to give due consideration to requests for alterations. It may either amend the report, apply to the High Court for directions or submit the report to the relevant Minister without alteration. In the alternative, a person identified in or identifiable from a draft report may bring the matter before the High Court seeking an order from the court directing that the draft be amended before submission to the relevant Minister. The court may either order the commission to submit the report without alteration, or with such alterations as it may direct, or give a direction to the commission to provide an opportunity to the person to give evidence or make submissions to the commission before the report is finalised. Either way, no one <Col N="677"/>will be allowed to delay publication indefinitely. There will be time limits for making submissions to the commission or applications to the court. Giving affected persons an opportunity to comment and have their views considered will meet the requirements of natural justice. The commitment to fair procedures will reduce the likelihood of court challenges to a commission&rsquo;s work and supports the objective of efficient and effective investigations.</P>
    <P>The final decision on the publication of a report or interim report rests with the relevant Minister. He or she may seek directions from the High Court where there is a risk that anything in the report or interim report could prejudice any pending or ongoing criminal proceedings. This is a useful final check. The Bill does not contemplate any other reason for delaying or withholding publication.</P>
    <P>Section 42 confers absolute privilege on reports and interim reports as well as on other documentation of a commission, where published.</P>
    <P>It is likely that in many cases commissions will find themselves grappling with the difficulties of disputed evidence. As a result, it may transpire that in some instances a commission may be unable to establish or present the full facts in respect of some or all of the matters about which it has carried out an investigation. The Bill, therefore, leaves open the possibility of a tribunal of inquiry being established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2004 for the purposes of inquiring further into the matter. It is my view that it will be the exception to have to establish a tribunal as a follow-up to a commission. Neither will the establishment of a tribunal in such circumstances represent a failure on the part of the commission. On the contrary, it will have carried out invaluable preparatory work on behalf of any subsequent tribunal, thus saving time and cost, apart from the quality and volume of the evidence it will have amassed.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides that in the event of a tribunal being established, all of that evidence becomes evidence of the tribunal. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that information excluded from a commission&rsquo;s report under section 32(3) is not made public as a result of the transfer of the evidence received by the commission to the subsequent tribunal. Section 46 provides a mechanism for dealing with such information. It provides that the affected person is to be informed of any intention to disclose details that were previously excluded and that they have a right to make observations. Ultimately, the High Court may have to consider all such matters.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of what a tribunal can be expected to achieve that the commission has been unable to do. A commission is required to establish facts and may comment beyond that only to the limited extent that I have referred to. This limited brief is required if we are to have a mechanism that reduces the adversarial content of existing fora and places less reliance on cross-<Col N="678"/>examinations and other features that add to cost and delay. A tribunal hears arguments in public and, unlike what we generally expect to be the case with commissions, permits cross-examinations. It can then come to conclusions based on the balance of the evidence available to it. In other words, it is able to make judgments about the balance of evidence in a way that we do not foresee for commissions of investigation.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, I would expect that only in the rarest of cases will there be a need to establish a tribunal following the conclusion by a commission of its work. A decision on whether to propose the establishment of a tribunal will, in the first instance, be a decision by the Government of the day and the proposal must then be submitted to the Oireachtas for its approval. It may be that the Government would decide that even where the commission&rsquo;s investigation is not as complete as would have been hoped, enough evidence will have been collected by it. The Government would then be in the position to proceed with the matter another way, for example, by legislative or administrative action.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes this reforming legislation provides an efficient and effective alternative to the State for the purposes of investigating matters of significant public concern. It draws on our experiences to date with other methods of investigation. It is a Bill that arises from recognition of the complexities of modern government and public administration. The opportunities for systems<?oasys [dc20]?>to fail are ever greater and the consequences of such failures have far-reaching effects, both for the individuals, their reputations and the country at large. It is important that we provide ourselves with a mechanism for responding to such failures that is responsive, sensitive and fair while at the same time effective and efficient. To meet these standards it must be speedy and cost effective. In that way it can command public respect and confidence. It will be seen as the ideal way of dealing with complex circumstances while fully respecting fair procedures and natural justice. This Bill meets those criteria and I am happy to commend it to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P><?oasys [dc0]?>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. The tribunal and public inquiry system is critical to the functioning of a democratic State. The core principles of any investigation must be that it is effective, efficient and has the full confidence of the public. Despite much excellent work from the current tribunals, there is clear evidence that public confidence in the tribunal model as a means of excavating and delivering the truth has waned. The recently published fourth report of the Mahon tribunal does little to allay these concerns.</P>
    <P>Any new proposals concerning tribunals will be judged by the members of the public from three distinct perspectives, namely speed, cost and results. Any proposed model that does not make significant improvements on all of those fronts will not amount to sufficient change. A new approach, therefore, which may bring speedy <Col N="679"/>results at a reasonable cost is in principle worthy of support. However, one of the dramatic differences between this Bill and any other comparable legislation is that the model proposed by it politicises commissions of investigation to an unhealthy degree. It does so by ruling out any participation of the Oireachtas in the whole process, which is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in the other House the Minister accepted Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal that all lawyers must go through a tendering process before being engaged by a commission. This is something that should be made a requirement for tribunals also because it would go some distance towards reducing the cost of tribunals.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind facilitating the establishment of commissions of investigation appears to be that they will be the first stage of an investigative process and if after investigation a matter is deemed more serious or more complex it will then be examined more fully by a tribunal. Will this legislation not just add a further layer to the existing tribunal process? Will the Minister of State tell the House how many of our existing tribunals would have been able to conclude at a commission of investigation stage? Many Members will agree the answer is zero.</P>
    <P>Aside from questioning the basis of the Bill, my real problem is that it seeks to extinguish the role of the Oireachtas, which seems to have no role other than making a positive resolution to establish a commission. In every other respect, the Minister has total control and his powers are exercised without reference to the Oireachtas. It is the Minister who will establish a commission by making an order, set the terms of reference, appoint the members and receive and publish the reports. The Minister can effectively be the political master of a commission of inquiry. Has the Minister considered the effect this will have on public confidence in the process?</P>
    <P>Under section 4, the order establishing the commission may authorise the Minister to set the terms of reference without any reference to the Oireachtas. This is in stark contrast to the way in which the terms of reference of a tribunal are set. These form part of the resolution, which establishes it and which is debated by the Oireachtas. Under section 32(4), it is the Minister who will receive the report of the commissions of investigation. Under sections 33 and 34, interim reports and draft reports must also be submitted to the Minister. The independence of any body, such as a commission of investigation, is paramount. In order to enjoy public confidence, the commissions must be at arms length from the Government. It is conceivable that much commission time will be spent investigating the activities of those not too far removed from the political sphere. Not alone must the commission be independent, but it must be seen to be so.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party believes the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in bodies of this type needs to be reinstated. The commissions of inves<Col N="680"/>tigation and their terms of reference should be established by the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition, the chairman of each commission must be required to be answerable to the Houses, or an Oireachtas committee. The chairman of a commission should meet with and report to an Oireachtas Committee to answer questions on the investigative process but not on the content or detail of its investigations.</P>
    <P>The public nature and consequent volume of lawyers are the two ingredients, which have made tribunals lengthy and costly. I am not convinced this legislation prevents these two factors becoming an issue in the context of commissions. Section 11 indicates that the bulk of a commission&rsquo;s work is to be undertaken in private. However, under section 11(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), the commission must sit in public when a witness requests such or where fair procedures would require it. These circumstances are potentially broad and would seem to reintroduce the public element to commissions. Section 11(2) reintroduces the potential for the attendance of large and costly legal teams, as it allows legal representatives of persons other than witnesses to attend. Section 11(2)(<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) introduces the right to cross-examine into the workings of a commission.</P>
    <P>Section 6(2) is most unusual and gives rise to some concerns as it effectively states the terms of reference cannot be amended where to do so would prejudice the rights of a person who has co-operated or provided information to it. This effectively grants immunity from further and deeper investigation to those who assist the tribunal, irrespective of what negative detail of their role later becomes available. Is it wise to tie the hands of the commission in this unusual way? Section 10(2)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are unusual provisions that impose a mandatory obligation on a commission of investigation to &ldquo;seek the voluntary co-operation of persons whose evidence is desired&rdquo; and that it must &ldquo;facilitate such co-operation&rdquo;. In practice, this could prove unduly onerous for a commission. For example, it could require overseas travel to facilitate witnesses in circumstances where it is not justified.</P>
    <P>I give qualified support to the general principle of the establishment of commissions of investigation, but I would like the Minister of State to address the matters which I have raised. When can we expect a reforming Bill on the raft of tribunals of inquiry legislation, which dates back to 1921? In March 2003, the Law Reform Commission published a comprehensive consultation paper on this issue. Despite this, the Government has given no indication of interest in implementing that consultation paper. The legislation is long overdue for review. The Mahon and Moriarty tribunals and Dunne inquiry are going from pillar to post without any end in sight. In the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s consultation paper, only five pages deal with alternatives to tribunals. This Bill only gives effect to those five pages. When will see the other 340 pages implemented?</P><Col N="681"/>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission seems to favour the establishment of commissions of investigation. However, its consultation paper stated &ldquo;the commission would expect that such an inquiry will not attract the rules of constitutional justice&rdquo;. In drafting this Bill, the Minister was faced with a quandary. On the one hand, he aimed to establish private inquiries, without the lawyers and publicity. On the other, he saw the constitutional constraints. The real question is whether the Minister has struck the right balance. Article 40.3.2 of the Constitution gives each person the right to a good name. The protection of this right before the courts necessitates the right of representation particularly where one&rsquo;s good name might be brought into question. Due to these considerations, and also out of caution, the Minister has conceded rights of attendance, representation and cross-examination. It is questionable whether in doing so, the Minister has avoided the potential infringement of a constitutional right. The workings of a commission seem to take on the trappings and procedures, which would be expected of a tribunal or a court.</P>
    <P>The further one reads the Bill, the more the distinctions between a commission and a tribunal begin to fade. The requirements of natural justice have defeated the intention to have low key, private hearings. Has the Minister achieved his aim of private, speedy, inquiries without lawyers and without bowing to the rules of constitutional justice, as suggested by the Law Reform Commission? Or has he just added another layer to the tribunal process, which will be as lengthy, costly and as public?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus an Bille t&aacute;bhachtach seo. Unlike Senator Terry, I welcome this much needed Bill. Those of us who sat on the sub-committee on the Barron report into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings were conscious of the inhibitions the current failed mechanisms of tribunals imposed. There is overwhelming public support for changes to be made which will lead to more cost-effective, efficient and relevant ways at getting at the truth. Ultimately, that is what all of these are about. Where issues of public concern arise, it has to be open to the Oireachtas, the Government and Ministers to establish mechanisms, which can inquire into these issues and arrive at conclusions on issues of importance.</P>
    <P>We have had a proliferation of tribunals. While I empathise to some extent with Senator Terry regarding an Oireachtas input, that will happen in any event because of the accountability Ministers and the Government have to both Houses. The Houses are however in no position to make any argument for having a defining role in establishing tribunals, given what has happened. As a Member I would personally feel culpable, and collectively we should feel culpable, for setting up vehicles which are costing a fortune. Some good work has certainly been done. The issues were important and needed to be inquired into, but not <Col N="682"/>for the length of time and at the costs currently involved. Despite pressure from the media or elsewhere we must be sensible in the arrangement we put in place. Any evening I am travelling late, I enjoy the &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; radio show. The re-enactment of tribunal proceedings is very interesting and entertaining but at what cost? We could have entertaining programmes on radio between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. for a small fraction of the cost incurred by the tribunals. That is not to diminish their role in any way but they have got totally out of hand. In fairness, many people in the legal profession also say that the tribunals are bringing their profession into disrepute. There is a need for more streamlined alternatives. What is before us is a well constructed, good alternative for the investigation of many of the issues. I did not quite understand the point made by Senator Terry regarding existing tribunals but most of them could have been covered by the mechanism we now have in the Commissions of Investigation Bill.</P>
    <P>When I alluded to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the biggest atrocity in the history of the Troubles on this island over the past 30 years, the only commensurate matter which arose that would have equalled those atrocities and equalled the necessity to have a public inquiry is probably the scandal of the blood transfusions, dealt with by the Lindsay tribunal. The fact of those tribunals taking such an inordinate length of time means that the purpose for which they were established is lost with the time span incurred. We heard recently that the Mahon tribunal will probably continue until 2014. Anything, which comes out of it in that year, or indeed in 2010, will probably have been overtaken by various changes in legislation during the interim period. The value of the investment in the tribunal will therefore have been lost. If issues are of public concern, there is surely a necessity that they be dealt with expeditiously. With the length of time being incurred by some tribunals, that is not happening. That is why I welcome the provision in this Bill that at the very outset the terms of reference, including a timeframe for the operation of the commission of investigation and a fully costed appraisal of what it will take to complete, are essential.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the manner in which previous terms of reference were drawn up. Much of the difficulty now being encountered regarding the timeframe and costs of existing tribunals relates to the broad terms of reference allowed. In that regard I would like to see on an all-party basis a sensible appraisal made of where each tribunal now stands, the outstanding issues and the timescales of which the tribunals themselves are talking. Each tribunal should then be re-defined in a sensible way. I have no doubt that much of the information gathered in some of the tribunals could now be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. There is no reason the legal process should not be able to deal with a number of the <Col N="683"/>issues that have now arisen. That is the correct forum for dealing with serious wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that once this legislation is enacted we would consider what issues currently before the different tribunals might well be referred to a commission of investigation to be expedited and processed. The residue of important matters which it is felt can be dealt with only by tribunals would then be re-defined in much more specific ways with the existing tribunals so that they could conclude their work in a fashion which would have been the initial intention of the Houses of the Oireachtas when some of the tribunals were established as far back as 1998. When some of those tribunals were established in that year, I doubt any Member envisaged that in 2004 they would still be continuing and only at the early stages of their activities. This Bill is a reasonable vehicle to ensure that in the future these matters will be dealt with in a manner of which we would all approve.</P>
    <P>I note that in the Bill there is emphasis on voluntary co-operation, to which Senator Terry referred. The Bill is clearly premised on getting co-operation but it also has extensive coercive powers which are outlined. They include directions to attend, to answer questions, to disclose and produce documents, powers of entry on foot of a warrant in the case of a private dwelling and the power to seize documents and equipment, as well as to make determinations and give directions where privilege is claimed over documents. That is as it should be. Once a commission of investigation or tribunal is established it must be able to operate with the full resources of whatever legal powers are required in order to conduct its business well and arrive at its conclusions.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State might clarify a matter which possibly involves constitutional issues. The commission of investigation will report and outline the facts in a situation. Where there is a conflict in the evidence, it is debarred from adjudicating. I suppose that is because much of the commission&rsquo;s work will be conducted in private so that people may not have the possibility of cross-examination in certain areas. That whole area might need to be looked at. I know that we value the idea of the public trial, the cross-examination and everyone having his or her say. That system does not operate in all countries. It has its shortcomings and we should recognise that. Where certain situations arise and where the facts can be garnered from private interviews, corroborated, established and perhaps even admitted, there is no reason why conclusions cannot be reached. However, in order to reach conclusions, it may be necessary to have a full public inquiry, with all the attendant costs, delays and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry alluded to the fact that holding many of the sessions in private would give an element of confidentiality at the early stages of investigations so that people&rsquo;s good names are not tarnished. The corollary to this is the public tribunals system. The initial operation, in which <Col N="684"/>lawyers for the tribunal outline the information they have garnered and what they will deal with during the course of a specific module, all goes into the public domain unchallenged and uncontested. In many instances, where it reflects badly on people&rsquo;s characters, it gives rise to injustice. When one hears many months later the defence making its case, carrying out the cross-examination and giving the other side of the coin, a different perception emerges. It is unfair that in the interim people who may have done no wrong can be ridiculed and held up to opprobrium by the media and the public at large. It is not right.</P>
    <P>One cannot deal with this topic without addressing the issue of costs. The Minister of State may be able to confirm what the tribunals have cost to date. I have heard figures in the region of &euro;120 million. There is speculation that by the time all the tribunals are completed we could be talking about &euro;1 billion, which is alarming. It is a scandal. I do not necessarily concur with Senator Terry&rsquo;s welcome for the tendering process. There is not a competitive arrangement within a number of professions, particularly the legal profession. I do not think a tendering process would achieve very much under the current closed system, which operates within the legal profession. There is an onus on the Government to tackle privilege where it is operating on behalf of vested interests and against the public good. This is an area that needs to be opened up to competition. However, until some system is put in place to achieve competition, I doubt if the tendering process will achieve what is desired.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for people who do not co-operate and who are saddled with the cost of part of the tribunal or part of the commission of investigation to be hit with excessive costs if the State has agreed &euro;2,500 a day when the maximum for any individual should not exceed &euro;1,000. If the State has done a bad deal with its lawyers in these instances, people should not have to fund the inefficiency of the State in their negotiations with legal people or anyone else who might be involved. The way the legislation is structured means that other legal people will be involved, which will help to streamline costs. I am pleased to welcome the Bill, which will in time be seen to be a progressive measure.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. I welcome the Bill more in hope than in expectation but I am very impressed with the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan&rsquo;s, explanation that it does not replace or amend existing legislation in regard to tribunals, but introduces a more flexible approach, which is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am not certain that the new model will be a successful way of carrying out investigations. What I am certain about is that the existing tribunal model has failed and we need to look for an alternative approach in the future. There is an old saying that &ldquo;justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo;, which goes to the heart of the problem we have had with tribunals. Senator Walsh and Senator <Col N="685"/>Terry already touched on this aspect. The root problem with that approach is that they take too long to complete. As of today, the Moriarty tribunal has been running for 2,470 days, the Mahon tribunal, formerly the Flood tribunal, for 2,431 days, the Morris tribunal for just 799 days and the Barr tribunal for 730 days. None of the tribunals is anywhere close to completing its work.</P>
    <P>For example, the Mahon tribunal recently estimated that it has 11 years of work to do. On past performance, we can have no confidence whatever that this will not prove to be an underestimate. This timescale is unacceptable, which is why I am sure the Minister has faced up to this challenge. It is totally out of line with what we were led to expect when each of the tribunals was set up. It is fair to say that if Members of the Oireachtas had any idea the tribunals would go on for so long, we would have thought long and hard before agreeing to their establishment in the first place. We probably did not have any other choice at that stage without introducing new legislation.</P>
    <P>The long timescale of the existing tribunals makes worse another inherent fault in the existing model, namely, the expense. The public standing of the tribunals has been greatly undermined by the sheer cost of the operation. It involves sums of money that are outside the experience of most ordinary people. Most people are not happy at the sight of teams of lawyers being provided with years of work that guarantee a total return roughly equivalent to winning the national lottery in a good week. There are two things wrong with the costs as they currently stand. The first is the rate that is paid to counsel representing the very many interests involved in the tribunals. Their daily rate parallels the usual costs that apply in the normal courts, but for totally different work. Most court cases last just a day or two and even the longest cases stretch for only a few weeks. The daily rates paid to counsel working in the courts reflect that fact. They are not designed for situations where the work goes on for many years, at a very low level of intensity. The other cost problem arises from the use of expensive lawyers to do work that is, to put it mildly, way below their pay grade.</P>
    <P>Each of the tribunals employs a team of lawyers who do the basic research work necessary to prepare the tribunal&rsquo;s case at public sessions. It is not necessary to employ top lawyers to do this type of work. Equally good results, or perhaps better results, could be got from using researchers who would cost a great deal less. Either lawyers should not be used for this work but, if they are, they should be paid on a contract basis at a rate that reflects the level of the work carried out.</P>
    <P>There is a third aspect to the cost issue which I am reluctant to touch on because it may be taken as criticism of the people involved in the existing tribunals, which I am anxious to avoid. My main issue is with the system, not with the people who are caught up in it, but honesty compels me to say that I am disappointed at the com<Col N="686"/>plete lack of urgency that seems to pervade each of these tribunals, from top to bottom. They are very good at carrying out their terms of reference, which we in the Oireachtas have provided, but no one in any of the tribunals appears to have considered the common sense questions of how long it will take to get results and if that timescale is acceptable to the public. Is the timescale just, equitable and appropriate? Far from asking these questions, it appears to some observers looking at the tribunals from the outside that in some cases the tribunals have deliberately gone about their work in the slowest possible way. I am not making that accusation. I am merely recording the fact that some people have voiced that opinion and believe it to be true. The fact that many people feel that way is a contributing factor to the low regard in which the tribunals are currently held by the public.</P>
    <P>The legislation concerning tribunals dates, as Senator Terry said, to 1921. However, until the beef tribunal at the beginning of the 1990s, it was very rarely used. The beef tribunal took too long, cost too much and produced unsatisfactory results. With hindsight, maybe it should have been a warning to us that there was something inherently flawed with the model we were using. More than a decade later, with all the experience we now have under our belts, there can hardly be any doubt about the unsuitability of the tribunal model as a way of investigating serious problems.</P>
    <P>I therefore give a cautious welcome to the Bill, which at the least is an acknowledgement that the problem exists. Whether it is a workable or complete solution, only time will tell, but I am willing to give it a chance. We must observe it carefully in operation and be ready to change it if circumstances suggest the need. We will always need some mechanism like this, other than the tribunal system, and it is vital the mechanism is effective. However, in putting forward legislation, let us be ready to examine it again to find whether we can improve it. If it is not effective, it will succeed only in adding to the problems and perpetuating them rather than solving them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to two aspects of the Bill. I look forward to hearing him answer Senator Terry&rsquo;s concern that the commission reports to the Minister and not to the Oireachtas. I do not understand this and would like the Minister to put my mind at rest. I approve of another point made by the Minister. He explained that the Bill has in its origins the need to provide a means for investigation into the child sex abuse scandals and to make arrangements for a less adversarial atmosphere to encourage witnesses who might otherwise have been reluctant to attend. This is worthy of praise, consideration and support.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been thought out correctly and goes in the right direction. I question whether we should have the flexibility to adjust it in some form in the future rather than setting it in stone. Nonetheless, I congratulate the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="687"/>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. I thank the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for bringing forward this legislation, which, unfortunately, is appropriate because of the times in which we live. The Bill provides for the establishment of commissions of investigation, which will investigate and report on matters referred to it which, in the words of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, are &ldquo;of significant public concern&rdquo;. Their job thereafter will be to establish the factual detail.</P>
    <P>A question arises as to when and in what circumstances such a commission would be established. The Bill provides that a commission will be established on foot of a Government order approved by the Oireachtas. The subject matter must, in the words of the Bill, be of significant public concern and not simply of public interest. In the past, situations have perhaps arisen whereby an issue driven by the media in the first instance gathered legs and ended up in a tribunal when it may have been no more than a storm in a teacup. Relevant issues of significant public concern could include the safety of society or the safe operation of a significant public service.</P>
    <P>We live in an era in which tribunals are an everyday occurrence. This has brought shame on the body politic and exasperated and disgusted the general public in a manner that could and should have been avoided. Moreover, some of the cheap political point-scoring in recent years has focused attention on politicians when we would perhaps have been better served by avoiding this. Anyone scoring a political point on this issue focuses on him or herself as well as on the person targeted, which serves no-one in public life.</P>
    <P>The tribunals were set up to examine unsavoury elements of Irish life and issues of concern to the public, as is right and proper. We have been shocked and ashamed by some of the outcomes and revelations from the tribunals. In that regard, I welcome public inquiries and hope they eliminate all that was bad in public life and life in general, whether in regard to the nod and wink merchants, the greedy or those who would seek to abuse the young and vulnerable.</P>
    <P>However, it is unfortunate, as we all agree, that the tribunals have become ponderous and lean heavily on the public purse. Recent statements that the tribunals may continue for years are at the least alarming. Have the terms of reference of the tribunals been examined? A lay person considering them would think they had moved away from their initial terms of reference. It would appear that any given evidence can send the tribunals off in many directions. The recent tribunal appearance by the Taoiseach is a good example. Two objective friends told me that, on that occasion, the tribunal was basically a sub-committee and that what took a full day could have been dealt with in half an hour. I am sure there are many other examples of this.</P>
    <P>Given this slow progress coupled with rising costs, it is not surprising there is an increasing <Col N="688"/>level of frustration and anger among the public, who pay the costs at the end of the day. For that reason alone, I welcome the Bill. It contains several new features which will ensure more timely, cost effective investigations without compromising the outcome of those investigations. It enhances the ability of a commission of investigation to meet its objectives by establishing the facts about matters referred to it. Justice will be better served, leading to a speedy conclusion and cost savings, all of which will assist in allaying public anger concerning the small number of lawyers receiving a disproportionate amount of the funds associated with the workings of tribunals. A newspaper report today suggested lawyers are receiving in excess of &euro;2,000 per day. When one hears of such costs, it is unsurprising the tribunals have cost approximately &euro;120 million to date and could cost as much as &euro;1 billion. This is outrageous when one considers what could be done with that money in times of need, and it must be stopped.</P>
    <P>When the tribunals were initially set up, we all thought they would last one or two years at worst and that verdicts would result. While I accepted the original need for tribunals, they have lost their focus in many respects and, in many instances, have become bogged down in legal argument. This Bill introduces many positive features to eliminate much of that. For instance, under the establishment order there must be statements referring to timescales and costs before the commission is set up. That is a commendable way forward. If these provisions had applied five or six years ago, as Senator Terry said, we would not be in the quagmire we are in currently in terms of costs and so on. Now details will be provided prior to any deliberations and the public will clearly see where their money is going, how long the process will take and what the final outcome will be in terms of cost. That will serve to create confidence in the process where it is required. Obviously, if it were not required at all we would all be much better off.</P>
    <P>It must also be recognised that this in no way interferes with the workings of tribunals now or in the future. Neither does it establish a single or permanent investigations body. We are told many investigations can take place at different times. That is to be welcomed. I also welcome the fact that the commission will focus in the first instance on seeking its information on a voluntary basis. To this end, the evidence will be received mostly in private, which is also a good thing. However, it has the teeth, if necessary, to force a witness to attend if he or she is not prepared to do so in a voluntary capacity. It is easy to envisage circumstances in which witnesses might not want to come forward. They may not be willing to co-operate or may try to hinder the effectiveness of the process. I am glad to see there is provision for penalties because this will focus the mind of a person who may want to hinder the process.</P>
    <P>The protection of the good name of persons who are maliciously maligned is also included in <Col N="689"/>the Bill. People will have the option of telling their side of the story if they so wish. The Bill will be of major benefit in investigating serious matters of public concern. I wish it well. Like all legislation that has come out of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is well thought out and will be of major benefit.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation in principle. There is no doubt that we need alternative forms of inquiries into matters of public interest. This type of commission of investigation was recommended by the Law Reform Commission and, it is to be hoped, will be useful in terms of inquiries.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Labour Party has raised issues of concern about the legislation in the D&aacute;il and we will do so again in this House. Some of our concerns have been raised by Senator Terry, for example, the setting of the terms of reference by the Government. The Labour Party has suggested that the legislation be amended so that the D&aacute;il and the Seanad are given this role in setting up commissions. We are in favour of tools such as this that are cheaper than the tribunal system and, it is to be hoped, speedier, but we also want to ensure the legislation is constitutional.</P>
    <P>We identified flaws in the Bill and proposed amendments to try to address the problem. We would like the Minister to consider these amendments once again. For example, our amendments dealt with the issue of fairness. One amendment also dealt with the issue of privileged documents. My understanding is that under the legislation, the commission must examine privileged documents. We are concerned that it could contaminate the whole inquiry if the commission becomes aware of something from a privileged document. We suggested amendments in the D&aacute;il to try to address these problems but they were not accepted. We hope to put down similar amendments in this House.</P>
    <P>This is just one step. It is mentioned by the Law Reform Commission, but there are many other recommendations by the Law Reform Commission that have yet to be carried out. These deal with the general issue of the need for inquiries into issues of public concern. The problem with tribunals, as was pointed out by other Senators, is the matter of cost and time. There is no doubt that the tribunals are doing worthwhile work, but the remit of tribunals is to deal with issues of public concern, and cost and timescale are also issues of public concern. When I think of the tribunals I am reminded of<i> Bleak House</i>, which I studied in college. I am not casting aspersions on the tribunals themselves but if a matter of public interest takes so long to be investigated, the public interest aspect is lost. There is something wrong with the procedure. If an issue of public concern is investigated for so long that it is no longer of public concern, what is the point?</P>
    <P>The Flood tribunal is investigating matters which are of concern to people who live in my <Col N="690"/>local area, in the constituency of Dublin West. However, time is moving on and people wonder whether anything will come of the tribunal. If the investigation lasts for 11 or 12 years, will it still matter? Will we have moved so far ahead that it will be just a footnote in history? I hope not, but we must consider ways of addressing this problem. We need to make sure the tribunal can complete its work as quickly and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>While the tribunal carries out its work it should be able to complete a study of its particular area so that in a few years laws could be introduced to address some of the problems identified. There should be moments of completion along the way and, overall, the tribunal should be able to make its determinations much more quickly. Whatever is required to do that should be done. If we provide resources for the tribunal to carry out its work more quickly and efficiently it will be a cost that we face now, but in the long term it will save money and the tribunal will gain more respect and mean more to people.</P>
    <P>It is important that the tribunals have some effect in terms of reforms, many of which have taken place without reference to any tribunal findings. We must ensure our reforms take into account the issues being investigated and adjudicated upon by the tribunals. We also need to make sure that in the next few years we introduce reforms in legislation and public policy on the basis of information gained from the tribunals.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome and has been talked about by the Minister for a long time.</P>
    <P>However, there are many other measures which the Government promised at various times in respect of which no legislation is forthcoming. What is being done about this at Government level? The Government proposed the appointment of a parliamentary inspector. This is also mentioned briefly in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report. In that regard, the Labour Party has proposed the setting up of a parliamentary inspectorate to work in tandem with an investigation oversight and petitions committee. Its function would be similar to that carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General on behalf of the DIRT inquiry. It would complement the commissions of investigation because the commissions are very much Government initiated whereas a parliamentary inspectorate would be accountable to both Houses of the Oireachtas. What is happening on that? It is my understanding that the Government has shelved it.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of addressing the need for criminal investigation into wrongdoing. Most people would like to see justice done regarding wrongdoing in matters of public interest. It is very much the public perception that there is not enough of that. What does the Government intend to do to ensure more is done in this area? People who are guilty of wrongdoing in the public arena should be prosecuted where appropriate. Very little is being done in this regard.</P><Col N="691"/>
    <P>The Labour Party has proposed a constitutional amendment to ensure that a parliamentary inquiry is as effective a tool as it can be. What is the Government doing in this area? The Law Reform Commission report indicates that a constitutional amendment is probably necessary to correct the legislation as it stands. Does the Government intend to examine that aspect as well?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commissions of Investigation Bill provides an essential and valuable alternative method of investigating matters of public concern. It establishes a body whose brief is to find the truth and deliver justice.</P>
    <P>The issues of public concern the commissions will investigate will not be trivial matters, but serious issues that could have long-term effects on Irish society. The Bill originates in the need to provide a means for investigation into child sex abuse scandals and other issues of national concern. It is essential to have a general framework for the operation of commissions inquiring into subjects as serious and as sensitive as these. It is hoped that is what the Bill will provide.</P>
    <P>The State has a responsibility to act as quickly as possible to provide a forum where victims of abuse and other serious issues can tell their stories and justice can be served. The Bill does everything to facilitate the voluntary co-operation of witnesses. Evidence will generally be taken in private and without legal representation. This is a very important aspect of the Bill. As a result the process will become more personal. Witnesses will not have lawyers badgering and cross-examining them. The purpose of these commissions will be to listen to grievances and discover the truth in a less adversarial atmosphere, not to point the finger of blame or doubt as happens in a court where the main aim of the lawyer is to win rather than discover the facts. The identity of witnesses will be protected in the interests of the investigation. This is very important, first, in order to encourage witnesses to attend and, second, to reduce the stress and anxiety caused to witnesses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the flexibility of the commissions. They will be prepared to accept evidence by video link or by way of affidavit. This aspect is extremely important for witnesses for whom recalling events is traumatic without being surrounded by judgmental eyes. This will ensure that witnesses feel secure enough to give their evidence without feeling they are on trial. It is also helpful from a geographical point of view, as some witnesses may be unable to travel to a commission.</P>
    <P>It is also essential, however, that the commissions have the power to ensure compliance with investigations. Where important witnesses refuse to attend, the Bill provides the commissions with the power to give direction to attend to answer questions and disclose and produce documents, to enter and search prem<Col N="692"/>ises, to seize documents, and to make determinations where privilege is claimed in respect of information and documents.</P>
    <P>It will be an offence to obstruct a commission or to fail to comply with its directions or to give false evidence. In addition, a commission may refer certain matters to the High Court for its directions, and failure by a witness to comply will give rise to contempt of court. This aspect of the Bill is essential to ensure that a commission is totally competent. It would make most investigations impossible if key witnesses refused to turn up.</P>
    <P>One of the main aspects of this Bill is the establishment of a flexible investigative mechanism for the State. There will not be a single or permanent investigative body. Each commission will be designed to suit exactly the needs of the matter being investigated. We will now be able to draw on a wide range of skills and expertise in order to establish a commission best suited to investigating particular issues. This is very important and will give the commissions a multidimensional aspect. The experience of some members will complement the expertise of others and <i>vice versa</i> and the Bill will ensure that each commission will be totally competent to investigate each case.</P>
    <P>The new mechanism of investigation created by this Bill will provide a more timely and more cost effective investigation of serious social issues. That the commissions established as a result of this Bill will greatly reduce the need for legal representation means that investigations will cost much less. Reports in today&rsquo;s newspapers estimate that to date we have spent &euro;120 million, and it is suggested that the overall cost could be as much as &euro;1 billion. It is not hard to imagine the number of hospital beds that could be provided or the number of hospitals and schools that could be built with that amount of money. What is happening is totally immoral. Inquiries will cost less. However, their effectiveness will not be diluted in any way. The opposite will be the case as the ability of commissions to investigate will be enhanced. The reduced need for legal representation will also ensure that commissions can reach a speedier conclusion to an investigation.</P>
    <P>The Commissions of Investigation Bill can only be welcomed. It will provide the State with a speedier and more cost effective means of investigating serious issues. Flexibility will ensure fair procedures and competent investigation. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. He published this important Bill more than 18 months ago and none of us should underestimate its significance. If this Bill is embraced and the newly established commissions that will investigate matters of public concern in the future are successful, we will have turned a corner in terms of providing a non-judicial form of inquiry which will be outside parliament and outside the <Col N="693"/>courts but will still provide satisfactory results for the public and politicians.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in parliamentary inquiries. There is considerable scope within the judgment on Abbeylara as to what politicians can inquire into. We clearly cannot make findings of fact against individuals. However, we can make recommendations in connection with general policy matters. Too often we have underestimated the role and significance of parliamentary inquiries within our democracy. In the first instance, they are cross-party inquiries, which overcome the type of party-political backbiting that goes on in this and the other House. Second, they are a very cheap way of doing serious work. Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s work with the justice committee in the context of the Barron report resulted in the publication of a very good report in a very short time and cost a very small amount of money. We should look at the potential of parliamentary inquiries that the Abbeylara judgment gives us. Politicians have too often said that the Abbeylara judgment dilutes parliamentary inquiries. It does in some respects, but in other respects it points a way to the future.</P>
    <P>I understand the Government can, by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, establish a commission of investigation. The benefit of this commission is that it will do its work in private, call its witnesses, seek orders to ensure people attend and seek orders to ensure that papers are delivered. At the end of that process, it can make a recommendation for a full-blooded tribunal, it can simply hand over the matters it has found to the authorities for a criminal investigation or it can report back to the Oireachtas. That is the flexibility we need. Our big problem to date has been that almost all tribunals have been in public. That is the great dilemma. Once something is in public, the costs of the tribunal inevitably increase. This is because people want their reputations upheld, believe they have a right to cross-examine witnesses who say adverse things about them and have a right to uphold their good names.</P>
    <P>By giving flexibility, which the Bill does, to the various commissions that are established, we will be doing a good service because we will be giving people the power to make the common sense judgments they need to make. If one reads the fourth interim report from Judge Mahon on his tribunal, it is a cry for help. We established the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal and we made an absolute hames of it. In the last term of reference, we opened up any other matter that is brought to the attention of the tribunal. This means that by compulsion it must investigate everything. It cannot make the common sense judgments that all of us make in our daily lives because it does not have the power to do so. The commission will now ensure that such a common sense approach will be taken.</P>
    <P>Judge Mahon&rsquo;s report is a cry for help. We all have an obligation to change the terms of reference, to give the tribunal the power to get on with <Col N="694"/>its work and to make the distinction between significance and insignificance. While we want everything to be out in the open, the dilemma is that it is very costly and it automatically ensures rebuttal and cross-examination. It also has to be said that if a person makes an allegation against another individual, it is not fair that such an allegation is allowed to be in the public arena for months or years without the named individual having the chance to rebut the allegation. That is not fair in any normal democracy and it has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The role of star witnesses is another issue to be addressed. If one is performing publicly at these tribunals, one thinks of the headlines that will appear the next day. The headlines determine what is going on at the tribunal. It is another downside to the public side of the tribunal. It would be much easier to gather information and come to speedy conclusions if it was in private. It would also be at less cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Lenihan, stated that the commitment towards the new commission approach came as the result of the allegations of sexual abuse of children by priests in the Dublin dioceses. One of the women who bravely took this matter into the public arena was a constituent of mine called Marie Collins. She has asked, through her group, that the very first commission to be established once the Bill goes through both Houses should look at the Dublin dioceses. This would be done in private to find out exactly if additional inquiries need to take place. That commitment was given when the Minister first mooted the proposal. Is it the intention of the Government that it would be the first commission?</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Terry that in giving the Government the power to make the resolution, we are giving it significant power. It would have been preferable if an all-party committee established a resolution before both Houses and gave possession of the commission to both Houses of the Oireachtas, rather than to the Government. One of the benefits of a tribunal is that it is, by and large, an animal of the Oireachtas rather than of the Government. We could do a disservice to the commission by ensuring that it is only established on resolution of the Government and not of the Houses in general.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate. I am very pleased that the Bill has been broadly welcomed on all sides of the House. This indicates that it is not only a timely measure but that it addresses many of the major concerns about current arrangements.</P><Col N="695"/>
    <P>This Bill is very significant reforming legislation and in the fullness of time it will be seen as a major step forward in the way we conduct public investigations in the State. We are all aware of the increasing demand for public investigations as a means of dealing with issues of major concern. There is a reasonable expectation that such investigations will produce quick and satisfactory outcomes. However, these expectations have too often been frustrated and, as a result, the investigation process has been damaged by perceptions of delay, obstruction and serious cost implications. This was outlined in particular by Senator Quinn when he referred to the cost and length of the major tribunals. The structures and processes provided for in the Bill will go a long way towards remedying many of the problems associated with the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>No one has claimed that the Bill represents a solution to all the problems currently associated with public inquiries and investigations. However, I am satisfied that it provides the State with an effective and additional means of carrying out such inquiries and investigations. The new procedure is flexible and can be applied in a very wide variety of circumstances. It is user friendly as it creates a less adversarial environment and in that way it facilitates witnesses who are anxious to co-operate with a commission. Senators made the point that some lawyers are out to win and be seen to win, rather than get to the bottom of the matter and discover the truth. The Bill also provides a comprehensive framework for dealing with legal and other costs, including the possibility of tendering for services. Timeframes are established at all stages of an investigation, thus ensuring timely delivery of results. The Bill represents a balance between the public&rsquo;s right to know and the protection of the good name and reputation of a witness.</P>
    <P>I believe that a commission of investigation established under the Bill will represent good value for taxpayers money. It will be cost effective and timely. It will deliver a satisfactory result and will help restore faith in the effectiveness of public inquiries. I have taken note of concerns raised during the debate and I will bring these to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry raised concerns that the role of the Oireachtas was too limited while the Minister had too much of a role. The possibility of public hearings depends on the agreement of the commission. A witness cannot demand that a private hearing occur. Senator Terry also noted that a final report is awaited from the Law Reform Commission before a general review is possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh also referred to the role of the Oireachtas and that we should learn from the past that the terms of reference were too wide. Senator Brian Hayes also referred to such mistakes. Senator Walsh felt that it was a very well constructed alternative to the current system. That hopefully will be the case. The Bill deals <Col N="696"/>with time and cost and these are very expensive lessons we learned from the past. Senator Walsh also felt that strong powers were very necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Kett welcomed the Bill and raised concerns about the duration of the tribunals, how they departed from the terms of reference and lost focus at significant cost and duration. Senator Tuffy welcomed the Bill in principle but will propose amendments. The tribunals have been doing worthwhile work, but the cost and delay factors have been highlighted, and the consensus among Senators is that we cannot continue to support them. Senator Brian Hayes made some recommendations on what the new commission might deal with, and I am sure that it will not be short of work. His specific recommendations will be noted, and I will pass them on to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to address many of the major concerns, especially cost and duration. I hope and believe that it will restore confidence in public investigations and I commend it to the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>When we finished yesterday evening, the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, had said that this Bill was not hers and she did not want to accept the compliments coming her way. They were right and fitting in the light of her approach to education and the work she has been doing. We were talking about the part of the Bill that covers integration and what is often called &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo;. Several speakers have mentioned its importance to the individual with a disability in allowing that person to feel that a holistic approach is being taken to his or her education. They can share a classroom environment with their families, brothers and sisters, and friends.</P>
    <P>I also view the matter from the other perspective. It is important that pupils who do not have a disability realise their advantages. In some ways, it could assist them in their education to recognise that others do not have the same opportunities and have to work much harder and make much greater effort to achieve their ultimate goals. The principle of mainstreaming which, when initiated, was probably more to do with assisting the person with the disability, has a tremendous knock-on effect in broadening the mind and breaking down those barriers that existed for so long.</P><Col N="697"/>
    <P>Growing up, we probably all witnessed cases where people with disabilities were seen as an embarrassment to their families. Many children were pushed into the background, in some cases being kept from public view and, if severely handicapped, sent to homes. The enlightened approach now taken to the development of policy, particularly in the area of education, has meant that that can no longer happen. That this Bill recognises that in its approach to mainstreaming is welcome. It has the potential to ensure that we never return to the dark days.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out a range of services that must be provided in the process of education for children with disabilities. It refers to the necessity for assessment, individual education plans and support services, enshrining that in the legislation. It also provides for the important process of mediation. Like other speakers, I welcome the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, which is an important statutory authority. It will develop and add to policy. I am sure that, at a later stage, it may provide further amendments to the legislation. It will be responsible for the delivery of the Bill&rsquo;s main provisions, which are welcome, as are its prescriptive nature and the way in which it prescribes individual assessments and the drawing up of individual education plans. While some of that work was already happening, it is important to ensure now that it happen as a right and that, regardless of who is delivering it at local level, there is now an obligation to do so.</P>
    <P>To some extent the Bill places the onus on school principals to act if a child&rsquo;s needs are not being catered for. Several other speakers referred to its importance. At times, school principals would often prefer to have the decision made for them externally. That was probably not the best way to proceed. In most cases principals recognise that they have the greatest capacity to understand children&rsquo;s individual needs. It is impossible to set a matrix of guidelines and rules to cover every eventuality, since each child&rsquo;s needs are different, and it is important that the onus be on the principal. I am sure that the teaching unions have expressed their views on that, but no doubt the Department has succeeded in placating them on the issues as they arise.</P>
    <P>A time limit of three months is outlined for intervention. Such limits are important to ensure this is done in an orderly fashion. The Bill requires consultation with parents and other relevant individuals. That is important since, from time to time in the past, there was not the same necessity to involve the parents. By and large that happened, but it is important to recognise that. The majority of parents whose children have special needs whom I have met put great effort into ensuring that their children get everything possible. It is important that that need be recognised. We will probably all hear about and be lobbied on the principle of early intervention and the necessity that difficulties be recognised early.</P><Col N="698"/>
    <P>Another important element is the review process for the educational plans. No one has a monopoly of wisdom or all the bright ideas, and it does no harm for us all to go back over what we do from time to time and ensure we are doing it in a proper and efficient manner. The review of those plans is important in that regard. The Bill recognises the need for co-operation and co-ordination between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children, and that is critical. The Bill appears to recognise the current deficiency in that regard and intends to resolve it. It is largely silent on how that will apply with the health boards; that must be addressed with regard to the co-operation between the two agencies. The Minister is more than familiar with some of the cases in our own county, where the Department of Education and Science is quite forthcoming in providing facilities for autism. She has played a major role in at least two projects, if not more, in our county, to ensure that the Department of Education and Science delivered very quickly. That is tremendously welcome, but we must do something about the role of the health boards and the assistance they will provide in that regard. The current situation is certainly unacceptable, particularly where there is a lack of professionals providing therapy such as speech and language therapy. We have talked about that and referred to two cases in Loop Head and Senator Daly&rsquo;s area.</P>
    <P>There has been a general perception for some time that this problem is due to a lack of Government funding. When one scratches the surface, however, one finds that the funding is there. Some positions have not been filled because of the nature of the work involved and the difficulty in getting people to move to remote locations. This is primarily an issue for the Department of Health and Children but the Minister of State has been working to address the problem. One solution is to try to make the positions available to speech and language and occupational therapists in the health service more flexible and more balanced so that they are not constantly dealing with the same type of problem. This is important because there is so much opportunity for them to make good money in the private sector and to be flexible in terms of the way they do their work. The work done by the Department of Education and Science on this matter is enshrined in the Bill but it must work in parallel with the Department of Health and Children to ensure we are not left with an exceptionally good system delivered through education while significant deficiencies remain in the health area.</P>
    <P>One element of the problem is that parents of children with special educational needs feel there is a greater array of services available for those living in urban areas. This is true of all services in that there is a greater concentration where the population dictates that services can be clustered. But people living in less densely populated parts of the country should not feel they are being offered an inferior service to that enjoyed by their <Col N="699"/>urban counterparts. Effort is required to ensure that these geographical issues are resolved. The Hanly report mentions this geographical issue so perhaps that thinking will permeate through the Department of Health and Children and assist in the delivery of services in this area.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>My party was never shy about the Hanly report and Senator Burke is aware that the electoral record in County Clare demonstrates that the report had no effect on our performance despite the fact that there were cries from all sides&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is too late in the evening for that discussion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It certainly is not and I would be happy to go through the numbers with Senator Burke and demonstrate that the seats lost in certain geographical areas had nothing to do with health. That is another day&rsquo;s work however.</P>
    <P>I welcome the weighted system for the delivery of resource teachers, which is being introduced by the Department of Education and Science. It is important to recognise that the emphasis on the role of the principal is being restored in allowing a certain amount of teaching capacity for that role and control of the allocation of resources. This is an improvement on the present system, which has us all driven around the bend, whereby detailed applications must be submitted to the special education unit in Athlone to undergo a complex processing procedure. This will particularly benefit those children with a less severe disability or special educational need, which can be easily diagnosed by teachers. The necessary resources in these cases can now be applied immediately without the necessity for primary, secondary and tertiary assessment and so on, which was logjamming the Department of Education and Science. I look forward to the implementation of this new system in September.</P>
    <P>I have already discussed the matter of special needs assistants with the Minister of State and there is an issue here regarding the cap on numbers. A number of children will continue to require the services of classroom assistants as it is the only way they can successfully function within a mainstream school environment. We must ensure that the needs of such children are met while also ensuring that children without special needs are not unduly hindered because of potential unruly behaviour, for example. This issue must be resolved, potentially by means of a simi<Col N="700"/>lar weighted system to provide teachers with the capability to deliver the necessary resources. The current situation whereby there is a need for a student to have an individual classroom assistant is unnecessary. Some students seem to believe they have ownership of particular assistants and this has caused some difficulties. There is a capacity for sharing in this area in a similar manner to the sharing of the resource in schools.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Department of Education and Science on the tremendous strides that have been made and recognise that this Bill represents the legislative framework for the future provision and enhancement of special educational needs services. There has been much debate in this House about the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing the necessary funding and funding will always be an issue irrespective of which party is in power and how resources are disbursed. This Government has demonstrated its commitment in terms of the allocation of extra teachers, a crucial measure which represents an excellent way to begin the implementation of this legislation. People on this side of the House would never claim that the problem is entirely resolved through the introduction of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted Senator Dooley included that qualification.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>I have no doubt that this Government is committed in the same manner that my party has always been committed since even before the time of Mr. Donogh O&rsquo;Malley and his achievement in taking on and delivering reform to the education sector. It is important that the current Government continue that tradition. I compliment the Minister of State on the work she is doing and on this Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the brave work she is doing in the Department of Education and Science about which she keeps this House regularly briefed. I welcome this Bill because it establishes the foundation for a new service for those with special educational needs. The service has been fragmented, disjointed and unco-ordinated over the years and one of the greatest criticisms has been that the Department of Education and Science was unaware of what the health boards were doing and <i>vice versa</i>. Senator Dooley mentioned the shortage of professionals required to provide the necessary services, particularly in isolated areas, whether speech therapy, psychological services and so on. These professionals are currently in short supply and it is often the people who most need the service who are denied it because they reside in an <Col N="701"/>isolated location and because the service is not available in a co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the issue of early diagnosis of those with special educational needs. It is vital that problems are identified before children even start school. The emphasis in this Bill is on the education system but the real problems arise when parents discover, perhaps very shortly after their child is born, that he or she will have significant special educational needs in the long term. This is long before there is any contact with the education system and any proper diagnosis of a child&rsquo;s particular educational difficulties. There is an absence of support, advice and guidance for families in those critical days after they discover they have a serious problem on their hands. The extent of the problem and its long-term consequences may not be identified for some time.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for children outlined the provisions of the Bill. I draw the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera&rsquo;s, attention to the need for an early response and to have some help and advice mechanism available for people when they discover, sometimes to their alarm and consternation, that their child has a problem that will remain with him or her throughout their life. That is a frightening thought. I know many families who have had to cope with that type of situation and they have felt frustrated, and sometimes irritated, by the services provided. This aspect is of critical importance.</P>
    <P>Despite modern technology and the large amount of investment made in the modernisation of health services generally, increasing numbers of children still appear to be presenting with difficulties that are almost insurmountable. This is why I drew the attention of the Minister of State in the other debate to the need to undertake detailed research and to allocate funding to determine, if possible, the causes of some of the problems that arise despite all the expertise that is available. All the small maternity hospitals were closed, for example, because it was thought that if their functions could be handled differently and better, these problems would not arise, given modern sophisticated systems with paediatric and all the other relevant advice that is available.</P>
    <P>However, there appear to be increasing problems, as highlighted in west Clare recently when we met parents from the Loop Head peninsula, as the Minister of State knows. They have children with special needs and only a poor service, if any, is available. Sometimes they have to travel many miles to get advice. In some cases they must go abroad to Hungary and other countries. They feel there is some research and advice there which is not available in this country and that help may be provided for them abroad that they cannot get here. Measures should be taken before this legislation is concluded, possibly on Committee Stage, to ensure some form of guidance and advisory assistance is provided to parents in the early stages of diagnosis, long before the children go to school or need special classes and teachers. <Col N="702"/>This should be made available in an organised and planned way, particularly to give parents up-to-date scientific assessments of their children&rsquo;s prospects and how matters may be addressed.</P>
    <P>There may be a need for special education for some teachers as well. Under this legislation a significant amount of responsibility is being placed on teachers and the teaching profession. I am not sure they are qualified to deal with many of the psychological and other problems that will arise in these cases. They will need to have professional help available to them at an early stage to enable them to carry out the work they need to do. It would be most unfair to place responsibility on people in schools and in the educational system for matters for which they are neither trained nor qualified. I presume there is some level of training in the colleges of education in view of the new responsibilities that will be placed on teachers. I do not believe it will be possible to provide a psychological service that is needed in many cases given the professional norms in teaching at present. I do not know whether there is a plan to deal with that aspect. Perhaps we could get clarification at some stage on how that is to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There were several references in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech to the relationship between the system being provided under this legislation and the various health boards. However, as we all know, the health boards are being abolished. There is no clear indication at this stage as to what way the different areas will be managed under the new model of health administration. I understand there are to be four boards for the different areas. I am not certain that the wisest course is to divide the activities of the current health boards between the four new systems. In legislation such as this, it is timely to examine whether it is necessary to rearrange the administration of the health authorities, especially the new forums that are to be set up in the respective areas of health administration, so that there is participation in the new health system by elected representatives in the local communities.</P>
    <P>It is time to examine how the new system will dovetail with what is being provided under this legislation. It is not good enough to continue with the current system, where one hand does not know in what the other is involved. We had experience of this recently where services were being sanctioned by one Department while another wanted them phased out. It is time to stop the fragmentation, division and compartmentalisation of activities that has been taking place in various Departments.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the national council, as proposed in the Bill, might be the vehicle to deal with that matter. I welcome the establishment of the national council. I strongly urge the Minister of State, when the council is set up, to advise it about the various issues that have arisen in these debates. Sometimes, although legislation gives an overall concept of what is to be put in place, it does not always work out in reality. Perhaps <Col N="703"/>before the legislation is finalised, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, might give some indication as to how the service being designed under this Bill will dovetail with the reorganised health system that is being put in place and how local community involvement may be built into that also. That will again help to eliminate much of the frustration being felt by parents as regards special educational activity.</P>
    <P>Recently we saw the concerns of people vividly expressed in the European elections, when Ms Kathy Sinnott was overwhelmingly elected on the basis of the activities in which she has been involved. She has been highlighting areas of disability for many years and people&rsquo;s special needs. Some highly experienced politicians, such as Mr. Gerry Collins, participated in that contest, yet out of the blue Ms Sinnott was catapulted into the European Parliament, mainly through the support of people who feel that this area has been neglected. There is a public perception that the area of children with special needs and requirements has not been given the financial or human resources attention it deserves. There is a clear signal there for us from the public in the constituency of Munster that people want action to deal with the issues with which Ms Sinnott is connected. We should learn from that lesson and take appropriate action. There should be more community involvement with the national council, more participation by local communities in the framing of arrangements to be put in place for the administration of services and, perhaps above all, a system of public private partnership to provide facilities to deal with some of the problems that exist. When the Minister for Finance introduced tax concessions for those providing respite care in institutions which care for elderly patients, many establishments were able to increase their bed capacity. Nursing homes like St. Theresa&rsquo;s in Kilrush were able to build new extensions and to provide extra beds as a result of that incentive.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State could speak to the Minister for Finance about the necessity to provide further incentives for those providing respite and care assistance. Many people are frustrated by the lack of places providing respite care for children. Also, there are not sufficient facilities available for carers, be it equipment, additional beds and accommodation or additional assistance, some of which is being provided by volunteer organisations. I welcome the work undertaken by voluntary organisations such as the Brothers of Charity. Such organisations receive a substantial amount of funding from health boards. Many people are critical of Government in that regard and often feel that were it not for a particular voluntary organisation they would have nothing. However, what they do not realise is that the voluntary organisations are substantially funded by the State, something not often acknowledged or appreciated.</P><Col N="704"/>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the Bill&rsquo;s passage. Members will have another opportunity on Committee Stage to tease it out further. This legislation provides us with an opportunity in the preparation of the administration of the new health boards to weld together a system which will respond to people&rsquo;s needs so that people will no longer be frustrated in terms of how they feel they are being treated. When this legislation is enacted and the national council takes up its role we will have a system, which can respond quickly and professionally to meet the requirements of those with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation will deal satisfactorily with the needs of those disappointed and frustrated by previous legislation and will provide those who care for children with special needs with an easier life. In many cases such special needs can be alleviated by support, guidance and financial assistance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a little like a meeting of the Clare persons&rsquo; association in the Chamber this evening. I am a second generation Clare person.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo; is applicable in the area of special needs. The announcement in the past few days by the Department of Education and Science regarding the specific allocations of special needs assistants is incredible. The Department had that information for more than a year.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a particular case, which arose for a school in County Clare. A civil servant based in Wicklow collected from the school all the information needed about its pupils with special needs and returned to Dublin with it. The school in question then had to fill out a detailed questionnaire and had to answer many detailed questions on the matter over the telephone. The same information was requested from the school on three different occasions. As if that were not bad enough, the school then had to wait a full year for the allocation to be made. One student had to wait 12 months for a special needs assistant. A year is a long time but a year out of eight years in terms of one&rsquo;s primary school education is an extremely long time. Primary school education is in many ways the foundation for life.</P>
    <P>Announcement of the allocations last Friday when most schools had commenced or were about to commence their summer holidays was an incredible decision which placed principals in an impossible position. While some schools gained resource hours, a particular school in north Kilkenny is losing them. That places principals and parents in an impossible situation, especially those parents whose children will not now obtain special needs assistance. They cannot take up this matter during the summer because schools are closed, principals or class teachers are not available and trying to get through to the Department of Education and Science or obtaining an answer from officials there is a major endeavour, to say the least.</P><Col N="705"/>
    <P>One would imagine the Department of Education and Science to be the smartest Department. However, that is not the case. Many schools which received news that they are to gain teachers also received a circular regarding staff appointments and new procedures that may arise as a result of special needs allocations. That matter was decided last March yet it has taken three months for schools to receive that circular. Perhaps the Minister of State will reply on those two points. Why was the announcement regarding special needs appointments made at the 11th hour and why did a circular regarding staff appointments and procedures for appointments take three or four months to arrive in schools? I understand some schools have not yet received the circular.</P>
    <P>The deployment of teachers for the coming school year is unclear. The circular states that the Department of Education and Science will communicate with schools regarding new clusters of schools being created before the commencement of the coming school year. That is very vague. Schools are closed for the summer. When will principals and teachers be informed of what will happen? Many Members represent rural constituencies where schools are currently working in clusters. It will be awkward for three or four principals to pool resources and work together. This decision places them in a difficult situation. Although I hope I am wrong, I predict there will be anarchy and chaos in schools for the first few weeks of September. That should not be the case. In my view the Minister should make decisions for the following school year in February to ensure a smooth transition period. The danger now is that the months of September and October will be wasted while schools try to get organised.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the removal of children with dyslexia and dyspraxia from resource hours to learning support teachers. However, school staff have no idea how such teachers will put in the hours required by these children while taking care of the needs of children with learning difficulties. The position of special needs assistants is also vague. The circular states that schools will be advised of the outcome of their application as soon as possible in advance of the next school year. When will they be advised in that regard given that they are closed for the summer?</P>
    <P>The Department has not informed schools of decisions regarding resource hours, special needs assistants and possible job appointments. It takes a number of weeks to fill vacancies as one must first advertise the position and then hold interviews. That impinges on principals and boards of management who must give up their time to deal with this matter during the summer, something which is quite difficult to do at a time when most people take their holidays. The announcement of extra special needs assistants is to be welcomed. However, I wonder from where they will come. It is currently quite difficult to recruit full-time qualified teachers. It is possible special needs assistants will be taken from mainstream classes. <Col N="706"/>The question then arises as to who will replace them. I recently raised the issue of cutbacks in the postgraduate places for teacher training. Such cutbacks make no sense given the number of graduates wanting to undertake teacher training. It is not good enough that they cannot do so. They should be allowed to take the postgraduate course because there is a shortage of teachers and the country needs teachers badly. It does not make sense to reduce the number of postgraduate places.</P>
    <P>Will students who receive resource hours keep those hours for the following year and the rest of their school-going days? I am aware that five children who receive special needs assistance in a school were not on a list given to the school&rsquo;s authorities recently. When parents telephoned the Department to find out why their children were not on the list, they were informed that a mistake had been made by, the Department and that they should be on the list. Was it a one-off case or are similar cases to be found throughout the country? Is it the case that children who should be on lists are missing from such lists? The system does not seem to be very well organised because mistakes are being made. Such mistakes will not be spotted until September because we are entering the summer period.</P>
    <P>The National Disability Authority began its work in June 2000 and has published three annual reports since then. The reports have not been made public, which is not a great vote of confidence. I ask that the reports be released so we can make a judgment on the authority&rsquo;s work. I am glad to have availed of the opportunity to discuss this matter. When I raised it on the Order of Business, the Leader, who is a former teacher and Minister for Education, agreed with the points I made. I hope the Minister of State will bear them in mind.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this Second Stage debate. Not only have many Members shown a great interest in the Bill, but many of them have shown that they have a great deal of knowledge of the subject. It is always useful in such debates to hear concrete examples such as those we have heard this evening. As we are dealing with a sensitive issue, it is important to deal with it in the best possible way. The Bill benefited significantly from the scrutiny it received in the D&aacute;il and it can only benefit from the debate in the Seanad. Having listened carefully to the comments made, I would like to speak about a number of the issues raised.</P>
    <P>I disagree with some of the points made by Senators Cox and Ulick Burke about the Bill. The legislation is designed to elaborate on and ensure the delivery of the constitutional rights of children with special educational needs. It will provide a statutory guarantee to an assessment, an education plan and support services, something which does not exist at present. Along with <Col N="707"/>other Senators, they raised the issue of the definition of a &ldquo;child&rdquo; and the limitation of the benefits of the Bill to those under 18 years of age. The purpose of this Bill is to address the constitutional rights in Article 42 of the Constitution, particularly the right to free primary education of children under 18. Section 15 recognises that in preparing and reviewing education plans, regard must be had to the provision that must be made to allow the child to continue his or her education after the age of 18.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming disability Bill will deal more specifically with the delivery of services, including education services, to adults with disabilities. When taken with the introduction of an advocacy service for children and adults under the Comhairle Bill, this legislation and the disability Bill will offer a complete and seamless service, albeit with differing regimes, for children and adults.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators mentioned the need for early intervention, which all of us recognise as important. We should provide properly for the transitions between pre-school and primary education, as well as between primary and secondary education. That a &ldquo;child&rdquo; is defined as a person under the age of 18 demonstrates a commitment to intervening as early as possible. Education plans must contain inputs to facilitate important transitions in a child&rsquo;s education.</P>
    <P>I invite those Senators who referred to resources to consider more closely section 13, which requires the Ministers for Education and Science, Health and Children and Finance to provide the necessary funds to allow for the preparation and implementation of education plans. Section 9(7) requires that schools be provided with the resources necessary to prepare and implement education plans. Some Senators misunderstand the purpose of section 13. It has been argued that the inclusion of a reference to the consent of the Minister for Finance to resourcing decisions under the Bill is tantamount to a veto for the financial watchdogs over the rights of children with disabilities, but that is emphatically not the case.</P>

	<P>The record speaks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>The reference to the Minister for Finance in section 13 ensures that when he exercises his constitutional duty to control expenditure, he is reminded of the State&rsquo;s duty in Article 42 to make proper provision for the education of all the children of the State. He will have to ensure that those who need the most help get the most help.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The record stands.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 13 is unique in shaping the exercise of this discretion. If the Minister for Finance fails to make adequate resources avail<Col N="708"/>able to the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science to discharge their duties under the Act, those who suffer as a consequence may have grounds for a review of the Minister&rsquo;s failure in the High Court. Section 13 provides an essential guarantee to parents by giving them the mechanism through which they can ultimately call the Government to account before the courts.</P>
    <P>I reject absolutely the suggestion that the Government does not treat children with special educational needs as a priority. It is not credible as the number of resource teachers in the State has grown from 104 to 2,500 since 1998. The number of learning support teachers has increased by 300 and there are more than 4,500 full-time and 1,500 part-time special needs assistant posts. Senators are aware that a further 350 posts have recently been sanctioned. The National Council for Special Education is in the process of appointing 80 special needs organisers.</P>
    <P>I recognise there is a delay in dealing with applications for special needs assistants in my Department. The new system for allocating resources, which was announced recently, will address the problem by substantially reducing the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments. It will put resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty over their resource levels. This will allow for better planning in schools and greater scope for early intervention.</P>
    <P>I would like to examine one of Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s many interesting comments. It is right that principals should have responsibility for arranging assessments and education plans. It does not mean that they will have to take on the task single-handedly. Guidelines will be prepared by the national council to assist principals and staff, to whom they delegate tasks. In more complex cases, principals will be able to call on special educational needs organisers to take over the assessment and planning processes.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole queried the duty of special needs organisers to assist principals in their duties under the Bill, which is provided for in section 18. The inclusion of psychologists on the team preparing the education plan is provided for in section 8. The Senator drew attention to the fact that explicit provision is not made in the Bill for the delivery of services through Irish, where it is appropriate to the needs of a child with special educational needs. I agree that the needs of the child and the wishes of the parent are essential to the educational process. Statutory guarantees in the Official Languages Act and the Education Act secure the linguistic rights of all children within education. Children with special educational needs are no different in this regard. The most appropriate mechanism to deal with this issue is by means of guidelines issued by the National Council for Special Education.</P><?oasys [cl11.2]?>
    <P>A great deal of effort and resources will be needed to implement the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. In this context, a five-year implementation plan is not unrealistic and has received widespread support. <Col N="709"/>There is much work to be done by the National Council for Special Education in delivering on the legislation but this will be one of the most important projects in the history of the education system.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate and look forward to continuing this process in subsequent Stages in the House.</P>

	<P>This matter concerns the boundaries for the local elections due to be held in 2009, of which I hope a review will be carried out. Although Carlow is the second smallest county I want to list some examples of the daftness of the current system.</P>
    <P>The first case I want to highlight concerns Ballon, in Carlow, a very small village which finds itself divided in half. One half is in the Tullow electoral area and the other is in the Bagnelstown electoral area. That is unfair to the residents of Ballon because it complicates matters. They have two engineers and two sets of councillors. It does not make sense to divide villages in two for electoral boundary purposes.</P>
    <P>Another case involves Graiguecullen, in Carlow, where the River Barrow does not form the county boundary, although many people believe that is the case. There is an imaginary line crossing the river. In fact, most of Graiguecullen is in Carlow and estates like Rossmore View, Oakley Park and Mount Clare can vote for both Carlow Town Council and Carlow County Council candidates but they are in the Laois area. When it comes to getting anything done, however, and this includes for those in Fr. Byrne Park, they have to go to Laois County Council but Laois County Council will barely return telephone calls from public representatives. That is totally unsatisfactory. The boundaries in that area should be completely reviewed.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>If people in an estate vote for public representatives, the people voted in should be able to do work for them. When people vote in a public representative from Carlow, it is daft that Laois County Council is the only local authority that can do something for them. Perhaps the Minister is aware of a similar case in Shannon. I suspect there is a problem with <Col N="710"/>boundaries near Limerick, although perhaps I am wrong. The Minister might understand to what I am referring.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>Another example is Bennekerry. The main population base in Bennekerry is Kernanstown Terrace, which is in area No. 2 in Carlow, but the remainder of Bennekerry is in area No. 1. Likewise, one third of the rural parish of Tinryland is in area No. 2 for local election purposes, with the remainder in the Bagnelstown area.</P>
    <P>My request to the Minister is simple. A review should be carried out. I realise it is a difficult job but one or two basic principles should be applied in that review. First, parishes should be kept together as much as possible in rural areas, unless the parish is very big and can afford to be split in two. Second, villages should be kept intact in one unit in whatever electoral area they are placed. I urge the Minister in particular to consider the ludicrous scenario we face in Carlow and Graiguecullen, which is totally unsatisfactory to everyone concerned in both Laois and Carlow. I realise five years is a long time away in some respects but it is important we get this process under way as soon as possible. People who wish to stand in the local elections in 2009 should know the area they will be representing.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to many people on this issue and I am aware that it is not just a problem in Carlow; it is being experienced throughout the country. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who regrets he cannot be here for this debate but he has asked me to make the following remarks on his behalf.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter. It is important to point out that unlike the situation regarding D&aacute;il constituencies, there are no constitutional or statutory requirements regarding the frequency of local electoral area reviews. The most recent reviews took place in 1998 and were carried out by two independent <i>ad hoc</i> committees, one for the Dublin local authorities and another dealing with the rest of the country. Prior to the 1998 reviews, a review of local electoral areas was carried out in 1985; in other words, there was a gap of 13 years between the previous reviews. The reports and recommendations of both of the 1998 committees were accepted in full by the Government and were implemented and in force at the June 1999 and 2004 local elections.</P>
    <P>Certain provisions of the Local Government Act 2001, due to be commenced later this year, will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the establishment of a local government commission which will be independent in the performance of its functions. The 2001 Act provides that the Minister may, by order, divide local authorities into local electoral areas and fix the number of members to be elected for each electoral area, but this may only be done following a report by the local govern<Col N="711"/>ment commission on the matter. In requesting the commission to prepare a report, the Minister may provide terms of reference and is required to publish the commission&rsquo;s report and to have regard to it in deciding whether to make an order revising the electoral areas concerned. Reasons must be given for any material variation from the recommendations made by the commission. While there are no constitutional or statutory requirements for any specified level of equality of representation among local electoral areas within a local authority, it has been accepted that there should be reasonable equality of representation. The 1998 committees both adopted as a general target that variations within authorities should be limited to between plus and minus 10%.</P><Col N="712"/>
    <P>A further element of the Act to be brought into operation later this year relates to the alteration of local authority boundaries. In this regard, the commission may also make recommendations on foot of applications made by local authorities or if requested by the Minister. It is open to any local authority, under existing law and as a reserved function, to initiate an application for a boundary alteration. A number of such applications have been determined in recent years, two as recently as January this year. Any consequential adjustments of local electoral areas are also implemented in the context of such boundary alterations.</P>
