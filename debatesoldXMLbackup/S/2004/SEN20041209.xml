	<P>I have received notice from Senator Terry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for Education and Science the reason for the delay in the purchase of the designated school site in Diswellstown from Park Developments Limited for the construction of St. Patrick&rsquo;s national school and to indicate that measures are being taken to ensure the site is purchased without further delay and whether similar delays have been experienced in purchasing other sites from that company.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>In a 30-year period, 3,636 people have died in the conflict in the North of Ireland. Yesterday, we all envisaged that we were poised on an historic agreement. However, this seemed to have failed for one specific reason regarding photographic evidence. The blame game is now very much in place between Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP. Yesterday, in the Lower House, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, claimed it was not necessarily photographic evidence alone that was the cause of the breakdown in the talks. I am at <Col N="2034"/>sea as to the other reasons. However, these should not concern us because the Taoiseach is still optimistic that a resolution will be reached before Christmas. We wish him well in his endeavours.</P>
      <P>Had a resolution been achieved yesterday, it would have been an historic agreement and a successful climax to all the talks that have taken place over the years. Members have spoken and written eloquent newspaper articles on the situation in the North. As we face the Christmas recess next week, it would be helpful if the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs could attend the House to specifically debate this agreement. If there are minor issues preventing a successful agreement being reached, I hope they will be ironed out in the near future and a political logjam, with a sense of instability creeping into the situation, will be avoided. I ask the Leader to invite a member of the Government to debate this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s viewpoint as the House could have a useful debate on this issue. Will the Leader convey, on behalf of the House, our congratulations to the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach for the extraordinary openness they displayed in dealing with yesterday&rsquo;s press conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a model of good practice in an era when people talk about transparency and availability. I would love to force-feed that approach to President George Bush who never takes questions. The press conference was superbly handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>While people might not have liked what they heard, every question was answered and there was no attempt to hide. When I spoke here three days ago, I said I hoped that whatever happened, we would not end up in a cloud of ignorance. We know how matters stand and can measure what progress has been made. While the increment may not be the extra mile we wanted, it is important to us all that we have had full publication of what was agreed. The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister were available to answer every question. I would like to see that process continued in the House. If the Taoiseach is not available, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should come to the House to answer questions. We have had questions and answers previously. It would be useful if questions such as those asked by Senator Finucane a minute ago could be put and answered in our presence. I sense the media is trying to catch someone out in the negotiations with questions about photographs. It does not work that way. We are where we are and I would like to ask questions here about the future <Col N="2035"/>and how we can make the process work. I want the size of the problem we face to be quantified.</P>
      <P>There was a perfect example of the &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; style at its worst on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; recently. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government told the world unashamedly that while he was in favour of incineration, he was opposed to it in his own constituency. He felt that was an appropriate approach for a Minister to take as we should all remember that as well as being Ministers, Cabinet members are also constituency representatives. What they have to do for their constituencies may be different from what they have to do as Ministers. I am completely confused. It would be very helpful if the Minister came to the House to explain his views on incineration. It is a very tricky issue on which I do not pretend to know the answers. I tend to be in favour of incineration to an extent, but am not sure what we should do.</P>
      <P>I would also like the Minister to attend to explain to the House where we stand on the Kyoto Agreement, especially in light of the comment by a member of President Bush&rsquo;s cabinet that it is not environmentally friendly and should not be supported. I want to know what we have done in the context of the protocol and, in particular, what the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is doing to support people who take environmentally friendly house building decisions on rain water management, solar panels and underground heating systems. Are we encouraging people with tax breaks or grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>More than most people here, I tend to be impatient with progress on Northern Ireland. I share fully, however, the views Senator O&rsquo;Toole has just expressed. The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister have devoted themselves effectively, efficiently and constructively to the process. The Taoiseach deserves to have that recognised. The House of the Oireachtas which has had a succession of citizens of Northern Ireland as Members during my time as a Senator should have an opportunity to hear formally from the Taoiseach or Minister for Foreign Affairs and hold a long, open-ended and serious debate on the matter. I have never accepted the idea that matters are too delicate to be discussed in a democratic forum. The House has plenty of evidence of people&rsquo;s capacity to deal with sensitive and serious issues sensitively and seriously. It is high time serious debate on events in Northern Ireland took place in both Houses.</P>
      <P>In light of how forthcoming the Taoiseach and Prime Minister were at their press conference and of the accessibility of the two major political parties, it should be remembered that there is a participant in the process which is never cross-examined, never meets the press and issues sanctimonious press releases in the name of an organisation called &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann. I recognise only one &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann. I do not say <Col N="2036"/>this to point the finger, but to highlight the fact that there is one exception to everything we have said here which remains in secret. I share Senator Finucane&rsquo;s view. We must ask if a great deal more failed to be done and if it is true that the IRA was not prepared to quantify what it had in its possession. A succession of questions has arisen. I am inclined to accept the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s view that photographs were not the only problem. The best thing we could hear now would be an explicit statement from the Government detailing what precisely is the problem.</P>
      <P>It would be very useful to have a debate on incineration. There is a Minister from the constituency in which I reside who is opposed to incineration there. A Minister of State from the same constituency who is responsible for environmental protection is also opposed to incineration in the area. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are also opposed to incineration in their constituencies. The Minister for Defence is opposed to incineration in the vicinity of a naval base, not on a constituency basis as it is far outside his, but in defence of the Naval Service. Whatever the merits and demerits of incineration, on which my views are available to be checked in the Official Report, we need to know the Government&rsquo;s position on waste management. The Government must adopt a position which applies everywhere rather than simply in places other than where a Minister happens to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join previous speakers in congratulating the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and their officials who represented the Oireachtas and the Irish people in the recent negotiations. While it is very easy for those of us who are not involved to be critical, the time has come for us to offer them our congratulations on bringing us so far. I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in congratulating the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach on yesterday&rsquo;s press conference. It was a step in the right direction in terms of how business should be done.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need to avoid recriminations and of the words of Senator Maurice Hayes, to whom I listened very carefully because of his experience in this context. However, while there is a lull in the process, there is a need for everyone to reflect. In reflecting, it should be considered that no one has a monopoly on humiliation. While neither side in Northern Ireland deserves to be humiliated, nor do the Irish Government, the State, law-abiding citizens, garda&iacute; or Ann McCabe. We must reflect on that to move the process forward constructively while respecting diverse opinions on all sides. I would welcome a debate on Northern Ireland and join previous speakers in the hope that time will be provided for one next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Finucane in his call for a debate on Northern Ireland. The call <Col N="2037"/>was also aired briefly yesterday. As all speakers have indicated, it would be timely if the Leader could arrange it for next week. Despite the failure to sign off on an agreement yesterday, a great deal was achieved and everyone involved deserves our congratulations. It would be wonderful if we could hear more from the Taoiseach. There are wise heads in the House, including Senator Maurice Hayes whose comments we have been reading and who is very sound on this issue.</P>
      <P>I record my agreement with what some would call the stern advice of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, to the hotel industry to watch prices. As he said, the worsening price situation must not be ignored. He is rightly concerned about our traditional tourism markets in Britain, France and Germany. While price is not the only issue, as he said we ignore it at our peril. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, to come before the House early in the new year for a debate on the immediate future of our tourism industry and the important issues surrounding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland. In recent weeks we all agreed it may not be the most appropriate time for such a debate but it would be appropriate now because as Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned, there is a wealth of information that we did not have at our disposal previously. That demonstrates once again the extraordinary commitment of the two sovereign Governments to this peace process.</P>
      <P>Many people would have walked away from the process a long time ago but the two Governments have stayed with it. When we consider the information now available, it is clear that major progress has been made. When the current effort was not derailed by what I regard as the outburst from Dr. Paisley in Ballymena recently on the need to humiliate republicans, I believe that effort will remain intact. I agree it is time for reflection and perhaps we should all work towards harmonising Christian principles with political activity. That is what we need at this time.</P>
      <P>One major result that has come out of all the difficulties, and it may be ironic in an historic sense, is the fact that this process has brought Britain and Ireland closer together&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that is part of the total equation. Obviously, we have great admiration for the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and all the other people involved in the process but my admiration for Tony Blair increases each time I listen to him. When I look back on the history of Ireland and the history of the North of Ireland, we were always worried what Margaret Thatcher or somebody like that would say to cause further prob<Col N="2038"/>lems. When I listen to Tony Blair, however, I hear a very reasonable, humane and pragmatic person. I agree with other speakers. We do not want recrimination. It is possible that in a matter of days something could happen, although I have my doubts. We should not ignore the fact that the looming United Kingdom general election has a bearing on this issue but I remain confident that the breakthrough could come at the very time we least expect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Leader share my concern at the statement by Colin Powell that we should look beyond Iraq? It suggests to me that Mr. Powell, in a form of queasy hypocrisy which one has come to expect from the Goering of the Bush regime, wants us to overlook what has been happening in Baghdad, Falluja and Abu Ghraib.</P>
      <P>I would like the Leader to draw to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs the reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> today where it is clear that the torture in Abu Ghraib consisted of using electric shock instruments and included the squeezing of the genitals of male prisoners by female operatives, which is very shocking, particularly to Islamic people. There were also prisoners with burns on their backs and prisoners with damaged kidneys. This is not a laughing matter. I am very surprised that some of the Senators on the opposite side of the House can smile about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame on you for smiling. You are very good on humiliation of other people but you do not seem to care very much about the humiliation of these unfortunate Iraqis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris, speak through the Chair please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that you, a Chathaoirligh, was as offended as I was by the sniggering on the opposite side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should ignore it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This torture continued after the revelation of the abuse. In light of that fact, we should also ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to require from the occupying forces a statement on what is happening in Falluja, where there is no monitoring whatsoever. The silence there is very worrying.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform why the Garda authorities in Limerick and Shannon, despite a complaint indicating <i>prima facie</i> evidence of criminal activity involving the aeroplane that has been named, have taken no action? We need to know about that.</P><Col N="2039"/>
      <P>I want to record my pleasure, and I am sure other Members feel the same, at the closure of a pub in Marlborough Street for three days because somebody was found drunk to the point of complete incapacity and a danger to himself and the public. I am very glad that the legislation passed through this House has now been seen to be effective in this regard. The legislation should be extended to include off-licences. Perhaps they are covered by the legislation but I am not sure.</P>
      <P>Last night, coincidentally, I witnessed a man and a woman who were almost insensible with drink purchasing alcohol from an off-licence in Parnell Street. That is not good enough. The personnel in these shops are not entirely responsible because, very often, they are not Irish nationals, their command of English is not very good and I doubt if they know the law. However, this practice should be stamped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Senators in calling for a debate on Northern Ireland. I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; who talked about the example of good neighbours working together. That was clear from the positive press conference yesterday, despite the disappointing outcome.</P>
      <P>On another issue about good neighbours, I understand the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will sign a deal with the British ambassador tomorrow on access to the Sellafield nuclear plant. This is the first time such access has been agreed. I understand there will be access also to the security arrangements there, which is very welcome. I am sure we all want the total closure of the Sellafield plant because if there was a terrorist attack or a failure at Sellafield, the consequences for this country would be horrific. I agree with the call for a debate on waste management, the Kyoto Protocol and other issues, which are relevant at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the call from some of my colleagues for a debate on Northern Ireland, which would be helpful because it would allow us the opportunity to ventilate to some degree the significant progress that has been made. We must recognise that over the course of the past ten years or so there has been transformation beyond description in the politics and the lives of the people of Northern Ireland. It appears now that another deadline has come and gone but that should not be a cause for any long-term disappointment. The significant political progress which has been made between the parties will inevitably result in a solution with which every side can live. It is most unhelpful to go down the route of defining humiliation and trying to cast blame. We must recognise that attitudes have changed greatly and that allows everybody the opportunity to move forward.</P>
      <P>The second issue I want to raise, as I did a month or six weeks ago, is the ongoing crisis in Sudan. Over the past few months, hundreds of <Col N="2040"/>thousands of people in that unfortunate country have either been killed, died from famine or have been displaced. It is the greatest international tragedy yet it is not the subject of the same type of debate as happens on other regions of the world currently under the spotlight. A debate in this House on Sudan would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Senators are offering and I would like them to be brief to allow us accommodate everybody before the time expires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in calling for a debate on incineration, an issue about which there has been much misinformation and confusion over the past few years. We would benefit from a balanced debate, with all of the facts, in which we can explore the many positive aspects that are associated with incineration, and the negative ones, and form an opinion on it going forward.</P>
      <P>In asking the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come before the House we could finally deal with the issue of the review of local government funding, which has been ongoing. While I welcome the increased allocation to the local government fund, it should be reviewed if needed because serious reform is necessary so local government can be financed in a more sustainable and fair manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the praise of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister for their patience in dealing with the parties in Northern Ireland. I visited the North this week and witnessed the incredible changes. It would be dreadful if the process went backwards and a debate on the issues would be useful.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to address the lack of facilities for children who come before the courts? This is a serious problem and various judges have tried to illustrate the difficulties in arranging a safe place for children who appear before the courts on criminal charges. Today&rsquo;s newspapers report on a case where the staff of a centre pleaded with the judge not to send a girl to them but he said he had to because there was no other place to send the girl who was on remand. Many Members will recall the effort Judge Hubert Wine put into bringing to the attention of the Department of Justice the dreadful lack of such facilities. The Minister should come to the House to outline the current position and explain why there is such a scarcity of suitable places after all these years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair on a wonderful presentation yesterday. We have come so far that both Prime Ministers are equal. Their body language at the press conference was a credit to all concerned. Perhaps we can look forward to the First Minister of Northern Ireland addressing the House next <Col N="2041"/>year. I hope there will be a peaceful Christmas in the North and that there will be a successful outcome to the talks.</P>
      <P>Christmas is both a happy and sad time for many people. Approximately 10,000 undocumented Irish people live in the United States. When we return next year, will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to debate this issue? Next year should be used to lobby the American Government to provide visas for our undocumented citizens so they can return home. I received a telephone call recently from a young man in Boston, who is lonely and sad. He typifies many Irish people in America. He could not return home for Christmas last year and cannot do so this year. Hopefully, he will be able to do so next year because if all parties put in an effort and work together on this issue, great results could be achieved. The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festivities could be used as the highlight in a push by the Government to ensure the undocumented in the US are recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the two parties have failed to reach agreement on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Much has been done and a measure of consensus has been achieved. I seek a debate on Northern Ireland in the new year. I pay tribute to both Governments for their tolerance and I renew my call on the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to curb the choreography and histrionics, which are not helpful to the peace process. I wish the Government well and I hope negotiations are resumed at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland. Every Tuesday at 5.30 p.m. Government Members are updated by the Taoiseach on what is happening in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is disgraceful. Can we attend those meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business. All Senators cannot attend those meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a no-brainer when, unfortunately, Dr. Paisley used emotive language when he referred to people going around in sackcloth and ashes. My uncle is a founder of the SDLP and when I spoke to him earlier, he said Dr. Paisley should withdraw that statement. It was not an outburst and it caused difficulty. It is important to remember that people on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland were manipulated into violence by both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>At a time when there is difficulty getting two sides to agree, I support Senator Kitt&rsquo;s comments about the agreement on access to Sellafield which will be signed tomorrow. I seek a debate on this issue early in the next session to ensure our attention continues to be <Col N="2042"/>focused on Sellafield. It is a dramatically dangerous situation. Pressure should be applied and we should let everybody know that we will not relax that pressure. I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House for a debate so we can stress the importance of this issue.</P>
      <P>It is interesting what one learns when a strike occurs. The strike at Irish Ferries meant that we did not have envelopes yesterday because they are bought abroad. While Ireland is in the EU and has obligations in this regard, the envelopes used in Leinster House are no longer produced in Ireland. Under EU regulations, it is correct to do that but I am surprised that such products are no longer made in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the events of the past 24 hours, it is inevitable that repeated calls would be made for a debate on Northern Ireland but similar calls were made yesterday on the Order of Business and the Leader responded positively. I endorse the comments that have been made. Members who disgracefully accused the Taoiseach of not being trusted in recent weeks might reflect on the events of the past 24 hours because trust was central to all that took place. The underlying reason for the remarkable relationship between Britain and Ireland, exemplified by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s remarks, was the establishment of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in the early 1990s when, for the first time since partition, British and Irish politicians broke down the walls of prejudice, indifference and ignorance to the point where there is now a harmonious relationship between both countries. Hopefully, the last piece of the jigsaw will be fitted into place in 2005.</P>
      <P>In light of the reply of the Minister to the matter of UN reform which I raised on the Adjournment last night, will the Leader consider a debate on the reform proposals by the panel of experts because of the importance of the UN in Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, in which we place great store? I do not wish to engage in oratorical flourishes or disagreements with Senator Norris but, notwithstanding his justifiable remarks about human rights, we should continue to raise the outrageous murders of Irish citizens such as Margaret Hassan and Kenneth Bigley. Is it not amazing how quickly they are forgotten?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have spoken about them in the House and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland with the Taoiseach as soon as possible. Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach to bring the SDLP centre stage once more? The party is the moderate voice of Nationalists in Northern Ireland and it has been central to the peace process from the beginning. It is important that its voice is heard again as we approach the final step. The Taoiseach should bring it back <Col N="2043"/>centre stage from the sidelines where it has been for the past 12 months or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane raised the issue of Northern Ireland and the need for a debate. We have put that proposal forward and it is now a matter of the availability of the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and of time. If we can reach agreement on it we will see if we have time for it. There is an excellent two page supplement in <i>The Irish Times</i> today which goes through every point of the proposed agreement and the discussion. If we are to have a debate on the issue, this would be necessary reading homework for all of us. I thank the Senator for raising the matter. We hope to have that debate.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole supports Senator Finucane&rsquo;s call for debate. He mentioned the extraordinary manner in which the matter was handled yesterday. I was struck by that also. The two Prime Ministers stood in front of the bank of reporters and journalists with their microphones and probing questions and took the questions calmly one by one. The obvious camaraderie between the two of them was enlightening and spelled openness. It showed a significant development in the relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The Senator also raised the matter of the views of the Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on incineration. I heard him speak on the issue on radio. He spoke about the need for a full debate on the subject. He said that people only get the scare headlines and not the full facts. It would be useful to invite him here to discuss that matter and the Kyoto Agreement. We could also discuss appropriate structures to support builders who take environmentally friendly measures such as the use of solar panels or wind energy.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan commended the openness of the Northern process. He wants an open-ended debate on Northern Ireland that would continue at periodic intervals. That would be useful. The only person we do not hear from in an open way is P. O&rsquo;Neill.</P>
      <P>The Senator also wants a Government position on incineration because recent statements bear out that there will be no incineration wherever any Minister lives. Some of the proper facts on incineration have not come out. How can it be good to continue putting refuse into landfill sites? That is not the proper way to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan felt congratulations were due all around on Northern Ireland and that no recrimination was needed. He made the salient point that nobody has a monopoly on humiliation.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan supported the call for a debate on Northern Ireland. He also agreed with his Kerry colleague&rsquo;s recent statement on hotel prices. He would like a debate on that.</P>

	<P>No matter what, he is very faithful to Kerry. Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; feels we should harmonise Christian principles with political activity. He praised the great relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom. This improved relationship is a welcome step. I regard what happened yesterday as a staging post and not the end. Much has been achieved and we have greater knowledge of what has been done to achieve it.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris asked about the statement of US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, with regard to forgetting what has happened in Iraq and reaching out. The former Taoiseach, John Bruton, begins his new job next week. He will play a strong role in this area in Washington and his work will be of great interest to us. I read in the newspapers that incorrect treatment of prisoners continued in Abu Ghraib after the issue was made public. The Senator asked whether the human rights situation there could be addressed. He also asked why garda&iacute; in Limerick, Ennis and Shannon have taken no action with regard to the criminal damage to an aeroplane.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris also raised the matter of whether the legislation on intoxication also applied to off-licences. I presume a person does not consume on the premises of an off-licence, but only purchases drink there. I smiled wryly when I heard a three-day embargo was imposed on the pub in question. The closure is not being imposed until January, so perhaps people will have taken a new year&rsquo;s resolution to give up drink then.</P>

	<P>The judgment shows the legislation is working. Senator Kitt supported the call for a debate on Northern Ireland. He also drew attention to the issue of Sellafield. The radiological protection institute now has open access to the premises and workers and can ask questions and get full information. This new accord between the United Kingdom and Ireland is a significant development and was not given much attention until today. There was a time when we dreaded confrontation. I remember when a previous Taoiseach and Prime Minister had an open spat resulting in mayhem and confusion.</P>
      <P>Senator Bradford called for debate on Northern Ireland and the Sudan. Senator MacSharry called for a debate on incineration and a review of local government funding. I am tired of hearing about reviews of local government funding as we seem to get no result from them. We get no more money, whatever about the review. It seems we review it but never implement it.</P><Col N="2045"/>
      <P>Senator Henry praised the patience of the Prime Minister and Taoiseach. We can only imagine all the back-breaking visits, readings, files, deputations and listening involved. It is amazing. She also asked if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could come to the House to tell us about facilities for young people in trouble. She wants to know what is available, the difficulties emerging in different centres.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden raised the issue of the undocumented Irish people in the United States. He wants us to make this a cause for 2005.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke asked that we bring the SDLP centre stage. It was always centre stage until the electoral mandate shifted the pawns on the chess board. The current situation is a result of how the votes turned out. The Taoiseach has always made a definite effort to meet Mark Durkan and invite him to his office. The role the SDLP has played is significant and cannot be underestimated.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I wish to make some general points about next week&rsquo;s arrangements for the Seanad. Besides carrying over some Bills, we will have two new Bills to deal with next week, the Social Welfare Bill and a short Bill which deals with the selling on of social housing and proposes to close a loophole in the current system where people sell their social housing in a lucrative manner.</P>
      <P>Today is our third day working on Committee Stage of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill and we are endeavouring to arrange another day for this next week, not envisaged initially. This important Bill is very detailed and it is only right that we give it comprehensive debate. At the same time, we cannot stay on one Bill forever. However, we hope to have a fourth day for Committee Stage next week.</P>
      <P>We thought we would not have to sit on Friday next, but this looks increasingly likely. It will require co-operation from other parties if we are to finish on Thursday night so as to make a Friday sitting unnecessary. We are working on it but co-operation is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s support for what we are trying to do with this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the House that we are discussing amendments together Nos. 45 to 47, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the amendment is to introduce a more comprehensive series of paragraphs explaining precisely what is involved in the setting up of the policing committees. There was general agreement yesterday, especially from Senator Jim Walsh, on the proposed new paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>g</i>). Much of the debate focused on whether the wording of paragraph (<i>a</i>) would include town councils. It is my opinion that it would; it was not the intention to exclude them.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to state more clearly what will be the exact provisions. From speaking to other Members I gather they also feel that is necessary. I am open to persuasion as to whether this is the optimal wording or if it could be expanded or improved upon. I hope the Minister will take on board this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday&rsquo;s debate revolved around whether paragraph (<i>a</i>) excluded town councils and, as Senator Cummins stated, it is certainly the intention to include them. The other main focus of discussion was whether a joint policing committee should have as its core base the town and area around it, including the area committee, or whether it should be done on a county-wide basis. That matter can be examined and worked out in conjunction with local authorities.</P><Col N="2047"/>
      <P>My interpretation of the amendment is that a great deal of the consultation and liaison activity that will take place at the level of the town or area committee will be done at sub-committee level rather than at joint policing committee level. In order to work effectively, committees will require resources in terms of staff. Perhaps the Minister will examine this matter. The joint policing committee may also develop initiatives such as a local advertising campaign, publication or otherwise. Good initiatives may evolve from these committees that would require financial resources and, given the limitations on town councils to provide either staffing or financial resources, it would be preferable for funding to come from a county council, some of which have budgets in excess of &euro;100 million. From that point of view, I find the proposition that policing committees would be based on city or county councils an attractive one. However, I accept that much of the work and dialogue at local level would be done in sub-committees.</P>
      <P>I gave an example yesterday of County Wexford which is divided into four local authority electoral areas with a significant town in each area. I would see these as the focal point for much of the dialogue between the Garda and the council which could be done at sub-committee level. This matter needs to be examined and discussion should take place with local authorities to see if there is an advantage in focusing on the larger unit which has more resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately I was unable to be present yesterday because I was elsewhere. However, I have had an opportunity to read through the proceedings of the House so I have an idea where people were coming from in yesterday&rsquo;s debate. I thank Senator Jim Walsh for his very useful proposals which I will study carefully.</P>
      <P>I emphasise to the House that I do not want to be completely prescriptive, but that I took from the Second Stage debate in this House that it was local authorities, as such, that we were concerned with, and that it was not to be done on a county development board basis. I understood that a direct engagement was preferred which reflected the importance of the mandate local authority members have, and that their participation in this committee process would be a central part of their role as local representatives rather than a clip-on addition to it.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be overly prescriptive as to how these committees should be formed. For instance, in my own area of Dublin, inner city forums are already in existence and we have area committees of Dublin City Council. It may make sense in one city to have an area committee as a sub-committee of one of these bodies but in another city one may have to put three areas together to do it. I will not try and think up a national model which has to be followed by everybody in every circumstance. I want this to <Col N="2048"/>be flexible and enabling but I do not want to be so vague as to leave it in the position that nobody does anything about it either. A balance needs to be struck.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Members of this House for their considered contribution on this matter. I will bear it in mind and come forward with a response on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who was here yesterday and gave a very good account of himself which was very much in keeping with the principle of the Bill. I compliment the Minister on bringing area committees into being. It is a most innovative idea. I note what the Minister said, that he wants to make them work well and he referred to his own area in that regard. I have great confidence in this proposed development.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I made the point in regard to the section that Members of the Seanad should be included, in addition to Members of the D&aacute;il or that a generic reference should be made to Oireachtas Members. It could be said that Senators have constituencies. In the areas in which Senators live it would be useful to have their input as well. Involvement at local level is of great assistance to us at national level when it comes to discussing issues of security and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I reiterate my request to the Minister that this would become a reality.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister tabled amendment No. 46 and I compliment him on his approach. I have experience of being before the House as a Minister of State with responsibility for trade and I welcome the fact that the Minister is open to the merits of Opposition amendments, which helps to strengthen legislation. I welcome the proposed deletion of the reference to county development boards as it would have been a restrictive approach which would not have given local authority representatives the opportunity of serving on the policing committees. Elected local authority members should have a pre-eminent position in regard to the new policing committees. I thank the Minister for including them and doing such a good job in putting forward the idea in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We appreciate that the Minister has said he will revert to us on Report Stage. We discussed this issue at length yesterday and again this morning. We hope an amendment will be tabled on Report Stage which reflects our debate on amendment No. 45 in particular.</P>

    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 46:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 23, subsection (2), lines 22 to 24, to delete &ldquo;within the framework of a city development board or a county development board, as the case may be, or otherwise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P><Col N="2049"/>
    <P>Government amendment No. 47:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 23, subsection (2), line 38, after &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, including consultation with such other public authorities, bodies or persons as may be required&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 48 and 49 are related and may be taken together by agreement. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 23, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na below the rank of Superintendent shall not be eligible to attend a joint policing committee meeting as the representative on behalf of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We feel there is no point in local garda&iacute; or sergeants representing the Garda at these meetings. People want garda&iacute; who can give a commitment on which they can deliver. The forum will become meaningless if the chief superintendent merely sends a sergeant to carry messages to and from the meeting about what is required in a community. We need a commitment from the highest levels of the Garda on these committees. By all means, the community garda can and should be present at these meetings with the chief superintendent but there is a need for a high-ranking garda to be present.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 49 seeks to ensure that the meetings of the joint policing committee are predominantly held in public. There will be occasions when a private meeting is required, a scenario which is also provided for by this amendment. However, by and large, the committee should meet in public, although we acknowledge that situations in communities and estates may require that they be held in private on some occasions. I hope the Minister accepts these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I see the point to which Senator Cummins refers in amendment No. 48, which is that if representatives of senior Garda management are not part of the joint policing committees, they will not be as effective as they might be, with which sentiment I concur. However, I do not agree that someone below the rank of superintendent should not be eligible to attend. My experience is that a superintendent who brought a sergeant with him or her to a meeting, was less <i>au fait</i> with some of the questions than was the sergeant, which was a useful exercise. I am not sure we should be too prescriptive in this regard. However, if a sergeant or a member of the Garda was turning up at all the joint policing committees without an inspector, superintendent or otherwise, it would dilute their effect. The issue should be examined further.</P><Col N="2050"/>
      <P>In order to earn public support, there is a need for some of the meetings to be held in public. Equally, however, there will also be a value in holding such meetings in private. Yesterday, I instanced an occasion on which we had a meeting between a superintendent and sergeant regarding a local disadvantaged area with a drug problem. That meeting could not have been held in public because it would have put the attendants at certain risk. There will be issues which will have to be discussed in private in order to give the meetings full effect.</P>
      <P>Many councillors will want to raise issues or, without naming people, might identify them. It is important that such a process is allowed and I am sure this provision will be part of the guidelines. We will have to cater for all arrangements. I would not like anything to be done which would restrict the effective operation of the joint policing committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not propose that various officers are excluded from the forum. However, it is important that on the committees which are established, there is a direct line of responsibility to the chief officer who is either the superintendent or chief superintendent. For example, an inspector is in charge of the community divisions, which are very important in my area. The inspector of the community division would have to be at these meetings because much of the work involves community policing, of which we are all advocates.</P>
      <P>However, the problem traditionally has been that when a new officer or recruit comes into a station he or she invariably ends up as a community garda for a number of estates. Over the course of two years, he or she will pick up huge amounts of information about the children who are causing difficulties and so on but then he or she is gone. The problem is that community policing is not seen as an attractive line of promotion within the force in the same way as detective work or other aspects of the force. We must work hard to emphasise that community policing is absolutely essential in urban Ireland and the work done is tremendous.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago, I attended a social function for a youth organisation in my own constituency, the money for which was raised by the community division of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Members of the division were present on the night helping to run the event, all of which represents unpaid work done out of hours. They are a tremendous example to the force. We underestimate the importance of community policing in this area.</P>
      <P>The amendment does not propose to exclude officers from the committees but rather that there must be a line of responsibility to the top, which is, in effect, the chief superintendent. I agree with Senator Jim Walsh in regard to whether these meetings should be public or private. Of course, most of the meetings will be private because they will deal with problems on estates, naming people and so on. However, there will be occasions on <Col N="2051"/>which a public meeting is very important. We have often seen reports in local newspapers about <i>ad hoc</i> public meetings with an attached lynch mob, to which no members of the force are invited. We must prevent this type of occurrence. We should not underestimate the importance of a public meeting in order that the public can see what is happening, even in a general way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The requirement of the attendance of a superintendent is commendable but, in many cases, he or she may not be available and have to delegate to an inspector, for instance. This provision is better suited to regulations rather than legislation. It is far better to have such minute details and requirements in regard to attendance dealt with in such a manner.</P>
      <P>It is also important that, where a superintendent or an inspector attends, the local sergeant and garda&iacute; would also be in attendance, if possible. It is worthwhile. Is so far as meetings in public and private are concerned, it is again a matter for regulations.</P>
      <P>Oireachtas Members enjoy absolute privilege, which is extremely useful. Many Members have brought forward issues in regard to crime in their areas and the only place in which they could name names with total privilege is in Leinster House. The danger is that if a meeting is held in public and an elected representative makes comments about people distributing drugs in estates in Dublin or anywhere else, if a person, family, group or gang, such as the Westies, is identified no such privilege would apply.</P>
      <P>This is a very big step, with which I accept the Minister will have great difficulty. There is a certain limited privilege for councillors, very few of whom have been sued. It should be borne in mind that there is an advantage in meetings being held in private because the question would then be whether people could be slandered in private or others sued for naming names. It would be innovative if the Minister could consider the constitutional requirement in regard to privilege. It would be a risky business to extend full privilege to those meetings because people could be named, shamed and abused and it could represent a very dangerous situation. Will the Minister examine the possibilities in this regard? I call for the safeguard of limited privilege for elected representatives who are carrying out their duties in a conscientious manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with that last point. Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas have absolute privilege as a matter of constitutional law and cannot be impugned in the courts for what they say in either House. There are strict controls over how that privilege is managed and Members cannot lay waste all around them because they are feeling malicious and want to get even with a few people. We must bear in mind that in order to widen the notion of absolute privilege one must ensure that it is con<Col N="2052"/>stitutionally possible to do so and put in place controls and counter measures to ensure it is not abused.</P>
      <P>Local authority members would have qualified privilege when making statements at local authority meetings as long as they speak in good faith, in other words, that they believe what they say is true, they are being relevant to the topic at issue and their utterance is part of their duty. However, if they speak maliciously and decide to smear somebody&rsquo;s character or make an absolutely reckless remark which they could not reasonably believe to be true, they lose that qualified privilege. We must be reasonably carefully about what we do. Whereas it is one thing for everybody to know that a named drug pusher is in an area, it would be a different matter if somebody chose to abuse his or her public office to smear a person at a meeting and, to use Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s great phrase &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see him deny it&rdquo;. That is always possible in politics. A balance must be struck.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the spirit of amendment No. 48 tabled in the names of Senators Cummins and Brian Hayes which is that an officer of adequate seniority should normally attend a joint policing committee meeting. However, if one states it must be a member of the force with the rank of superintendent, one may find that the meeting will collapse if the superintendent catches the flu and cannot attend. We must be reasonable.</P>
      <P>In the case of area committee or sub-committee meetings, it may be perfectly reasonable that the local inspector will attend rather than the superintendent. I fully appreciate that Members were not trying to exclude ranks of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but the local sergeant may be present for a discussion on anti-social behaviour by a small minority of the community in a particular estate.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden is correct when he states this is a matter best dealt with by guidelines. I imagine the guidelines will contain a term to the effect that it will be the duty of the local chief superintendent to ensure that garda&iacute; of adequate seniority to deal with the business in hand will be present on the occasion. That is probably the best way to deal with it.</P>
      <P>In response to whether such meetings are public or private, it may be similar to a joint committee meeting of the Oireachtas in that the meeting may deal with some issues in public and revert to private session and exclude the public because of the way the debate on an issue is going. Flexibility is the key. I think that should be dealt with in guidelines, if necessary, rather than in prescriptive legislation.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Senators for tabling the amendments and I think Members would probably agree, on reflection, that the right way to deal with the important issues raised in the amendments is to deal with them in the context of guidelines rather than rigid prescriptive law which might trip the operation of these committees.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2053"/>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that guidelines will be issued in that regard and we accept that suggestion and will withdraw our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of whether the meetings should be public or private, will a majority of the members present determine that part of the meeting will be held in private session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In some cases the chair of the committee may decide that if the discussion continues on certain lines, he must exclude the public because he or she does not wish to have a person&rsquo;s reputation discussed in public. I do not want a situation to arise where a majority can trample down somebody&rsquo;s rights and force the committee down the wrong line. For example, if 51% of the members decided to use the occasion to brutalise the reputation of an individual, the chair should have an overriding duty to remember that certain matters should not be dealt with in public. I do not want a situation where a chairman can force his or her will on a majority and exclude the press. We need more flexibility. I do not know the procedure in the joint committees of the Oireachtas to arrive at the decision to hold the meeting in public or private session, but it is probably the majority view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a majority decision .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, that can be dealt with in guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 49 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 31, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will probably get myself into trouble with my party for raising this question. When I considered this section, my first question was why Members of the Seanad were excluded, but that has been discussed and I will not raise it now. However, Members of the D&aacute;il will be on the committee and that means that outside a 25 mile radius of Dublin, when Members of the D&aacute;il will be elsewhere, these committees will be able to meet only on Monday or Friday nights. That practice had developed in local authorities when Members of the Oireachtas held the dual mandate.</P>
      <P>The logistics of organising a meeting such as this are bad enough without having Members of the Oireachtas say that Monday night is the only suitable time. I think this is a backward step from the decision to let local matters be dealt with by the local representatives. I am certain that if my party spokesman in the D&aacute;il hears what I have just said, I will be in big trouble. The Minister can tell him and that will liven up the debate in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2054"/>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Arrangements can be made to meet at appropriate times and that should not be dictated by whether Members of the D&aacute;il are available. If a Deputy wishes to attend the meeting, he or she has the right to do so. It is very important that Members of the Oireachtas would have the opportunity to attend those meetings, where practicable.</P>
      <P>Section 31 resonates with another section 31, which was deleted from the legislation by a previous Government. In this case, I think we should allow the provision for Oireachtas Members to stand.</P>

	<P>I take quite seriously the point made by Senator Ryan. If it were to be read into this section that these meetings could only take place on a Monday or Friday because Members of the Oireachtas would be liable to attend the Oireachtas on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, that would be somewhat retrograde and would be a constraint. My intention &mdash; maybe I have not achieved it in the manner in which this is phrased &mdash; was to bring about a situation where they would have the right to attend and be heard, not that they would be <i>ex officio</i> full voting members. If they are full voting members then they will have to be accommodated. Viewing it from my temporary perspective on the matter from the Government side of the equation, an Opposition Deputy is free to drive down to Kilkenny or wherever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 50 and 51 are related and may be taken together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2055"/>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 24, subsection (2), between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) monitor the performance and effectiveness of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out its functions in the administrative area,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment proposes to make clear that one of the functions of the policing committee should be to monitor the effectiveness of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within a local area and to ensure that it is discharging its functions as best it can. This is fundamental to the effectiveness of any such committee.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 51 proposes that in addition to its own meetings the policing committee would organise public meetings in which issues of particular interest are discussed by everybody and where the public is not just an observer. Such meetings are very beneficial even with garda&iacute; going out into the communities as currently happens. It is very effective in that the public see a Garda presence and see garda&iacute; are taking an interest in their communities. This amendment is to ensure that the Garda would be empowered to organise meetings with the community on issues of particular interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 51 makes an important proposal. Frequently there will be calls for public meetings on anti-social activity and problems with crime. Very often those calls for meetings are made by political parties or residents&rsquo; organisations. It would be a very useful function if the police committees could organise a public meeting on a topic. People would be more likely to come to such a meeting than they would to a meeting organised by a political party or by some ginger group within a community that has a particular bent against the police or the like.</P>
      <P>In Northern Ireland a local partnership policing board held a public meeting in a certain area which attracted media coverage. The meeting allowed the community to vent its views on a particular issue. I acknowledge that sectarian issues exist in Northern Ireland which thankfully do not arise in this jurisdiction. However it was useful that the meeting was organised by the local policing board and I propose the same function should be given to these committees. A meeting organised by a political party or some ginger group does not have the same significance, to my mind, as a meeting organised by these new committees. It would be a useful, additional power to give the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I find myself persuaded by amendment No. 51. It would be useful for these committees to have a function as organising committees. As the Senators who proposed this amendment have said, if a local political party convenes a meeting on a particular issue, one tends to wonder whether one should attend or not. Should I participate in this meeting or because I am not in that party hope that the <Col N="2056"/>meeting is a failure? There is an element of competitive jealousy on these occasions. The proposal is a good idea and I am disposed to accept that amendment.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to amendment No. 50 and I will explain my reasons. It was always my intention that these committees should be partnerships between the Garda and the local authority members. No more than that the Garda is supposed to monitor the local authority as one of the functions, I do not want these committees to be an occasion for demagoguery where people just stand up and point accusing fingers at the Garda about various matters. It is not a function of the local authority, as such, to have a statutory monitoring of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the administrative area of the local authority. The local authority is free to have a debate if it wishes and I have no problem with that but it is not one of its statutory functions. It would produce an imbalance in the relationship. I have constantly stressed that this is a two-way street. The Garda should be able to say to the local authority that it built such and such an estate but there are no pitches for the kids to play, no indoor hall, nothing. It should be able to point out that open spaces and communal stairways have become fouled and damaged and that the local authority has responsibility in these matters. That is just as much a legitimate part of the discussion at one of these committees as the more brash councillors pointing fingers at the Garda and saying it is nowhere to be seen or whatever.</P>
      <P>I want the relationship to be one of parity of esteem between the two constituent elements of these committees, the garda&iacute; who attend them and the local authority public representatives who are present. My reasoning is that if they are an inquest format or if they are an accusatory tribunal where the local authority members claim that under statute one of their functions is to monitor Garda performance, then it changes the character of the committee completely. The garda&iacute; will be put on the defensive and that is not the relationship I wish to achieve.</P>
      <P>In rejecting that amendment I would draw to the Members&rsquo; attention to the proposed section 32(2) which states:</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) keep under review&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(i) the levels and patterns of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour in that area (including the patterns and levels of misuse of alcohol and drugs), and</P>
      <P LI="2">(ii) the factors underlying and contributing to the levels of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour in the area,</P>
      <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) advise the local authority concerned and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on how they might best exercise their functions having regard to the need to do everything feasible to improve the safety and quality of life and to prevent crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour within the area,</P><Col N="2057"/>
      <P FLI="0">That gives the committees a broad remit to do all of these things but it does not do it in the form of, &ldquo;We will tell you where you are going wrong,&rdquo; mode which would be suggested by Senator Cummins&rsquo;s phraseology. It would introduce an imbalance into the equation which I am anxious to avoid. Section 32(2)(<i>b</i>) shows that it is balanced between the local authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in that both of them share equally in this duty to uphold the law in their area, to improve the quality of life and to prevent anti-social behaviour. I have always striven to make it very clear that this is a partnership and not something in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the accused party; garda&iacute; should not be cast as defendants or people who must justify themselves while local authority members wave the statute at them and say, &ldquo;We are here to monitor you.&rdquo; If that relationship creeps into the transaction, the policing committees will be less effective. While I propose to accept amendment No. 51, I will not accept amendment No. 50. I ask Senators to accept my position.</P>

I am glad he will accept amendment No. 51. It is important that public meetings may be arranged at which people will have an opportunity to discuss issues arising in their estates and areas. As the Minister stated, it has been left to political parties in many instances to organise such meetings and it would be preferable if joint policing committees were to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a reasonable half compliment to prove I am in reasonable humour. I will not pretend I am an authority on the Bill because I am substituting for Senator Tuffy. The purpose of the amendment is to delete section 33(2). I invite Senators to try to figure out the meaning or purpose of the subsection. This is the reason we propose its deletion. It reads:</P>
      <P LI="1">
        <i>Subsection (1)</i> is not to be taken to confer on any person a right in law that the person would not otherwise have to require a local authority to take any steps referred to in that subsection or to seek damages for a local authority&rsquo;s failure to take such steps.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The lawyer who advises the Labour Party on these matters, while not quite as eminent as the Minister, has pointed out that this subsection is a virtually meaningless collection of words. I will listen to the Minister&rsquo;s response with interest but meaningless paragraphs have no function in legislation. This subsection does not appear to have meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>To put the matter in context, where a statute creates a duty one must look at its terms to decide whether failure to comply with the duty becomes actionable at the instance of a person who is aggrieved or suffers as a result. This is a conundrum about which law students learn at great length regarding tort. While there is a tort of breach of statutory duty, it only exists where the courts interpret the statute which creates the duty as one which intended that individuals who suffered as a result of a breach of the duty were to have an individual cause of action against the person in breach of the duty. I hope that is clear.</P>
      <P>When one creates a statutory duty, as in the case of section 33(1), one must ask what are the consequences of a breach of the duty in question. One must make clear to the courts that either there is to be a cause of action vested in individuals who are at a loss as a consequence of that breach or there is not. Subsection (2) is designed to bring about such clarity. It provides that it is a duty of a local authority to take such steps as may be practicable to assist in the reduction of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour within its area of responsibility. This is an important point of local government law because local authorities have functions and duties conferred on them. If a local authority, for instance, wants to spend money, the city or county manager will be the first to point out if the purpose for which the money is being spent is not proper because the authority has no function in the area in<?oasys [jy?>question.</P>
      <P>Crime and anti-social behaviour reduction will, under the legislation, be an area in which local authorities have a positive duty to act and discharge its duty in that regard. It is not meaningless to confer a duty which is not actionable at the instance of an individual. It is essential for some purposes that it should be <i>intra vires</i> a local <Col N="2059"/>authority to do things which otherwise might be regarded as <i>ultra vires</i> a local authority.</P>
      <P>What happens if a local authority is in breach of this duty? Does one vest in the Circuit, District or High Court a right to compensate somebody who is at a loss as a result of a failure to carry out the duty? For instance, if subsection (1) was interpreted as requiring a local authority to have adequate street lighting in a crime infested estate and the lights do not function, can someone whose car has been vandalised three times while the lights were not functioning claim damages for the state of the car? Alternatively, where powers are available to exclude troublesome neighbours from social housing of which one is the landlord and one fails to do so, can a person whose house has been wrecked twice by his or her neighbours demand that the landlord pay the bill? These kinds of issues could arise with the result that people go before a judge, indicating a person has a duty and demand compensation.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) makes it clear that the question of compensation does not arise unless it would already arise, that is, the new duty does not confer an extra right on individuals to sue for damages. In addition, persons are not conferred the right to injunct a local authority to do something or refrain from doing something based on the duty in subsection (1). If one were to provide for such a right, the local Circuit Court judge would, for instance, be in a position to order a local authority to erect four more lights in a particular area because it is clear that criminality arises from a failure to do so. One would have judge-driven local politics if one were to give the right to the courts to hand out injunctions based on that general duty.</P>
      <P>These are the reasons for the inclusion of subsection (2) which reads:</P>
      <P LI="1">
        <i>Subsection (1)</i> is not to be taken to confer on any person a right in law that the person would not otherwise have to require a local authority to take any steps referred to in that subsection [this is the injunctive relief] or to seek damages for a local authority&rsquo;s failure to take such steps [this is the damages relief].</P>
      <P FLI="0">The subsection, therefore, excludes injunctive and damages relief from a person who claims a breach of a general duty. If this provision were not included, a clever lawyer could seek to persuade a court that a person. whose home had been vandalised 15 times in circumstances in which it was reasonable to believe that tenants could have been evicted for anti-social behaviour but were not, could sue the local authority for the cost of bills incurred as a result. In extreme cases of this nature, my sympathy would go to the person in question, as would a judge&rsquo;s. However, we do not want to create a new head of compensation because it is hard enough to run a local authority without constantly being told by the law agent that certain measures cannot be pursued because the authority faces being sued. For <Col N="2060"/>example, advice could be given that a new park cannot be built because all available money must be spent on street lighting on the grounds that ten solicitor&rsquo;s letters have been received threatening the authority with an action. That is the purpose of the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I now clearly understand the purpose of the subsection but it raises an obvious question. What is the point of subsection (1) if it is not enforceable either by injunction or seeking damages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I worked with a manager who used the phrase &ldquo;let the dog see the rabbit&rdquo;. I am inclined to say the same to Senator Ryan. We are talking about a public body. Section 1 gives functions and responsibility to the local authority. Section 2 removes the right of a third party to claim this as a tort if there is a breach. The body&rsquo;s directors are elected democratically by people whose responsibility is to ensure the local authority&rsquo;s functions are carried out properly and effectively. They should give responsibility for the local authority to the manager, rather than pass it on to a third party to do so through the courts. It protects the accountability of elected members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>One might ask what practical effect such a provision will have. It means whichever function is being performed by the local authority, whether by management or elected members, must be done in a manner which has regard to the reduction of criminality. If planning permission is refused because a local authority believes it would increase criminality in the area, that becomes a criterion to be imported into the discharge of its functions. It can refuse to grant a licence or permit by reference to this criterion. It is not a toothless tiger. It is a public law duty without a private law remedy, and there are many such examples on the Statute Book. They do not mean an individual can sue or seek an injunction to force a local authority to do something. However, they could have other functions, such as allowing a person, in extreme circumstances, to quash a decision by a local authority on the basis that it flagrantly did not have regard to one of its functions.</P>
      <P>The provision is not a toothless tiger, even in the legal sphere. It strengthens the hand of local authority members and managers when considering criminality, public order and anti-social behaviour aspects of their work. If a local authority is vested with the right to say yes or no to a public concert in its park, it can look at this and decide it will probably give rise to anti-social behaviour or disorder and refuse permission on those grounds. The concert promoter cannot say it is an unreasonable decision, because there is a clear statutory criterion imported into the discharge of the local authority&rsquo;s function.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 25, subsection (3), lines 39 to 41, to delete paragraph (<i>a</i>).</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I know a good deal about this matter. Legislation dealing with the relationship between public bodies and authorities and Oireachtas committees has come through this House. With one or two exceptions, where we persuaded the Minister to drop the provision, the legislation has stated, as it does here, that the Garda Commissioner, &ldquo;shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such policy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While we do not want party political speeches from senior public figures, this imposes an enormous constraint. A Garda Commissioner could interpret the wording whichever way he wishes. Other exclusions in terms of the security of the State are perfectly reasonable. However, not to allow the commissioner question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government implies that he or she could express opinions on the merits of the Opposition&rsquo;s policy. That is hardly fair.</P>
      <P>The Minister may think it is a great idea for the Garda Commissioner to have a go at Senator Cummins, Deputy Costello and others. It seems strange that it only refers to Government policy. I understand the difference between Government and Opposition policy. Nevertheless, this provision is unfair and unnecessary. Most senior figures in the public sector and bodies can draw a sensible line between reasonable comment and head-to-head conflict with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2062"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great protection for a Garda Commissioner when he goes before an Oireachtas committee, perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts. When confronted with a question as to whether the policy of his Minister is right or wrong, he is in a position to say he is not entitled to respond and should not be asked to do so. That is a fair protection.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner is bound to be truthful. Commissioners are men of integrity and one day the role may be filled by women of integrity. They should be in a position to come into the Oireachtas and decline to answer questions by reference to the need to serve the Government of the day with regard to the discharge of its policies. That may not be fashionable. It would be interesting to know the points on which the present Commissioner disagrees with me with regard to matters I raise publicly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be a few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but it would damage our relationship if I was to read criticism levelled at me by the Garda Commissioner in the newspapers. I would not dream of criticising him in public, unless we were in an extreme situation, neither would he dream of doing the same. However, if he genuinely disagreed with a policy enclosed in the strategy statement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at my behest, it would be unfortunate if a public rift emerged because of an obligation on a Commissioner to be truthful as to his personal views on a particular issue. This provision is for the protection of a Commissioner. It is as wrong to ask him if he disagrees with my policies as it is to ask if he agrees with them. If one keeps asking him with what does he agree one will eventually identify that with which he disagrees. That is not a useful way to carry out the Commissioner&rsquo;s functions. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a disciplined force, and the Commissioner is in charge of discipline within the force. It would be strange if he was entitled to break ranks with the Government of the day on points of Government policy and criticise it. The relationship between the Commissioner and Government of the day would be seriously undermined if he were given the right and entitlement to criticise Government policy before the Oireachtas. It would not assist him in any way and would render that relationship dysfunctional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has made a convincing case regarding the Garda Commissioner. My personal objection, as distinct from the objection raised in the amendment, is that such provision is standard in all legislation dealing with bodies such as the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and others that are meant to play a role in public policy formulation. I accept the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have a role in terms of public policy formulation given the nature of its job. However, the chairmen of other bodies are prohibited by injunction from criticising public <Col N="2063"/>policy, a provision which is, effectively, a gag. The Minister made the valid point that the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s position is unique.</P>

      <P FLI="0">The point at issue is whether the Garda Commissioner should be required to only attend the Committee of Public Accounts.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not support the amendment. Currently, it is possible for a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to summon the Garda Commissioner to attend before it provided it is using its powers of compellability. The amendment seeks to provide that the Commissioner will be at the beck and call of any committee which resolves any afternoon to require him to attend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commissioner is not immune to the compellability provisions provided they are duly complied with and the summons is relevant to him or his legal functions. It is a different matter to provide that he be required by a committee of either House to attend and give evidence on matters which it deems appropriate. The inclusion of such a provision would result in substantial interference with his position. The Commissioner is compellable and will have a particular obligation to attend before the Committee of Public Accounts. Where exceptional circumstances arise which require him to appear before other committees, he will do so.</P>
      <P>Senators who are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights will be aware of his attendance there. I do not want to create a situation whereby the commissioner must attend each time he is requested to do so. His position would be weakened were he to be statutorily required to attend a committee every time he was requested to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P FLI="0">It is important the audit committee is independent and is chaired by an outsider. The independence of the auditing process is a serious requirement. I do not see why the Garda representative bodies should appoint somebody to that function any more than the workers of a company should appoint an audit committee of that company under company governance. It is not necessary to <Col N="2065"/>put such a provision in place. I will not accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment requires that one person from the Garda representative bodies be nominated to the audit committee. Were the Minister to consider excluding current or former garda&iacute; from being a member of the committee it would go some way to appease me. I do not believe the independence of the committee would be affected by the inclusion on it of a former or current member with expertise in the area. My concern relates to the total exclusion of such people from the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not been persuaded by the Senator&rsquo;s argument. While I do not suggest the Bill should be amended, perhaps the provision relating to ministerial discretion could deal with this issue. It would be innovative if one of the chairmen of the joint policing committees were nominated to such position. Such a provision would knit things together nicely and would provide status for the joint policing committees. Perhaps the Minister will consider my suggestion.</P>

	<P>If the audit committee consists of a body of outsiders undertaking an audit of work within the force, why is the appointment of a Deputy Garda Commissioner necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment in principle. The Bill is flawed in not having a representative from the Garda Representative Association or the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors on the audit committee. A submission was made, arguing for one person, designated by the Garda representative bodies, to represent their interests on the committee. I do not see the rationale behind having a Garda Deputy Commissioner appointed to the committee while no member of the force will be. Maybe the experience in other jurisdictions was different. Departmental officials would have studied similar legislation in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It would help to meet the Bill&rsquo;s objective and make matters more transparent to the 10,000 members of the force. Membership will be 14,000 when the Minister is finished. This is a sizeable number of people to be without a representative on the committee. I will go along with the Minister but I suggest the amendment should be considered as it will not take from the Bill. The Minister knows where I am coming from, as far as my Seanad nominating body is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s argument in not accepting the amendment was that a group of outsiders will be part of the auditing regime. Why then is the Garda Deputy Commissioner a member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The committee will consist of at least five persons. A minority of insiders will be represented, if one includes the Minister&rsquo;s nominee as a quasi-insider. The structure envisaged is one on which there will always be a majority of non-members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from which the chairperson will be selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the emphasis on senior management being part of the committee with the exclusion of ordinary members of the force? I take issue with this exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer and this committee&rsquo;s function is to advise the Garda Commissioner on financial matters relating to his or her functions, to report in writing to him or her and to provide the Minister with a copy of each report. If ordinary members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, however defined, were to be represented on the committee, it would have to be through either nomination by the representative organisations or an election by all members of the force. I am not attracted to the proposition of putting members of representative organisation <i>ex officio</i> on the audit committee. This is an audit committee and I do not want to compromise people. If one is there to represent a representative organisation, one is carrying out a different function from being an audit committee member. I have responsibility to the Oireachtas for the Garda Vote. The Garda Commissioner will be responsible as Accounting Officer for the force. The committee will assist the Garda Commissioner in his or her role as Accounting Officer and the Minister in the overall responsibility for the Garda Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill allows for the Minister to nominate a member of the audit committee. This would not preclude the Minister or his successors from appointing a member of the force thereto. This will ensure that the nominee will not be representing an organisation but will be an experienced and respected member of the force, past or present. This provision does not state that the nominee cannot be a serving or former member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. There is flexibility in this <Col N="2067"/>regard and I recommend it be considered by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Am I right in saying that the audit committee&rsquo;s reports will only go to the Minister and never be made public? I am only learning about the Bill as I go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In a sense the Senator is right as there is no obligation to publish the committee&rsquo;s reports. However, they will be available to the Comptroller and Auditor General, if he or she believes they contain matters that should be brought to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts. If every audit committee report into suspected malpractice was prepared on the basis that it had to be made public, it would seriously damage the effectiveness of the committee&rsquo;s work. The Comptroller and Auditor General can call for any reports and to check for any matter to which the public should be alerted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is trivialising this issue. The Bill states &ldquo;the audit committee shall ... report in writing at least once a year to the Commissioner on those matters and on its activities in the previous year, and provide the Minister with a copy of each report.&rdquo;. It is not envisaged that the committee will produce reports every week. I would not be unhappy if the Minister had reasons some reports on individual matters should not be published. However, there is no reason the annual report to the Garda Commissioner and the Minister cannot be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The internal auditing process may do spot-checks of various kinds. If the intention is to prevent fraud, misappropriation or misapplication of moneys, publishing how this is achieved will weaken the effectiveness of the audit committee rather than strengthening it. If the report states that 48 spot-checks were done on the collection of parking fines while none was <Col N="2068"/>done on gun licence fees, the method will become known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not an argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see what the Oireachtas would do with that material. The Constitution provides for a Comptroller and Auditor General who will have access to all of the material. If it contains anything of interest, I have no doubt the Comptroller and Auditor General will draw it to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts. If appropriate, it will come into the public domain in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 38.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 58:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 28, subsection (3), line 13, to delete &ldquo;As soon as practicable after&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Within 30 days of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendment refers to the annual Garda report. The report for 2002 was published at the end of 2003, meaning it took the Garda a year to complete. The report for 2003 was published in November of this year. Given the technology available in this age of accountability, it is unacceptable for this scenario to obtain. I am glad to see that section 38(1) requires the annual report to be completed within four months and acknowledge that matters in this context have improved significantly.</P>
      <P>As drafted, however, section 38 allows the Minister to publish the report at his discretion. I am not happy with the use of the words &ldquo;As soon as practicable&rdquo;. It is not unreasonable to request the Minister to publish the report within 30 days of receiving it. If the Minister has it, there is no reason not to publish it within a month. While I acknowledge that there have been improvements, amendment No. 38 would further enhance the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness to the Minister, he has improved matters in this area. Unlike his predecessors, he has put the quarterly figures into the public domain. The amendment moved by Senator Cummins is not, however, unreasonable. Why would the Minister not publish a report provided to him directly by the Garda? All we are asking is that he would do so within 30 days. I have yet to find a reason he would not and imagine it is something he would wish to do anyway. It would be better from a legislative point of view to remove the words &ldquo;As soon as practicable&rdquo; and insert a 30-day provision. I ask the Minister to consider making the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the provision in section 38 that the Garda Commissioner shall submit a report to the Minister not later than four months after the end of each year. The Minister is to be applauded on that. I have seen local auth<Col N="2069"/>orities issue reports 12 months after the end of a year which is ridiculous. By the time such reports are published, they are out of date and irrelevant. Although it seems inherent in the public-service psyche to shy away from deadlines, we should require the same of the public sector as we do of private companies. Businesses must comply with clear deadlines in companies legislation or fines are imposed. It is incongruous to have a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach in the public service.</P>
      <P>I am not sufficiently <i>au fait</i> with the matter to know what might inhibit publication of a report by the Minister. I am inclined to think there should be provision for discretion as a report might contain material, the publication of which the Minister or his or her officials felt should be delayed. I agree that such a delay should only take place in extenuating circumstances. While I do not know if an annual Garda report would contain material which would require revision by the Department, the imposition of a 30-day limit could be very restrictive in a scenario in which a difficulty arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senators for pointing out significant improvement in this area on my watch and that of my predecessor. Garda reports are being submitted in comprehensive form reasonably promptly by comparison with the situation in the past. I will not be tempted into making unfair comparisons as to how bad the past was which would excite party animosity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>For everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We will leave it like that. I thank the Commissioner and his predecessors for bringing about the improvement under discussion.</P>
      <P>When I took office, annual reporting of crime figures, which is a matter of some significance though by no means the sole subject of the Commissioner&rsquo;s report, took place in the public domain up to 18 months after the period to which they related had ended. In effect, reporting took place almost two years after the start of that period. I inquired about the practicability of issuing quarterly crime statistics and discovered it was possible. It is natural that there should be counsels of caution in any organisation and I was asked, given that the figures might be awful, if I really wanted them to be published.</P>
      <P>I decided the better approach to the publication of crime figures, which are a key performance indicator of Garda activity, would be to carry it out while the subject matter was reasonably fresh. If something is going wrong in a particular Garda division or if there is a surge in the incidence of a particular offence, the public finds out about it three weeks after the end of a quarter. The people whose responsibility it is to attend to such matters have the attention of the public directed to their area or at the trend in a certain crime at a very early date. I have been lucky that <Col N="2070"/>the period since the institution of quarterly figure publication has been one in which the Garda has performed relatively well. There has been a downward trend in headline crime figures. If they went up, I would have to take the rough with the smooth.</P>
      <P>We have moved dramatically from the scenario in which by the time we received old, out-of-date news, a Garda Commissioner could be long gone from office before we found out what happened during a considerable period of his or her tenure. We have got to a position where the key performance indicator in question is regularly reported on. When one sits at the Cabinet table, one receives a pile of reports every year. Former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, had a policy that any body which could not report within six months of the end of a year was presumed to be asking for its own abolition. Once that became noted as a general policy, it was amazing to see how in the months of June and July all the required reports which it used to take long periods to submit would tumble in.</P>
      <P>I am strongly of the view that if the reporting requirement is to mean anything, reports must be prompt and contemporary. The four-month provision in section 38(1) is apposite. It allows a reasonable period for the compilation of the annual Garda report to a reasonable standard and permits the public to be informed relatively soon after the end of a year what circumstances obtained during it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 58 proposes to delete the words &ldquo;As soon as practicable after&rdquo; and to provide that &ldquo;Within 30 days of receiving the report, the Minister shall cause a copy of it to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; I am attracted to the spirit of the amendment. Having imposed a four-month deadline on the Garda Commissioner, it seems slightly at odds with the spirit of the change we are bringing about to provide that I can decide in the fullness of time when I will put his or her report into the public domain. I expect on Report Stage to insert in section 38 a form of words such as &ldquo;As soon as practicable and, in any case, no later than 30 days&rdquo;. That might be a better way to proceed. It is important that the Department and my colleagues in Government have time to absorb a report. Since this report comes out in May I will not run into a holiday period in which, normally, Cabinet meetings are not held. It means I have time to absorb it and prepare myself for the interviews and so on that follow from it. It is also important that I should be in a position to tell my colleagues at Cabinet what the report contains so that they have time to assess it in a public sense. That is fair. We have to have some time to consider a report but 30 days after its receipt is probably enough time for that process to be done. I am attracted to the spirit of this amendment. Rather than stating &ldquo;within 30 days&rdquo; it should state &ldquo;as soon as is practicable and not later than 30 days&rdquo;. We can prepare an amendment along those lines.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 59 to 61, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 59:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 28, line 20, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the Central Statistics Office&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the Garda Commissioner shall ensure that the statistical information is made available not only to the Minister but also to the Central Statistics Office. This follows on from my acceptance of a recommendation from the expert group on crime statistics that a central crime statistics unit should be established, and I decided it should be established within the Central Statistics Office. Generously, the Central Statistics Office agreed immediately, even without a statutory nudge in that direction, to carry out this function.</P>
      <P>My aim is that the old canard that this is garda&iacute; devising figures about themselves which we should take with a pinch of salt will be laid to rest. The Central Statistics Office, which has the function of carrying out crime victimisation surveys and the like and has an expertise in the area, should carry out this function. That will free up resources within the administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because what I requested, which was quarterly figures and annual reports on time and so on, takes up a good deal of resources in terms of meeting deadlines, checking everything and ensuring that all crimes are being adequately reported. I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 60 and 61 for the same reason. They are unduly prescriptive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of amendment No. 60 was to regularise what the Minister is already doing. We welcome the practice of making provisional and quarterly statistics available but we take exception to the way the Minister sometimes selectively presents those statistics and the public relations spin that is put on them. The statistics should be published in full and presented. The Minister has said he will not accept either amendment. We tabled the amendments with a view to having a proper deadline. We appreciate the improvements that have been made but these amendments would have regularised the process and ensured it could not be reversed by a future Minister who may decide that the quarterly statistics should not be made available and that we should go back to old practices.</P>

	<P>This is a Bill for the future involving not just the current Minister but all future Ministers who will have the privilege to hold the position the Minister holds. While the Minister might have a liberal and tolerant attitude to the publication of information of this nature, it may not always follow that others will do the same. When the Minister receives the quarterly figures, what is the normal time lag involved from receipt to publication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Cummins talks about spin. When I receive the quarterly figures I study them carefully and then I make a totally vain attempt to convey the truth to the people. Whatever I do, my good friends in the media immediately engage in a massive distortion of the figures. That is what happens on every occasion. If there is a decrease of 4% in overall crime, it is reported that rape incidents have soared by 90% or something like that. If one reads down to the end of the report one will find that crime levels are decreasing. Spin on this matter comes from the media, not from me. In the statements I issue I always counsel against rash conclusions, ask people to examine the totality of the figures and remind them that the overall figures for headline offences equates the theft of a bicycle with a murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister used a different spin when he was in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No. That is not spin. I am simply reminding people that there are other aspects to be considered. If I claim crime has decreased by 5% people must look carefully at the individual components of that. In all the statements I have produced there is not a whit of spin in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not beyond the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On the contrary, I always tell people to read these things carefully and not draw rash conclusions from them. I am aware, however, that crime sells newspapers. That is an immutable fact in public life and it has been the case as long as newspapers have been produced. A good crime story is better even than a corruption in politics story. Crime stories sell newspapers.</P>
      <P>I am not naive enough to expect that a report that sells newspapers will be written in a way that suggests we should all be at ease. It is much easier to convey to the public the notion that crime is on the increase, that we should all be scared and that there is a real problem in society. That is a much easier message to get across than one to the effect that crime levels have improved slightly over the past quarter and that there is less crime.</P>
      <P>I will give a prime example to the House. Incidents of murder have declined consistently in the period since I was appointed Minister, although I am not claiming responsibility for that. There has <Col N="2073"/>been a constant decline in the number of murders committed but one would not know that from reading many newspapers or listening to programmes on radio or television. They report that there is a murder a week and that the situation is out of control. That is simply not true. We are coming to the end of this year and the figures will reflect that there were fewer murders this year than last year, and there were fewer murders last year than the year before. That is a fact but the newspapers do not want to report that. There will not be a headline to the effect that the murder rate has dropped. It will not be done, but if they sift through the tables of figures I produce every quarter and see that the number of rapes increased in one quarter by X amount, from one figure to another, and that it represents a 40% increase, the banner headline will read, &ldquo;Rape Spirals Upwards&rdquo;, or something like that.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I am not naive and I know what newspapers do but in this House at the very least we should be conscious of the fact that, for example, the incidence of murder has been declining for two years. There is no question of me spinning; those are facts. That is one figure in which everybody must have some faith. Garda&iacute; cannot turn a blind eye to murders and so on. It is interesting that, despite an increase in population, increased urbanisation and the increased availability of firearms, the number of murders has fallen over the past two years. Nobody will report this because it does not sell newspapers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>A sensible counsel against quarterly publication of crime figures was that a news story would be reported on a quarterly basis rather than an out of date story 18 months after publication and the media would be given four bites at the cherry every year. That was good advice but, on the other hand, not producing the figures quarterly would break the chain of accountability and distract the Garda. Who would be motivated by figures that may appear in 18 or 24 months? The world does not work that way.</P>
      <P>Quarterly publication is positive. I will think about accepting the proposal before Report Stage. I do not want to make a provision that will create a difficulty and more bureaucracy. I will have to contact the CSO regarding whether this should be a statutory requirement. It would be difficult for a bad minded successor of mine to reverse that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>He or she could not do so if it was in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that but, even without making a provision in law, it would be difficult to return to the old regime. However, I do not want to create a mess for the CSO, without consultation, if it takes over this function. Significant progress has been made in publishing the fig<Col N="2074"/>ures on a quarterly basis. They are published without spin and, if Members do not believe me, I invite them to ask for the accompanying speeches and statements from my Department. When the CSO takes over this function from the Garda, it will improve significantly. It would be unwise to impose the quarterly provision in law without carefully considering whether it might create difficulties in the future.</P>

	<P>Normally, I receive the first quarter figures in mid to late April and I turn them around within ten or 14 days. In a vain effort to ensure they are reasonably presented to the public, I have come to the view that I should be available to discuss them. On some occasions I am involved in a major issue and I decide to do the press briefings the following week so that I can absorb the figures and come forward with an appropriate public response.</P>

There was a time when legal aid was regarded as a dirty raincoat end of the spectrum activity by practising barristers. It was a case of God help those interested in criminal law while others had to do the work out of economic necessity. It was not fashionable, although many barristers acted on a <i>pro bono</i> basis in criminal cases because criminal legal aid was not introduced until the 1960s. It was first introduced in murder cases and was then generalised as a result of a High Court decision.</P><Col N="2075"/>
      <P>It would be a heavy burden on a middle class person of normal means to pay a solicitor or barrister the amount available under the legal aid scheme for his or her defence if he or she was impecunious. Serious offences attract serious legal aid fees and it is a heavy burden on a person who does not qualify for legal aid to meet those fees. Members of the Garda who faced a lengthy jury trial arising, for example, out of an accusation of assault wondered whether they could afford to defend themselves properly. It was demeaning for a member who takes a salary form the State that his or her family circumstances were such that he or she could not put together the fees to have himself or herself properly defended. The representative associations picked up the tab in many of these cases and that was a worry for them because they were providing a system of legal aid.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden suggested that if a garda was acquitted, he or she should be given the full costs of his or her defence as would be the case if or she was convicted. I am not disposed to doing that because if one is acquitted, the system will provide a sum not exceeding that available under legal aid and that is a generous amount. It is not necessary to give somebody more out of the public purse.</P>

      <P FLI="0">Currently, a garda who resigns and takes up a full-time position with Interpol gives up his or her pension entitlement. We should encourage <Col N="2076"/>members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to compete for positions at this level. This amendment is designed to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be useful to set out briefly the general position with regard to service abroad by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Where a member of the Garda is stationed overseas in his or her capacity as such a member, for example with Interpol, he or she receives an allowance for such duty and accrues service and pension entitlements as normal. Where a member opts to leave the Garda to serve overseas with another agency, such as the UN, he or she ceases to be a member and must rejoin the force on the termination of that service. In such cases the member does not accrue service and pension entitlements. These distinctions are well understood within the force and any question of a change in the position would, in the first place, arise for discussion between me and the various representative bodies. Therefore, it would not be a good idea for me to start negotiating here on the floor of the House through legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This section deals with secondment from the PSNI to certain ranks in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while section 47 deals with the reverse situation. Have there been any preliminary discussions with the Chief Constable on this issue? If there have, will the Minister inform us whether any serving PSNI members are interested in secondment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na? There is a logical reason for interest the other way, particularly in terms of boosting the number of Catholics in the PSNI as a means of achieving the 50:50 regime proposed in the Patten reforms. I am not against the proposal but am interested to know whether discussions with the Chief Constable and the Garda Commissioner have indicated any interest in the proposal and the legislative framework outlined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This part of the Bill is effectively a repeal and re-enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Police Co-Operation) Act 2003. That Act has a part in the Patten report and the outworking of the Good Friday Agreement. Until now, there has been a delay in the practical implementation of the Act, based on the question of the remuneration of members going North or South. With regard to members going North, I will issue new guidelines as to entitlements. I hope in the near future to be in a position to meet the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Con<Col N="2077"/>stable in Northern Ireland to announce the first secondments on a South-North basis.</P>
      <P>The Senator&rsquo;s question on whether there has been an interest in North-South secondments is interesting. I am not in a position to answer that today. However, I will communicate with him on that issue. I imagine that until the initiative gets going on a South-North basis, the implementation North-South will be held up.</P>

      <P FLI="0">I have concerns regarding the broadness of this section. The Constitution recognises freedom of association and this section does not sit comfortably with that principle. While I recognise there are public policy considerations behind what the Minister is trying to achieve, this section does not strike the right balance.</P>
      <P>The representative bodies should have the ability to flex their muscles when trying to get better conditions and salaries for their members. Garda&iacute; are employees like any other employees and want the best possible conditions for themselves. To impose a statutory ban in the way proposed is inequitable. Will the Minister give us his view on this? The proposal seems to be a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised at this amendment because Fine Gael is a party with regard for strong law and order principles. One can only imagine the chaos that would ensue if we did not have the kind of protection offered in this section. I do not accept that garda&iacute; are workers like any others. They are intrinsically involved in the security of the State and have responsibilities and powers a person in a normal job does not have. It would create an impossible position if we did not have the protections of this section.</P>
      <P>Over the years partnership systems have evolved which have led to dialogue between members of the force, their employers and the State. Most trade unions operate responsibly. In the 1970s and 1980s when we had high unemployment and much difficulty with industrial relations, a maturing of attitude and approach to industrial relations took place, particularly in the private sector. This has facilitated a partnership approach in most companies which has avoided withdrawal of labour as an addendum to negotiations. This is good and healthy and has served us well economically.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the public service. Perhaps this is because public service management has been particularly weak in dealing with industrial relations issues. For example, when local government reform was introduced, an embargo was placed on the external recruitment of people to senior positions, which were to be filled in-house. As a consequence, while many good people were promoted, there are also many round pegs in square holes. The unfortunate consequence of that is that the public and taxpayers will get an extremely poor return over a number of years until these people go through the natural wastage process of retirement and whatever else.</P>
      <P>We need to bring the operation of industrial relations mechanisms within the public service into line with what is happening in the private sector. It needs to become much more modern in its approach. It would be a backward step to accept the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment is a studied recommendation. I do not know if the Minister&rsquo;s <Col N="2079"/>officials received any recommendations on the Bill in this regard from the representative associations. I am unaware of any such case having been made. It would be difficult to enforce this measure, as it would be difficult to prove that such inducement occurred. Section 52 refers to a person who, &ldquo;induces, or does any act calculated to induce, any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to withhold his or her services or to commit a breach of discipline&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section has serious implications for representative associations. I am sure the Minister or his officials have had discussions with the relevant organisations. I have not received any submission in this regard but I wonder if the proposed measure is enforceable.</P>
      <P>Is it possible for the Minister to introduce a measure that is in keeping with the amendment which would ensure that where legitimate negotiations are under way, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not be unnecessarily charged with this type of offence? Otherwise, it would be very difficult for representative associations to negotiate on behalf of members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing the amendment rather than the section generally. However, I suppose we can talk about both at the same time. The amendment runs contrary to the terms of section 17, which we have already discussed, and for the reasons I expressed in regard to that I will not change my view at this point.</P>
      <P>On this issue, I would ask Senators, some of whom have been nominated by a federation which includes representative organisations, to look carefully at the report of the Morris tribunal, which investigated Garda activities in Donegal. The point made by Senator Jim Walsh was set out in that report in the coldest terms. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not simply employees. The Garda is not simply a service industry where the public are customers, it is something different, namely, a disciplined force that is a central element of the executive power of our State. I am not naive in regard to what can and cannot be achieved, but it could not be the case that somebody could organise, in effect, a mutiny in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that the State would stand helpless in the face of such behaviour.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins comes from a party, of which I was once a member, which has a strong tradition in law and order and standing behind the State. Sometimes standing behind the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one has to stand behind the force as the force, rather than the force as represented by the representative bodies of the force.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a central pillar of the State and must operate as a disciplined force, as Mr. Justice Morris pointed out. It cannot be the case, for instance, that the proper functioning of the force is reduced to solely an industrial relations process. There are occasions when superior officers are entitled to an immediate explanation and when it is not a matter of nego<Col N="2080"/>tiation as to whether they would be informed of facts or given explanations to which they are entitled. A disciplined force cannot function in that way. I do not wish to sound draconian or hardline.</P>
      <P>A police force is distinguishable from fire or ambulance services which are equally vital parts of our State but while we can say in those cases unionisation is permissible, we simply cannot cross that line in regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>I am considering tabling an amendment to section 52(2)(<i>b</i>) to increase the penalty for causing disaffection to five years because, as things stand, to the best of my knowledge &mdash; and Senators may correct me on this &mdash; there would not be a power of arrest if we leave the indictable penalty at two years. Somebody could hand out leaflets urging people to mutiny and it would not be possible to arrest them as the law currently stands. I think that would be wrong. I hope that is not taken as being hardline, it is just in order to make the legislation effective.</P>
      <P>I accept what Senator Leyden said, that one would need to reach a high threshold before this section would come into operation, but if we did reach that high threshold and I was confronted with people handing out leaflets outside Garda stations urging a mutiny effectively against the authority of the Garda Commissioner, I would have to be in a position to arrest them. I could not just say, &ldquo;Please desist or we will send you a solicitor&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>To be honest, it is much of a muchness to me. I do not wish to get involved in the politics of competitive penalisation for offences. Let us remember that in the case of a summary offence, it has to be a minor offence under the Constitution. The seriousness of the <Col N="2081"/>offence has to be taken into account. I will think about this between now and Report Stage. I will consult the Parliamentary Counsel as to whether &euro;3,000 is, in the view of the Attorney General, a permissible penalty for a summary offence. If it is, I cannot see that there is anything sacrosanct about &euro;2,500. However, &euro;3,500 is certainly getting to the upper limits of penalties for summary offences. I am cautious about going too far in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

      <P LI="1">In page 36, subsection (3), line 25, to delete &ldquo;&euro;2,500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;&euro;3,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment is similar to that which we tabled to bring the standard penalty for a summary offence up to &euro;3,000. Amendment No. 72 reflects the fact that we believe the offence of impersonation of a garda is a very serious one, which must be reflected in the gravity of the penalty available. I cannot understand why the Minister has not made impersonation an indictable <Col N="2082"/>offence when one considers the circumstances in which people have impersonated garda&iacute;. For example, members of the Provisional IRA have set up road blocks and placed blue lights on their cars in order to pull over trucks carrying alcohol and cigarettes. Senators are aware of such activities. I am sure the Minister agrees that the impersonation of a garda is a very serious offence, which is reflected in the content of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider the matter between now and Report Stage. I note that this is a summary offence, which is largely due to the fact that it is a re-enactment of an existing provision. To have in one&rsquo;s possession or to wear a Garda uniform is a serious matter. However, if it is not an impersonation offence, which is dealt with under the previous section, I do not want to go wild on penalisation.</P>
      <P>Having said that, if I found in someone&rsquo;s garage four Garda uniforms or imitations or composites of Garda uniforms and civilian clothes which look like the real thing, I would agree that six months might be an inadequate sentence because this could be seen as a preparatory act to using those items for something else. However, I do not want to be overly reactionary on the subject.</P>
      <P>If someone was found in his or her flat with a number of Garda uniforms, it could be a very serious offence; much more so than one committed under section 53, in which a person might telephone someone else pretending to be a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 37, subsection (2)(<i>h</i>), lines 18 to 20, to delete &ldquo;(as defined in the Freedom of Information Act 1997) obtained in the course of a criminal investigation&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of amendments to section 55(2)(<i>h</i>) have been proposed. Amendment No. 75 takes account of amendments Nos. 76 and 77, tabled by Labour Party Senators and, as discussed with the Parliamentary Counsel, may meet their concerns. I refer to the reference to personal information relating to a deceased person and the need to insert the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; in the paragraph. At this stage, it might be helpful to refer to amendment No. 89, which will be discussed shortly. It defines personal information for the purpose of this section as including personal information relating to a deceased person.</P>
      <P>The relevant subsection in the Bill refers to personal information as defined in the Freedom of Information Act 1997. The definition of personal information in the FOI Act does not refer specifically to deceased persons but section 28 of that Act, which deals with the issue of the refusal of information on the basis of personal information, includes a reference to information relating to a deceased individual. Generally speaking, personal information in the FOI Act is taken to include deceased persons so, in one view, there is no need to provide for a specific reference in this Bill. However, I am inclined to the view that for the purpose of clarity a provision as proposed relating to a deceased person should be inserted in the subsection by reference to the 1997 Act. As I have said, amendment No. 89 provides accordingly.</P>
      <P>There is no need however to refer to a missing person as a person&rsquo;s status is not affected by his or her location so such persons would have the benefit of the protection of personal information in the FOI Act. It also seems to me that the sub<Col N="2084"/>section could usefully be simplified and, for this reason, I propose an amendment of the words as defined in the Freedom of Information Act 1997, &ldquo;obtained in the course of a criminal investigation&rdquo;, should be deleted. Thus, there would be no need for the proposed amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the Labour Party group&rsquo;s third amendment, which is to replace the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; with &ldquo;or&rdquo;. As the section as a whole stands, a double test has to be satisfied, which refers to the publication of personal information and harm, not or harm. My amendment proposes that it has to be harmful and be consistent with this; there is a double test before a person can be found guilty. If the amendment is accepted it would have the effect of broadening the scope of the offence and I would not be happy to do this in circumstances in which the potential penalty is quite severe; up to seven years imprisonment. This is commensurate with a serious breach and the double test should be retained in my opinion. In this context, section 55(2)(<i>h</i>) reads, &ldquo;results in the publication of personal information and constitutes an unwarranted and serious infringement of a person&rsquo;s right to privacy.&rdquo; The intention is that the definition of personal information will be inserted in a new subsection (8), which we will discuss on amendment No. 89.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Labour Party Senators agree that this meets their concerns in respect of amendment No. 76, which concerns personal information relating to a deceased person. I thank the Labour Party Members for drawing these matters to my attention by way of the amendments tabled to this important area of the law.</P>

      <P LI="1">[if it] affects adversely the relations of the Government with any political party, group or institutions in Northern Ireland or the Government&rsquo;s ability to promote agreement, advance the peace process or engage in negotiations with regard to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is proposed to remove that paragraph completely. It is vague in intent. What does the concept of the peace process mean in any event? <Col N="2085"/>When I hear some people, in parties not represented in this House, claiming they spent 30 years struggling for peace, my stomach turns. Former Deputy John Bruton got into trouble&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Sometimes people can comprehend a lot of things from the phrase &ldquo;the peace process&rdquo;. I remember on one occasion joining a peace march in O&rsquo;Connell Street after some terrible atrocity and from out of a side street came a group of Sinn F&eacute;in people with a placard that referred to a poor man called Mr. Ed O&rsquo;Brien, who had been blown up while on active service for the IRA in Britain. They had posters commemorating him as a peace activist. I felt very sorry for his family that language was perverted in such a way and that setting off bombs was put down as peace activism. Sometimes words cease to mean anything. In the circumstances we have decided to delete paragraph (<i>k</i>) completely and elaborate on paragraph (<i>j</i>), extending it to encompass Northern Ireland. That is probably the best way of dealing with this issue.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 82</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 37, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) Information shall not be deemed to be of harmful effect if it can be shown that its disclosure was inadvertent or procured through fraud or deceit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This section is viewed in black and white terms and seems to allow very little scope for flexibility. Let us take the example where a garda receives a telephone call purporting to be from his or her chief superintendent or superior officer and he or she discloses information to that person, who turns out to be a journalist. Should this innocent garda be condemned under the provisions of this section? That appears to be the effect of section 55(3). It gives rise to concern. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comment on it.</P><Col N="2086"/>
      <P>In tabling amendment No. 83, I proposed it to offset the absolutist nature of the section, particularly section 55(2) which sets out a very broad definition of the term &ldquo;harmful effect&rdquo;. The Minister should acknowledge that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uses the media to its advantage and for its assistance in investigating crimes, particularly serious crimes. When members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na contact the media to highlight a particular case, they know that the profile of the case will be raised, which inevitably leads to more information from the public. In this regard the provisions of subsection (2) go overboard. Will the Minister address these points?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>What amendment No. 82 seeks to achieve is amply covered by the terms of subsection (1), which states:</P>
      <P LI="1">A person who is or was a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or of its civilian staff or who is or was engaged under contract or other arrangement to work with or for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall not disclose, in or outside the State, any information obtained in the course of carrying out the duties of that person&rsquo;s office, employment, contract or other arrangement [and this is the point] if the person knows the disclosure of that information is likely to have a harmful effect.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The<i> mens rea</i>, the guilty mind to commit that offence, is that the person knew, when he or she did it, that it would have a harmful effect. That is a fairly high test for the prosecution to prove. It is balanced in its own way by subsection (3) which states:</P>
      <P LI="1">For the purpose of this section, a person is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to know that disclosure of information referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> is likely to have a harmful effect if a reasonable person would, in all the circumstances, be aware that its disclosure could have that effect.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It introduces an objective standard of behaviour. Having said that, let us suppose that somebody who is in fact a journalist impersonates a superior officer, nobody could be said in those circumstances to know that the disclosure of the information to the superior officer would have a harmful effect. An innocent person who is duped would have a defence. I do not want to make this an unprovable offence, because it is there for serious reasons.</P>
      <P>The House will know that we started off with a draft set of heads of the Bill which attracted considerable public controversy, that we have gone through a process of discussion with the representative bodies and such like and have produced a Bill which I am further amending to make it more precise, including the introduction of the double requirement of harmfulness and one of these categories, rather than deeming any of these categories to be <i>per se</i> harmful. I am <Col N="2087"/>softening the offence quite considerably in that respect. This is a question of balance.</P>
      <P>I want to have a situation that those who deal with the Garda S&iacute;ochana and the members of the force who require their colleagues to deal professionally with the information they are obliged to share all operate to a reasonable decent standard of behaviour. I am not asking people to behave like reverend mothers, but merely that they behave to a standard of decency which I think everybody is entitled to expect. The great majority of members of the force would instinctively, without any law, go down this road.</P>
      <P>Section 55(4) does not prohibit a person from disclosing information if the disclosure is authorised by the Garda Commissioner, as per paragraph (<i>d</i>); is otherwise authorised by law, as per pargraph (<i>e</i>); or is made in the course of, and in accordance with the duties of that person, as per paragraph (<i>a</i>). That covers a significant number of potential defences. For example, section 55(4)(<i>a</i>)(x) covers disclosure to &ldquo;a member of either of the Houses of the Oireachtas where necessary for the proper discharge of the member&rsquo;s functions,&rdquo;. That is a very broad provision for somebody who wants to act as a whistleblower. The person may go to any Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, if it is relevant to that person&rsquo;s functions, such as holding the Government accountable. If one looks at the small print, one sees that the section is not draconian.</P>
      <P>I do not want to reopen old wounds, but there have been occasions when a tiny minority in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have revealed information which must have been crucifying to the victims.</P>
      <P>There has been publicity about some of these cases. In one case an entire file was handed over to a journalist and it resulted in two women who were named in the file as being involved in an allegation of unlawful abortion, being visited by representatives of the newspaper to get their side of the story. Whatever the rights and wrongs of abortion, there was no reason a newspaper should be put in possession of such information with those consequences. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the situation and I do not wish to go into it, those two women were entitled to have their privacy totally respected and not to wake up one morning and find on their doorstep a member of the press asking them if it was true that X or Y had happened to them. That kind of behaviour, which thank God is extremely rare, should never be countenanced in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>This section will act as a protection for members of the force who are asked for information by people who should not ask for it. They can say, &ldquo;No, this is a serious matter. If you were to print that material or to publish that material or to convey that material to a third party, there could be a very serious criminal investigation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I was Attorney General, the former Garda Commissioner, Patrick Byrne, told me that <Col N="2088"/>in the absence of a section of this type, there was virtually nothing he could do to investigate many cases which were <i>prima facie</i> breaches of the Official Secrets Act, because he did not have a power of arrest, the power to make inquiries or the power even to check who was contacting whom by telephone. He could do nothing and was effectively relying on asking people whether they had done it and being told that it was not them and that was it.</P>
      <P>I am not on some kind of solo run here. I have balanced this as fairly as I can. It protects whistleblowers and those people who have a constitutional duty to reveal information. It upholds all the best traditions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and provides a protection to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they can say to people who put them under pressure to disclose information improperly, &ldquo;No, it is as good as my job is worth. If I disclose it to you, both you and I would be committing a serious offence and there are now investigatory powers which would put us both in jeopardy&rdquo;. That strengthens the hand of decent members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are the vast majority and will isolate to a tiny minority those who seek to breach the law.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins made the point that on occasion the Garda uses the media but that can be a legitimate use. On occasions, perhaps, people may criticise it as being an illegitimate use. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na lives in a real world; it is not a group of reverend mothers. Its members must use publicity on occasions for their own purposes in the proper prosecution of criminal investigations. They cannot use the media as a form of informal punishment to pillory people whom they suspect. I believe this achieves the correct balance.</P>
      <P>I am aware I have been criticised by a number of people in the media on both sides. I find it slightly confusing. I have been accused by some of being a wholly useless Minister because I have not taken action to stop information coming out. I have another group of critics who say that I am some kind of mad fascist because I have taken action. I wish these people would get together and sort out their differences.</P>
      <P>The editor of one newspaper thinks this proposal is wholly wrong and another very senior journalist has castigated me savagely for not introducing something like this sooner. I suppose we live in a democracy and people are entitled to have their opinions. However, I think this section, as now amended, is right and it provides for all of the exceptions for which this House would want to provide.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins&rsquo;s amendment concerns the integrity of the force. I cannot imagine a case where that would be an issue where, for instance, it would not be permissible to go to a person in authority or a Member of the Oireachtas. If a Member of the Oireachtas has information and discloses it responsibly at a later stage, the media can feast on it. This is not a gagging writ in respect of material which should come into the <Col N="2089"/>public domain. There are checks and balances in the section as now drafted and I am very happy with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>All Members of the House would be of the same opinion concerning some members of the force who would attempt to use this information to harm a person or a body. It would be our intention to ensure that action should be taken against such members. The new tests which the Minister proposes in this section need to be extended. Should the same not apply to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? What is to stop a senior or junior or any official of the Department or of any other Department, using such information in an erroneous, malicious way when that information came to him or her by way of members of the force?</P>
      <P>I do not know the full answer to the question I pose. I have no difficulty with what the Minister proposes as a new standard for members of the force. Is it the case that other arms of the State&rsquo;s security system will face the same test? The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is such an arm because it functions for the Minister alone who is responsible to both Houses. Will the same criteria and provisions apply to them?</P>
      <P>Significant amounts of information on security matters are disposed of by many people in very sensitive positions in the Minister&rsquo;s Department and in other Departments. If this law is applied to members of the force, does it equally apply to other civil servants, albeit those working in other areas? I do not suggest it happened on the Minister&rsquo;s watch but it has happened as we all know. Information has been touted and put into the public domain not only to wreck politicians but also individuals in a malicious and harmful way. Will this law apply to those in the Civil Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer is that the provisions of this law, obviously, are special to this case. The Official Secrets Act applies to everybody in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is part of An Agreed Programme for Government which has not yet been reached and may not be reached, the way things are going. The ambition of the programme is to replace the Official Secrets Act with an entirely new code. Official information under the Official Secrets Act is, literally, anything. It is a summary offence for an official in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to reveal any piece of information of any kind that is in his or her possession. That is a strange law and, luckily, prosecutions are not brought.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is an offence under the Act for any member of my staff in the Department to say over a pint in the evening what he or she did at work earlier in the day. That is an extraordinary position in which people find themselves. Having said that, since becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have been impressed, as I should have <Col N="2090"/>expected to be, that I have never once believed any official in my Department had leaked information.</P>

    <Title>Road Traffic Bill 2004: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill represents a further significant step in the development of a code of road traffic law that underpins and promotes road safety. The Bill was initially published on 11 June 2004 with the immediate focus of supporting the introduction of a new system of speed limits based on metric values. In the interim period the Comptroller and Auditor General published a report relating to the operation of the fixed charge and penalty points systems. This report, which was discussed before the Committee of Public Accounts, highlighted a number of issues relating to the operation of these systems. My Department is also aware of issues raised with regard to prosecutions for speeding offences detected by garda&iacute; using hand-held speed detection guns. Following the advice of the Attorney General, the Bill includes a range of provisions to address those issues. The Bill also contains an important provision regarding vehicle insurance, which has also been added to the scope of the original Bill.</P>
      <P>In many instances sections of the Bill provide for relatively minor, though necessary, amendments to provisions in existing enactments. For the purpose of today&rsquo;s debate, I will focus on the main provisions. Part 1 contains the standard title, citation provisions and outlines definitions for key phrases and words that appear in the text. Part 2 provides for the introduction of a new system of speed limits based on metric values. The current system has its legislative base in the Road Traffic Act 1961 and was last reviewed in 1992 and 1994. Senators will appreciate our road network has seen major investment and improvement over the intervening years and this has been a significant contributing factor in our improved road safety performance.</P>
      <P>It is important to ensure that speed limit structures are consistent with the road network, that they retain their central focus on safety and, in particular, that the system is relevant having regard to modern traffic and road conditions. In addition, there are grounds for suggesting a need for greater flexibility in policy regarding the manner in which speed limits are applied. These requirements prompted the decision to carry out a comprehensive review of current speed limit structures and policy last year. That review, allied to the determination to adopt metric as opposed <Col N="2091"/>to imperial speed limits, provides the background to the proposals in this part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the target date for the introduction of the metric system for speed limits is 20 January 2005 and that determination is the main reason this Bill has a relatively tight focus. Section 4 empowers the Minister for Transport to determine the maximum speed limits that should be applied to vehicle classes through the making of regulations. Ordinary speed limits are currently applied in respect of a very small group of vehicles, in particular to buses and heavy goods vehicles. This provision remains essentially unaltered from that which has applied since 1961.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides four default speed limits. Section 5 provides that the speed limit in built-up areas will be 50 km/h. This replaces the present 30 mph built-up area speed limit. Section 6 introduces a new speed limit of 80 km/h to apply to all regional and local roads outside of built-up areas. This is essentially equal to 50 mph and replaces the present general speed limit of 60 mph on these roads. A new speed limit of 100 km/h, which will apply to all national roads outside of built-up areas, is provided for in section 7. This speed limit will replace the present general speed limit of 60 mph on national roads outside urban areas. Section 8 establishes the speed limit for motorways will be 120 km/h, which replaces the current motorway speed limit of 70 mph.</P>
      <P>The majority of the regional and local road network is of a lower infrastructural standard than that of national roads in terms of design, road engineering and maintenance. A default maximum speed limit of 80 km/h is considered the best road safety match for the majority of these routes. This new limit will result in a reduction of approximately 16 km/h, or just over 10 mph, in the speed limit applying in respect of over 90% of the rural road network. Local authorities will be in a position to apply the higher speed limit of 100 km/h on specified stretches of regional and local road where they deem such action to be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The speed limits provided for under sections 5 to 8 will apply automatically to the roads in question, save where it is determined that there is a requirement for them to be replaced. The replacement of a default speed limit will continue to be facilitated by the making of special speed limit by-laws by county and city councils. This will be provided for in section 9.</P>
      <P>The concept that decisions regarding the application of special speed limits should be taken by the major local authorities was introduced in the Road Traffic Act 1994. Such decisions are reserved to elected members. This devolution of power from the Minister to members of local authorities has served us well. Road users should be confident that each speed limit is applied in a reasonable manner and that in each case it reflects road safety considerations and the capacity of the road in question. For that reason <Col N="2092"/>section 9 incorporates a number of changes to the process relating to the making of special speed limit by-laws. For that reason section 9 incorporates a number of changes to the process relating to the making of special speed limit by-laws. Subsection (4) introduces a new public consultation process through which members of the public can submit objections to a council&rsquo;s proposals. The prior consent of the National Roads Authority to all proposals relating to national roads will continue to be required and the current arrangements relating to consultation with the garda&iacute; and urban local authorities will also remain in place.</P>
      <P>The section also provides that the Minister for Transport can issue guidelines to local authorities to which they must have regard in making their by-laws. This takes cognisance of the onerous task involved in the determination of the application of special speed limits and will ensure that the greatest possible level of support will be given to local authorities.</P>
      <P>The range of speed limits that may be deployed as special speed limits include the values of 120, 100, 80, 60 and 50 km/h and local authorities can apply special speed limits of 30 km/h and 60 km/h. The availability of the use of the 30 km/h speed limit will allow councils to impose a legal requirement on traffic to adopt very low speeds at locations sensitive from a road safety perspective. For that reason, the use of that speed limit must be in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Minister. International experience has shown that the deployment of such low speed limits is only effective when accompanied by appropriate traffic calming measures. The House will note that the application of the motorway speed limit of 120 km/h on dual carriageways on national roads can only be pursued in accordance with the guidelines.</P>
      <P>Another new initiative in this section will allow local authorities to make provision in by-laws to apply different speed limits on separate carriageways of a road and to apply special lower speed limits for specified periods of the day, for example in the vicinity of schools during the times children are entering and leaving school.</P>
      <P>Section 10 introduces a new concept that provides that in the event of road works, a city or county manager may make an order determining that a speed limit other than that which normally applies at the road works site should be put in place for the duration of the work, up to a maximum period of one year. It is hoped we will not have too many of those. Section 11 provides for the substitution of section 47 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 which establishes that it is an offence to breach a speed limit.</P>
      <P>Section 12 provides legislative support for the transition period that will apply in advance of the metrication date. The changeover to the metric system will entail the provision of over 58,000 metric speed limit signs to serve the 96,000 km of public road network. The 34 city and county councils will commence the changeover of signs at least three days prior to 20 January 2005 with <Col N="2093"/>the objective of having in place all metric signs to support the official changeover to metric values at midnight on 19 January. Each new sign will display the value of the maximum speed limit in figures together with the unit km/h to signal that metric units of measurement apply.</P>
      <P>Special information signs notifying road users that speed limits are in km/h will also be provided. The initial focus for the deployment of these signs will be on cross-Border roads and on exit roads from ferry ports and airports. An intensive multi-media public information and awareness campaign will kick off in early January 2005 to herald the new speed limits system. A dedicated website will also be available.</P>
      <P>Section 15 responds to an issue raised in recent court cases by providing clarity on the evidence from the operation of all forms of equipment used by the garda&iacute; in the enforcement of speed limits. Part 3 introduces a number of adjustments to the administration of the fixed charge and penalty points systems introduced under the Road Traffic Act 2002.</P>
      <P>Section 18, which introduces a number of changes to the fixed charge system, incorporates a provision through which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can engage third parties in functions relating to that system. The functions that can be outsourced are of an administrative nature and have no direct relationship with the detection work of the garda&iacute; and traffic wardens. Other amendments include recognition of the fact that the return of the actual fixed charge notice on payment of a fixed charge will only be required where specified. In practice, this will mean that it will apply in the case of a penalty point offence only and the introduction of an express statement to the effect that the payment of a fixed charge shall not be accepted after the expiration of 56 days.</P>
      <P>As the House will recall, between the time of the publication of this Bill and the Second Stage debate, a report published by the Comptroller and Auditor General into the operation of the fixed charge system by the Garda was the subject of consideration by the Committee of Public Accounts. That report raised a number of issues that needed to be addressed as quickly as possible to confirm the deterrent effect of both the fixed charge and penalty points systems. One of the issues on which that report focused was that of corporate registered owners of vehicles.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act 2002, which introduced fixed charge and penalty points systems, establishes requirements with which a registered owner must comply. For example, a registered owner is required to furnish the name of the person driving the vehicle at the time of the commission of the alleged offence. However, having regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, new provisions needed to be introduced to provide for a greater degree of responsibility for registered owners, especially where the corporate ownership of the vehicle is concerned. Sections 19 and 20 respond to the potential that <Col N="2094"/>may exist for corporate owners of vehicles to escape their responsibilities. The House will agree that such potential threats, where identified, should be addressed on the basis that every attempt must be made to heighten the deterrent effect of the fixed charge and the associated penalty points system.</P>
      <P>Section 21 provides for a restatement of the requirements on defendants in court proceedings relating to the majority of traffic offences to present their licences to the court. Section 22 provides for a number of amendments to the operation of the penalty points system. Of key significance is the addition of the offence of driving without reasonable consideration to the schedule of offences. This offence will attract four penalty points on conviction in court and two penalty points on payment of a fixed charge.</P>
      <P>Part 4 presents a range of miscellaneous amendments and initiatives across a number of areas. Section 26 amends section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 which relates to the control and regulation of traffic and parking. The purpose of the amendment is to allow for the issue of permits for a range of functions and for the imposition of charges for such permits. A power of inspection in respect of such permits is also being provided for the Garda and, where appropriate, for traffic wardens.</P>
      <P>Section 27 provides a response to concerns expressed by representatives of the emergency services on the need for greater clarity as to the circumstances where emergency vehicles can be exempted from requirements, restrictions and prohibitions imposed under the Road Traffic Acts. However, it must be understood that the application of any exemption is subject to the overriding prerequisite that road users must not be endangered.</P>
      <P>Section 30 introduces a new offence relating to the supply of mechanically propelled vehicles to minors. The new offence will apply to the supply of all mechanically propelled vehicles to persons aged under 16 generally. However, persons aged 16 but under 17 years are legally entitled to hold a licence to drive certain vehicles and this is reflected in the section.</P>
      <P>Section 33 has been introduced to provide for a new power to enable garda&iacute; to demand production of driving licence or provisional licence subsequent to the commission of a road traffic offence. This issue was also raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report. The amendment is necessary to ensure the efficient operation of the penalty points system.</P>
      <P>The primary provision of Part 5 is section 34 relating to the law on motor insurance. This is a sensitive issue. I cannot emphasise enough that this change is not for the ease of the insurance companies. Its only purpose is to protect all road users by ensuring that motorists can continue to have access to sufficient insurance cover in a changing insurance market internationally. The reason for the amendment is quite simple &mdash; a substantial risk exists that in the near future <Col N="2095"/>insurance companies will not be in a position to provide cover for motorists as required by law. Under Irish motor insurance law, motorists must have cover for unlimited liability for personal injuries to third parties. Up to now, the industry has been in a position to provide such cover by re-insuring the risk with specialist re-insurance companies. Reflecting re-insurance market conditions, Irish insurers now expect their re-insurers to refuse to cover them for unlimited liability motor cover in the future. The industry holds that if companies are refused re-insurance cover they will not be in a position to provide unlimited cover to motorists. The amendment to insurance law, proposed in section 34, will enable the Minister to replace the requirement for unlimited cover with a specified level of cover for motorists to obtain insurance and continue to use their vehicles. The amendment will not change the existing arrangements but will enable a change to be made in the future, if necessary. Any proposal to change the unlimited cover requirement and the specific limit would be subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The provisions in section 34 specify the maximum fine for the offence for not having insurance and, consequently, section 35 provides for the deletion of the reference, as specified, in the Road Traffic Act 2002.</P>
      <P>The key determinant of road safety performance is the behaviour of road users. The primary focus of our strategic approach to road safety is to influence positively the behaviour of road users. This can be attained through initiatives, such as the enactment and enforcement of laws that promote good road user behaviour. This focused Bill contributes to the overall approach to road safety policy. It provides for changes to traffic laws that will have a direct impact on road safety and support for their enforcement.</P>
      <P>Senators will appreciate the particular time considerations associated with the passage of the Bill and for that reason its scope is limited. In particular, it does not address random breath testing, a recommendation of the new road safety strategy. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, indicated this is an issue of ongoing deliberation between the Department and the Attorney General. While that deliberation is at an advanced stage, it would not have been appropriate to address that sensitive and important issue in the Bill. The new provisions in the Bill will add further value to the Government&rsquo;s pursuit of its overall strategic approach to road safety. I look forward to the co-operation and contribution of Members in facilitating the passage of the Bill. I commend it to the House</P>

      <P>The Bill is an attempt by the Government to tie together myriad objectives, such as standardising speeding limits and converting them to the metric system, giving comprehensive powers to the local authorities, particularly in setting speed limits, and granting parking permits. The Bill also includes the outsourcing of penalty points and their notification to drivers, the sale of vehicles to minors, disqualification of public service drivers and exemptions for emergency drivers. This long list of objectives is well overdue, particularly the sale of vehicles to minors. Action to improve speed limits was long overdue for motorists who have been disadvantaged by the illogical state of national speed limits.</P>
      <P>I welcome any attempt to improve the abysmal system of speed limits. This legislation converts speed limits from miles to kilometres. While we must follow our European counterparts in moving to kilometres, I am concerned that it will lead to even greater confusion. We must be conscious that Northern Ireland will not replicate our conversion to the metric system. Additional resources and vigilance will be required, especially at the entry and exit Border-crossing points. I urge the Minister of State and departmental officials to ensure the public is fully informed and aware of this changeover. I am anxious that the Minister will give sufficient funds to the National Roads Authority in this regard.</P>
      <P>Difficulties will arise with changes to both signage and speedometers. The change in signage must be done in an efficient and motorist-friendly manner to ensure minimum disruption and maximum public information. The Minister of State alluded to an advertising campaign in the new year but I am concerned by the short lead-in time for the changeover. Today is 9 December and the changeover is expected to take place on 20 January 2005. With Christmas coming, the public will not pay sufficient attention to these significant changes which are scheduled to occur. This is not least because of the failure to introduce the legislation earlier in the year which has prevented media publicity campaigns from being undertaken.</P>
      <P>Changes to speedometers in existing cars will cause problems. I ask the Minister of State to clarify if he has considered providing some conversion device to motorists to assist them in making the conversion in their minds. The currency converter for the euro changeover worked well for Irish consumers. Perhaps a similar system could be provided by the Department of Transport.</P>
      <P>Speed limits are of critical importance to the promotion of road safety. Existing legislation relating to speed limits provides for the deployment of four different road speed limits, in addition to the application of speed limits to certain types of default speeds. For some time it has been perceived that the system of speed limits is not appropriate to the changed situation which now exists on the road system. Criticisms of existing speed limits centred on the imbalanced policy <Col N="2097"/>towards them. For example, rural and secondary roads are subject to the same general speed limits as national roads. This does not make any sense. It is unquestionable that the existing speed limit structure has not taken account of the significant upgrading and development of roads network, which have taken place nationwide over the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>The Bill will change the speed limits and, no more than the conversion to metric, it has the potential to create confusion in the public minds. The requirement to reduce speed limits will cause more trouble than the increase in speed limits on certain roads. The need for extensive public information on these changes will again be crucial. Changes to the system will have a strong impact on the speed limits of rural roads where motorists will have to reduce their speed by more than 11 mph. Given that such roads are predominantly the site of many fatal road accidents, it is for the best they are reduced. However, it is going to mean a huge change in drivers&rsquo; mindsets. I have serious concerns about the level of public awareness that these changes will come into being in less than two months.</P>
      <P>I am also disappointed that the changes to the speed limits will do nothing to simplify what is already a complicated system. It was hoped that with metrification, a new structure of speed limits would be introduced, bringing some standardisation to the system. However, now there will be an increase in the number of default speed limits from three to four, thereby, increasing the ever confusing number and range of road signs. I support the Bill&rsquo;s provision giving local authorities power to set special speed limits, provided it is not abused. This must not lead to a situation where, in the space of a few kilometres, motorists are subjected to an array of rising and falling speed limits, not making any obvious sense in terms of road safety. Where higher or lower speed limits can be applied to make a significant difference in promoting road safety they must be utilised. Examples include any high-density residential area or the vicinity of a school in which there are significant numbers of pedestrians and cyclists. I state this with caution as the justified imposition of different limits in housing estates and outside schools should not mean such limits should apply on more significant routes. We cannot have an endless proliferation of speed limits. If we are to reduce speed limits, it is vital to back our initiatives with significant funding to allow local authorities to introduce them.</P>
      <P>In this context, it is necessary to ask who will have the power to set speed limits. Will it be a reserved function or a power of the county manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be a reserved function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to hear it will be a reserve function of a council, though it will probably be a more drawn out process than the Minister of State has indicated. It has been the case <Col N="2098"/>that the manager exercises the function where road works were taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The manager will have the power to impose temporary speed limits where there are works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister of State contends that the legislation seeks to implement change by setting out speed limits in built-up areas, on local and regional roads, national roads and motorways, which are the four general road categories, I fear it will have no effect. If local authorities fail to act and implement sensible speed limits, we will not move on. The guidelines the Minister intends to include in the legislation may end up gathering dust as there is no onus on the office holder to ensure momentum. As some local authorities may be slow to act, it is important to have a mechanism whereby they can be made to make haste in implementing standardised speed limits. We need action to ensure local authorities seize the initiative. If they do not, motorists will continue to disrespect our speed laws.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister of State to explain to the House how, apart from using the metric rather than the imperial system, he expects reasonable, rational and workable speed limits to take hold. The Bill must not be allowed to become one which reads with good intentions but fails to deliver improvements in our speed-limit system. The Minister has a duty to ensure that local authorities work with the NRA to effect changes on the ground.</P>
      <P>Speeding by heavy goods vehicles is a significant issue and the cause of many accidents. The problem must be addressed by the relevant authorities. Surveys of speed limits undertaken from 1999 to 2003, including the most recent NRA survey conducted last year, reveal that a high percentage of goods vehicles exceed the speed limits which apply to them. It is vital that we examine measures to ensure that these vehicles abide by the speed limits we have established for them. The legislation does not appear to include any measure to force goods vehicles to keep within the law. It is a pressing concern which must be addressed. I urge the Minister to explain what he proposes to do to tackle the issue.</P>
      <P>Inaction by the Government, especially in the key area of road safety, is resulting in an increasing number of road deaths. To date in 2004, there have been 40 more deaths than in 2003. The figure will rise further before the end of the year. The statistics indicate that the initial positive benefits of the penalty-points system have begun to wear off. It is a trend about which we should be extremely concerned. It appears our slipping record on road safety is due in no small part to the patchy implementation and enforcement of the penalty points system. There have been numerous inconsistencies in the system&rsquo;s implementation.</P><Col N="2099"/>
      <P>We need a road courtesy policy for which the Garda has responsibility. Section 28 provides that it will be an offence to drive with reasonable consideration. Much driving of this kind results from the frustration drivers experience when travelling behind a line of slow moving lorries or a motorist who is impeding traffic by driving at the white line and preventing people from passing. As a result people at the back of long lines of traffic may drive dangerously and overtake on continuous or double white lines. A courtesy policy should be introduced whereby garda&iacute; can ask people who are driving slowly to pull in to the slow lane or the hard shoulder. Such a policy would help to reduce the frustration many drivers feel and reduce the number of road deaths.</P>
      <P>Controversies on convictions obtained with the toxic meter used to measure drink driving and the recent dismissal of cases brought in respect of speeding offences observed by radar gun have undermined public confidence in the penalty points system. Many people have begun to believe they can evade road safety laws. The absence of absolute enforcement of all aspect of road safety laws is eroding the penalty points system. As motorists can see for themselves and are told by many media pundits that one can drive the length and breadth of Ireland without encountering a Garda inspection point, it is little wonder they believe they can persistently break speed limits and get away with it.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I will go through those aspects of the legislation I have not had time to discuss. An amendment was introduced on insurance in the D&aacute;il, to which I will refer and to which I will not offer support on Committee Stage in this House. There was no consultation on the matter apart from the pressure insurance companies brought to bear on the Minister. He should have consulted with IBEC and other bodies before amending the Bill. He is reading the issue incorrectly. It is the subject of a great deal of concern. People will feel they are not properly covered when the legislation is enacted. In the current climate in which insurance companies are making vast amounts of money while awards and premiums are being reduced, the matter requires further consideration. The system the Minister intends to introduce is not in place in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing is being changed. I will speak to the Senator on the matter after the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>A cap is being introduced and Fine Gael will not support it until it has received further clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the introduction of the Bill. Since first being elected to the Seanad and becoming transport spokesperson, the main issue that has dominated most of our debates is road safety. Through <Col N="2100"/>successive Ministers and Ministers of State we have had various debates and statements on all aspects of road safety and it is welcome that the culmination of that debate is the presentation of a Bill because our role here is to enact legislation relating to issues we regard as being of importance in society. There has been much discussion with people from all sides of the House who gave their views in terms of their personal experience and the experience in various constituencies throughout the country. The introduction of the legislation is therefore especially welcome at this time. The Bill is part of a package of measures and a series of transport Bills and strategy statement documents that will ultimately bring about the change in culture we all want and which we hope will result in a considerable reduction in loss of life on the roads.</P>
      <P>The main theme of the Bill is road safety. We are all aware of the numbers of deaths on our roads. Few families have not been affected in some way by a road accident. When we consider road accidents we tend to concentrate on road deaths but it must be remembered that fewer people are being injured on our roads. We tend to concentrate on the number of deaths but the reduction in the number of people seriously injured or maimed for life is very welcome. That is an area on which we must concentrate. It is also important to ensure that with a reduction of accidents on our roads there is a corresponding reduction on the burden on accident and emergency units in our hospitals, something with which we are all familiar and which is discussed here regularly in terms of health Bills and health issues generally.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the progress made in recent years in tracking road deaths. Success in this area has been underpinned by the launch of the national road safety strategy which sets out clearly the Government&rsquo;s agenda until 2006 in terms of the type of approach it intends to take and the results that are expected. I congratulate the Minister of State and the Department officials on the progress that has been made. I acknowledge also the progress made by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor.</P>
      <P>The downward trend in fatalities continued in 2003 when the lowest number of fatalities since 1963 was recorded &mdash; approximately 336. That is particularly welcome. I realise there has been a blip this year to some extent but we must examine the question of road deaths over a wider sample period. It is not necessary to look at it on a year by year basis. It must be examined on a three to five year cycle and the road strategy document reflects that.</P>
      <P>The successor to the initial strategy was published recently and its primary target is to realise a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006. That would mean there would be no more than 300 deaths per year by the end of 2006. It is probably wrong to say &ldquo;no more than 300 deaths&rdquo; because any death on our roads is tragic when one considers the consequences for the <Col N="2101"/>family involved and the knock-on effect on our health service and insurance sector.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a number of initiatives covering fixed charges and penalty point systems introduced under the Road Traffic Act 2002, focusing in particular on the out-sourcing of certain functions relating to fixed charge payments from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I welcome that because for too long we talked about the difficulties associated with the garda&iacute; in that many of them are involved in administrative duties. That is not good in terms of their career development or the delivery of the service, which is their primary function. They must be seen to be active in society. That initiative will be welcomed both by garda&iacute; and the wider society.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new Garda traffic corps and the increased Garda numbers will do much to deter people from drink driving, which is without doubt one of the primary factors in the number of road fatalities. The introduction of the Bill before Christmas &mdash; Senator Burke also raised this issue &mdash; may be lost on people among the myriad other activities taking place at this time. I hope that the passing of the Bill in the run in to Christmas may focus people&rsquo;s attention on a safer approach to the use of their cars and that they will not use them while under the influence of alcohol, something that becomes particularly difficult in the Christmas period. I also hope the heightened awareness associated with the regular campaigns that take place at this time of the year and the fact that the Bill, having passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas, will be enacted will focus some attention on it.</P>
      <P>The focus of the Government&rsquo;s policy is on the key areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing to reduce the number of deaths but we must also consider the injuries that occur as a result of road accidents. We should concentrate on reducing the number of accidents rather than focusing on the deaths, although I realise one follows from the other but people fail to realise the enormous damage associated with injuries, the cost to the families and people involved and the cost and burden on the health service.</P>
      <P>Through the continued high level of direct Garda enforcement it is envisaged that by the end of the period of the road strategy in 2006, at least 50% of the overall vehicle fleet will pass through a speed check each month. As the national fleet of registered vehicles numbers over 1.85 million, this will require an annual number of checks of approximately 11.1 million. That is a huge move away from the current position and it is a target the Government has set itself. It will be difficult to reach it but I have no doubt it will be reached, and it is something that will be welcome in an overall context.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of issues regarding the presence of garda&iacute; on our roads. While the operations of the Garda fall outside the remit of the Department of Transport, it is worth mentioning them. I have long held the view that many road fatalities tend to take place late at night in rural <Col N="2102"/>or semi-rural areas. They tend not to be on our highways where most of the concentration of detection has taken place. We would be well served by ensuring there is a greater level of Garda activity in our villages and county towns throughout the country in the late and early hours of weekends. The issue of young people coming out from discos, getting into high-powered cars and attempting to drive home while under the influence of alcohol, and even drugs, and the element of showing off that goes on has caused many deaths on the road. That must be addressed. Policing those areas in a concentrated and focused way would have a significant impact on changing behaviour. Similarly, the presence of highly visible garda&iacute; patrolling villages and towns late at night would act as a deterrent to those people and could be the key to stopping them attempting to drive home. Many of the young people involved could get taxis home because the number of taxis in rural Ireland is far greater than was the case when I was growing up. That is something that should be focused on. It is about changing that culture and taking those young people out of harm&rsquo;s way.</P>
      <P>There is also a necessity to examine the culture of driving among young males in particular who are often referred to in the tabloids as the boy racers. The Government will have to address that problem in some way, whether by dealing with the size of engine they can be licensed to drive or the State insisting that some type of governing mechanism is placed on the engines to ensure they cannot go above a certain speed. That is a topic that needs further discussion. Sufficient emphasis cannot be placed on the issue of policing in rural areas. Policing such areas would act as a deterrent and it would be a confidence building measure for people who are intimidated by congregations of young people in villages and towns late at night when discos and bars close. Good policing would lead to good behaviour in the community and it would prevent tragic accidents on our roads. I am too familiar with this having witnessed many young people&rsquo;s lives being taken in road accidents in my own county, Clare; alcohol and drugs have played a role in them. Many of these accidents occur late at night on rural, unimproved roads. No matter how many speed cameras are put in place, such roads will not be policed, and, therefore, the policing of these areas needs to be examined. That will help to change behaviour and it will be a vital element in the delivery of the targets set by the Minister.</P>
      <P>We all need to drive more carefully and slowly during the forthcoming festive period. Senator Paddy Burke referred to people&rsquo;s annoyance when they are stuck behind other cars. However, none of us should tailgate and we should give ourselves and the car in front more space. We must be alert to more vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, the young and the elderly. I am no angel in this regard as I rush to and from meetings and to and from Dublin and I get caught up in my own little world. <Col N="2103"/>I have often overtaken a car on my way to Dublin but as I arrived in Dublin the same car was there almost as soon as I was.</P>
      <P>We must find further ways to instil in our young people at an early age the importance of responsible driving. I am not sure whether that should be a feature of the school curriculum. While pupils who leave school and attend universities may be qualified to study, they are not educated about the basics in life. When they buy cars, they have not had training in this regard in school. Conveyancing is another issue for young people.</P>
      <P>The Irish School of Motoring in conjunction with Mondello Park race track recently launched a new initiative to teach young people to drive responsibly and to promote education on the dangers of speeding. That is the way we should go and I hope the Minster of State will open discussions with the Minister for Education and Science in this regard. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been involved in the programme to which I refer but there should be a crossover between Departments.</P>
      <P>Under the national safety strategy 2004-06 the enforcement of the drink driving laws will result in one in four vehicles being screened on an annual basis. Senator Paddy Burke and others referred to metrification, which is an important issue, as is the North-South divide. Penalty points were introduced in this State and there is a similar system in the UK but the unification of those systems is important. There is a great deal of concern because Northern drivers have little, if any, regard for speed limits and the Garda is unable to follow up on speeding charges, which should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke also referred to the insurance issue. I had discussions with the representatives of the Law Society who say it has no impact on solicitors. There is concern, however, about the balance between what a driver is legally required to be insured for and their potential ultimate liability. The Department has suggested that because such a small number of cases are involved, the issue is not relevant. If so, why are insurance companies pushing the case that it could ultimately prevent them from providing cover? They take an actuarial perspective and if the insurance shortfall is of such little significance to the person who is to be insured, why are insurance companies prevented from covering the shortfall? Hopefully, the Minister of State will allay our fears in this regard and perhaps we will discuss it further on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about people who use high occupancy vehicles and buses because they might have to pass on the cost of the increased insurance to the users of their services so that if they have an accident, they are covered. They will have to provide the cover from their own reserves. I seek the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on this.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Norris.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the changeover to metrification. I went metric 15 years ago and I am not allowed to let the old imperial measurements pass my lips. I have become much taller and lighter than I was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a great deal in common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I will concentrate on the scandal of deaths on the road. While I agree with much of Senator Dooley&rsquo;s contribution, I disagree with his repetition of the Department&rsquo;s mantra that the recent increase in the number of road deaths, which followed the decrease caused by the introduction of penalty points, is a blip. We found the way to resolve this scandal but we have lost our way since. Drivers copped on that they would not be caught because the penalty points system was not being enforced. The number of road deaths has returned to previous levels and unless it is accepted that the answer is in our hands, we will have work to do.</P>
      <P>It is vital to cut through the waffle and get to the truth. People will change their behaviour only if they think they stand a good chance of being caught. Unless the law is enforced consistently, the way people drive will not change. All our effort should be put into enforcing the law. The penalty points experience has demonstrated that the magic bullet is people&rsquo;s belief that they will get caught. Nothing else matters and that is why I welcome the Bill with considerable reservations.</P>
      <P>Urgent legislation is needed to underpin the change to the metric system, which is due to take place at the end of January but I deplore the fact that the Bill contains nothing about random breath testing or the rollout of a nationwide network of speed networks and does not make it an offence to use a mobile telephone while driving.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State would have us believe that all of these issues are in the works, that he has had urgent consultation with the Attorney General about the legal difficulties and that they will all be included in next year&rsquo;s promised Bill. The scorn poured on all these assurances in the other House is due to the fact that we have heard it all before. We have been listening to promises on imminent action for approximately six years, ever since the first road safety strategy was launched with great fanfare.</P>
      <P>We have heard the same from the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors. The Minister of State is new to his job so he does not have to take the blame. He can make these assurances with a straight face and, I am sure, with great sincerity. He certainly has the intention to change the system. However, he does not seem to realise that the system with which he is dealing is highly resistant to change. He does <Col N="2105"/>not fully appreciate the enormous frustration created by these endless delays. Meanwhile, more people get injured and more die. More accidents happen because people believe that they can get away with behaviour that is highly destructive, both to themselves and others.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has got into the habit of repeating the mantra that the cure for road deaths lies in people&rsquo;s behaviour. This is true up to a point, but it cannot be used as a way of escaping responsibility. The truth is that the Government has in its hands the only lever that will get people to change their behaviour, namely, the rigorous implementation of the law. To have that lever and not use it is not only negligent, but criminal.</P>
      <P>As we heard from Senators Paddy Burke and Dooley, we need to police the roads where most of the accidents happen, not the motorways or dual carriageways, but the narrow country roads that are real death traps. We need to police these blackspots at the times of most risk, late at night and in particular at weekends. The irony is that such implementation as we have is focused on the wrong places at the wrong times. It is this problem we need to consider.</P>
      <P>For years we have been promised a dedicated Garda traffic corps and there are now signs of this happening. Even if we get it, will it be properly deployed or will we hear the same old argument about overtime over and over again?</P>
      <P>I have become convinced that the answer to our implementation problem is a proper nationwide network of speed cameras. I called for this in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 September. Speed cameras could be put in the right places to work all the time. They will not look for overtime either. When we get the network of cameras, if ever, they must be seen to work. We must remember that it is not enough to simply put them in place.</P>
      <P>After publication of my article, I was shocked to learn that almost half of the cases recorded by existing cameras never made it to court because of technical problems that made the evidence useless. This illustrates the half-hearted way we approach implementation of road traffic law. Cameras are a solution and we have it in our hands to do something about this. It will cost us but the return on investment in cameras and ensuring they work is significant. Our half-hearted approach has gone on too long and caused too many deaths.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to break the mould and become the first in this area to focus on getting things done. I feel so strongly about this because I believe we have the answer in our hands. We can make it work and reduce deaths on the road. Numbers of deaths were down immediately after the introduction of penalty points, but as soon as the public realised the system was not being enforced the number of deaths rose again. Let us seize the opportunity now to do something.</P><Col N="2106"/>
      <P>Senator Dooley also suggested that an all-Ireland penalty point system is essential. I travel quite a lot and it is clear that cars from Northern Ireland ignore the speed limit south of the Border.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also evident that we ignore the limit when we cross the Border. We have all-Ireland food safety and tourism schemes, so let us ensure we have one for speed limits also. We have the power in our hands and I urge the Minister to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time. He takes a serious view of the matter and has published an important article on it.

It is easy for the Minister and the Minister for State to talk as they have drivers, but I speak as an ordinary motorist.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with much of what Senator Quinn and others said about changing behaviour. There has been a dramatic drop in penalty points pursuit, but when accident numbers increase this is described as a blip. Senator Quinn said it is more serious and that people do not take penalty points seriously. I do not agree. It is because nobody has the slightest respect for the speed limits. Why should they? They are daft, incoherent, inconsistent and do not deserve respect.</P>
      <P>I can give examples from the Stillorgan Road, Ballyfermot, dual-carriageways and motorways where speed limits change from 70 mph to 60 mph to 50 mph to 30 mph arbitrarily wherever and where the little policeman stands under the bridge with the gun. I do not suggest he or the Garda is making money, but they are making convictions which is important from the point of view of promotion and advancement. They are making money not for themselves but for the <Col N="2107"/>county councils that have instituted these unfair and unjustifiable alterations in the speed limit.</P>
      <P>I approve the direction this Bill is taking because the Minister of State is trying to get national coherence and consistency. Well done on that. However, to be honest, the need for this Bill is because nobody in his or her right mind would have any respect for the speed limits as they exist. Currently there are legal ways around the issue of speed limits and this undermines the penalty point system.</P>
      <P>The motorist or customer also has entitlements. The Minister should introduce a system where there is a mandatory requirement where it is intended to prosecute for notice of such intent to be served within 60 days of the offence. It is unfair to send out such notices six months after an offence. That is wrong, bad practice and further undermines and erodes respect. Ultimately, we will only get a decrease in deaths and dangerous driving if we win the respect of people when imposing penalties. I agree with the penalty system and believe it will work and concur with Senator Quinn and others that an all-Ireland system is necessary.</P>
      <P>I now wish as a grammarian to take issue with the Minister of State with regard to the plague of prepositions creeping into the English language. His speech states: &ldquo;This essentially equals to 50 mph&rdquo;. It does not. It &ldquo;equals 50 mph&rdquo; or &ldquo;is equal to 50 mph&rdquo;. This is as bad as another example from his speech which I would like to squash, namely, &ldquo;comprises of&rdquo;. Things &ldquo;are comprised of&rdquo; or &ldquo;comprise&rdquo;. Let us drive these prepositions back into their caves where they belong. I hope they will be deleted from the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech in future.</P>
      <P>To return to the 70 mph or 120 km/h speed limit, what I like about this is that it will be standard. Before Cyprus joined the European Union that was the limit there. Not all cars are marked in kilometres as well as miles. Is there something we can do about this? Is there some kind of flexible Perspex that could be placed over speedometers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>There is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is excellent. It is good to have something so that people with older cars can apply it so that they know what speed they are travelling in kilometres per hour.</P>
      <P>What a diplomat we have in the Minister of State, Deputy Callely. He says that the concept that decisions relating to the application of special speed limits should be taken by the major local authorities was introduced through the Road Traffic Act 1994. He states: &ldquo;Such decisions are reserved to elected members. This devolution of power from the Minister to members of local authorities has served us well.&rdquo; No it has not, it has been a disaster. They have not served us well. If they had, the Minister would not be changing the regulations but he is too diplomatic to say it. <Col N="2108"/>He does not want to get the backs of councillors up. He is right to take this attitude. However, I want to put on record that they have not served us well at all. They have made a pig&rsquo;s ear of the entire thing.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State went on to say that there is a provision in the section to the effect that the Minister can issue guidelines. This is excellent but it is too vague. Is it possible for the Minister to publish these guidelines or lay them before the House? In particular, the Oireachtas should have a look at the first issue of guidelines. It would be a good thing if they could be laid before both Houses.</P>
      <P>Included among the reasons for reduced speed limits is a school in the vicinity. I have driven in situations where there was a school on the other side of a roadway with a concrete wall which a grown-up hairy adult like myself could not get over but it was used as an excuse to vary the speed limit. I agree with the principle but speed limits have to be justifiable and real. If they are real, people will observe them.</P>
      <P>I have tried to observe the speed limit on what used to be called the Naas Road. I have driven in the slow lane at bang on the speed limit where I have been passed out in the fast lane by a lorry and, simultaneously, by a private vehicle on the hard shoulder. They blew their horns, drove right up behind and flashed their lights as if to say, &ldquo;What are you doing, driving at the speed limit?&rdquo; This is because sometimes there is inconsistency and incoherence. If the Minister of State produces good guidelines that are coherent and consistent and indicates to the Oireachtas what they are, then we will improve the situation. I urge him to do it, even in the diplomatic and occasionally slightly ungrammatical terms he has laid before the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I rushed to the House but Members will be pleased to hear I was not driving. I welcome the Bill. It contains many issues about which I am concerned.</P>
      <P>One issue of concern relates to fixed penalty charges and when, where and how they are imposed and recorded. When penalty points are imposed, there is no collation of the information relating to time, location or zone. We do not know how many thousands of penalty points have been amassed in certain areas. This matter must be examined. I have not had an opportunity to check the transcript of a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport earlier this year which addressed the issue, but I am fairly sure that a Garda representative stated &mdash; I am open to correction on this &mdash; that penalty points are not imposed after 2 a.m. That is also the time of night when the majority of single vehicle road fatalities occur. We are all too well aware of the number of such fatalities, especially at weekends involving young male drivers.</P>
      <P>A brave step needs to be taken, similar to the one taken by the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in regard to the <Col N="2109"/>smoking ban. People said it would not be accepted and would not catch on but it has become very much accepted practice. It was a very daring step for a Minister to adopt and it has worked. We have to get to the stage that when people get behind the steering wheel of a car they realise the dangers they pose to others if they are not responsible. In that regard, the time has come for random drug and drink testing. It would generate considerable public debate if a Minister were to take that step. I believe such a move would find favour with the vast majority of people. I urge the Minister of State to consider such a forward-looking step. Other Ministers have implemented far-reaching measures which people thought would not happen. In his contribution, Senator Quinn said this is within our grasp.</P>
      <P>The Government has been highly successful in the area of insurance reform. Insurance premiums are collapsing because of actions taken by the Government. We do not read about this in the national press because it is good news. The Government needs to take a serious look at how we are addressing the issue of road safety. There is an onus on Members to encourage the Minister to look seriously at this area, when one considers the number of people that are killed on our roads and the number of families that are affected.</P>
      <P>Another concern which has been brought to my attention by many constituents is that of foreign nationals driving cars on our roads. I do not know if their cars are insured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if they are even taxed. There are thousands of them on the roads. I personally know of foreign nationals who fly home to bring back cars across the Continent from Latvia or wherever else. They probably have some type of insurance but I very much doubt if it is adequate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of metric standardisation on road traffic signs. I hope for an improvement in the situation now that county councils will be given the responsibility for reviewing road traffic signs. There is a ridiculous situation on the Navan Road where I live. On the Ashtown end of this perfectly good dual carriageway the speed limit varies from 30 mph to 40 mph to 50 mph and 60 mph. I have been driving on this road for two decades and have yet to witness a car crash. However, I see garda&iacute; on point duty on the 40 mph zone and 50 mph zone. We must examine how penalty points are imposed. Given that there is major concern about how the system is being implemented, perhaps the Minister of State would commit to seriously examining the issue. For example, penalty points are issued in groups of two in respect of speeding and so on; they are not applied in uneven numbers. If uneven numbers of penalty points were applied in respect of certain locations such as accident black spots throughout the country, it <Col N="2110"/>would have a two-fold effect in that the motorist would be informed that he or she is entering a more dangerous area and, more importantly, it would inform us how many groups of three penalty points were being imposed. We would then know if these areas are being policed or not, without the use of fantastic technology or great expense.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to relax the imposition of penalty points in cases where motorists are caught travelling at 5 mph in excess of the minimum 30 mph speed limit. For example, if a driver was caught travelling at 5 mph in excess of the limit, he or she would not have penalty points imposed, but might instead receive a fixed penalty fine. At present, people are behaving like clock-watchers; they are watching their speedometers as they drive to see what speed they are doing and are braking and accelerating as they pass through different speed limits. We cannot continue through the two or three years of the remaining term of the Government while the numbers of road fatalities rise to see what will happen in a year&rsquo;s time. The Department will quite rightly state that it has passed responsibility for speed limits to local authorities. Nonetheless, there is a case to be made for root and branch reform and a stock take on where we are in this regard.</P>
      <P>One could examine this issue another way in that, because of the increasing level of car ownership, the number of deaths should also increase correspondingly. In that context, our road safety strategy is working to some extent because the number of cars on the road has increased dramatically, while fatalities on the roads have not increased to the same extent. I urge the Minister of State to examine this issue. I am delighted to see that local authorities can now provide for new speed limits in the vicinity of schools and residential estates.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech and would like him to explain his remarks in regard to the unlimited liability in terms of car insurance. Where does that issue come from and how has it arisen? When I insure my car, will I be able to do a price check and request a certain level of unlimited liability?</P>
      <P>I recognise that this Bill deals with many areas of activity. However, I have doubts and have made several public comments about the policing of penalty points and how they are imposed. At one point, I was told it would be too costly to correlate the time, zone and locations but that should not be the case. If we are to have confidence in the system, we need to be given that information. One of the reasons I am seeking to have introduced the imposition of odd numbers of penalty points is so that we can see that dangerous locations are being policed properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of my colleague, Senator McCarthy, who intended to take this Bill but unfortunately had to attend to a matter in Cork. I welcome my constituency col<Col N="2111"/>league, the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to the House. I do not think I have had an opportunity to congratulate him on the record before, which I now do.</P>
      <P>I am bothered by section 34 of the Bill which deals with the issue of unlimited liability and a proposed cap. The purpose of this section is not at all clear. I have read the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution and I know what was said on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il. However, it does not make sense. There are two ways in which the Minister of State could have sought to deal with the acknowledged problem of large or excessive awards putting pressure on the insurance industry. He could seek to prevent the courts from awarding damages in excess of a certain amount for property or injury to the person, in regard to which I have heard argument that to do so would have constitutional implications and could conceivably be ruled to be unconstitutional. However, it would at least make sense within a certain context. Although I appreciate it is an enabling provision, what is proposed in this section does not seem to make a great deal of sense.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the insurance companies will only cover a certain amount of an award. For the sake of argument, the Minister could make regulations, with the consent of the Oireachtas, to put a cap of &euro;1 million on damages which would be awarded for personal injuries. However, nothing in the section prevents the courts from making an award considerably in excess of that, for example, the courts could award &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million. That liability attaches in the first instance to the insured person &mdash; the defendant. His or her insurance company will pay out the first &euro;1 million in damages but he or she is still personally liable for the rest.</P>
      <P>This seems to undermine the whole basis of our insurance system because we seek and receive insurance believing it gives us cover against any cases which could be taken against us if we are guilty of negligence. However, if the insurance company will only cover one for a certain amount and one must cover any amount in excess, it will give rise to considerable concern. It is not alarmist to suggest that it is perfectly possible for someone to force the sale of another person&rsquo;s house in order to fork over the additional damages. This seems unfair and goes to the heart of our insurance system. Moreover, it is not just the defendant who would be placed in difficulty; the plaintiff would also be in difficulty.</P>
      <P>In regard to the most serious cases, I presume the cap is intended to be relatively high. These will involve, for example, people who have been be disabled, paralysed or rendered quadriplegic. It is generally acknowledged that while our awards for lesser injuries in this country tend to be relatively high, the awards the courts make for more serious injuries tend to be closer to the international norm. It is possible that someone who genuinely required extensive care and medi<Col N="2112"/>cal attention into the future would not be able to recover sufficient funds to cover his or her medical expenses and care requirements. In this situation, the defendant has an exposure because he or she has a liability which he or she may not be able to discharge without selling his or her house or other assets and the plaintiff, the more seriously injured, would be in a situation in which he or she could not guarantee being able to look after himself or herself into the future because the damages he or she is able to recover were not sufficient.</P>
      <P>Before we legislate for something as fundamental as this and injure and do damage to the insurance system and the concept of insurance in the process, we need to be very satisfied as to why we are doing so. No cogent case has been made as to why we should. The Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution referred simply to the solvency of the insurance system and insurance companies and their requirements in terms of reinsurance and so on, while at the same time he stated that this provision did not come from the industry. I was interested to read a report in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which referred to a recent debate when prominent individuals in the insurance industry and others such as Ms Dorothea Dowling, whose views we respect on this matter, addressed this issue to a greater or lesser extent. They seem to indicate the problem is not serious, and in so far as there was a serious problem, this measure was not required to deal with it. What will be the effect of this measure? It seems a little strange that if it will deal only with the relatively small number of high awards, presumably it will not be of great benefit to the industry. The bulk of awards are relatively small, although we might consider them to be over-generous but will not be affected by the cap. In many cases the more serious accidents are most deserving of the damages that are awarded.</P>
      <P>I am very open to the idea that we change the way in which awards are made. Rather than making lump sum awards, there is merit in giving an annual award to cover care and the actual costs incurred. I appreciate that the courts are not very keen on this idea because it would involve substantial administrative costs and they would like to draw a red line under such an exposure. However, in terms of justice and fairness, it has a great deal to recommend it. I get a sense from the language the Minister of State has used that he is not totally wed to this idea. Perhaps we could have a more detailed discussion on it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of a new system of speed limits, particularly the distinction being made between regional and national roads. While the Minister of State and I both live in the city, my good lady wife is from north Clare. Having driven the roads from Lisdoonvarna to Ennistymon and Doolin on more occasions than I care to count, the idea of a 60 mph speed limit on bad roads is foolish. Reducing the speed to the equivalent of 50 mph is welcome and the distinction <Col N="2113"/>between national and regional roads is sensible and is something we should have introduced some time ago. There is a cogent case for making such decisions at local level. I know there is a requirement to seek the consent of the National Roads Authority to changes of the speed limits, and I accept that, but we must acknowledge that local councillors and the local county or city manager knows best. It is good that this is underpinned in the Bill. We must address local circumstances with a measure of flexibility and I know that flexibility is in-built in the Bill.</P>
      <P>From my experience of driving in France on holidays, the speed limit is lower when weather conditions are bad or it is raining. I am not sure if this has statutory effect, but I assume it does. In France the speed limits are 130 km/h in normal conditions and 110 km/h when the weather is not good. This common sense approach has a self-evident appeal. Will the Minister of State consider it and respond to it when he gets the opportunity?</P>
      <P>I welcome the power given to city and county managers to set limits for road works, particularly for one-off events. I am glad that we are eventually tackling the metrification of the system. Although this has been flagged, there has been little publicity regarding it. I understand, and the Minister of State may correct me if I am wrong, that it is intended to implement it in a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; approach in January. However, I am not sure it is correct to only give a few weeks&rsquo; notice regarding the implementation of this measure so soon after Christmas when people&rsquo;s minds are elsewhere. I know that one may announce things as many times as one wants but until it happens people will not pay much attention. This is an important issue where a significant publicity campaign run by the Government and by the Department is clearly mandated and required. While there has been some publicity in the past few days, we must make considerably more effort in the next month or so if this is to happen smoothly. I know there is provision in the Bill for transitional arrangements but I am not totally clear as to how that will work.</P>
      <P>I drive a very old Japanese imported car where the speedometer is calibrated in kilometres per hour. One gets used to it in a matter of weeks. I appreciate that some among us are more resistant to metrification and it may take them longer. We should not opt for a long transitional period. We should require as soon as possible, if not immediately, that new cars being imported into the country or being constructed here in part have only metric calibration.</P>
      <P>People will become familiar with the metric measure very quickly, if needs must. It is not unusual to see road signs showing distances in imperial measures and others in metric measures. It is almost an Irish joke when one sees a sign for a destination with &ldquo;5&rdquo; and a small &ldquo;km&rdquo; written beside it and further down the road a sign shows &ldquo;3&rdquo; with no calibration on it. We can appreciate what it means, but visitors do not know that a <Col N="2114"/>white sign is an imperial measurement and a green sign is the metric measurement, and this causes confusion.</P>
      <P>It is now 27 years since we first introduced metrification and we should put in place an accelerated programme of removing signs showing imperial measurements as soon as possible. It is holding us up to ridicule in a fashion that is avoidable and we should simply stop it.</P>
      <P>My primary purpose in speaking today was to address the issue of insurance. I trust we will have an opportunity to have a detailed debate on it on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, and his officials to the House. This is my first opportunity to wish him well in his new position.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State outlined in his detailed speech on the introduction of the Road Traffic Bill 2004, its main purpose is to promote further improvements in road safety and to provide for the introduction of a new system of metric speed limits. The Bill provides for changes to the administration of the fixed charge system for traffic offences, including the introduction of a specific provision to facilitate the outsourcing of certain administrative functions currently undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is a very welcome development that garda&iacute; will be redeployed from desk and administrative duties as it frees them to pursue other areas of law enforcement. There are provisions in the Bill to address issues identified in a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the administration of the fixed charge system.</P>
      <P>The Bill introduces a number of other initiatives, including a ban on the sale of vehicles to minors. Measures will be introduced to stop a garage or private individual from selling a mechanically propelled vehicle to anyone under 16 years of age. However, a 16 year old is entitled to hold a licence for a motorcycle under a certain cc and perhaps this should be re-examined. It should be specified that cars should not be purchased by anybody under 17 years of age because persons under 17 years of age are not entitled to drive nor are they permitted to obtain a provisional driving licence.</P>
      <P>The adoption of the first national road safety strategy six years ago has been followed by a distinct improvement in road safety performance. That improvement has been particularly linked to the introduction of the penalty points system in October 2002. Credit should also be given to the national car test, the NCT, which has been responsible for putting dangerous mechanically propelled vehicles off the road. The Bill promotes a new system of speed limits and the outsourcing of functions relating to the fixed charge system, which is directly linked to the penalty points system, should further sustain that improved performance. I welcome the introduction of the conversion to kilometres per hour and the Minister of State has outlined the new limits to the House. <Col N="2115"/>The main changes to result from these proposals will be the replacement of the current general speed limit which applies to non-motorway rural roads with separate speed limits for the national and non-national roads. I welcome that the Bill provides for elected members of county and city councils to retain the power to make speed limits by-laws to provide for the development of special speed limits. Public representatives are aware of the condition and types of roads in their areas and what speed limit should apply to those roads. The range of special speed limits available to local authorities will be from 120 km/h to 30 km/h, which is from 75 mph to 19 mph.</P>
      <P>I agree with some previous speakers who stated that 20 January 2005 is a little soon for the implementation of this legislation and I ask the Minister of State to consider instead 1 March or 1 April 2005. I welcome the fact that a comprehensive education programme has been developed and that both the print and broadcast media will carry notices announcing the change in the system. Has the Minister of State any plans to promote the change in schools because young people are very good at educating their parents, as he will know? Such a programme would be helpful from junior certificate year and upwards.</P>
      <P>As a resident of the Border area, I am very aware that Northern-registered cars have no concern for other road users. I have no hesitation in saying they are a danger and a disgrace. I am pleased that there will be what I hope are huge signs stating that 120 km/h does not mean 120 mph because Northern drivers are used to miles per hour. I urge the Minister of State to speak to his counterpart in Northern Ireland and progress the introduction of an all-island penalty points system. Northern drivers show complete disregard for our laws and I live right next to them.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Quinn that we show the same disregard in the North. The Northern system is very strict and if people from the Republic are caught speeding there, their cars can be taken from them. It might be no harm if we started doing that here also.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with the use of radar guns which is to be welcomed. This was the subject of a court challenge. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently finalising development of a new IT system for the processing of fixed charge fines which is to be welcomed. I question the need to outsource this system and wonder why we cannot do it ourselves. What savings are made by outsourcing because I assume that to be the main reason for it?</P>
      <P>The Bill also features an extension of the powers available to the Garda to seek the presentation of a person&rsquo;s driving licence where a person is suspected of having committed a traffic offence. A person is currently obliged to carry his or her licence and is allowed a certain number of days to produce it at a Garda station. Will the Minister of State clarify if this will still be the case?</P><Col N="2116"/>
      <P>Like other speakers I am a little confused about the insurance aspect of this Bill and I ask for more clarification. I firmly believe that a person convicted in a court of not having insurance, even on the first occasion, should be suspended from driving for a period of time rather than being fined. The amount of hardship and damage caused to somebody who happens to be in collision with a person who is not insured is outrageous. A family car can be written off by somebody without insurance and the consequences for that family are very serious and can last for years.</P>
      <P>It might be helpful to make it compulsory to drive with vehicle lights on. I ask the Minister of State to consider this because it is a great help when driving and it should be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to my queries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to this debate and wonder if the title of the Bill is a misnomer and should instead be the speed limit Bill. The contributions to the debate have proved that the essential components of road legislation such as speed cameras and random breath testing could have been incorporated into a serious Road Traffic Bill. Senator Wilson referred to a concern of mine, the lack of knowledge about the introduction of the new metric system of speed limits and signs. The Minister of State announced that the changeover to the metric system will entail the provision of over 58,000 metric speed limit signs to serve the 96,000 km of public road network. The 34 city and county councils will commence the changeover of signs at least three days prior to 20 January 2005. I presume there will be uniformity in the road signs and they will not vary from county to county. Are the signs <i>in situ</i> in the county council areas as Christmas approaches and will they be erected before 20 January 2005? Will the Department organise a publicity programme to inform the public about the changeover to the new metric system?</P>
      <P>An excellent means of promotion already exists. Everybody goes to local authority offices to tax their vehicles. A simple insert to accompany notification of road tax being due could be used to inform drivers of the changes. There will be lack of uniformity when it is introduced. We have been discussing movement on political issues in Northern Ireland today. The change to the metric system is a classical example of a change being introduced in the South, while the old system continues to apply in the North. People will have to make mental adjustments as they move between the North and South. It is a pity the North has not adopted the same approach as the South, although there may be impediments to taking a uniform approach.</P>
      <P>People have become more conscious of speed limits in recent times, particularly since the introduction of the penalty points system. Senators have pointed out with regard to the operation of the system that most road tragedies do not take place on national primary routes and motorways. <Col N="2117"/>Unfortunately, the majority occur on county roads. As recent statistics gathered from coroners&rsquo; reports show, many fatal accidents occur between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. and approximately 80% of the deaths investigated involved young people. Many of those driving during these times fall asleep, in many cases due to alcohol. Drivers often wait until after 3 a.m. to drive a vehicle on the basis that the likelihood of meeting garda&iacute; on the road between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. is remote.</P>
      <P>People are annoyed that garda&iacute; are regularly stationed at points where traffic flows are good, such as on the new bypass near Patrickswell, outside Limerick. This approach is akin to catching bees in a honeypot. I have not seen evidence of crashes at that location. Drivers in such locations are not creating traffic hazards. While speed checks at such points may be good for pinpointing speeding drivers, they lack credibility when operated on the Limerick bypass at 8 a.m. on a Sunday morning when the road is quiet, as was the case recently, according to a person with whom I have spoken. I wonder whether they are in operation when serious crashes occur. The Garda needs to examine this issue if the penalty points system is to have credibility.</P>
      <P>Another reason the system has fallen into disrepute is the late issue of speed tickets, which often do not arrive until months after the offence. As Senators will be aware from experience, when one spots detection equipment while driving, one is not sure whether one is driving over the speed limit. One then receives a ticket several months later.</P>
      <P>I understand the reason the administration element is being removed from the Garda and outsourced. As Senators have noted for a long time, if we are to deploy more garda&iacute; on the streets, we will have to devolve administrative functions to outside agencies. This is a valid approach. The Department of Agriculture and Food, for example, has successfully contracted out many administrative aspects of its activities, including aspects of the premium system. Its success could probably be emulated in the area of road traffic.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General damaged the reputation of the penalty points system. It found that the type of information furnished by speed cameras was inadequate. In addition, only three cameras or thereabouts are in place despite the fact that they are probably the greatest deterrent on the roads.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to clarify a matter related to the exemptions from provisions of the Road Traffic Acts for emergency vehicles. The media will focus on incidents in which Ministers or Ministers of State are caught speeding. The exemptions mentioned in the Bill cover drivers of fire brigade vehicles, ambulances and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na driving a vehicle in the performance of their duties. Garda&iacute; are employed as ministerial drivers, while civilian drivers are employed to drive Ministers of State. Section 27 exempts from the requirements of the road traffic <Col N="2118"/>Acts, &ldquo;the use by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a vehicle in the performance of the duties of that member or a person driving or using a vehicle under the direction of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where such use does not endanger the safety of road users&rdquo;. Will this exemption apply to the drivers of Ministers and Ministers of State? Will they have <i>carte blanche</i> to drive at whatever speed they want? I would be concerned if that were the case. If we expect ordinary members of the public to observe speed limits, we must all set an example. It is, therefore, incumbent on Ministers and Ministers of State to set the same example expected of the public. If a Senator or Deputy was caught speeding, the media would focus on giving him or her adverse publicity.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions regarding minors. There are many so-called &ldquo;bangers&rdquo; around. We have a new phenomenon of cars, many of them very old, being offered for sale at the side of the road. I am sure they are sold at nominal prices. The garages are likely to fully comply with the provisions and will not sell bangers to young persons aged under 16 years. However, we are all aware of cases in which the sale of such cars for small sums of money resulted in fatalities. Will the fines prescribed by the legislation be imposed on the individuals who sell such cars?</P>
      <P>The Bill is interesting and addresses a matter of concern to all of us. I seek reassurance that the public will understand the move to metrification and that a proper marketing approach will be adopted.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Bill. The Minister of State, whom I welcome to the House, has important responsibilities. Two of the major issues to arise during the previous general election were road safety, notably the number of fatalities, and the cost of insurance, both of which fall to some degree under the Minister of State&rsquo;s remit.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The main reason for the Bill is to adjust the speed limits and change them to the metric system. While I accept that practice regarding road signs indicating distance is inconsistent, with many of them, particularly on minor roads, still in miles, there is an illogicality about having speed limits indicated in miles and distances indicated in kilometres. We are switching over from a system common to these islands to a system operated on the Continent, which I welcome. It is in some ways similar to the changeover to the euro in 2002. I disagree with my colleague, Senator Wilson, in that I believe January to be a good month for changeovers of this kind. In any case, these measures must be planned well in advance and my advice to the Minister is to get on with it.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry and others are in the same position as me in that we have older cars. I am a little concerned that older cars clearly indicate speeds in miles per hour, whereas kilometres, if indicated at all, are so faint one would almost cause an acci<Col N="2119"/>dent trying to identify them. One possible angle is for the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to establish some kind of programme to replace dials on older cars. I am not aware that this issue has been covered in discussions and perhaps it should be considered. The general speed limit of 50 km/h is marginally greater than 30 mph. Those of us who sometimes feel constrained by the 30 mph limit will now get an extra one or two miles per hour. The general speed limit on regional and local roads is utterly absurd, and should be 60 mph. Far better roads often have a lower speed limit.</P>
      <P>I generally favour local authorities having responsibility for speed limits. However, it must be with the consent of the National Roads Authority. Recently there was vast investment in the Glen of the Downs bypass in County Wicklow. This replaced a very indifferent road which had a speed limit of 60 mph. However, the brand new dual carriageway has a reduced speed limit of 40 mph. What was the point of spending all that money on road improvement when the speed limit was cut by a third?</P>
      <P>There is now a facility for dual carriageways which are almost <i>de facto</i> motorways, such as the Watergrasshill bypass, close to Fermoy. There is no good reason that should not have an upper end speed limit. Why must the limit be constrained to 60 mph or 100 km/h? In this regard, we differ from the North, where the general speed limits on dual carriageways is 70 mph. I am glad there will more flexibility in this matter.</P>
      <P>We have adopted an increased speed limit of 120 km/h for motorways. If we vastly improve roads situated away from cities, we should benefit in terms of lower journey times and higher speeds when it is safe to do so. In most of continental Europe, the speed limit on motorways is 130 km/h. In large parts of Germany, where they drive Mercedes and BMWs, the speed limit is 140 km/h, and sometimes unlimited. I am not proposing we should do the same. However, after applying the limit of 120 km/h for a period of time, we should consider increasing it to 130 km/h on motorways close to the Border, or the Monasterevin bypass, or other roads situated far from conurbations.</P>
      <P>On the issue of insurance and road safety, I share some of the doubts expressed by Senator McDowell as to whether to give an enabling power via regulation for the Minister to put caps on liabilities. Should the situation the Minister envisages arise, there should be separate legislation at that time. In an emergency, this provision may allow the Minister some temporary power. However, if a major change of that kind is made, it should be subject to separate legislation put forward at the time before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>There are four or five issues with regard to road safety. The danger of unsafe cars is now being addressed with road testing. Road improvements and the presence of warning signs will deal <Col N="2120"/>with the problem of unsafe roads. Other issues include drink, drugs and sleepiness or tiredness, which is rather underestimated.</P>
      <P>The topic of ministerial cars was raised. Compared to 1981, almost 24 years ago, the number of car accidents these days is far above the average and too high. It is a source of resentment for the general public when officeholders are not subject to the same rules as everybody else. A defence in a case some years ago was that the person had to get to an important function. To the objective observer, some distance from this place, it did not seem as important as that. However, public safety is important. I have been in cars on official delegations abroad and the drivers can be macho in their attitudes which can lead to accidents. As a passenger I was involved in an accident in New York where another passenger was injured for a series of months. Perhaps we should try to do less. It is better to be late temporarily than in the permanent sense.</P>
      <P>The issue of cyclists and motorcyclists being subject to laws has been neglected. It is a source of intense irritation when they break red lights. There is a high level of accidents involving such vehicles. More attention regarding road safety should be paid to the matter.</P>
      <P>I have not studied the Bill sufficiently, but it will hopefully make road safety regulations more watertight, so that district judges do not have the pleasure of throwing out prosecutions on a whim. If members of our Judiciary, in particular at lower levels, showed a bit more commitment to road safety rather than taking pleasure in throwing out as many cases as they can, it would be better for all concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan suggested formalising extra speed limits, in that if one is only 5 mph or 8 km/h above the speed limit, it should be disregarded in terms of penalty points. Such limits cannot be formalised. They must be left to the discretion of the garda&iacute;. If they are formalised them, then <i>de facto</i> the speed limit is raised and everybody will drive at the increased speed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I urge the Minister to work with Northern Ministers to establish a penalty points system for the whole of the island. There may be some political reasons as to why that has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House as well as his sensible Bill. I would like to give him and Members a little bit of information. My faithful 1991 SAAB convertible registers kilometres as well as miles on the dial. Many motor accessory shops sell plastic dials which display speed in kilometres per hour and people can attach them to the dial of their cars.</P>
      <P>An issue of particular interest to me has not been addressed today. I had hoped the matter would be dealt with during my time in the Seanad <Col N="2121"/>but I am now wondering if that will ever happen. When I first became a Member of the Seanad mention was made of the introduction of a driving instructor standards authority. While a voluntary register has been put in place there has been no further progress on the matter. There was a great deal of communication with the Department of Transport some years ago on the introduction of such a register about which the Irish Driving Instructors Association was encouraged. As far as I can recall, the association set up a voluntary register in the 1990s which is part funded by the Department. I have received different estimates on how many driving instructors are registered. I am often told the figure is 90% and other times I am told it is three out of four. This is an important issue.</P>
      <P>Improvements have been made to the driver testing system which now includes a theory test and a practical session. It is important to ensure that those who teach others to drive have a formal education in that area. While some instructors take the matter seriously, the fact they are not required by law to take it seriously is foolish. It is not good for instructors to instil their idiosyncrasies regarding driving into another generation of drivers. I learned to drive during the time when one&rsquo;s mother or father taught one. That was not a desirable way of teaching people to drive. I hope the Minister will introduce such a register soon. Ireland is the only European country which does not have one. While the Irish Driving Instructors Association receives advice from its counterpart in the UK, it is important we introduce a driving instructor standards authority here. I hope that is done fairly soon. I have raised this matter with several Ministers for Transport but to date nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>Members have made important contributions on the Bill. Another issue not mentioned is that of the separation of traffic. The Minister of State spoke of the importance of road-users&rsquo; behaviour. It is difficult for cyclists to be as helpful as they could to motorists when there is not enough space on the road for both. We should separate traffic, particularly in urban areas, wherever we can. Reference was also made to motorcycles. The statistics on accidents-fatalities among motorcycle users are very high. Motorcyclists are extremely vulnerable people. Motorcycles can travel at great speed yet there is little facility which enables them to separate themselves from general road-users.</P>
      <P>Another set of road-users who are not helpful &mdash; I come within this grouping &mdash; are pedestrians. We are a terrible nation of jaywalkers. We tend to always try to cross the road before the next car comes along. Many elderly people are frequently knocked down within ten yards of a pedestrian crossing. Instruction of pedestrians in terms of their responsibilities as road-users would also be helpful. The statistics on pedestrian fatalities involving highly intoxicated people are worrying. Approximately 50% of pedestrians killed on our roads were intoxicated. Senator Norris referred <Col N="2122"/>on the Order of Business to a pub in Marlborough Street which has been closed for three days for serving people who were inebriated. I regret to say it has not yet closed. It appears it will close for three days at its convenience.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may recall the bus driver who drove over a pedestrian who had fallen down in front of a bus in O&rsquo;Connell Street. Pedestrians have a responsibility to consider their safety and that of others. They should not believe they could not be involved in an accident just because they are not behind the wheel of a vehicle. In fact, they could be the people who cause an accident.</P>
      <P>Senator Wilson referred to driving with one&rsquo;s lights on. The Minister should consider the introduction of legislation to make mandatory that one drives, during the winter months, with one&rsquo;s lights on. It is often very difficult, given heavy cloud cover and the shorter day, to see people on the road. I recently drove to and from Belfast via the magnificent new road and noted that motorists, particularly around the Dundalk bypass, were driving without lights quite late in the evening making it quite difficult to see them.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on introducing this Bill. I hope he will be the one to establish a driving instructor standards authority. There would be no major effort required in doing so. The matter is simply being left on the back burner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions of which I have taken note. While some of what has been suggested is not accommodated in the Bill I do not necessarily disagree with the points made. I believe we should try to ensure that much of what is deemed appropriate is included in legislation. However, the Minister and I have only been at the Department of Transport for a short number of weeks following the Government reshuffle. Much of the work on this Bill was in progress and a deadline of midnight on 19 January had been set for the changeover from imperial to metric speed limits. In that regard, we were locked into a time schedule in terms of ensuring the legislation was in place to accommodate the date of change.</P>
      <P>Senator Wilson asked why the changeover is being introduced in January and suggested people may not take notice at this time of year to the media coverage which this issue will receive. While I appreciate it is the festive season this issue is important and people will take note of it. The campaign will continue after the festive season up to and beyond the date of introduction. Also, people are most likely to change their cars in January. A great deal of work has been undertaken by my predecessor with regard to the Society of the Irish Motor Industry. We are a small peripheral island nation and due credit must be given to the SIMI for its work in successfully ensuring that all new cars imported to Ireland will have in place the metric speed system.</P><Col N="2123"/>
      <P>I am unable, in the time available to me, to deal with all the issues raised. Senator Henry asked about the introduction of a driving instructor standards authority. The Government&rsquo;s first road safety strategy provided financial assistance for the voluntary driver instructor register to attain an appropriate quality certificate thereby enhancing confidence in the register. The Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill, providing for the establishment of the authority, was published in July 2004 and Second Stage was taken in the D&aacute;il on 14 October. Good progress has been made in this area.</P>
      <P>I agree with comments expressed on vehicle lights being on during daytime hours, a practice which may be beneficial to road safety. The European Commission has engaged consultants to carry out a study on the effectiveness of daytime running lights. While the practice of daytime running lights can reduce vehicle-to-vehicle accidents in northern Europe, it can also increase the risk for less visible road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. The best approach is to await the conclusion of the EU-sponsored research.</P>
      <P>Several Senators raised the issue of insurance and Senator Morrissey raised it together with the matter of foreign-owned vehicles. Insurance is mandatory for all road-using vehicles, even foreign-owned ones. If a vehicle is not insured, it is liable to the full rigours of the law. Certain measures apply and others will be introduced on the speed of goods vehicles. In accordance with the 1993 road traffic regulations, which give effect to an EU directive relating to speed limits, a goods vehicle with a design gross vehicle weight of over 1200 kg. is required to be fitted with a speed limiter, so it cannot exceed 90 km/h or 55 mph. In accordance with EU Directive 2002/85/EC, this requirement will be extended to further categories of vehicles.</P>
      <P>Driving while under the influence of a substance was also raised. I prefer the term &ldquo;driving under influence resulting from substance misuse&rdquo;, a term familiar to Senator Henry in her professional capacity, rather than &ldquo;driving while intoxicated&rdquo;. The medical bureau of road safety participated in an analysis of blood and urine specimens, provided for the Garda by people suspected of driving while intoxicated. In 2002, 388 specimens were tested, of which 30% tested positive for drugs. In 2001, a two year research programme was conducted in which 2,000 specimens were selected for analysis. Half of those was under the limit for alcohol while the other half was over the limit. Of those samples with zero levels of alcohol, 68% tested positive for one or more drugs.</P>
      <P>Senators asked why there is no mutual recognition of penalty points with Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, this has not been established and it is an issue that should be pursued. Senator Morrissey claimed that penalty points only apply at certain points of the day. This is not correct as penalty points are applicable 24 hours a day. Sev<Col N="2124"/>eral Senators questioned the Bill&rsquo;s proposals on insurance renewal. We are ensuring that people will be re-insured but it has become an issue for the underwriters. It arises from market changes and demands and other issues, such as governance and transparency. Unlimited liabilities did exist but now they have to be stated in a category. We are making an enabling provision but not changing anything. The <i>status quo</i> and how we go about our business will remain. Senator Paddy Burke was particularly concerned about this issue. I invite him to discuss the matter with my officials who will respond to his queries. There is nothing untoward about our proposals in this area. It would be remiss of us to create a situation where people may not be able to obtain insurance renewal. These proposals will ensure that will not arise.</P>
      <P>The issue of the number of injuries and deaths on the roads was raised by all speakers. From my research during my short time in the Department, I have found that, in round figures, the number of cars registered in 1990 was shy of 800,000, while in 2004 the figure was 1.5 million. With the increase in the number of cars on the road and the statistical models available to us, if the Government had not introduced a road safety strategy, deaths on the roads would run to 500 per year. In the early stages of the penalty points system, there was a knee-jerk reaction with a reduction in road accidents and deaths. Having weighed up all the issues, and looking at the current figure for road accidents, I estimate the final figure for 2004 will be in the high 300s. This is 35% lower than the figure we could have had if the road strategy was not introduced. Credit is due to my predecessors in the Department who, for the public good, had the courage to introduce tough measures to reduce road casualties and fatalities. The programme for Government contained a commitment to establish a dedicated Garda traffic corps, which is something we will see the benefit of as we progress. I am especially pleased by the recent announcement to proceed with the establishment of a traffic corps over the next three years. It will be headed by an officer of assistant commissioner rank.</P>
      <P>I hope I have covered the issues raised. The Bill makes provisions on three matters, including speed limits which are to be converted to the metric system to bring us into line with our European counterparts other than the United Kingdom. One might not want continue to adopt some of the same policies as the United Kingdom on European issues. Ireland has been to the forefront, especially in our approach to monetary union which has led to us being seen as a main European player. It is right that we should convert from the imperial to metric system. Whatever the UK decides to do, so be it. Members will have their own minds made up on that. We should be positive on the European position.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>The other matters addressed in the legislation are outsourcing and insurance liability. I look forward to working with Members on Committee <Col N="2125"/>Stage when I will have the opportunity to respond to each matter as we go through the various sections of the Bill. I invite any Member who takes issue with any aspect of the legislation to contact my office to facilitate a smooth Committee Stage debate. I would like to think we could respond positively to anything which might cause a hiccough to ease the passage of the legislation and accommodate Members. I record my appreciation of Members&rsquo; contributions. I have taken notes on them and may be able to respond more positively to what they have said on later Stages.

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for attending to reply to this matter. It is one in which he has an interest. I am hopeful his interest means we will be able to reach a successful conclusion on this very important issue in our area.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware of the need to construct St. Patrick&rsquo;s national school at Diswellstown. For a number of years, the school has been situated in temporary accommodation at St. Mochta&rsquo;s school which has caused a great deal of hardship to parents who must ferry their children to and from that location. It is also leading to traffic congestion on the roads in the area. More importantly, people need to have a school in the area in which they live. The people of Diswellstown have been without one for several years. The same problem exists all over Dublin. In the growing area of Dublin 15, thousands of houses have been built but the infrastructure to service them has not been provided in parallel. The Minister of State knows the problems we have had with delays in providing schools.</P>
      <P>Our concern in Diswellstown is that the site on which the school is to be built has not yet been <Col N="2126"/>purchased by the Department. Perhaps, the Minister of State will give me good news and tell me otherwise today. According to my information the Department is not at fault. If it is the case that the developer has delayed on the delivery of this and other sites in the area, his behaviour should not be tolerated. I hope the information I have is incorrect. As full planning permission has been granted, when will the deal on the site be concluded and when will construction commence to provide the school at the earliest possible date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Terry for raising the matter. I am aware of her great interest in St. Patrick&rsquo;s national school. I share it not only as a Deputy of the Dublin West constituency but as a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Children. I am glad Senator Terry has given me the opportunity to record the current position on the provision of a new school building for St. Patrick&rsquo;s national school in Diswellstown, Dublin 15.</P>
      <P>The school is temporarily located in the former St. Mochta&rsquo;s school building in Porterstown. St. Patrick&rsquo;s will be the second school for the parish. The Department is aware of the urgent need for the new school building. A new 24-classroom facility was listed to proceed to tender and construction as part of the 2004 school building programme and provision was made for it in the Estimates. The date for completion at the time of the funding allocation was September 2005. Officers of the Department have done everything in their power to meet that deadline. Tenders for the detailed design and construction of the new school have been received and are being evaluated by officials. As a matter of law, a tender must be decided on within weeks. Planning permission for the new school was granted by Fingal County Council, but, as Senator Terry will know, this was the subject of a third part appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. I thank Fingal County Council for the expedition with which it dealt with the matter. The board determined the appeal a short time ago and the result was positive from the Department&rsquo;s point of view. Permission to proceed with the building of the school was granted subject to certain modifications to the original plan.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry rightly asked if there had been similar delays by the developer in question in other parts of the city.</P>
      <P>I have looked into that matter and the Department is not aware of any delay, similar to the one in this case, regarding the acquisition of other sites from the vendor in question.</P>
      <P>The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which purchases sites for new schools on behalf of the Department, had identified a suitable site for the new school build<Col N="2127"/>ing. The acquisition of the site has been at conveyancing stage for some time.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the urgent need to build a school on this site. I am very concerned at the length of time it has taken to complete the conveyancing process. I assure the House that the urgent need to complete the necessary formalities has been stressed to the solicitors acting for the vendor.</P>
      <P>The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, which is acting on behalf of the OPW and the Minister for Education and Science, has been waiting for replies from the solicitors to the vendor. I can now confirm to the House that the solicitors to the vendor responded to a number of those queries this afternoon and that a meeting to discuss all other outstanding matters is scheduled for next Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Department is intent on securing the site for the school as soon as possible. When this has <Col N="2128"/>been done, the provision of a school building will proceed as a matter of urgency. The Department will work with the school authorities to put in place alternative strategies to accommodate the pupils, if required, for September 2005. I do not believe any such strategy would necessarily involve the full school year but I thank Senator Terry for raising this issue. Any delay in this matter, since the granting of the planning permission by Fingal County Council last summer, cannot be laid at the door of the Department of Education and Science or the school authorities who have worked hard together to progress this particular project as quickly as possible.</P>
