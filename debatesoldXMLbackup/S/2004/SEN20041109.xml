      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to carry out an urgent review of job losses in Ballinasloe, County Galway, in consultation with local task force groups and other statutory bodies with a view to directing investment in job creation to the town as that was stated to be a priority with this Government since 1999.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 4.30 p.m., on which spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and other Senators ten minutes and of which the Second Stage debate shall continue tomorrow; and No. 2, statements on present public transport facilities in Dublin and future plans, to be taken at 4.30 p.m. until 6.30 p.m., on which spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and other Senators ten minutes, and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements. As regards No. 2, there will be a debate on transport matters as they affect the remainder of the country at a later date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a commitment in the programme for Government to reduce the primary school pupil-teacher ratio to under 20:1 in accordance with international best practice. <Col N="887"/>Everyone is aware that at present 100,000 pupils are in classes of over 30 or more and that 584 are in classes of 40 or more. It appears the Minister has reneged on the commitment to which I referred because at the weekend she referred to it as a &ldquo;noble aspiration&rdquo;. Perhaps the Leader might ask her to clarify the difference between the two. The Minister stated there might not be sufficient teachers to achieve the intended ratio by 2007. The INTO refuted her remarks and stated there are sufficient teachers available.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader might also seek clarification from the Minister in respect of the position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> special needs assistants. The Minister recently announced that 350 additional special needs assistants will be appointed, which is a welcome development. All Members must be frustrated by the fact that the Department of Education and Science is not in a position to respond to requests made on behalf of concerned parents about special needs assistants for their children. It is incumbent on the Department to clarify the current position in order to remove the uncertainty being experienced by pupils and their families. The appointment of 350 additional special needs assistants is worthwhile but I understand from the Department that thousands of them will be required to cope with the demand. It will be interesting to discover the reaction of the Minister for Education and Science in respect of both of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised the matter of class sizes with the Leader last week before the story broke in the media because I was suspicious that a timeframe or schedule had not been provided. I requested that the Minister come before the House to explain the situation because this matter is of interest to Members on both sides. There are many variables with which we must deal at this stage. The reality is that parents who looked forward to their children being in smaller classes, teachers who welcomed the commitment and children who could benefit from it, are all losing out.</P>
      <P>As I stated in the House last week, according to the Central Statistics Office there are now nearly 400,000 pupils in classes of over 20. The Minister maintains there are not enough teachers to implement her plans. There are enough teachers, as clearly evident from the INTO figures. The Minister has stated that one of the reasons there are not enough teachers arises from her plan to put more teachers into the disadvantaged and special needs sectors, which I acknowledge would be welcome. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to outline the supply of and demand for teachers over the next three or four years; her schedule for the implementation of the plan to bring classes to below 20 over the next three or four years; and the capacity to train teachers through the colleges of education, <Col N="888"/>through Hibernia College and also through postgraduate courses. Will the Minister inform the House about conversion courses? Many post-primary teachers without work are interested in converting to primary teaching and specific courses should be made available to them.</P>
      <P>These issues about which we have all received inquiries have been raised with me by Members from all sides of the House over the past year. I have a constituent who has graduated and wants to do a postgraduate course but there is not enough space in Irish colleges because the Government will not support sufficient graduate places. Young Irish men and women are training in the UK and in Northern Ireland. It is crucial we address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>When I was training to be an engineer many years ago, we were taught that the functions of management were to plan, organise, staff and control. Week after week the Government explains about the breach of yet another commitment regarding pupil-teacher ratios in primary schools. In the richest country in Europe, there are currently 100,000 children being taught in classrooms with in excess of 30 pupils.</P>
      <P>The Government seems to be unable to plan for anything. It apparently discovered late that a large number of EU purchasing rules have slowed down the mythological decentralisation. It seems that when it announced the plan it was not aware of the EU purchasing procedure which has to be observed. Will the Government supply the House with some evidence that it knows how to plan, organise and control, because the Comptroller and Auditor General does not think so? In that context, I ask for a debate on schools.</P>
      <P>A question has emerged over the weekend about the priorities of the National Roads Authority. It was believed there was a Government decision that the priority in this context was three major inter-urban routes. It appears now that the new Minister, true to his capacity to create chaos wherever he goes, has decided this is not a good idea and wants inter-regional routes to be prioritised. I wish to lay a small bet that the consequence of inter-regional route prioritising is that the motorway to Waterford will now come to the top of the priority list; of that, I have absolutely no doubt. People trying to do business outside Dublin and people trying to commute from Galway, Cork and Limerick, to Dublin, ought to know whether they can plan for a proper national road network or whether we are now about to go back to the drawing board and start all over again.</P>
      <P>I ask for a debate on the role of regulators in society. The evidence in Britain is that many of the regulators are now costing more than the Departments which were originally supposed to be the regulators. The evidence also is that they have failed gloriously. A recent report in <i>The Irish Times</i> suggests that our telecommunications <Col N="889"/>service providers are among the worst in the world and that Eircom is the best of them, which is an interesting commentary on the rest. Our regulators grow bigger and yet seem to do little to help consumers. Will the Leader inform the House when the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill will be taken again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>While I appreciate that parents are concerned about class sizes, and rightly so, in recent weeks they have also been concerned about the film censor and the somewhat bizarre decisions he has taken. In that context, would the Leader consider it worthwhile to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House? He is the political boss of Mr. Kelleher, who in recent weeks has passed uncut a movie which will now be shown in theatres showing actual sex on screen. Also, in the past few days he has justified giving a 15 PG rating to a Santa Claus movie which RTE rightly highlighted on its main news last night, expressing the concerns of many parents who will be confused coming up to Christmas about the title of a film the content of which is very adult. In both instances, the film censor has justified these decisions rather bizarrely by suggesting that adults should be able to make up their own minds. I have no problem with that, but anybody who goes to cinemas will know that in many cases the people issuing and collecting the tickets are only in their late teens. There are very few instances of enforcement across the country of the existing film censorship laws. I applaud UCI in Dublin which has issued public statements to make parents aware of the mature and adult content of the Santa Claus movie.</P>
      <P>This is not about what appears in the movies but what happens when these films go to video. These films will go directly to video and I know from my experience as a parent of young children that these videos are readily available throughout the country. The law is not being enforced and I ask the Leader to seriously consider inviting the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to discuss the whole question of censorship, not only as it applies to the cinema and theatrical releases but also to video releases for which no classifications are given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments of my colleagues who expressed regret about the announcement by the Minister for Education and Science on the reneging of the commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in national schools. I want to emphasise the area of special needs in education. This is an area on which we had an announcement yesterday, yet we are all familiar with schools throughout the country on which that announcement will not have an effect in terms of the granting of special needs assistants.</P>
      <P>My question relates to a motion which Senator Kenneally tabled for the Adjournment this <Col N="890"/>evening regarding the provision of cancer treatment services throughout the country. Now that we have a new Minister for Health and Children, it would be apt to ask her views on the whole area of cancer treatment. Her predecessor adopted a head in the sand approach to the matter. I am talking particularly about the provision of facilities in the regions. There is not a family in the country that has not been affected in one way or another by cancer. I attended a meeting last night about that issue where it was highlighted that in a previous era, a former Minister for Health, the late Dr. Noel Browne, took stringent action to eliminate TB yet in the post-Celtic tiger era&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator calling for a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;cancer treatment facilities are inadequate throughout the country. The Minister for Health and Children should be asked to come before the House to outline her views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the comments of Senator Mooney on censorship. It has been brought to my attention, since I raised the matter of the use of fireworks last week, that this Hallowe&rsquo;en was the worst in living memory in terms of damage to property, injuries, desecration of graveyards, statues and so on. In addition, the use of repeaters, which are capable of firing up to 50 shots, was highlighted in one of our local newspapers. Young people are holding these repeaters in their hands and firing them at each other. There is no need for me to tell the House how dangerous that is. We make these statements every year. For God&rsquo;s sake can we do something about it so that we might at least notice an improvement next year? I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House and outline what he intends to do in future about this serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a series of debates on Iraq? In the run-up to and early stages of the war in Iraq, the Seanad played a useful role in political life by holding a series of rolling debates during which we constantly monitored the situation. Further debates are necessary because of the assault under way in the city of Falluja. We know 100,000 civilians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Iraq since the beginning of the war. An estimated 50,000 civilians are trapped in the city of Falluja where three hospitals have been bombed. In the past, some bombed out hospitals have been used as operational command centres for the United States army. This is not appropriate, particularly in light of concerns expressed in the House, including by me last week when I stated the position was very dangerous, and by the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, who, having examined the matter, warned against an <Col N="891"/>attack on the city. In addition, e-mails from the commander of the Black Watch regiment suggest 800 Scottish troops were moved for political rather than operational reasons and are exposed to considerable danger.</P>
      <P>Several Senators have placed on record their concerns about sinister operations involving a United States Gulfstream jet specially adapted for the transportation to centres of torture of persons kidnapped by the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Having already sought a debate, I now call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, the number of times the jet in question has landed at Shannon Airport, its purpose, the reason the Garda has not boarded it to ascertain what it is going on and to report back to the House. Details on this matter are on the record.</P>
      <P>I propose that the House note the interesting and useful judgment handed down today in the High Court in the case of two courageous young Irish women, Dr. Katherine Zappone and Dr. Ann Louise Gilligan. The court indicated that the case in question involves a serious matter which remains to be determined by the Supreme Court, namely, the recognition of a marital relationship between two persons of the same sex. I raise the case because the Leader made an excellent suggestion that an all-party committee examine this area in a calm, rational manner. I would be prepared to make available to such a committee drafts of two Bills we have prepared in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Leader for arranging a debate tomorrow on the question of competitiveness and consumer protection. I support a call made by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, in light of his concerns about the issue of rip-off Ireland. I am not sure if he was referring to propaganda by the Fine Gael Party and its website.</P>

	<P>Did the Senator listen to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>For base political reasons, the Fine Gael Party is prepared to sabotage tourism and wash&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may not make statements of that nature. Does he have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael Party has a rip-off Ireland website and is doing damage to the tourism industry through its so-called rip-off campaign.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="892"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a question. The Leader cannot answer for the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>This is rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Fine Gael Party to remove the website and fight the case in the House, rather than on the worldwide web.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame on the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The wish of IKEA, a Swedish furniture group, to locate here has been widely discussed. Ballymun, which has been mentioned as a location, would be a worthwhile site given the important urban regeneration under way in the area. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is apparently considering breaching retail planning guidelines to accommodate the company. I urge him to be extremely careful as such a decision could create a terrible precedent and have an adverse impact on the road network. It is not true that IKEA must have giant stores. I am reliably informed the company&rsquo;s store on the island of Majorca is of moderate size, as would also be appropriate and applicable to our circumstances given our population and size. The House should urge the Minister to be careful in his negotiations and not to cede too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it possible to have an urgent debate on the fisheries industry which is in crisis? Only this morning we learned of the laying off of 60 workers at and the effective closure of a processing plant in Burtonport, County Donegal, largely due to the existence of prohibitive fish quotas and the fact that many Irish registered boats choose to land catches in other countries such as Scotland and Norway.</P>
      <P>It is important to debate this matter to explore the action which might be taken to rejuvenate an industry which was thriving many years ago but which, unfortunately, has died away to the detriment of many coastal communities. There is a responsibility on all of us to take appropriate action to achieve this rejuvenation. The debate would also give the House an opportunity to explore with the Minister the aquaculture industry which heretofore has not realised its potential in terms of the employment that could be created and the revenue gained by coastal communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Nuclear material and waste is shipped around our coasts on occasion. A conference is currently taking place in Australia where countries from the Far East are discussing the possibility of such waste and material being stolen. When the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill returned to this House from the D&aacute;il, Senator Quinn pointed out it was a 2000 Bill and that it had taken a long time to go through the Houses. While I realise the Leader cannot order the business of the other House, the Law of the Sea <Col N="893"/>(Repression of Piracy) Bill 2001 went through this House three years ago. Why is there such a lack of concern that this legislation is passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Education and Science is determined to reach the target of an average class size of 20 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>She aspires to reach it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>However, it is a case of prioritising how she reaches this target. In the context of rolling out the commitment, she must have due regard for special educational needs, which has been stressed in the House today. The Minister and the Government are firmly committed to reaching the target set out in An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>We should consider the record of recent years. For example, the pupil teacher ratio has gone from 22.2:1 to 17.44:1 over the period of this coalition Government.</P>

	<P>Are we having a debate?</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I have. Average class sizes have fallen from 26.6:1 to 23.9:1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should ask his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come to the House to clarify the confusion that has obviously arisen among the Opposition? Some 4,000 extra primary teachers have been put into the system. There is a question in regard to the reality of supply over the coming years. The Minister is being forthcoming and up-front about this.</P>

	<P>Order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us deal with the realities by calling on the Minister to come to the House to discuss the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the ongoing fractures in Government policy, it is important we have a debate on incineration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator a question? He should ask it quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, now criticise the whole idea of incineration. I want to know what it is they know which the general <Col N="894"/>public is not being informed of in regard to incineration. It is important we have an urgent debate on incineration. Both Ministers have stated incineration is dangerous to the environment, which we on this side of the House have known for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an issue for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>On another issue, the public are shocked by the many incidents of overcharging by Vodafone and O<?oasys [cf8]?>2<?oasys [cf1]?>. Almost &euro;3 million was robbed from customers over the past 12 months or so yet all that has been received from the management and directors of the companies is an apology. The Government needs to take action in this area and customers robbed by the two mobile telephone companies should be fully compensated. This is important because there is concern among members of the public, particularly businesses and young people, with regard to overcharging in this area. We have often heard an apology but more action needs to be taken. It is the responsibility of the Government, particularly the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to demand this.</P>

	<P>I support the comments of my colleague, Senator Glynn, on the issue of fireworks. Legislation is in place for the enforcement of the Act. However, if it is not enforced, we must ask why. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must explain to the House why it is not enforced. The same goes for bonfires which are not covered by any legislation. On bonfire night in Dublin city, parks and other areas become no-go areas except for drug-taking and boozing. Long gone are the days that a bonfire was something to be enjoyed. Legislation is needed in this area.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport to explain the U-turn by the National Roads Authority on the provision of central crash barriers, particularly after the recent horrific pile-up on the M1? I do not understand what criteria the National Roads Authority has used up to now. There is a great hurrah for the new motorway to Cork, completed a year earlier than expected. However, there are no crash barriers in the middle of the road, which is dangerous.</P>

We have become more mature about Remembrance Day and all Members should attend some of the Remembrance Day observations next Sunday.</P>

	<P>I know I will be accused of time-wasting if I have not. Will the Leader provide time for a debate on An Post? There is a threat of a serious industrial dispute in An Post which will bring the postal service to a go-slow, if not a halt, coming up to Christmas. It would be useful to study this company which is the worst-run State body. I not only blame the trade unions as An Post is a case of bad management from political appointees to bad, overpaid management and intransigent trade unions. A debate would be useful because An Post is the epitome of how a monopoly should not be run. It is a case of a monopoly being run at a loss of &euro;43 million per annum. Before there is a postal strike, will the Leader invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the House to explain what plans he has to bring An Post back to profit and working order?</P>

	<P>It would be useful to have a debate with the relevant Minister, whether the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Minister for Finance, arising from a decision in the Italian High Court yesterday. The Italian director of consumer affairs took a case against the banks claiming they were treating their customers inequitably by applying only a yearly interest on deposits but quarterly interest on overdrafts and loans. The court decided this was inequitable and it is estimated that 10 million Italians will benefit to the tune of between &euro;20 billion and &euro;30 billion as a result. The Director of Consumer Affairs here could take a similar case. I am not aware of any such case being taken here in view of which it might be appropriate to debate the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Members who asked for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House. If she does she might also deal with the issue of school transport which has increased fivefold in the past few years yet fewer passengers use the service. It is completely inflexible, and dealing with CIE and the Department is a nightmare for everyone concerned because they will not listen to common sense about altering routes slightly to pick up additional children. We should examine this approach and ask hard questions.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ross&rsquo;s comments about An Post. One can contrast it with the postal service in England, which has been turned into a very profitable organisation whose employees recently received large dividends. We can learn lessons from that experience. I am also very concerned about the idea of sub-contracting postal services in rural areas.</P>

	<P>In recent days couples who would like to adopt a child, at home or abroad, have expressed grave concern about the length of time it takes them to be assessed for their suitability as adoptive parents. They attribute the delay to the lack of social workers. This process is traumatic for adoptive parents but it takes anything up to four years, longer in some cases, to go through the process. If the provision of social workers would help speed that up something should be done about it. We need social workers in other areas too. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come to the House to outline how she can ease the difficulties facing would-be adoptive parents and see what can be done to improve their situation?</P>

	<P>Senator Finucane, the deputy leader of the Opposition, raised the matter of the pupil-teacher ratio and the statement on this issue by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. The words &ldquo;noble aspiration&rdquo; <Col N="897"/>were good ones to use. The Senator wants the Minister to come to the House to talk about the pupil-teacher ratio and the shortage of teachers. I will endeavour to ensure that happens. He mentioned special needs assistants, in particular, and the scheme which this House welcomed. However, the Senator pointed out the lack of lucidity as to which schools will be involved. Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the pupil-teacher ratio and the disadvantage it entails. He said there is a supply of teachers in the colleges and they can supply more. This underlines the case for bringing the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan said 120,000 children are in classes of more than 30. That is another matter which we will endeavour to have the Minister address in the House. He also talked about the re-ordering of priorities and the role of regulators. The Minister is considering more amendments to the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 which he has promised to discuss on Committee Stage here. It is hoped the Bill will be back in the Seanad within the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney began by speaking about the film &ldquo;Bad Santa&rdquo; but he had a wider concern about how the film censorship board issues certificates. He also spoke of how videos can proliferate without regulation of any kind.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan spoke about the promise on the pupil-teacher ratio being reneged on. He also asked about cancer treatment in the south east. Senator Glynn claimed that bonfires, rockets and repeaters had made this the worst Halloween in memory. We have asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform whether he has plans to enforce the Act which deals with this. Senator Norris wondered how often American Gulfstream jets land at Shannon bearing prisoners.</P>

	<P>I will inquire about it. Senator MacSharry wants a debate on the fishing industry. Such a debate is overdue and we will arrange it. Senator Henry spoke about the Law of the Sea (Repression of Piracy) Bill 2001, which must now be well out of date. Senator Fitzgerald was right when he said the Minister for Education and Science will reach her target, but has started with easing disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon wants a debate on incinerators, as well as a debate on overcharging by Vodafone. Senator Kett supports Senator Glynn&rsquo;s remarks on fireworks. Senator Feighan spoke about the NRA and its change of heart on the crash barriers. The Cathaoirleach was good to allow the Senator&rsquo;s point about Remembrance Day, which is next Sunday. Many Irish people lost their lives fighting in the First and Second World Wars.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh made the point that we are not the richest country in Europe. The recent IMF report puts us at 99%. Senator Ross wants a debate on An Post, and I think we should have one. It appears that we will be strapped again this Christmas when the mail will be at its heaviest. We will invite the Minister to the House. Senator Kenneally raised the issue of a case in Italy, where a consumer brought a case against the banks, which now have to pay &euro;20 billion to &euro;30 billion to consumers.</P>

	<P>I am not as fit as some at running from my office to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House today on Second Stage of the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004, which provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for certain health and social care professionals. Statutory registration is best described as a system whereby individual members of a profession are recognised by a specified body as being competent to practise within that profession under a formal mechanism provided for by law.</P>
      <P>Unlike systems of voluntary registration, it is a legally binding process with a mechanism for the prosecution of offences. The Bill is integral to the delivery of the commitment in the health strategy to strengthen and expand provisions for the statutory registration of health professionals. This is the first of three Bills to reform the regulatory environment for health professionals, with legislation for medical practitioners and nurses to follow.</P>
      <P>The 2001 health strategy was based on four key principles, namely, equity, people-centredness, quality and accountability. As outlined in the health strategy, gaining people&rsquo;s trust in a health system is about guaranteeing quality. People want to know that the service they are receiving is based on best-practice evidence and meets approved and certified standards. Improving quality in the health care system requires implementation of internationally recognised evidence-based guidelines and protocols and ongoing education and commitment from health care institutions and professionals. Trust requires that deficiencies in the system be identified, corrective actions taken and future progress monitored. The principle of people-centredness includes ensuring that consumers are given greater control and greater responsibility for their own health and <Col N="900"/>increased involvement of consumers as partners in planning and evaluation.</P>
      <P>The vision adopted in the health strategy for the future health system places great store on treating people with dignity and respect. The health strategy envisaged that action would be taken to strengthen the customer focus of service providers. While acknowledging the need for freedom in exercising clinical judgment, the Government also accepts the need for a stronger framework for questioning and investigating clinical decisions in specific circumstances. Accordingly, the legislation on statutory registration of health and social care professionals contains a comprehensive legal process for the investigation of complaints against individual professionals.</P>
      <P>The health strategy also stated that measuring the costs and quality of services and managing human resources have become increasingly complex at all levels in modern health care organisations. Strengthening and clarifying accountability and measurement mechanisms is a priority. Professionals now practise in a more demanding environment. Evidence-based guidelines, tighter professional standards, the requirements of health care organisations, and patient rights and expectations all add to those demands. That is another aspect of accountability strengthened by these legislative proposals. The establishment of a system of statutory registration for certain health and social care professionals is therefore considered essential to the delivery of the quality and accountability objectives of the health strategy. It will ensure that members of the public are guided, protected and informed so they can be confident that health and social care professionals providing services are properly qualified, competent and fit to practise.</P>
      <P>The proposed system will ensure professional conduct and the maintenance of high standards of professional education and training among those professionals. It is estimated that 14,000 health and social care professionals will be subject to regulation from the outset, some 15% of whom are employed in the private sector. The 12 professions to be subject to the provisions of the Bill in the first instance were selected because they are long-established providers of health and social care within the health service and in most instances have experience of self-regulation. In addition, the qualifications of the majority of those professions are currently regulated within the public health service.</P>
      <P>While the proposed system of statutory registration applies in the first instance to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health and Children to include additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system by regulation on the basis of specific criteria. Such criteria include, in particular, the potential for harm to the public, as well as the existence of a defined scope of practice, the degree to which the profession has estab<Col N="901"/>lished itself, has defined routes of entry and is committed to continuous professional development.</P>
      <P>Legal registration constitutes a demanding standard of competence for each registered practitioner, including comprehensive fitness to practise structures. A central feature of the Bill is, therefore, the adoption of a contemporary approach to fitness to practise issues. In that context, the Bill provides for a mediation process and other informal means of resolution for less serious complaints by agreement of both parties concerned. It also includes a mechanism for a practitioner to accept a complaint and the sanction proposed to pre-empt the requirement for a full hearing where the complaint is considered to be less serious. A health committee is also being established to investigate, with appropriate input from a medical practitioner, complaints which arise from the health status of a registered practitioner.</P>
      <P>The design of the proposed regulatory system was strongly informed by the principle that regulation in the health and social care sphere involves the balancing of a range of objectives and interests. These relate primarily to quality standards of service provision, protection of the public against harm, accountability and economic impacts.</P>
      <P>While all regulation imposes economic costs, these costs will be offset in the case of the proposed system of statutory registration by such benefits as quality assuring the competence of practitioners; addressing information deficits for the public; bridging shortfalls in education and training levels; maintaining an incentive to invest in education and training; and the introduction of a statutory disciplinary process and strong consumer representation.</P>
      <P>In developing the system of statutory registration for health and social care professionals, there was regard to the principles underlying effective regulation as set out in the various initiatives on regulatory reform, including the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland and the White Paper, Regulating Better, which highlighted the requirement that consumers should be placed at the top of the policy agenda. In this regard, while the present system of voluntary self-regulation is operating efficiently in many instances, it is considered that it does not provide adequate protection to the public who have a right to be confident that the person providing a service is properly qualified, of good standing and competent to practise in his or her profession.</P>
      <P>The system of statutory registration proposed in the Bill is open and transparent, with strong public interest representation which will serve to enhance the quality of service to patients. Strong emphasis is placed on ensuring quality and safety while facilitating appropriate competition. Representative bodies of the professions concerned <Col N="902"/>have long advocated the introduction of a system of statutory registration. The key features of the system reflect the outcome of consultations undertaken with relevant professional bodies and these bodies have been kept abreast of the development of the proposals. In order to ensure quality and safety while facilitating appropriate competition, consultations also took place between my Department and the Competition Authority.</P>
      <P>I will outline the key elements of the proposed system of statutory registration for health and social care professionals. Section 4 designates the 12 health and social care professions subject to the provisions of the Act, regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self-employed. They are chiropodists, clinical biochemists, dieticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists. This section also provides for the designation of additional health and social care professions by regulation in the future.</P>
      <P>Sections 6, 7 and 8 establish the health and social care professionals council; define the object of the council as being to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions; provide that the council must exercise its powers and perform its functions in the public interest; and set out the functions of the council. The health and social care professionals council will, through appropriate co-ordination and oversight, ensure the consistency and coherence of the system as a whole and promote uniformity of practice among registration boards.</P>
      <P>The locus of control and direction in terms of the operation of the system of statutory registration lies firmly with the health and social care professionals council. The council will have a co-ordinating role ensuring there is uniformity of procedures throughout the system, particularly regarding disciplinary matters where a substantial legal and administrative burden is anticipated in line with current experience in the medical and nursing professions. It is considered that the individual registration boards would not have the capacity required to deal with the complex legal issues likely to arise on an ongoing basis or would not benefit from the expertise the council would build up handling these issues on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Section 9 lays down the membership of the council as comprising 25 members, 12 being members of the registered professions and 13 from outside the professions, representing the management of the public and voluntary health or social care sector, third level educational establishments and the interests of the general public to ensure an appropriate balance with public accountability.</P><Col N="903"/>
      <P>In keeping with the regulatory system for other health professions, section 17 provides that the council must meet its expenses out of funds at its disposal, that is from fees paid by registrants. Section 22 enables the council to make rules providing for such matters as registration and the receiving and recording of evidence by committees of inquiry. Sections 26 and 27 provide for the establishment of a registration board for each of the 12 professions to be registered; define the object of each registration board as being to protect the public by fostering high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of that profession; and set out the functions of each registration board.</P>
      <P>Section 28 lays down the membership of each registration board as being 13 persons, six from the particular profession elected by members of that profession and seven persons from outside the profession, representative of the management of the public and private health or social care sector, third level educational establishments and the interests of the general public.</P>
      <P>Section 31 enables each registration board to make by-laws regarding such matters as qualifications attesting to the standard of proficiency required for registration. Where a proposed by-law might result in an additional burden being imposed on the Exchequer, both the council and the Minister must approve the draft by-law. Sections 35 to 37 provide for the establishment and maintenance of a register of members of that profession and the procedure to be followed by a person seeking registration. Section 45 requires each registration board to make the register available for inspection by members of the public. Sections 47 and 48 enable each registration board to approve or withdraw approval for education and training programmes for the education and training of candidates for registration and require a registration board to monitor the ongoing suitability of education and training programmes approved by the board.</P>
      <P>Section 50 requires the council to establish a preliminary proceedings committee, a professional conduct committee and a health committee to perform functions and exercise powers in regard to complaints, inquiries and discipline and sets out the membership of these committees. Section 51 sets out the grounds under which a person may make a complaint to the council concerning a registrant, including professional misconduct, poor professional performance or where a registrant&rsquo;s ability to practise is impaired by his or her health status, including an addiction to alcohol or drugs. A complaint may also be made on the grounds of professional misconduct or poor professional performance even though the matter to which the complaint relates occurred outside the State.</P><Col N="904"/>
      <P>Section 55 provides that where there is sufficient cause to warrant further action being taken regarding a complaint, the preliminary proceedings committee must refer the complaint either for resolution by mediation or other informal means or to a professional conduct committee or a health committee. Section 57 provides that a hearing before a professional conduct committee will generally be held in public while a hearing before a health committee will generally be held in private.</P>
      <P>Section 59 enables the council to apply to the High Court for an order directing a registration board to suspend a registrant&rsquo;s registration pending the completion of an inquiry, if it considers that the action is necessary to protect the public. Sections 62 to 64 provide that if allegations have been substantiated the council must impose a disciplinary sanction on a registered practitioner, such as the attachment of conditions to registration, suspension or erasure from the register. Sections 67 to 69 provide that the imposition of a disciplinary sanction other than an admonishment or censure does not take effect unless it is confirmed by the High Court.</P>
      <P>Sections 75 and 76 provide that the council may notify the Minister, employer and public as soon as any sanction imposed on a registered professional takes effect. This includes imposition of a sanction in another jurisdiction. Section 78 makes it an offence for an unregistered practitioner to use a protected title or to falsely represent himself as being a registered practitioner. Section 90 sets out grandparenting arrangements for those practitioners currently in practice. It is intended that all persons currently qualified to work in the public health service will meet the standard required for registration. Where practitioners do not possess the required qualification, they will be given an opportunity to undergo an assessment to demonstrate competence. Where a practitioner does not reach the standard of proficiency required for registration, he or she would not be entitled to continue to use a title that is protected under the legislation but would be entitled to continue working under a different title.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, this Bill marks a further step in the process of strengthening and expanding provisions for the statutory registration of health professionals as set out in the health strategy. It is further confirmation of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the delivery of a reformed health service which has as its core objective the maximisation of the level and quality of care provided to patients and clients in the years ahead.</P>

    </Speaker><Col N="905"/>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>She was here last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>She was not presenting a Bill. She was speaking on health topics and has certainly been very busy lately.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes this long overdue Bill which the T&aacute;naiste informed me has been circulating for nearly 20 years. The Bill is welcome from everyone&rsquo;s point of view. It is good for the consumers who will get proper treatment when they enter a particular practice. The last thing one needs is someone with a back problem visiting a so-called physiotherapist and emerging with neck and leg problems, later discovering that the practitioner was not fully qualified in the appropriate area. The Bill is also good for the professionals as regulation will protect their good name and reputation and allow them to stand over their titles. Any complaints can be followed up and rectified and in an extreme case a person&rsquo;s name can be erased from the register. Hopefully that will not happen too often.</P>
      <P>The Bill will place registration of the listed professions on a statutory footing, giving them the recognition they deserve. The statutory registration gives each member of the profession recognition by a specified body as competent to practise within that profession under formal mechanisms provided for by law. Fine Gael believes that registration of health professionals is necessary in order to ease the legitimate concerns of the general public that they are visiting health professionals who are properly trained and competent to look after their ailments or injuries. The Bill also affords the professionals and the public protection from quacks or those working in specific health areas without any proper qualifications. The Bill will ensure that the good names of professions are protected.</P>
      <P>A proper registration system gives the public and the professions protection because it allows for the investigation of allegations of misconduct or incompetence, a welcome step not currently provided for. The legislative framework of statutory regulation also allows for the appraisal and approval of education and training courses, examinations, qualifications and institutions, ensuring the proper development of education and training across the professions. It also allows greater consistency in the application of EU directives concerned with the mutual recognition of third level qualifications in EU member states.</P>
      <P>The registration system must ensure that we deliver the best possible service to patients, clients and service users. While the proposed system of self-regulation must be welcomed, I hope that the new structures will have no adverse effect on competition in the various professions. That is a danger when going down the road of regulation. The T&aacute;naiste said she had consulted with the Competition Authority in drawing up this Bill, but we should consider the issue. Unfortunately, we will not find out what might happen <Col N="906"/>for perhaps a few years after the Bill is enacted and in operation. We must be careful that we do not over-regulate and discourage competition in the area. I assume that would not be the aim of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reference to people working in areas in which they might not necessarily have the appropriate qualifications. I am aware of one gentleman in Carlow who is quite famous for setting bones, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>He is known the world over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The individual in question has cured many people but he has no medical qualifications whatsoever. The concept of grandparenting rights is, therefore, interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They used to be known as &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo; rights but we have changed the name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as I am aware, the same term is used in respect of slots at Heathrow Airport. Aer Lingus does not own its slots there but it is said to have grandparenting rights in respect of them. This is a good concept because it will allow people who are currently practising and who have a history of doing so to remain in their professions, even though they might not have the necessary qualifications but can clearly demonstrate that they are qualified to work and can cure people.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the holding of hearings in private. The Bill states that hearings can be held in public or private. Why would hearings involving health cases be held in private? I accept there is a need for discretion in certain cases. However, in order that members of the public have confidence in the system we must ensure that deals cannot be done behind closed doors. It is also important to ensure that decisions are reached quickly and that complaints will not take years to resolve.</P>
      <P>I understand there are to be 12 registration boards. If I recall correctly, 13 groups were originally to be covered by the Bill. Health and safety officers were included initially and perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will indicate why they were ultimately left out.</P>
      <P>Physiotherapists are seeking a clear distinction between themselves and physical therapists. I urge the T&aacute;naiste to rectify the position at this stage. I am aware that, under section 94(3), the Minister may, by regulation, prescribe one or more than one title that is a variant of the title specified in section 4 for the profession and that, in addition to the title specified, may be used by registrants of that profession. However, section 94(7) states that a regulation may be made only if a draft of the proposed regulation has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and if a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House. I am concerned that on Committee <Col N="907"/>Stage the T&aacute;naiste should cater for the needs of these groups.</P>
      <P>I wish to inquire about accountability. Each profession will have its own registration board but there will also be a general council. For how long will the council hold office? Will it be possible to reappoint its members and, if so, for how many terms? To whom will the council be accountable? My previous portfolio was transport and whenever I asked a question about roads I was informed that responsibility in that regard lay with the NRA and not the Minister. The position was similar as regards train services. The last thing we need is to create another body which will be completely unaccountable to Members of the Oireachtas or the public. I hope the Minister will accept some responsibility in this area and not simply blame the council for any bad decisions taken or walk away from difficult decisions. The council should be directly linked to the Minister and thereby linked to the Houses of the Oireachtas and members of the public.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the T&aacute;naiste has not remained in the Chamber for the contributions of Opposition spokespersons. I thought it would be common courtesy for her to remain and not leave halfway through. I am sure, however, my views will be passed on to her in due course.</P>
      <P>The complaints process should work if it is effective. However, we must ensure it is quick and fair. We must also ensure that decisions are reached fairly and in a manner that stands up to scrutiny. In the case of someone with a genuine complaint against a particular person or body, we do not want it to take years for the complaints process to run its course in order for a resolution to be reached.</P>
      <P>In general, Fine Gael welcomes the Bill. However, we will be tabling a number of amendments on Committee Stage. The main issues that arise are the accountability of the general council, the absence of health and safety officers from the legislation and the need to ensure the complaints procedure will be fair, effective and not time consuming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>This is extremely important legislation because it will place a number of professional bodies on a statutory basis. Many of the people involved in the professions to which the Bill relates were treated unfairly for many years. It is only fair that when people undergo the rigours of taking the decision to enter a profession and study to gain competency therein, they should have protection under the law. It may have taken some time for the Bill to reach us but it is extremely important. I have spoken to many members of the relevant professions who welcome the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Bill provides, as the T&aacute;naiste stated, for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for <Col N="908"/>health and social care professionals. It is a key element in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, to expand and strengthen the regulatory environment in the health sector. It is also pivotal to the objective of providing quality and accountable health care for the public. The latter is extremely important because when people attend a practitioner, either one of those to whom the Bill refers or some other practitioner &mdash; I have the honour of being registered in a particular profession &mdash; they should be able to rest assured that, following treatment, the cure will not be worse than the disease. Patients&rsquo; rights must be protected.</P>
      <P>Before the Bill was brought forward, a series of workshops were held with the professional bodies to try to reach a consensus on how a system of statutory registration might operate in practice. The groups were consulted to ascertain what they felt were the strong points, which might be enshrined in law, and the potential weak points, which might be consigned to the dustbin. In the main, the objectives in this area have been achieved.</P>
      <P>The Government has always emphasised the importance of seeking to build consensus by using a highly-consultative process with the professions involved. The purpose of establishing a regulatory system is to ensure that members of the public are guided and, above all, protected and informed in order that they can be confident that health and social care professionals providing services are fully qualified, competent and fit to practise. The system of statutory regulation proposed in the Bill is open and transparent and is characterised by strong public interest representation. The latter will serve to enhance the quality and accountability of health and social care services provided to the public. A system of legal registration for health and social care professionals is essential to the development of the quality and accountability objectives of the health strategy.</P>
      <P>Professional people are usually extremely jealous when it comes to their professional standing. They would be quick to disassociate themselves, and rightly so, from any member who brings their profession into disrepute. That is a well-known fact. No one is quicker to blow the whistle on a person who is bringing any given profession into disrepute than one of his or her colleagues. Long may that practice continue.</P>
      <P>At present, only a handful of health care staff &mdash; doctors, nurses, dentists, opticians and pharmacists &mdash; are subject to statutory regulation. The new system will regulate the activities of more than 11,500 professionals working in the public sector and thousands more in the private sector. On the matter of funding of the 12 registration boards, each of which will have 13 members, I trust there will be an annual registration fee as obtains in other professions. If the boards are to have responsibility for ensuring the education of <Col N="909"/>their members is progressed and kept up to date, a certain financial provision will be necessary within the given profession.</P>
      <P>The new system will regulate the activities of a large number of people. The titles of various professions will also be protected. It will be an offence for an unregistered person to offer professional services to the public. I have raised this matter in the House on a number of occasions. They may not be covered by the provisions of this Bill but certain people are practising what they call alternative medicine. Registered doctors who have been struck off, and rightly so, are ripping off vulnerable people by telling them cock and bull stories that they will do the devil and all for them when they are doing nothing. They are the modern day Draculas, sucking every last cent out of those people and the inevitable always happens; the person dies and the unfortunate dependants lose whatever funds they have.</P>
      <P>Alternative or complementary medicine will not be affected although these areas are likely to face separate regulation in the coming years. I appeal to the Minister of State and to the T&aacute;naiste to ensure that the people to whom I have referred are put out of business and put in jail where they belong. Members on both sides of the House have complained about some outrageous occurrences. I was confronted with a situation in the Mullingar area prior to the local elections. What I heard would make an apt script for a horror film and it is a disgrace. We cannot stand idly by and allow this to happen and it underlines the importance of this legislation. I am very annoyed about this situation. Other Members such as Senator Finucane, have raised this matter. Something must be done about these people. I think there is a clinic called the Killaloe clinic but I am not sure.</P>
      <P>This new system is a culmination of several years of consultation and discussion between the Department of Health and Children and interest groups along with the research undertaken by the IPA. This is the first of three Bills to reform the regulatory environment for health professionals. Legislation for medical practitioners and nurses will follow and that is to be welcomed. I assume Senator Henry, who is a doctor, will also welcome that proposal. Established professionals are not afraid of being part of a regulatory system whereby they must uphold standards because that is what is meant by being a professional. Any legislation which will ensure a system which will be widespread and across the board will be welcome.</P>
      <P>Statutory registration is a system whereby each individual member of a profession is recognised by a specific body as competent to practise within that profession under a formal mechanism provided by law. Unlike systems of voluntary registration, it is a legally binding process. All persons wishing to practise must be registered and can be prosecuted for practising if not registered and <Col N="910"/>that is to be welcomed. Moves to introduce legislation to provide for the registration of certain health and social services professions have been under consideration for some significant time but for various reasons it had not been possible to proceed. Members will know the old saying that it is never too late to do the right thing and at long last, the right thing is being done.</P>
      <P>There are several pressing reasons such legislation should now be introduced. Legitimate and genuine concern exists among members of the public. They wish to be guided and protected so they are confident that the professional providing the service is properly qualified and competent to do so. The professions themselves require protection where normal operational procedures and ethical factors make it impossible to exclude those who are unqualified or insufficiently qualified from engaging in professional activity. This is because, among other reasons, the professions can only apply an ethical code to their own members. The good name and reputation of the majority can be damaged by the actions of a very small minority that bring a profession into disrepute unless there is a mechanism for sanctioning professional misconduct and misdemeanour.</P>
      <P>Disciplinary procedures are provided for in the Act. The Nurses Act established a fitness to practise committee. Such a procedure is strict. Anyone who has undergone the rigours of such a committee or was stupid enough to put himself or herself in the position of undergoing those rigours, will know what it is about. The word is out that one should keep one&rsquo;s nose clean or else one will be given the boot which is only right and proper.</P>
      <P>A proper system of registration can allow for investigation of allegations of incompetence or misconduct and allow for disciplinary action to be taken. It also provides a mechanism whereby practitioners compromised by ill-health or addiction can be appropriately dealt with. This is a very important provision. Registration provides a legislative framework for the evaluation or approval of education and training courses, examinations, qualifications and institutions, thus guaranteeing proper development of education and training across the professions. Some of the professions are already discharging these functions. Registration provides a more widely informed and participative forum for the administration and implementation of EU directives on the mutual recognition of third level qualifications in EU member states. It will also lead to greater consistency in the application of these directives.</P>
      <P>Voluntary codes of registration, while very useful in themselves, cannot by definition offer the legal protection afforded by a system of statutory regulation and this is why this legislation is important. Underlying all the considerations must be a strong commitment to ensure that the best possible service is delivered to patients and <Col N="911"/>clients and this must be the primary concern when developing a system of registration for health and social care professionals. It is proposed to establish a system of statutory self-regulation for social care professionals and the other 12 health and social care professions involved. The regime will provide a formal legal framework and administrative infrastructure within which the quality of the service provided to the public and the future development of the professions can be assured.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>A registration board will also be provided. We are delighted to &ldquo;import&rdquo; professionals, if that is the right word to use. In the past there was great difficulty in recruiting social workers. When I was a member and chairman of a board, we were forced to recruit in South Africa. People from across the water are very welcome in this country. If they have committed a misdemeanour across the water or been guilty of any professional misconduct, that must impact on their employment in this country.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I have posed a number of questions and I look forward to Committee Stage. This Bill must be right. It has been a long time in gestation. It is important because we need the type of professionals the public deserves. We must outlaw services such as those provided by the east Clare clinic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill. The Bill has been sought for approximately 20 years and it is good to see it before the House today.</P>
      <P>I have taken note of the sensible words of Senators Browne and Glynn but it is important to recognise that we cannot protect the general public from themselves. If they insist on going to unregistered practitioners there is very little we can do but the Bill puts everything in a much better framework because people will now be in a position to look up registers and see if these people have the necessary qualifications. It is important for fellow professionals as well because all health work, as the Minister is well aware, is team work and one would like to think the people one is working with are properly qualified. We have appalling examples of people claiming to have qualifications which they do not have. We have seen people appointed to jobs only to discover afterwards they do not have the qualifications. That is why they are now asked in many cases to send in the original degree certificates. It is good to see this Bill being brought forward.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn brought up the case of a man who was on the medical register but it was well <Col N="912"/>known for many years that he was promoting fraudulent treatments and taking a great deal of money from the unfortunates in the general public who had very serious illnesses. There appears to be no method under this legislation whereby the council could taken action about something which was publicly well known. A complainant has to come forward but people are sometimes reluctant to come forward to denounce someone they have trusted. They sometimes feel very foolish. Might it be possible to examine whether the council can initiate a complaint if something was known to be a public scandal?</P>
      <P>These boards are not self-regulatory. The professionals in each board will be outnumbered by the ministerial appointments but there does not appear to be anything which would prevent the Minister appointing people who are fit to be registered on those boards. That would mean that the profession could be in a majority on the boards. The same appears to have happened in the veterinary council Bill where a vet could be put forward by the Food Safety Authority and some of the other nominating bodies. I do not know if the Minister means the registrants are always to be in a minority or if she does not mind whether that is the case. The council will oversee the registration boards and the chief executive officer of the council will be a very busy person. I was glad to see that he or she will be able to delegate some of his or her duties to juniors.</P>
      <P>There is confusion among the general public about the qualifications of some persons. Senator Browne highlighted the situation regarding physiotherapists and physical therapists. It is only in the past few years that physical therapists who are not physiotherapists have set up practice here. Some of them do an excellent job but in the United Kingdom and internationally the title &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; is synonymous with the title &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo;. The titles are interchangeable and the professional qualification requirements are the same. This fact is recognised in 92 countries, all of whom are members of the international organisation of physiotherapists. The main concern of the society in this country is the protection of the public, which it believes can only be done by protecting the titles &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; and &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo; in the Bill, and I will table an amendment to that effect.</P>
      <P>In recent years, practitioners who were physical therapists have become confused in the public&rsquo;s mind with physiotherapists, and the confusion often arises when they try to get physical therapist fees reimbursed by the Voluntary Health Insurance or BUPA, only to discover that the therapist they attended was not a physiotherapist and they are not entitled to a reimbursement of fees.</P>
      <P>The other group about which there could be confusion is chiropodists because they are required to have a bachelor of science in podia<Col N="913"/>try. It might be as well to call them chiropodists-podiatrists or something like that because there will be enough trouble trying to sort out the grandparenting situation. I understand there are about five different groups which for many years have been in discussion with the Department of Health and Children about the qualifications and criteria that will be allowed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not know who will do the assessments but this is an important area because with the dreadful increase in diabetes in this country, foot clinics and the referral of patients by the medical profession and others to properly qualified chiropodists-podiatrists, is vital. One of the great expenses incurred by diabetics is due to the fact that those who get ulcers on their feet are admitted to hospital for about a month, at goodness knows what cost, when they could be properly treated in a foot clinic or by a well-qualified chiropodist-podiatrist.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to see an attempt was being made to provide for mediation between the professional and the complainant. That is a very good idea. From experience with medical litigation cases, I am aware that if some attempt had been made at mediation earlier in the proceedings, many court cases might have been stopped.</P>
      <P>I was delighted also to see that professional conduct committees and health committees will be established under the Bill. As the Minister will be aware, the problem has frequently been a health issue involving drink and drugs or something like that. These cases are unsuited to being dealt with by professional disciplinary committees. That is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, the professional conduct committee is mainly to be held in public. That is fine for the professional but I hope the complainant is given sufficient warning as to the private details that may be explained in public. Some of it can be held in public, some in private, but I am aware that people who have taken medical cases to court have been horrified by the medical details brought forward. I have no objection to the committees being held in public, which is probably a good idea, but it is not nearly as hard on professionals as it is on complainants and I hope they are given sufficient warning.</P>
      <P>Another area which concerns me is the fact that a register will only be published from time to time. It should be published every year. That is essential because people leave and join the register, and it will have to be up to date. I am sure Senator Quinn will mention, as he always does, that reports must be published and laid before the House promptly, not as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>Another aspect about the registers that concerned me was the restoration of names. For example, if a person decides not to work for a certain number of years and leaves the register because there is a retention fee to be paid, there <Col N="914"/>is nothing in the Bill about continuing professional development. Changes will have taken place in the time the person was not working. This is a major problem and I have had to be tough about continuing medical education. I am sure the Minister has seen that with pharmacies. One could not be out of that profession for two years without having to deal with all the dreadful changes. One would spend all the time looking up MIMS. That is an important aspect because we do not want people sliding back onto the register, so to speak. With the best will in the world, we all think we are keeping up to date with matters by reading <i>The Irish Times</i> health supplement but there is a little more to it than that if one is practising as a professional. I hope that something could be done to require people to show they have tried to keep up in that regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I will table amendments. As the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials will be aware, regardless of how warmly Senators welcome Bills, the House can always improve them. I look forward to energetic debates on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill and thank Senator Henry for allowing me to spend a few minutes discussing a specific issue. As the Senator pointed out, the legislation is long overdue. I recall that in the 1960s anybody could use the title of chemist. I am not sure when legislation changed the position. In the 1980s, while chatting to an architect about qualifications, I discovered that anyone could place an architect&rsquo;s sign on his or her door.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that the qualifications of health care professionals, in particular, are regulated. The contributions of Senators Browne and Henry reminded me of the difficulties we face in this area. One of the 12 professions referred to in the Bill is physiotherapy. I, too, have been contacted by the Institute of Chartered Physiotherapists regarding its difficulty with the title of physical therapist &mdash; I often use the word &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;therapist&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I must be careful, it is a slip of the tongue. I also have difficulty with the word &ldquo;draft&rdquo; as I occasionally mistakenly use the word &ldquo;daft&rdquo; instead in the House.</P>
      <P>Until now, I did not understand the implications of an issue which arises with regard to the physiotherapy profession. As Senator Henry noted, 92 countries have determined that the titles &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo; and &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; have the same meaning. This is also the case in Northern Ireland and Britain where regulations have been introduced on the matter.</P>
      <P>Section 94(3) provides that the Minister may prescribe one or more than one title as a variant of a title specified in the legislation. The titles of physiotherapist and physical therapist create a <Col N="915"/>specific difficulty in that both have the same meaning in most parts of the world. In Ireland, however, physiotherapists have qualifications and a university degree, whereas the title of physical therapist applies to those practitioners who do not have professional qualifications. This presents difficulties to patients been treated by physical therapists who have found to their surprise that their claims are not accepted by BUPA or VHI. This difficulty will not be easily resolved by the legislation in its current form. The provision of section 94(3) allowing for regulation of the matter at a later stage is insufficient. The Bill should define physiotherapists to include physical therapists because unless the latter title is included in and regulated by legislation the public will continue to be misled.</P>
      <P>I was impressed by Senator Glynn&rsquo;s deeply held concerns regarding activities by a person which verge on criminality. The issue I raise is entirely unrelated and arises from confusion. It should be addressed in the Bill rather than by regulation at a later stage. The objective of the T&aacute;naiste and Minster for Health and Children and the Minister of State in her Department, Deputy O&rsquo;Malley, is to frame good legislation. During the forthcoming debates in the House amendments will be introduced to improve the Bill, including one to address the matter I have discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley. As previous speakers have noted, this welcome legislation is long overdue. It is vital that the legitimate concerns of members of the public are protected to ensure they are confident that professionals providing services are properly qualified and competent.</P>
      <P>The professions require protection where normal operational and ethical factors make it impossible to exclude unqualified or insufficiently qualified persons from professional activity. The reason, among others, is that the professions can only apply an ethical code to their own members. Unless a mechanism is in place for sanctioning professional misconduct, the good name and reputation of the majority can be damaged by the actions of a few who bring a profession into disrepute.</P>
      <P>The Bill will provide for a proper system of registration which allows for investigation of any allegations of incompetence or misconduct and disciplinary action to be taken if deemed necessary. It also provides a mechanism to deal appropriately with practitioners compromised by ill health or addiction. It is vital that a system of statutory registration provides a legislative framework for the appraisal and approval of education and training courses, thus ensuring the proper development of education and training across the professions.</P><Col N="916"/>
      <P>In dealing specifically with one aspect of the Bill, I bring to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children the legitimate concerns of the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists. I met representatives of the society and listened carefully to their briefing. While the ISCP welcomes the publication of the Bill, it has concerns about the issue of title. It believes that issues which have implications for the general public have not been addressed.</P>
      <P>As Senator Henry stated, the title, &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo;, as distinct from the &ldquo;physical terrorists&rdquo; to which Senator Quinn referred, is synonymous with the title of &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo;. These titles are interchangeable and the professional qualifications and requirements are the same. In recent years, a group of practitioners has adopted the title &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo;, which has led to confusion regarding the difference between the two practices. The matter has only come to the attention of members of the public when their claims to VHI or BUPA have been rejected and, on investigation, they have discovered they were not treated by a physiotherapist.</P>
      <P>In hospital settings some doctors who trained or practised in other countries refer to chartered physiotherapists as physical therapists. As previous speakers have noted, this leads to confusion which can impact on patients. While the legislation may focus on statutory regulations for professionals, the interests of patients must be to the fore at all times. The differences between the two practices which currently operate here are profound, both in terms of the different level of educational requirements and the extent of involvement and interaction with the medical profession. This is nowhere more evident than in pharmacy in which there is a distinct difference in the qualifications of assistant pharmacists and pharmacy technicians who work alongside pharmacists. It is imperative that the legislation recognise and clearly set out this difference.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Physical Therapy awards the qualification of physical therapist. While this is a legitimate qualification and its practitioners provide a specialised service to the public, it is not the same as the qualification or service provided by a physiotherapist. These two qualifications must be recognised and regulated, while also being separated in the eyes of the general public. I hope the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children will address these concerns on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I also hope the T&aacute;naiste will be in a position to give an assurance that she will, through statutory instrument, protect the titles of physiotherapist and physical therapist for the profession of physiotherapy in the legislation and thereby protect the general public from the current confusion engendered by the fact that a separate group of practitioners whose members are not physiotherapists is using the title &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo;, <Col N="917"/>which is interchangeable with the title &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo; elsewhere in the world.</P>
      <P>Recent developments in a changing arrangement between general practitioners and pharmacists must be addressed. While I am aware the T&aacute;naiste recently addressed the issue in the D&aacute;il, I re-emphasise it in the hope that she will examine it in the short term in accordance with existing legislation. Lest some may not know this, I declare a conflict of interest in that I own a pharmacy. However, it does not change my view.</P>
      <P>Co-operation between health care professionals is vital in the operation of an effective health care system. However, team working among health care practitioners must have its limitations, for example, in the case of general practitioners coming together to build health centres and putting pharmacies on site, or pharmacists building health centres and inviting general practitioners to relocate their local surgeries to their health centres. Clearly, there should be no business arrangements of this kind between the prescriber and the dispenser as recommended in the pharmacy review group report. This is not in the best interests of either profession or in the best interests of the public. Each profession has its own separate and autonomous role and it is important that this independence should not be, or be perceived to be, compromised in any way.</P>
      <P>On the wider issue of health centres generally, I have serious concerns about allowing a pharmacist or a few doctors to control the market in a particular location. Apart from possible ethical considerations, what would this mean for patients in terms of choice, accessibility and quality of care in the long term? I ask the T&aacute;naiste to examine this issue carefully and to set out clearly how she proposes to address the matter.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I welcome the Bill and look forward to examining it in more detail on Committee Stage. The Bill is long overdue and should be welcomed by the professions, as I feel it is. More important, it is in the interests of the patient. All our initiatives and the direction of the health services must be geared towards quality of service for the patient, which should be to the fore in all legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to the House. Like other speakers, I welcome the Bill. It is long overdue and, while I did not examine it in detail, the memorandum makes good reading.</P>
      <P>I speak from a unique position as a former member of the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais, which are governed by Acts that mirror the Bill before us. In so far as they mirror it, one can take a sheet out of the Medical Council&rsquo;s book or that of An Bord Altranais and state they are well regulated professions. There are a few problems at the edges &mdash; perhaps I am being flippant in putting it that way &mdash; but I was glad to hear the T&aacute;naiste state that reform of both pro<Col N="918"/>fessions and the Acts that relate to them is due in the near future. Hopefully, whatever is wrong with those Acts will be put right. In saying that, the 26 year old Medical Practitioners Act 1978 has stood both professions in good stead. I do not see why this Bill will not be just as effective.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as pointed out by other speakers, is good for the professions given the ever-changing medical world. During my time with the Medical Council, I discovered that patients now go to their doctors armed with much information. They search the Internet, based on their symptoms, and then they quiz the doctor. However, the medical and nursing professions lend themselves to this. There is a partnership between client and doctor or patient and practitioner. While I am never comfortable with the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; and prefer the word &ldquo;patient&rdquo; when talking about medical matters, patients or consumers increasingly take control and organise their own health care, which is quite new. The Bill gives protection to the practitioner but also allows the patient greater accountability and greater insight into what his or her practitioner might be doing.</P>
      <P>I have much experience in the area of fitness to practise. In my six years on both medical bodies, dealing with the issue of fitness to practise was the best education I have had. It opened my eyes and ears to matters one would not believe were going on, some very sad and with dire consequences for practitioners as well as members of the public. I am glad fitness to practise is dealt with in the Bill, supported by the capacity of the High Court to deal with certain cases.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of a health committee. While the Medical Council set up its own health committee, An Bord Altranais does not have a health committee, or did not when I left it one year ago. Such a committee is a more humane way of dealing with sick practitioners than subjecting them to a full fitness to practise examination, especially when the issue is one of mental health or addiction. They should be dealt with in a kinder way. I am glad the health committee cases will be held in private before being held in public if the case involves the issue of fitness to practise.</P>
      <P>Section 59 of the Bill is essential. It enables the council to apply to the High Court for &ldquo;a section 59&rdquo;, as I am sure it will become known, to suspend a registrant&rsquo;s registration where the council feels the protection of the public may be interfered with in any way. I agree with Senator Henry that if somebody comes off the register voluntarily and is off it for a number of years, continuing education and training should take place.</P>
      <P>While I did not examine all the detail of the Bill, I am interested in the area of competence assurance. It is a hard lesson learned by the Medical Council that the competence of practitioners is now as important as their experience. With regard to competence assurance, perhaps <Col N="919"/>measures dealing with peer review could be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>That the Bill deals with mediation is also welcome. As Senator Henry stated, in most cases if one could bring the complainant and the person complained of together, a simple apology would normally sort out the issue and there would be no need for the lengthy legal costs often inflicted on both sides.</P>
      <P>I have a concern about other sub-committees of the 12 boards in question. These are all in the health area and ethics is a significant issue for them, including the matter of the confidentiality of patient records. I do not know how detailed they will be compared to medical records and medical histories but there would have to be a history of some kind. What protection will the public have in regard to their records being maintained in a secure manner rather than being exposed?</P>
      <P>Registration takes up much of the Bill from section 35 to section 46. I am interested in having some amendment made to the Bill in this area, a matter I will raise on Report Stage. When a certificate is issued, there should be an onus on the practitioner to display it. This does not often happen and certificates are left in drawers or facing down on desks. How are members of the public to know a practitioner is registered unless they see a certificate displayed? Other medical practitioners have their degrees displayed on the wall. While I do not mean certificates must be displayed in nice frames, they should be displayed in paper frames similar to those of children&rsquo;s first day at school photographs. They should also be displayed on practitioners&rsquo; desks, visible to members of the public.</P>

    <Title>Public Transport in the Greater Dublin Area: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I had several commitments at the same time and appreciate the forbearance of the House in this matter. I thank Senators for the opportunity to address this House on the progress made in recent years regarding public transport facilities in the greater <Col N="920"/>Dublin area and the proposals in hand for further enhancements and improvements in the coming years.</P>
      <P>These are exciting and challenging times for all of us involved in public transport. It is widely accepted that a shortage of investment over a long period prior to 1999 led to a deterioration of services provided and a subsequent lack of confidence by customers in public transport facilities generally. The Government recognises the important role public transport plays in the life of the country and has committed unprecedented levels of investment for the upgrade of the necessary infrastructure to meet present and future demands. In the six year period from 1999 to 2004, the Exchequer will have spent just over &euro;2 billion on modern fully accessible buses; increasing capacity and improving facilities on the rail network; the introduction of the Luas; and the development of bus priority measures around the country.</P>
      <P>The projects undertaken have impacted on all regions of the country from new rolling stock, track work and signalling on the mainline rail network to the rural transport initiative for the less densely populated areas. However, today&rsquo;s debate refers specifically to the facilities provided in the greater Dublin area and I will confine my comments to this region. It is vital that Dublin, as the nation&rsquo;s capital, has in place an efficient public transport system that allows industry to prosper, tourism to develop and people to travel to and from their employment locations in the shortest possible time. That the population of the greater Dublin area is continually rising and that there is a low-density spread in residential areas provides a challenge for public transport. This must be met and the actions taken to date and those planned for future years will help to relieve congestion and allow traffic in the greater Dublin area to flow again.</P>
      <P>Last July, the regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area were adopted. This means there is now a robust planning framework to help in planning to meet the transport challenges facing Dublin and the greater Dublin area in the future. This framework will also help to achieve better integration between transport and land use planning. This integration is very important in ensuring sustainable development, which, in turn, will help to eliminate congestion in the greater Dublin area. The regional planning guidelines provide a clear context and direction for future investment to take place within the greater Dublin area up to 2016. Moreover, these guidelines have statutory backing as local authorities must demonstrate that they have had regard to the planning guidelines.</P>
      <P>The relevant agencies investing in transport in the greater Dublin area are assessing their plans in the light of the guidelines. In particular, the guidelines provide an important guidance to the Dublin Transportation Office in its input into all <Col N="921"/>development plans and planning applications in the greater Dublin area. With this in mind, I will deal with the specific elements of public transport addressed in recent years, where progress has been made and for which there are significant plans.</P>
      <P>The two Luas lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green are now operational and passenger numbers exceed expectation. Services on the green line to Sandyford commenced at the end of June 2004 to wide public acclaim with a satisfactory level of patronage achieved to date on the line. Numbers travelling exceed 20,000 per day with passenger numbers particularly strong in the off-peak hours. Services on the red line commenced at the end of September 2004. The target journey time from Tallaght to Connolly Station is 43 minutes with expected daily patronage of approximately 40,000 when full services are operating.</P>
      <P>Since 30 June 2004, the Luas system has carried in excess of 3.5 million passengers. Park and ride facilities are an important feature in promoting the Luas network. The Railway Procurement Agency provides over 1,600 spaces at its park and ride facilities at Balally, Stillorgan and Sandyford stops on the green line and at the Red Cow on the red line. An additional 450 spaces will be provided as part of a private development near the Tallaght stop, which will be completed soon.</P>
      <P>With the first lines in place and operational, the Railway Procurement Agency is now advancing plans for extensions of Luas to the docklands and Cherrywood. These plans will include private sector funding captured through levies under the Planning and Development Act 2000, from developers who own land along a proposed route. The Department is awaiting business plans from the Railway Procurement Agency to assist in its evaluation of both extensions.</P>
      <P>I have also asked the Railway Procurement Agency to examine the possibilities of linking the two existing Luas lines and I am awaiting its report. Based on preliminary analysis, the agency has indicated that, arising from recent traffic management measures introduced by Dublin City Council, including an active policy to remove traffic from the city centre and the delivery of quality bus schemes, the environment across the city centre appears to be more conducive now to Luas than in the past. I understand the scheme could add a further 20% to Luas patronage, which would mean in excess of 7 million new Luas trips per year.</P>
      <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann expects the demand for services along the DART and all of its other suburban rail lines to increase substantially in the coming years. In July the company submitted to my Department a business case for the development of an integrated rail network for the greater Dublin area up to 2016 at a cost of almost &euro;3 billion. The proposals involve an increase in capa<Col N="922"/>city through the introduction of additional rolling stock and the extension of platforms; the upgrade of signalling to provide for additional train paths; and the construction of a new station in the city centre. The proposals represent the opportunity to expand significantly the capacity on the rail network in the greater Dublin area, particularly along the Kildare and Maynooth lines where major housing development will take place. The construction of an interconnector tunnel linking Heuston Station to the docklands also forms part of the programme.</P>
      <P>My Department is assessing the business case and I will be able to make commitments over the coming period on several key aspects of the plan which are deliverable in the short to medium term. However, already some significant elements of the plan are under way. The first phase of the DART upgrade will be completed in 2005. This involves increasing the power supply, replacing overhead lines and lengthening platforms. When coupled with the introduction of 40 new DART railcars, this will result in a 100% increase in DART capacity since 2000. The second phase of the DART upgrade, to be completed by the end of 2007, will improve signalling and allow for an increase in the number of trains that can cross from Connolly Station to Pearse Station at peak times.</P>
      <P>The introduction into service in late 2003 and early 2004 of a new fleet of diesel railcars, 80 of which are already in service, has substantially increased capacity on the suburban rail services. Other major improvements achieved on the rail network since 2000 include new, longer trains on all services into Heuston delivering a capacity increase of 130% in December 2003 alone. On the Maynooth line, the track work was doubled and new diesel railcars were assigned to the route in 2000.</P>
      <P>This capacity has been further increased by 25% in the past year with the addition of new rolling stock. Capacity increases of over 40% have been achieved on the Dundalk route. In addition, the refurbishment of Heuston Station has been completed. Four new platforms have been provided and the signalling on the approaches to the station has been replaced. On the Kildare route, new turnback facilities have been provided in 2003 at Hazelhatch and Portlaoise, allowing frequency increases along the line into Dublin.</P>
      <P>Buses also play a vital role in providing public transport services in the greater Dublin area. The network operated by Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and private operators is essential in the fight to persuade more people to leave their cars for the public transport alternative. Under the national development plan, Dublin Bus has purchased 460 new buses to date, of which 93 are additional and 367 are replacements. These buses improve the quality and reliability of the fleet as well as providing for increased services. This has resulted in <Col N="923"/>a 25% increase in Dublin Bus peak hour capacity since the beginning of the national development plan. Proof that expenditure in expanding and improving the bus fleet is paying off is provided by the Dublin Bus passenger numbers, which have been growing steadily in recent years and in 2003 exceeded 149 million. Bus &Eacute;ireann also has a successful story to tell. Bus &Eacute;ireann has increased its capacity by approximately 40% from commuter towns such as Drogheda, Navan and Naas to the city centre.</P>
      <P>The main focus of traffic management schemes is bus priority measures, as well as enhanced park and ride measures and improved interchange facilities between bus and rail. Considerable investment is being made in such facilities at present and the results are good. Dublin is at the upper end of success in terms of bus lanes as a percentage of the total road network, when compared with other international cities. A key element for easing congestion in the greater Dublin area is the delivery of quality bus corridors. Good progress has been made in rolling out bus priority schemes. Nine QBCs have been commissioned to date regarding Malahide, Lucan, Stillorgan, Finglas, north Clondalkin, Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Swords and Blanchardstown. Further QBC roll-out is being prioritised with funding through the Department&rsquo;s traffic management grants of &euro;27 million for 2004.</P>
      <P>The QBCs are making a significant contribution with greater patronage and increased speeds. For example, bus patronage on QBC routes at peak periods increased by over 60% between November 1997 and November 2003. Bus speeds on the QBC sections of bus routes increased by 14% during peak hours between November 2002 and November 2003.</P>
      <P>There are those who suggest that Dublin&rsquo;s transport problems could be solved by congestion charges and London is cited as the best experience in that regard. It is my view that congestion charges should only be considered for Dublin when the many measures now being put in place to improve public transport services and to expand and enhance the roads network at strategic locations around Dublin city, have been fully evaluated and are fully operational. Discussions have been taking place with the relevant agencies regarding the use, by buses, of hard shoulders on roads, particularly those linking Dublin and satellite towns. Making hard shoulders available to buses would help operators to meet their schedules. This would make buses a more attractive and feasible option, and contribute to a modal shift from the private car to public transport.</P>
      <P>A very significant amount of development and enhancement work has taken place on the public transport network in recent years. More is needed and my Department, together with the imple<Col N="924"/>menting agencies, is continually monitoring the investment programme to ensure the right projects are pursued at the right time. Significant progress is being made in the battle to tackle congestion. With car ownership levels continuing to rise, the challenge is still a major one. However, the scale of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to investment is public transport is significant. I look forward to next year when further projects are completed such as the M50 and the port tunnel, which will handle thousands of trucks, buses and cars each day. I look forward to next year when the DART and suburban rail are operating at greatly enhanced capacity, when the Luas lines are delivering on their planned levels of patronage, and when further traffic management measures are in place. Much of the investment is paying off and there is much more coming down the track in a short space of time. I apologise to Senators as this is a debate that interests me, but I am committed to the Road Traffic Bill 2004 at the same time as I am here. Unfortunately, I had very short notice of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share my time with Senator Terry. I welcome the Minister to the House and I understand the difficulty in being in two or three places at the one time. I appreciate the fact that he made this statement today. I thank the Leader for organising this debate. This matter arose last week on the Order of Business and she organised the debate in a very short period of time, which we all appreciate.</P>
      <P>I live on the Luas line in Kingswood Heights in Tallaght, where there now is a new Luas station. There is a great deal of pride in our community about Luas. It is a terrific service and we will leave the fact that it was two years behind schedule to another debate. If a quality public transport system is provided, people will use it.</P>
      <P>There are other things we can do to make sure even more people will use Luas. American transport economists tell us that if a person lives more than eight to ten minutes walking time from a station, then that person will use a car. We can make Luas an even greater success if we operate feeder bus services from outlying communities to the Luas line. The Minister might argue that the capacity is not there. The Tallaght line has a smaller capacity than the Sandyford line because of the rolling stock. It is crucial that we have feeder bus services that will bring people to the line to ensure more people use the space that is there.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that 3.5 million passengers have used both lines to date. Has a survey been carried out to find out if people have made that modal shift from private car to public transport? There has been a 40% reduction in the use of the bus in my own area. None of us wants to see Luas succeed at the expense of Dublin Bus. We have to be much more innovative in the way <Col N="925"/>in which we bring people to the line to encourage the expanding community to use it.</P>
      <P>The issue arose last week about an interconnection between the blue line and the red line. I appeal to the Minister to be open minded about how we can connect both lines. It is ridiculous to have this modern, state-of-the-art transport facility, without a means of connection between both routes. I know that there is a problem at the top of O&rsquo;Connell Street and O&rsquo;Connell Bridge because up to 40% of buses traverse that junction. That is a problem, but we may well be able to connect them in another way.</P>
      <P>Why can we not connect them between Harcourt Street and James&rsquo;s Street with a new stretch of roadway? In the short term, we could have a free shuttle bus service that will get people from the Tallaght line to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and <i>vice versa</i> to make sure there is interconnection between the two lines. It is a crying shame that in our plans over the past few years, we did not produce the right planning ingredient to ensure a surface connection between both lines. The Minister&rsquo;s comments last week were very positive on the attitude of Trinity College in terms of taking a chunk of the provost&rsquo;s front garden and moving it up this side of the city. We need an interconnection.</P>
      <P>One problem that has emerged is that of accidents involving the Luas, particularly on the Tallaght line. This is the case as it traverses many junctions in the north inner city. We need more policing, particularly in the run-up to Christmas, as well as better signage. That would be useful as people are only getting used to the fact that trams are back in Dublin after 40 years. They have to improve their driving habits and they have to learn. A policing presence would help.</P>
      <P>I was not against what the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, was trying to do with regard to Dublin Bus. It is good to give new routes to competition and to get Dublin Bus to compete with private operators.</P>
      <P>I am a great supporter of Dublin Bus, which has turned the corner like no other semi-State company and done fantastic things in Dublin. There is a need for a public sector company that works in tandem with private sector operators. I am not against that in principle. I ask the Minister to take action in that regard. Industrial relations difficulties, such as the stand-off between the former Minister for Transport and the unions, have comprised part of the problem. As a result, decisions have not been taken on the new routes which have been proposed by Dublin Bus.</P>
      <P>I am aware of new suburban communities in west Dublin which do not have a bus service, even though there are 2,000 houses in the area. I understand that Dublin Bus wants to provide a service and compete in the market in such areas, but it has been unable to do so because of industrial relations difficulties which resulted in a stand-off over the past six or seven months. I <Col N="926"/>understand that new routes must have the imprimatur of the Minister. I advise him to sanction the many routes which Dublin Bus is prepared to operate. If other private operators want to provide a service in such areas at a reduced cost, or to provide additional services on such routes, he should sanction that too.</P>
      <P>The public and private sectors should work together in this regard. The Government should not adopt a stuck-in-the-mud attitude to matters like this. While I welcomed what the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, was trying to do I may not have agreed with the way in which he went about it. Dublin Bus is an innovative company which has shown a capacity for leadership in recent years. It has been at the cutting edge of public transport. It needs to be supported, but that support should not be provided at the expense of other people who could also provide the service.</P>
      <P>It seems likely that a traffic corps will be established. I would welcome such a development. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to have found 1,000 new garda&iacute; to do the job. I hope to hear the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter in the future. There is a need for a dedicated traffic corps in Dublin to move bottlenecks and penalise those who engage in bad driver behaviour.</P>
      <P>Many of this city&rsquo;s congestion problems are caused by bad traffic management. I have long argued for a contraflow system on roads with three lanes, including the road on which I live. The system could be managed by a policeman from the traffic corps in the mornings and evenings to ensure that people do not abuse it.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael and Labour Party groups on Dublin City Council have argued for the introduction of car pooling, purely to see if it would work. There is no point in empty vehicles travelling on bus lanes in the mornings. I do not suggest that private cars should do it. If a car has a full load of people, however, we should let it off. Such people should be allowed to use bus corridors. It will be great if the experiment works and it can be cancelled if it does not. I thank the Minister, Deputy Cullen, for coming to the House to attend this important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Transport to the House. I appreciate that he is quite busy. I welcome many of the transport initiatives to which he referred in his speech. I refer in particular to Luas, which has to be praised because it has been successful. I wish there were Luas lines on the north side of Dublin. I regret that trams do not go to Dublin Airport, for example, or to the Blanchardstown area, where I live. The Taoiseach said recently that the metro will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="927"/>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I noticed that the Minister did not refer to the metro in his presentation. I presume he would have mentioned it if it was going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be very wrong to interpret the matter in that way. I have said repeatedly that it will not be finished by 2007, but it has not been taken off the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister had referred to it in his speech as part of the Seanad&rsquo;s discussion on transportation in Dublin. He should have told the House whether the Taoiseach was right to say that the metro has been scrapped and will not be pursued. His comments are all we can rely on at this stage. The failure to put in place an efficient public transport system on the north side of Dublin is an example of the neglect of that area. It is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss the Minister&rsquo;s regional strategic planning guidelines, which are supposed to lead to sustainable development. I would like the Minister to accompany me on a journey through parts of west and north Dublin, so he can see what the guidelines have done to the area. An Bord Plean&aacute;la is granting planning permission in the area on the basis that public transport will be provided. The Minister knows that public transport is not being provided in a way that will adequately deal with the level of development being approved. I encounter problems every day as I travel along the Navan Road on my way to Dublin city. Similar difficulties are found on the north side of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Blanchardstown cannot cope with the additional traffic which is passing through it as a result of suburban development on the north side of Dublin and in County Meath. An Bord Plean&aacute;la should not grant planning permission in the absence of an adequate public transport system. It has approved the development of 2,000 houses on the site of the former Phoenix Park racecourse and almost 2,000 units in Pelletstown, which is approximately a mile from the Phoenix Park. I could mention several other developments in that area.</P>
      <P>The provision of a rail link to the airport is absolutely necessary in the interests of the sustainability of industry and tourism in Dublin and the surrounding region. I ask the Minister to prioritise the establishment of such a link, which could serve towns such as Ballymun and Swords as well as Dublin Airport. A link to Blanchardstown could be provided at the same time.</P>
      <P>Dublin will grind to a halt if we do not provide the integrated infrastructure that is necessary. I welcome the improvements on the railway line between Connolly Station and Maynooth, which were mentioned by the Minister. While people recognise that the line has improved and are using it in greater numbers, many more of them would use it if further improvements were made.</P><Col N="928"/>
      <P>I would like to speak about park and ride facilities, which I promoted as a member of Fingal County Council between 1991 and 2002. None of the park and ride services which were earmarked by the council every time it compiled a development plan, has been delivered. If we develop park and ride facilities outside built-up areas, we will encourage those who are travelling in cars to use buses to continue their journeys to the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand why incentive schemes have not been put in place to encourage private individuals to provide such services. The Government will have to step in if the private sector continues to fail to get involved. It is an outrage that there are no park and ride facilities in north or west Dublin.</P>
      <P>The national development plan contained a commitment to the provision of 250 additional buses, but just 93 have been delivered. I cannot see how the Minister will make up the difference before the Government&rsquo;s term ends in 2006. I ask him to examine this matter. Buses can be provided much more cheaply than Luas lines or other railway systems. If the Government delivers the promised number of additional buses by increasing the number from 93 to 250 as it promised in the national development plan, it will have the necessary impact.</P>
      <P>It grieves me that the Dublin Port tunnel project has taken so long and that the costs involved have increased by tens of millions since it was first promised. It seems that the tunnel will not be completed before the end of 2005. I left Castleknock at 7.30 a.m. one day last week when I had to travel to Dublin Port. After I had been to the dock, I travelled back to Castleknock but did not arrive until 10.15 a.m. It took me two hours and 45 minutes to make the entire journey on an ordinary morning. I was shocked to see that many trucks, which are doing great damage to the environment of Dublin, were stuck in traffic coming out of the port. The cost over-runs and delays associated with the provision of this infrastructure are damaging the city&rsquo;s commercial life and tourism.</P>
      <P>I welcome many developments, but much still needs to be done. I hope that under the new Minister matters will move forward far more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to the House, and also the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who was here to speak in a transport debate for the first time since his appointment to the Department. We are all delighted he has taken on the role and is up to speed so quickly, as is Deputy Callely. Based on the statements emanating from the Department of Transport, there will be a continued vibrancy in the office, ensuring that matters will be dealt with in a comprehensive and coherent way, some<Col N="929"/>thing we have come to understand and expect from that Department.</P>
      <P>It is timely that we have this discussion on transportation in Dublin, requested last week. This is important for several reasons as there seems to be an element of rewriting history, both in certain sections of the media and in the Opposition. One might almost be forgiven for thinking that the transport sector was in crisis. There are issues and difficulties, as there will always be with a developing environment and growing population, particularly that along the east coast. However, due consideration and recognition must be given to the level of investment and commitment from both the present and previous Governments. The issue should not become a political football. It is useful to have the debate in this House, where the approach is less partisan and where ideas can be discussed openly so that they can feed into the strategic thinking of the Ministers and the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister clearly outlined for us that under the NDP from 2000 to 2006 more than &euro;2 billion would be spent on public transport capital projects. There is no doubt it will deliver impressive increased capacity in bus and rail transport in the city, which is very welcome. We have all seen the increases in quantity and quality regarding network availability. Since the introduction of the national development plan in 2000, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has almost doubled its capacity on the network in and around Dublin. As Senators will be aware, this is funded by both the Government and the EU. An additional 100 diesel railcars are used to deliver that service, most of them operating on suburban services in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>One probably has to consider transportation in Dublin in several circles, starting with the external one feeding in and out of suburban areas, and then continuing in stages. The central issue is management of traffic in the city&rsquo;s central zone, followed by the question of how to cater for the nearer suburbs. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s commitments and the investment it has made to increase service levels on the city&rsquo;s periphery have been most welcome.</P>
      <P>Let us take one or two examples, considering such places as Maynooth, where the increase in frequency has been approximately 124%, going from approximately ten to 20 railcars. There have also been significant increases on the Dundalk line of approximately 43%. On the Gorey-Arklow line, the figure is 30%, and Kildare&rsquo;s will be 160% when work is completed. It might be a little repetitive to talk about what has been done, but it is important to get the information into the public domain. There has been considerable negative comment regarding the delivery of transport infrastructure in the city. It is important that we feed into the debate and ensure that the facts are clearly recorded.</P><Col N="930"/>
      <P>There is the same level of continued service with the DART, where capacity has almost doubled since 2000. We have gone from 80 to 154 DART cars on the line. Due recognition should be given to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. I will speak presently of Luas, which is doing an exceptional job. However, the DART is still performing exceedingly well given its geography and based on the increased levels of investment it has been given. The service it delivers is still exceptionally good value for money and we should not lose sight of that. The debate on the Luas and the metro sometimes disregards the increased levels of investment in conventional diesel rail to the periphery and the DART.</P>
      <P>There has been a great upgrade to the DART service, something with which the Minister dealt. I understand it has largely been completed on the south side, with construction ongoing at weekends on the north side. As well as the new DART I mentioned, there will be several phases to the overall upgrade of the system, including improved access and longer platforms to cater for the longer trains now expected in light of the upgrading of power supplies. That will obviously provide much needed increased capacity on the DART. The cost is approximately &euro;176 million but unfortunately that significant investment has not been recognised by our friends opposite. When the second phase is completed, there will be an increase of 30% to 35% in capacity, amounting to 6,000 extra customers per hour at peak times. It is easy to look at the figures and the amount of money invested, but one must consider the impact on the lives of commuters and the fact that the system is dealing with 6,000 extra customers per hour at peak times.</P>
      <P>The Minister has addressed the second phase of the DART upgrade regarding signalling in and around the city. This will ameliorate the current bottleneck, moving from 12 trains per hour in each direction to 16. That will really improve connectivity from north to south, an issue that has already been raised. The number of tracks from Kildare will also be increased from two to four, which will lead to a very significant increase in activity levels on that line, from approximately 2,500 to 15,000 passengers per hour. That massive extra capacity should not go unnoticed. The investment is approximately &euro;300 million, with a 15-fold increase in service levels.</P>
      <P>The Luas has been discussed in detail by several speakers. It has been a great success, and I do not think that there has been any negative comment since it started. There has been a little tittering about some minor accidents but more accidents of this kind, such as cars scratching each other, take place on two or three miles of any road in the city than on the entire Luas line. It would have been very foolish of people to expect that there would be no incidents, given the change in culture associated with the new system. We should congratulate all those involved in this <Col N="931"/>House and elsewhere, especially the RPA for its work in delivering on time. Of course, the Minister and Minister of State must receive just recognition for their work in that regard.</P>
      <P>Right from the start, Luas has provided frequent, reliable, convenient commuter services. There is no negative aspect. There was a great deal of comment by certain people who wondered what political party and what Minister would have the guts to take on a project of its size, recognising its impact on commuters&rsquo; lives through the construction phase. I am delighted to have been in the party in Government at the time that was prepared to bite the bullet, take the tough decision, provide the investment and, to some extent, suffer the pain of negative publicity accompanying construction work. Now that is in the distant past and we have a really first-class service. It is great to see that its extension to new areas is now being considered. I very much welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments regarding the connection of the red and green lines.</P>
      <P>The level of confusion in that regard is probably unfair. When the Minister said he believed it necessary to connect the two lines, in some people&rsquo;s minds this was an automatic indication that the metro would not go ahead. Tonight Senator Terry said yet again that some comments from the Taoiseach meant that the metro was now off the track or was to be scrapped. I have listened relatively intently to the leader of our party on many occasions and read his comments on that issue with interest. He did not mention the scrapping of the metro project, nor did he indicate it was off the agenda. He said it was unlikely to be completed by 2007, but that it was still part of the overall strategy towards a solution for public transport in Dublin. This is something we all recognise.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris and I are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, and took part in the commissioning and development of a report which recognised the need for a connection between Dublin city centre and the airport. We believed, based on the recommendations of that report, that a metro was the best way to achieve this. There are a couple of issues surrounding the project. The metro has to be part of an overall budgeting strategy, which is for the Department to deal with. Some members of the committee went to Madrid to look at what they achieved in delivering a more cost-effective metro service. There are arguments relating to the ownership of land, particularly with regard to the extent and depth of ownership. In Madrid, any land below a certain depth was owned by the state. The significant costs associated with the purchase of land was no longer an issue, but it must be addressed in Ireland. That requires a review of the constitutional right to ownership. I hope the Minister would be prepared to look at the matter. There are also safety issues, with <Col N="932"/>regard to building a single or twin tunnel, and these must also be addressed.</P>
      <P>I support the concept of a metro between Dublin city centre and its airport. However, it must be part of an investment list which gives due recognition to the regions. We must get away from the idea that because there is a crisis in Dublin, all investment should go into Dublin. Today&rsquo;s debate is about Dublin, and the rest of the country will be dealt with another day. However, when the Minister is developing a policy or budget within his Department, or with the Departments of Finance and Environment, Heritage and Local Government etc., available moneys should be shared in terms of delivering infrastructure for all the people of Ireland, not just in the Dublin region. This should feed into the timeframe associated with the delivery of a metro service. One can always work a little from behind. As demand and population grow along the east coast and Dublin, one is always playing catch up.</P>
      <P>It is similar to decentralisation. Is it not better to develop the regions? Is it not better to develop a counter-balance along the west coast, building a level of infrastructure to encourage people to live there? It would, to an extent, stem the continued accelerated growth in the city. There are Members present from the Dublin area who will want to see continued investment. However, as long as I am in this House I will continue to fight for the west of Ireland&rsquo;s slice of the pudding.</P>

	<P>I accept that, and I am delighted to be here for a couple of days. Both myself and the Cathaoirleach must return to the mid-west.</P>
      <P>While I am not taking from the debate on Dublin, it is part of the balancing exercise. There are others with a similar belief. That is another day&rsquo;s debate, and I will be putting forward those issues. I was dealing with the macro-issue today in terms of priorities. We will deal with the micro-elements with regard to what requires funding at a later stage.</P>
      <P>We are getting a fourth river crossing in Limerick, which will be hugely beneficial. The port tunnel is a fantastic piece of infrastructure; 4.5 km of motorway at a cost of &euro;685 million. Approximately 9,000 trucks per day will be taken off the streets. That is extremely significant. I do not know if the Minister agrees with some of my views on the west of Ireland. However, as there is such a level of investment and delivery, it baffles me why there is a continuous whinge about what is not being done. If we started doing the same about the west of Ireland, we would be here for a month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House, I wish to share time with Senator Norris.</P>

	<P>That is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="933"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister has returned to discuss the state-of-the-art modern transport system in Dublin which he mentioned <i>en passant</i> last week. The Minister made no reference in his speech to the Navan line. This was in the national development plan when it was first published. It is crucial this issue be developed. It would take much pressure off the N2 and N3, and would provide a service to satellite towns. I ask the Minister to respond to the issue at some stage and let us know the Government&rsquo;s plans.</P>
      <P>We should have a start date for the metro project. I do not blame Senator Terry for having a view. There is no point people on the other side saying they are committed, when we all know it must be done. I believe it will be done, and I do not think the Minister or Government have pulled back from it. It would be madness if they did. However, we should start it now.</P>
      <P>Members of Fingal County Council and the recently retired Fingal county manager, Mr. Willie Soffe, had a proposal with regard to the metro. They made a solid business, social and infrastructural case for the extension of the metro to Swords. In its development plan, the county council pencilled in space for stations in Swords. Much of this will be achieved on a neutral cost basis, paid for by developers. We should examine this, as well as the issue of public private partnerships in such arrangements.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the height of the port tunnel, and Senator Morrisey has raised the matter on a number of occasions. The previous Minister for Transport dealt with it clearly. When I spoke on the matter before, I said we needed a decision on it. I said if the Minister decided not to increase the height, the obvious consequential decision was to ban &ldquo;super-cube&rdquo; trucks from the city altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody can object to this proposal. I tested the height of tunnels in France and Italy and other European countries. There is nothing particularly wrong with what we did. It has been presented as being reactionary, but I do not accept that. I have been overtaken on my bicycle by these big &ldquo;cubes&rdquo;, as I call the supertrucks. They are frighteningly dangerous and create a slipstream, similar to a Ferrari, which sucks people in. The competent decision arising from not increasing the height of the port tunnel is to ban these trucks from our roads. They are going to come to the city, and the solution will be worse than the problem. There is a slight gain, in terms of economies of scale, for transport people. However, the cost of impact on road infrastructure is massive. These trucks have treble the impact on roads compared to ordinary vehicles.</P>
      <P>I have not heard the Minister mention the issue of Operation Freeflow. We are coming up to <Col N="934"/>seachtain na Nollag, and we need to bring it into operation immediately.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes said he would not object to introducing competition for Dublin Bus, and he praised the company. I am glad he did, because it deserves praise. It has hugely improved its service. The Senator spoke of bringing in private competition. I have an agnostic view on the matter. I am neither in favour nor against private or public transport. If we introduce competition, there must be fairness to all. Those allotted city routes must provide Sunday morning services. A route allotted in the country must, for example, cater for one&rsquo;s granny going to the dispensary from Dunquin on Sunday morning. In order to have a level playing pitch, a certain level of service must be provided.</P>
      <P>I intended to point out that I could not find any park and ride facility on the north side of the city, but until I heard Senator Terry speak, I did not know there was none. That is quite appalling. My route to town runs through the Finglas area. The Finglas QBC is probably the most successful such bus lane in the city. Apart from a minor hold up for buses at Hart&rsquo;s Corner it is free flow all the way and is an absolutely dependable service. However, there is no park and ride facility. People leave their cars in pub car parks and the like. This causes major problems although it is the least technical of issues. There is plenty of space on the periphery of the M50, along the N2 and even the N3, Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s area, for major park and ride facilities and these should be put in place.</P>
      <P>We should be given a start date for the metro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We should ban the super-cube transport from the city and immediately begin the line to link the Luas services. Let us ignore the begrudgers who say that will tear up the city. It needs to be done; let us do it. We should also have compulsory purchase orders which would allow the construction to proceed. If people object to compulsory purchase, the money offered should be put in the bank, as is done in many European countries. People should be informed of the amount of money being offered to them and also be told that the building of a road is going ahead. They should be told that if they want to appeal, a fair appeals structure is in place which may or may not award them more money, but they should not be allowed to stop the project going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, for his generosity in sharing his time with me. I fully agree with his views on the Dublin Port tunnel. He has highlighted the crux of the matter. The tunnel was built to relieve the congestion caused by large commercial vehicles in the city centre. It would be absurd if we simply used the existence of tunnels to dislodge the <Col N="935"/>worst of these commercial vehicles and those most hostile to ordinary civilian transport, if I might call it that, in the city.</P>
      <P>There are transport problems in Dublin just as there are in many growing European cities. It is estimated, for example, that between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. each day there are 460,000 journeys in Dublin, 71% of which are by car. The vast majority of these cars have only one occupant. All public transport modes available can at their maximum stretch cater for only 30% of these journeys. That is the situation. The Luas adds life and is pretty &mdash; as Frank McDonald kept telling us &mdash; but can never offer a real solution. That is a mathematical certainty.</P>
      <P>We have discussed this matter many times in the Seanad. Some of us formed a group to promote the metro and availed of the services of people like Garret FitzGerald, who worked out the mathematics. The Luas is simply incapable of shifting sufficient numbers. As it is on the surface, it not only has the difficulty of dislodging other services, of which we have had experience, but is relatively inflexible in terms of its capacity to increase train length and frequency. At the same time I am not a begrudger. We have Luas, so let us enjoy it. Its sophisticated appearance on the city streets is very nice for those who live along the Luas lines, few though we may be. The Luas has some unintended negative social consequences in terms of further boosting house prices along its lines.</P>
      <P>It is true as Senator Terry says that there is no real solution on the north side of the city, which is a pity. There was a regrettable absence in the Minister&rsquo;s speech of any statement about Luas. I hoped he would refer to it, but there is not a single line about it in his speech. Unfortunately, I was not in the Chamber when he was speaking, as I had to be somewhere else, so I do not know if he mentioned Luas. I know that his heart is in the right place.</P>
      <P>Some of the safety issues were glossed over and need to be examined more carefully. I warned about this kind of tram system five years ago in the House but other cities have learned to live with the safety issues and there is usually a decline in the frequency of accidents. The issue was discussed at the Joint Committee on Transport. As Senator Dooley said, the question of our culture also arises. We are all amber gamblers. People drive their vehicles not just through amber lights but through red lights if they see an opportunity. They can then be hit by the trams. Once again, a north side bias is evident. The Luas line on the north side of the city started late, has a smaller capacity than the line on the south side, is less frequent and has experienced the majority of accidents. All this helps to make the case for a proper transport system.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the signage is inadequate to prevent accidents. One could argue that in terms <Col N="936"/>of comparative signage, there are plenty of signs. Perhaps they are not designed in a sufficiently eye-catching manner. We may be suffering from what I call &ldquo;sign blindness&rdquo;, a little like snow blindness, because there is a blizzard of signs all over the city. One cannot take them all in. Yesterday evening, I was driving two friends from Los Angeles through Dublin city and I pointed out where the Luas tracks were. They remarked that there were no signs. There may be, but they are possibly not the right signs. A very good suggestion made by the Joint Committee on Transport was that the signs should incorporate pulsing, winking lights such as those warning people at the DART level crossings. The Luas system should also involve CCTV cameras to record the registration numbers of cars driven by those who break red lights.</P>
      <P>I am surprised there has been no accident yet in an area which involves special danger, the stretch where public service vehicles such as buses and taxis, along with private cars, share the road for a couple of hundred yards with the Luas trams. That stretch runs from Middle Abbey Street through Beresford Place to the lower end of Gardiner Street. It is quite likely that at some stage, cars will be trapped there by the traffic, and there may be a collision. This should be examined.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooley was a little diffident about the metro. He referred to the report commissioned by the Joint Committee on Transport, which wholeheartedly endorsed the metro. The committee was informed that not only was it good value, but a necessity, and that a significant cost would result from failure to install the system. The report was unanimously adopted by the committee established by both Houses of the Oireachtas to look at transport.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister did not mention the metro in his speech, he did mention it on a <?oasys [jy?>&ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme a week ago, a programme on which I was a panellist. He said clearly at that time that the metro plan had not been dropped and that it remained Government policy. He contradicted those who said the Taoiseach had unilaterally torn up the metro proposal. I spoke to the Minister of State in the corridor outside this Chamber and asked if it would acceptable for me to put this on the record, and he agreed it would. That is the Government position. The Taoiseach said it is unlikely that a metro could be completed by 2007. That is a pity, but let us not allow this to wither on the vine. This is the most significant transport initiative for the city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>As a result of initiatives in which I engaged, the committee brought Professor Melis to Dublin and visited Madrid. Unfortunately, I was not able to visit that city but I am glad other Members travelled there. Professor Melis made the points Senator Dooley iterated, namely, that the system in Madrid was facilitated by the fact that the <Col N="937"/>Spanish Government controlled ground underneath the city and the planning process could be short-circuited as a result. However, he also stated that the parliaments of other cities had passed legislation. That is what we should be doing, namely, asking the Government to prepare legislation to facilitate the putting in place of a metro.</P>
      <P>Another significant factor in the Madrid case was how the time problems were overcome. The longer a contract runs, the higher the costs involved. In Madrid there was a series of between six to ten parallel contracts which meant that the line was being worked on by a series of contractors. We should consider using a similar system. Not only is there something in our culture which encourages people to gamble with amber lights, there is also something which allows people to think that, in the interests of their companies, increasing and massaging prices is good. The prices initially reported by the Railway Procurement Agency were bizarre in the extreme. I recall a spokesperson stating on the radio that the project would cost &euro;4.5 billion. The interviewer said that the construction costs would only amount to &euro;1.5 billion and inquired as to what use the other &euro;3 billion would be put. The spokesperson answered, perfectly cheerfully, that it would be used for contingencies and insurance. My attitude to that is: some contingencies, some insurance.</P>
      <P>I forgot to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to the House. I did not intend any discourtesy. It is only right that I should welcome a fellow northsider.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, and I look forward to having good working relations with him and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated earlier that public transport in Dublin faces a number of challenges. That is certainly the case. I am a fan of Dublin Bus and of public transport in general. There has been a great deal of discussion about Luas but people had better realise that even if the system operates at five minute headways on the Tallaght red line, it will only carry a mere 2,000 people between Heuston and Connolly stations at peak hours. There are currently 132 buses on the quays each morning, the routes of which run parallel to the transport corridor for the Luas for 100 yards. These vehicles carry many more passengers than the Luas. Operated by Dublin Bus, private operators and Bus &Eacute;ireann, all of these buses converge at that point having travelled along Con<Col N="938"/>yngham Road from the west and are obliged to fight for every inch of road space on the quays. The bus lane on the quays is called a QBC but it is not a QBC.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus has invested in 1,200 buses under the national development plan. The company is on record as stating that it would have 200 buses over and above the number it would require if the problem of congestion on our streets was resolved. It costs &euro;50 million to buy 200 buses. I attended a lunch recently at which it was stated that the Small Firms Association estimates that congestion is costing businesses &euro;1 billion. The real figure in that regard is anybody&rsquo;s guess. How long can this be allowed to continue?</P>
      <P>We must give serious consideration to the position of Dublin Bus and the way people are transported. We should call QBCs what they really are, namely, bus lanes. There are possibly one or two QBCs but, as Senator Norris stated, they run, like Luas and the DART, mainly on the southside. I have in my possession the QBC monitoring data for November 2003 which was supplied to the steering committee. It refers, on every line, to the Stillorgan QBC and states that if one wants further information, one can obtain it on request. I am not surprised that it is not published and only available on request. When one reads the figures relating to the Blanchardstown QBC, one realises that the name is a misnomer. Blanchardstown as the worst performing QBC. According to the figures, one will get to Bachelor&rsquo;s Walk from Blanchardstown if one travels by car and not by bus. This is despite the fact that capacity on the Blanchardstown route has increased by 50 or 60 buses since 1997. However, the population of that area has increased very significantly. The average speed of a bus travelling on the route at the River Road is 13.92 kph.<?oasys [jy?>The position is worse out towards Clonee and<?oasys [jy?>in the estates of Clonsilla, Laurel Lodge and<?oasys [jy?>Castleknock where the termini are to be found.</P>
      <P>It has taken a great deal of time to put QBCs in place but these are not monitored by the police. A QBC was put in place on my estate last December and it is a disgrace to see how it is flaunted each morning. Buses are actually blocked from moving along it. Before the advent of the QBC, they had a better chance of making progress. The Garda does not monitor the QBCs.</P>
      <P>I am seeking a more realistic consideration of the infrastructural deficits in our QBC network. As politicians, we will be obliged to take difficult decisions about QBCs in our areas and direct that bottlenecks should be removed in order that buses can travel their routes. We are either in favour of public transport or in favour of private motorists.</P>
      <P>In terms of Irish Rail, I am of the view that there is a solution for the north side of Dublin and, as a knock-on effect, for inter-city services also. Last Saturday, my party adopted the Irish Rail commuter plan which is currently on the <Col N="939"/>Minister&rsquo;s desk. I believe it is the only party to do so. It was presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport by Joe Maher of Irish Rail last February. Why are we not running with this plan, which has undergone its feasibility study through the DTO model? It takes two years from the day it is bought to the day it is delivered for a carriage to go into service. Commuters expect that one can buy a carriage off the shelf. It is not as easy as that. Decisions taken now will not relieve the situation for two or three years. We must be realistic.</P>
      <P>The Irish Rail plan, which will increase the number of commuters from the current figure of 22,000 to 122,000, must be implemented. The advantages of the plan are simple. There is a rail line from Maynooth to Dublin which runs parallel to the N3 and which is grossly under-utilised. There is also a line which runs in from Kildare parallel to the N7. The latter is blocked each day with cars at the Red Cow roundabout. If there was a proper rail system running into the city from Newbridge, Kildare, the Dunboyne-Clonee area, Drogheda and Arklow, congestion on our roads would be relieved. The Luas has proved one thing, namely, if there is a reliable and frequent service, customers will flock to it. As stated earlier, however, even if the Luas were to operate at five minute headways, its impact would not be as great as that offered by the alternatives.</P>
      <P>People have asked for a cultural change on the part of motorists. In that context there should be a cultural change within Departments. I recently submitted an Adjournment debate matter on the extension of the travel saver ticket which is tax-efficient for both employer and employee. I received a reply from the Department of Finance which beggars belief. It stated that if it was further extended to allow employees buy tickets directly themselves, it would suggest the introduction of some sort of direct tax relief for all. It further stated that the extension of the scheme in this way would have serious cost implications for the Exchequer. I believe that is incorrect. If the employee was buying the ticket directly, there would be no employer or side component, which is the case when the employer buys the ticket. The reply further states that it would also place a significant administrative burden on local offices of the Revenue Commissioners who must process the relief for employees. Such an attitude must change. People are being encouraged to leave their cars and use buses and are not allowed tax relief because of cost implications for the Revenue Commissioners. What are the current cost implications of traffic congestion? I ask the Minister of State to examine this matter in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been poorly advised on the matter of the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>

	<P>I guarantee if any Member looked at a super-cube and an ordinary lorry, they would not be able to see the difference in height. Goods are leaving the country in super-cubes and there are jobs which depend on those goods being delivered to foreign markets at a cost competitive price. Those who say they should be banned are not living in the real world. Should the business be transferred to Larne, courtesy of the Irish taxpayer who has built a new motorway? I plead with the Minister of State to review this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well. I worked with him when he was Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly and he will fulfil his new role well. The introduction of the national development plan has resulted in significant investment to revitalise transport in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The two Luas lines have been a great success. The journey from Sandyford to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green takes 22 minutes and from Tallaght to the city centre takes 43 minutes. Those are very impressive journey times. When I was a county councillor I travelled from my area to Tallaght and it used to take me over one and a half hours to travel to and from Tallaght. The journey time of 43 minutes is a significant achievement and is welcomed by every Dublin citizen. Commuters can now travel to their destination efficiently and in comfort.</P>
      <P>The platforms on the DART line have been upgraded so that those with disabilities have easy access to the trains and this is a significant improvement. Four or five years ago the number of DART carriages per train could not be increased because the platforms were not long enough. That improvement has been implemented and is a step forward which facilitates those travelling to and from the city.</P>
      <P>Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath has increased its fleet numbers. There are too many buses on the road. Given the traffic congestion, the buses overlap one another. In many cases three buses come in a row. If there was no congestion, there might be no need for the extra fleet of buses.</P>
      <P>Quality bus corridors, particularly the Stillorgan and Rathfarnham QBCs, have been a major success. They are working very well. The rail services in the outer area have also increased capacity which will facilitate the demand from Kildare, Maynooth and Gorey. I acknowledge there is much more to be done but these are significant steps forward.</P>
      <P>The question to be answered is how we can lessen our dependence on the private motor car. Is it the case that bus users are switching to the Luas and therefore the motorists are not being taken off the road? Some action must be taken <Col N="941"/>because the traffic congestion is building up. I needed to bring my car into town in order to collect a big item but I will not do so again. It took an hour to get in and out of the Jervis Centre. I will not bring my car into town for the remainder of this year. It took me one and a half hours to travel home yesterday, which is ridiculous. People must cop on about this situation.</P>
      <P>I suggest that an integrated ticket system might be a way forward. A man travelled up from Waterford to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital. He came up by train and crossed the road to travel by Luas to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital but he had to buy his ticket on a different system. It should have been possible for him to buy a ticket at Waterford station to connect with the Luas. Such a system would attract more people to public transport. They should not be inconvenienced in their travel. In this regard I agree with Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s comments regarding a yearly ticket. Employers could produce a yearly ticket for employees with perhaps a tax rebate as a way of attracting them away from using a private car.</P>
      <P>The provincial buses all leave from Bus&aacute;ras at 5.30 p.m., heading for the N4, N7 or N9 routes. Why can they not be moved out to the depots near the Red Cow roundabout? That should be considered.</P>
      <P>The park and ride system is not working. People still park on the side of the road in Sandyford rather than in the park and ride facility because they will not pay the fee. I was surprised at that attitude and it needs to be examined. I urge the Minister of State to solve the problem of congestion in the run-up to Christmas. If the traffic can be kept flowing, we are halfway to success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Paddy Burke for his courtesy. It is fashionable and easy to bellyache about public transport and people will do so whenever they are in Opposition. Ministers for Transport are easy targets and they have a very difficult job. I agree with much of what Senator Ormonde said about the improvements which have taken place in transport in the Dublin area in recent times. Not everything has been entirely welcome. There have been appalling and unforgivable delays. They have tested the customers&rsquo; patience to such an extent that it is almost at breaking point. Having been a private doubter about Luas I have to say to this Minister, the previous Minister, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister who pioneered it, the then Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, now Leader of the House, that Luas is a more than welcome innovation. It is almost revolutionary.</P>
      <P>When I bought my first car some years ago I thought I would never travel by public transport again. One of the great advantages of getting one&rsquo;s first car is that one avoided what were the <Col N="942"/>horrors of public transport at the time. I now try to find a way to travel by Luas because it is so convenient, comfortable, stressless, cheap and quiet. I welcome it regardless of the cost, and I say that as someone who often complains about the cost of things.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.3]?>
      <P>In terms of public transport, however, it is not possible to say it was too expensive because roads, public transport, trains, buses and routes are fairly permanent and that cannot be measured in terms of a dividend or the cost to industry or individuals. One can have a rough guess at what is being saved or guess, per company, what is being saved going by various shorter routes using different means of transport but the actual amount it benefits the nation is inestimable. We cannot tell what it is and in that sense the Luas is a great innovation because we cannot measure in terms of money its benefit to the country, the traffic or the reduction in numbers it effects.</P>
      <P>Also, the improvements in the roads, which have been talked about, are massive, revolutionary and welcome, if slow. Yesterday, I travelled from Dublin Airport to my house in Carrickmines and the joy of being able to travel nearly the whole way on the M50 was something completely new and to be welcomed. I completed in 30 minutes a journey which, in days gone by, would have taken me an hour or an hour and a half. That is a welcome development, something we should applaud and not decry. It is something for which the Government, and all Governments, must take some credit and responsibility. In terms of capital spending, we should say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;. Credit is due to Senator O&rsquo;Rourke in terms of the Luas. The role she played in that project is magnificent, and let us not bellyache too much about the expense incurred and its late arrival because we now have it.</P>
      <P>The same applies to the bus corridors, which have been very successful in the area Senator Ormonde touched on. The buses race along the Bray road on a daily basis and are attracting more passengers. The Senator made a good point about whether people are moving between the buses and the Luas, and we do not know the answer to that. Despite the immense improvement made in the Luas, and the welcome intervention by the Minister to link the two Luas lines, I am anxious that Dublin University, which is not my constituency but is somewhere in which I have a great interest, should not have some of its territory taken from it.</P>

	<P>It is in Senator Ross&rsquo;s constituency.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="943"/>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that is not correct. Dublin University is not in my constituency. The graduates of Dublin University are my constituents. It would be very wrong if we decided, willy-nilly, to excise some of that territory without the co-operation and agreement of Dublin University. We have to be careful that modern transport does not interfere with the great heritage we are privileged to have. When I was flying over London yesterday I saw some of its great infrastructure, which we do not have here. They have tunnels, underground stations, enormous structures, which one sees in the United States also, over-ground junctions and fly-overs, something we have not developed here but which we should consider. I say that in the context of expense not being so important. Roads and rail are not something we can measure and decide they are too expensive because in terms of eternity, nothing is expensive.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the Minister&rsquo;s other important role as sole shareholder of CIE. That is a responsible role but I suggest it has been a tremendous obstacle to transport in this country. That CIE has been a monopoly for so long, along with the other great monopolies of the State &mdash; CIE, An Post and Aer Rianta &mdash; has hindered the particular objectives to which those companies aspire. Their mission has been hindered by their monopolies. I say this in the knowledge that private companies will now be allowed to compete with CIE in certain areas. We should welcome that because it is consumer-friendly, even if the CIE unions do not welcome it. It is important that the new Minister is prepared to challenge, not in a confrontational way, the unions which say there should be no change in this particular area.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to anybody that in the modern world we cannot continue with monopolies of this sort. We only have to look at the incredible success of Aircoach running its buses from the airport to acknowledge that this service is consumer-friendly and absolutely necessary in the present context. Aircoach was started by John O&rsquo;Sullivan, who I believe used to be in Dublin Bus. He set up the business on his own with a very small amount of money but sold it recently for &euro;15 million. That was a great achievement because he set up to compete with the major monopolies from the airport, and he has now expanded his bus fleet. He started off running at a loss. One only had to be on the street outside to see all the empty coaches driving past. It was a disaster to start with but people got used to these particular buses which they found were cleaner, more frequent and more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>And cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>They were cheaper as well. People used them and gave Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan the sort of mandate small private competitors need in this <Col N="944"/>area against the great monopolies. The Minister should have the courage &mdash; the former Minister, Deputy Brennan, hesitated too much &mdash; to insist on competition with CIE, not on one or two particular routes but on all routes because that will benefit CIE also. One only has to look at the difference it made in the airline industry. It will not only be consumer-led but it will also force CIE to make a profit. If the introduction of competition in certain semi-State areas kills the monopoly and even puts the State out of the picture, so be it. If it is run for the benefit of the customer and can be profitable, that is a philosophy the Minister can happily espouse and comfortably say is popular. There is nothing wrong with doing something popular if it also happens to be right. Semi-State companies, particularly in the transport area, are used by certain people to protect particular perches; these people sit on and expand their empire, make sure it does not make a profit, keep competition out and crucify the consumer. I welcome the fact that we are moving away from that philosophy and urge the Minister to take his courage in his hands and promote faster change. We would then see more Luas projects, greater competition in other areas and a better transport system.</P>
      <P>We always have plenty of reasons to moan about public transport &mdash; it is a national sport. In recent times we have seen tremendous developments in this area, none of them perfect. We should welcome them and encourage all Ministers to continue in this vein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to contribute to the debate. I thank the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and his Minister of State, Deputy Callely, for attending the debate. I also thank Mr. Maurice Treacy, an official of the Department, for his attendance. We sometimes forget the civil servants who accompany Ministers to the House. They do the hard work and have great experience.</P>
      <P>Apart from my strong interest in public transport, my contribution has another purpose. As my comments on a certain issue last Thursday may not have been sufficiently clear, I wish to clarify it for the record. Recently, in the other House, the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, stated that I had squandered millions of euro when we were forced to return European funds as a result of changing our plans as regards the Luas system. This is untrue and I thank Mr. Treacy from the Department for a note he sent me on the issue. I will read out the note before sending it to Deputy Rabbitte, which should keep him tranquillised for a while. The note states:</P>
      <P LI="1">Senator Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</P>
      <P LI="1">Leader of the House</P>
      <P LI="1">Your request for details of reallocation of EU funds that had been originally associated with the Luas project refers.</P><Col N="945"/>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Arising from the reallocation of EU funding for Luas, several new projects were approved. The new projects were: track and signalling work on the Maynooth line; Maynooth line stations; platform extensions; track renewal on the Connolly-Mullingar line; purchase of 16 additional DART cars; purchase of 20 Diesel railcars; and purchase of buses, including 50 double-deck buses, 7 trial buses and 20 buses accessible to disabled people.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">The specific funding details are not to hand at present [they are in a store in Finglas] but can be obtained if required.</P>
      <P LI="1">Maurice Treacy</P>
      <P LI="1">Public Transport Division</P>
      <P LI="1">9 November 2004.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Last week was not the first occasion on which Deputy Rabbitte made such an untrue claim. If I recall correctly, Mr. John Fearon, a civil servant, went to Brussels and negotiated the reallocation of the funds in question. This was the first time permission was given to fund bus services using European moneys, not one punt of which was lost to Ireland. When we realised the changes in plans regarding the Luas project could give rise to the funding being returned, we insisted that we should be allowed to keep it, which is what transpired. I am pleased to clarify the matter in the House and thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to do so.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, will have statutory responsibility for traffic in the Dublin area. We have had major developments in the area of transport. Listening to them brought to mind the day on which I sought £500 million for track renewal. Without this funding our trains would not run and our railway stations would be closed. Of all the measures I took, securing funding for track renewal gave me the greatest satisfaction because it resulted in trains operating to the highest safety standards. This was an excellent investment by the Government.</P>
      <P>We had to make a tough case for funding track renewal over two sessions. Following an unfortunate rail accident in Knockcroghery, when a fish plate fractured leaving two people injured, I visited the site of the incident and saw the condition of the line. I then informed the Cabinet that we could no longer run trains. One&rsquo;s first responsibility is safety, from which everything else follows. I told the Cabinet I could not vouch for the safety of the rail tracks. We obtained the funding and rectified the problem. Rail services and connections are essential, particularly in rural areas where they are a lifeline.</P>
      <P>Having hated it until the day before the trams ran, it is amazing that everybody now loves the Luas system. Overnight, we found that people who castigated and metaphorically threw stones at me started to love the Luas system, which was <Col N="946"/>an amazing development. I constantly receive letters from people informing me that, having used the service, they find it wonderful and think I am great. I do not know what to make of Tom McGurk&rsquo;s description of me on RTE as &ldquo;Mama Luas&rdquo;. Overnight, the sentiment towards Luas changed from hatred to love.</P>
      <P>Every time I see a tram on Cuffe Street or pass Dr. Steevens&rsquo;s Hospital on James&rsquo;s Street, I congratulate myself and the Department on holding our nerve. It was amazing that the Luas and I changed from objects of hate to objects of delight. This demonstrates that one must hold one&rsquo;s nerve on major infrastructural projects. To paraphrase the poet, Robert Frost, we have miles to go before we sleep. The Government has much to do.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross referred to fly-overs, the Tube and other infrastructure in London. Two weekends ago I visited Paris &mdash; it was not a junket but paid at my own expense &mdash; and had a lovely time. The city&rsquo;s underground system has been operating for 150 years. Most capital cities have underground systems.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister for Transport and his Minister of State success in their jobs. Over the past two years, we tried to arrange debates on public transport in the House but found it rather difficult. I believe we are entering a new golden era following my golden era as Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>I am happy to clarify for Deputy Rabbitte what happened to the funding which he stated was squandered and lost to Ireland. Every time he takes a seat on a bus, enters Maynooth railway station or travels by train to Mullingar, I hope he will think of the money which was not lost but well spent. The Deputy signed an accord in Mullingar with another individual but there is no sign of it.</P>

	<P>The Minister is due to return to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, to the House. The biggest losers in the area of transport will be business people in the centre of Dublin. They are losing business due to traffic congestion. More and more people will stop shopping and doing business in the city centre because there is total congestion and chaos in regard to traffic and parking.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy for the business community in the city centre. They pay the highest <Col N="947"/>rents, car parking charges and rates in the country as well as many other costs. The city centre business community will be the big losers the longer the problems continue. Business after business will move to Liffey Valley, Blanchardstown and the suburbs of Dublin city, a process which can be witnessed daily.</P>
      <P>There has been a huge increase in the level of traffic in the city in recent years. In 1997 there were approximately 180,000 cars in the city at rush hour but that figure is now 280,000. While much has been done by the Government in recent years to tackle this problem, it is not enough. I am disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. He summed up the situation when he stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Park and ride facilities are an important feature in promoting the Luas network. The Railway Procurement Agency provides over 1,600 spaces at its park and ride facilities at Balally, Stillorgan and Sandyford stops on the green line and at Red Cow on the red line. An additional 450 spaces will be provided as part of a private development near the Tallaght stop, which will be completed soon.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That is the situation. Somewhat over 1,500 parking spaces are provided in park and ride facilities in a city where 280,000 cars are on the roads during rush hour. The Minister continued:</P>
      <P LI="1">With the first lines in place and operational, the Railway Procurement Agency is now advancing plans for extensions of Luas to the docklands and Cherrywood. These plans will include private sector funding captured through levies under the Planning and Development Act 2000, from developers who own land along a proposed route. The Department is awaiting business plans from the Railway Procurement Agency to assist in its evaluation of both extensions.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Where does that leave the routes? It is a chicken and egg situation. We must wait for the business community or those who own the land to develop it before raising the levies to put in place the extensions to Cherrywood and docklands. I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that the land for these routes should be acquired by compulsory purchase order.</P>
      <P>We must move forward because to wait for others to develop the lands would take years. The owners do not care. In many cases, the value of their land is increasing rapidly. As Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, CPOs should be used and the owners compensated. The Government, in conjunction with the Railway Procurement Agency should make plans to progress this. The Minister stated: &ldquo;These plans will include private sector funding captured through levies.&rdquo; If we wait for levies to be raised and planning permission granted, the process will be a non-starter.</P><Col N="948"/>
      <P>Senator Terry referred to park and ride facilities. When considering how to get a proportion of the 280,000 cars which use the city daily out of the city centre, park and ride would seem a sensible option. The Government, the Railway Procurement Agency or some other agency should buy portions of land where park and ride facilities can be provided at a reasonable cost so that motorists can park and use public transport to travel to the city centre.</P>
      <P>I am a great believer in public transport. To have a solid public transport system is a necessary evil. I agree with Senator Dooley on the need for regional balance. Why should every motorist have to travel to Dublin to shop or to leave the country through Dublin Airport? Why can they not travel by public transport? In my case, public transport takes too long and is too awkward for me to use. If there was a system whereby one could, for example, drive for one hour from County Mayo to Athlone to get a train which would travel non-stop to the heart of Dublin city, I and others would use it. However, the public transport system now more or less provides shopping trains or shopping buses with the result that travellers do not use them.</P>
      <P>There is no reason we cannot have greater access to Europe from regional airports. Why do the majority of travellers to Spain, Portugal or other destinations have to come to Dublin to leave the country? A vast area from Cork to Donegal and west from Athlone is served by access airports at Sligo, Knock, Galway, Shannon and Cork. Travellers should be able to use these airports rather than having to use the M50 toll road to and from Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>Much work has been done and I give credit to Senator O&rsquo;Rourke for her work in this area as Minister for Public Enterprise. However, much remains to be done. The Government missed a golden opportunity when it got its wires crossed in regard to taxi deregulation. There was an undoubted deficit in regard to public transport but the Government took the easy way out when it deregulated the taxi industry. Dublin was flooded with taxis rather than buses whereas the taxi industry was correct in its views at that time. While hindsight is useful, there was a public transport deficit in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Government must quickly consider the use of park and ride facilities and CPOs and not wait for development incentives to be put in place because time is running out and the number of cars on the roads is increasing. Some eight years ago, the average number of cars per 100 of population was approximately 27. The then EU average was approximately 55 cars per 100 of population. Ireland has reached the EU average which is taking its toll on our roads and cities. With the affluence acquired over the past ten years, more people are using cars. Solutions must be found to get people out of their cars.</P><Col N="949"/>
      <P>Members referred to the introduction of an integrated ticketing system, a step the Government has no choice but to take. A person should be able to get one ticket for use on Luas and the bus. Many elderly people use public transport and the current ticket system where one needs a separate ticket for Luas and for the bus only complicates their travel. Integrated ticketing will make the whole system easier to use. Senator Ross spoke about the service provided by Aircoach that has been a great success. However, part of its success is due to the hassles of parking at Dublin Airport. People now prefer to travel by Aircoach, leaving their cars at home, rather than facing the hassle and cost of car parking at the airport. I wish Aircoach well as it provides a great service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, to the House. I congratulate him on his appointment to the Department of Transport with special responsibility for certain traffic management issues in Dublin and the major cities. During his many years as a member of Dublin City Council, he was never shy about making forceful and critical comments on how local authorities and Government were bringing about a balanced programme for public transport facilities. I hope the same critical faculties, so sharp and vociferous on Dublin City Council, will be to the fore in his new role as Minister of State at the Department of Transport. I will be delighted to share many of those views with him in the future as I have in the past.</P>
      <P>Much comment has been made on the large investments made by the Government in the past seven years to develop public transport facilities in Dublin. Investment has also been made to tackle the growing and persistent problem of traffic congestion. Surveys carried out by many bodies, including IBEC, point to this growing problem. One issue, mentioned only briefly in this debate, is traffic congestion in the inner city area within the two canal networks. Congestion in this area is ongoing because economic success is ongoing, leading to an increase in the population of Dublin city. This in turn leads to an increase in use of cars and the flow of traffic through the inner city. City council officials informed me that in the past 30 years, the increase in the throughput of the volume of road vehicular traffic in this inner city area was approximately 33%. This is at a time when the car user population has increased many times. The Government has taken this problem on board by adopting the Dublin transport initiative programme.</P>
      <P>Contemporaneous with the development of off-road public transport facilities, such as the upgrading of the DART service, the first phase already completed on the south side of the city, and the introduction of the Luas service, most <Col N="950"/>motorway development must take place in the outer suburban ring of Dublin city. A phenomenal level of development has taken place in this area. Last year, the Dublin city manager commented on the pressures brought on the inner city by the increase in car users. He said that if motorists wished to go through the inner city, they should do so underground. Although a wry comment, it did point to the problem in this area. Any attempt to increase the throughput in Dublin&rsquo;s inner city will see inner city motorways having to be built on stilts or underground. Neither of these proposals is acceptable for various reasons.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and the former Minister, Deputy Brennan, for the introduction of the Luas service. However, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke deserves special tribute. As Minister for Public Enterprise from 1997 to 2002, she piloted, protected and enthusiastically promoted the Luas project, often in the face of criticism from public commentators. The extent of her commitment and determination to bring the project to fruition was impressive. Without that, we would not have Luas today. Her efforts have resulted in us now enjoying a wonderful facility that will greatly enhance the image of Dublin city as a tourist destination and contribute to public transport facilities.</P>
      <P>I am impressed with the extent of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development and completion of the M50. Members spoke about the enhancements to be enjoyed if the project was completed. However, one disheartening feature is the manner in which this necessary project has been held up. Everyone has the right to an appeal. If individuals or communities believe their rights will be infringed or their heritage will be damaged by a project, they have the right to appeal. However, a balance must be struck in the interests of the public good. That balance has not been struck in the succession of appeals causing the blocking of the completion of the M50. At this stage, it borders on the farcical and certainly on the vexatious. It also raises questions about the whole appeals mechanism regarding compulsory purchase orders. I favour compulsory purchase orders being made on a ring of land between Malahide, Swords and Lucan to allow a frontloading of road and rail infrastructure. The suggestion made by Senator Paddy Burke, and others, on compulsory purchase orders must be examined as a matter of urgency by the Department of Transport.</P>
      <P>The problems caused by the appeals system must also be addressed. How much are the appeals costing through delays or deferred costs? I have often asked this question but have yet to receive an answer. A deferred project will cost more due to the variation of contract triggered at a later stage. There was the example of the Glen of the Downs motorway where eco-warriors and rent-a-crowd environmental professionals came <Col N="951"/>down to the area to delay a laudable project. Environmentalists and those in the local community conceded there was very little to be saved by this type of action. When one aggregates the cost of these actions and delays, what was the final cost to the taxpayer?</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>Those figures should be determined, aggregated and published, and the people who must pay the piper should be told so that they can make a balanced appraisal of what this liberal appeal system involves.</P>
      <P>The common good should be to the fore at all times. That should be the balancing factor. I thank the Minister of State and look forward to working with him. I am sure that as he moves forward to develop facilities for public transport in his Department we will hold many views in common and will occasionally hold differing views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Senators&rsquo; statements on the public transport facilities in Dublin and the future plans. Several issues were raised and I will try to respond quickly to some of them. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, for his contribution. He asked a relevant question about the planning and appeal process and in particular its costs. I cannot give a total figure for those costs. The appeal process delayed the Glen of the Downs project, and the additional costs, not of the appeal process but of the road project, were in excess of &euro;40 million for a relatively small section of road fairly quickly completed. One recognises, as the Senator does, the right of an individual or a community to appeal should they feel threatened. However, in light of the Senators&rsquo; comments my officials and I will reconsider this matter to see if there is another mechanism that might assist us to roll out these projects without undue delay, while acknowledging people&rsquo;s right to appeal.</P>
      <P>I am delighted we are having this debate. I congratulate my colleague, the Taoiseach, on his foresight in appointing a Minister of State in the Department of Transport with particular responsibility for Dublin and some of the other regions and cities where there are congestion problems. I do not say that because I happen to be a beneficiary of that decision in so far as I received the appointment. I say it because of the need to address some of the issues raised tonight. I am particularly pleased also as a &ldquo;Dub&rdquo; to be in the Department of Transport dealing with transport issues in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There has been an unprecedented level of expenditure and investment in public transport in the past few years. I concur with Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s remarks on Dublin Bus. He mentioned the infrastructure bottlenecks and I will try to address some of these pinch points where there <Col N="952"/>are serious problems. He said in effect we are either for public transport or private motorists. I differ from him on that point.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde described the difficulty she had coming into the city to collect a large parcel for which she needed her car. I am trying to achieve the appropriate mix and get it right. We must accommodate the private motorists and ensure that they feel they are being accommodated. We must also give the commuters or the people coming to work the opportunity to decide which suits them best, their private cars or public transport. To do this we need to roll out several projects.</P>
      <P>Our rail, bus and road networks need to be fully integrated and we must address issues concerning the quality bus corridors which proved successful early on. There are difficulties regarding bunching of buses and their flow. I have met all the operators in the greater Dublin area in the past few weeks since my appointment, including the quality bus network project office, to address some of the issues that will ensure the continuing momentum of the success of the network. Some new innovative measures may be needed.</P>
      <P>Integrated ticketing, in particular a smart card system, is very important. This will enable passengers to hop on or off whatever part of the public transport network they are using and perhaps collect their cars in the park and ride facility. It will not even be necessary to fumble for the smart card because it will work from one&rsquo;s pocket. This will be a great system and I am anxious to roll it out very rapidly.</P>
      <P>There is some work to be done on the policy associated with park and ride and who is responsible for the development and who will fund it. There is a mix of people involved in it now, including the local authority and the service provider, depending on who has the landbanks.</P>
      <P>The smart card is part of the new intelligence systems available in cars. One no longer uses a key to open the door, the system will detect the card and disarm and unlock automatically. The same applies to intelligent transport systems. If we take an innovative approach to many of the issues raised by the Senators, whether traffic jams, vehicle heights or other problems, and think outside the box about what can be introduced to deal with congestion issues we can solve each of those problems.</P>
      <P>The metro and the linking of the Luas lines are on the table and will progress to a satisfactory conclusion. I look forward to working with the House to address several of the issues raised in the best interests of the citizens and the economy of Dublin city.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at theDepartment of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, and congratulate him on his promotion. I have not had the opportunity of doing so in this House since he was promoted. I wish him every success. I am delighted to see a neighbour, and Munster man being promoted, especially one from County Clare, the banner county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen. I wish him well in his new appointment for however long it may last. In 1999, the closure of the AT Cross factory heralded the beginning of three major job losses in Ballinasloe, with the result that 900 jobs have been lost since 1999. The T&aacute;naiste and then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, indicated that she prioritised the area because of her connections there, her commitment to the west of Ireland and the equal opportunity for investment throughout the country. These were the reasons given and she called on all the agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S, the local county enterprise board and Galway Rural Development to commit themselves to prioritise Ballinasloe. We were supposed to get review after review, but the only review carried out was an announcement of a further closure. The closure of Square D followed in rapid succession to AT Cross. Last September, we had the final nail in the coffin when Dubarry shed 40 jobs. Nothing remains of the three except a skeleton workforce in Dubarry, which is now only a distribution centre for its products.</P>
      <P>Despite all the commitment and determination shown by various groups, nothing has happened. Nobody has ever heard of the reviews carried out as there was nothing to review except failure. There is a belief in Ballinasloe that along with those 700 jobs, the 1,300 public service jobs decentralised from Saint Brigid&rsquo;s hospital to other areas of the community have also been lost to the town. When we speak about decentralisation, we must realise that only one individual has indicated that he or she is prepared to go to Ballinasloe with the agency that is supposed to move there. This Government has turned its back on the people of east Galway and Ballinasloe in particular. If it was serious, it could surely have recognised that Ballinasloe might have become a hub centre or a gateway under the national spatial strategy. I ask the Minister to immediately meet with the relevant bodies and have a review on what can be done. If prioritisation means anything, then surely it means action sooner than five <Col N="954"/>years down the road. I ask the Minister to indicate to me that he will call together all of the relevant bodies.</P>
      <P>I must single out the Galway City and County Enterprise Board as the one body which has taken action and which has responded through the creation of some jobs. I must give credit to the CEO of that body, Mr. Charles Lynch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not like the use of names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The CEO of that body has come forward and wholeheartedly supported every opportunity in job creation and in the provision of finance. It is important that the Minister indicate he will meet with those bodies with a view to taking some belated steps to move forward and show that the Government is doing something, rather than turning its back as it has done over the past five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am conscious of the adverse effects on workers in the Ballinasloe area of job losses over the past year, including the recent announcement by Dubarry Shoes Limited of its decision to cease manufacturing at its Ballinasloe plant during November 2004 and transfer this production element to the company&rsquo;s manufacturing partners overseas, with the loss of up to 40 jobs.</P>
      <P>The relevant development agencies are making every effort to promote industrial development in the town. Ballinasloe remains a location of high focus for the IDA for new foreign direct investment. Since the Square D closure announcement in January 2003, IDA has brought 12 potential clients on site visits to Ballinasloe. The construction of a second advanced technology building is also under way at the IDA business and technology park in Ballinasloe and completion is expected before mid-2005. In addition, a site has been provided by the IDA to the ESB for the construction of a 38 KV station to satisfy the electricity needs of new projects locating on the park. The ESB is currently out to tender for the construction of this station.</P>
      <P>The IDA and Enterprise Ireland are actively working with the existing base of companies in the county and the Ballinasloe area to encourage them to grow and expand. The State development agencies continue to actively participate in locally generated marketing initiatives. Enterprise Ireland is providing support for the appointment of a manager for Ballinasloe Enterprise Centre. The agency has also supported a one year training programme for entrepreneurs in the Athlone and Galway Institutes of Technology under the enterprise platform programme, as part of encouraging high potential start-up companies in <Col N="955"/>the region. Further examples of progress being made in the town can be seen in the opening of the leisure centre and an increase in the range of training opportunities. The courses include the NUI diploma in community development and the LIONRA course providing access to third level education.</P>
      <P>F&Aacute;S, the national training authority, continues to participate with other State agencies in helping people to find suitable employment in the Ballinasloe area. In reaction to the closure announcement at Dubarry Shoes Limited, F&Aacute;S immediately contacted the company and met with the personnel manager on 13 October 2004 to outline its full range of services, to ascertain details of the lay-offs and make arrangements for meeting with the staff. F&Aacute;S began one-to-one guidance interviews with the workforce on 20 October 2004. To date, the agency has interviewed most of the 40 staff who are due to be made redundant.</P>
      <P>Galway County and City Enterprise Board is actively involved in the economic and social development of the Ballinasloe area, particularly through the implementation of the Ballinasloe area community development section plan, a local group dedicated to the establishment and development of enterprise units. The board also co-operates closely with the Leader group, Galway Rural Development and with Galway County Council.</P>
      <P>Since January 1999, 55 grant applications have been approved for assistance by Galway County Enterprise Board in the Ballinasloe region at a cost of &euro;591,225, of which &euro;453,152 has already been paid. The board has also provided targeted start your own business training courses for former employees of Square D, some of whom have successfully implemented their ideas and are currently providing employment in the Balinasloe region. The board will continue to be proactive in ensuring that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development throughout the locality. In the area of telecommunications, Galway County Council and the State development agencies have recently submitted a proposal to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for the development of broadband infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The major decentralisation package announced in the budget includes 110 jobs to be relocated to Ballinasloe. This move demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to balanced regional development and will provide a further boost to enterprise development in this area. The State development agencies are fully committed to ensuring an equal distribution of job creation opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions, in particular the Border, midlands and west region, of which Ballinasloe is an integral part. The State development agencies, under the auspices of my Department, <Col N="956"/>will continue to work closely together and with local interests in promoting Ballinasloe for additional investment and job creation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne, to the House. This is a very important issue for Davitt College in Castlebar as it is an important facility for the students and people of Castlebar and the surrounding area. The college, which has over 700 students and an excellent teaching staff, is located in the centre of Castlebar. Attempts have been made over many years to secure funding for the proposed sports hall, which is badly needed by the college and the town.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In 1998, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, approved the allocation of £200,000 for a physical education hall which had been fully approved at a cost of approximately £1.5 million. The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said there would be no queue jumping when he published a priority list for schools building projects in January 2003. Davitt College appeared in section 6 of the building projects list for large-scale post-primary schools. The then Minister announced in 2003 that the project would complete its current stage of architectural planning and proceed to construction in 2004, subject to financial constraints. As all planning stages were completed by Davitt College earlier this year, the project is now ready to go to tender. Although the Minister said there would not be any queue jumping in respect of the list which had been approved, a number of schools in counties Galway, Limerick and Meath came from nowhere in 2003 to overtake schools such as Davitt College. People are annoyed when such things happen.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.3]?>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, will have good news for us this evening. In response to a parliamentary question asked by Deputy Kenny last March, the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">The budget announcement on multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a framework for the building programme. It will give great clarity about projects that are not progressing in this year&rsquo;s programme, including Davitt College. I will make another announcement during the year.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I hope the Minister of State will make such an announcement this evening and that it will contain good news for Davitt College and the people of Castlebar. If not, the Minister&rsquo;s statement at the time will be seen as nothing more than a ploy in the run-up to this year&rsquo;s local elections.</P>
      <P>The proposed sports hall is badly needed by an excellent school, Davitt College, and a large town, Castlebar. All the planning stages have <Col N="957"/>been completed and the project is ready to go to tender. When will it go to tender?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Paddy Burke for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s proposals for a new sports hall at Davitt College in Castlebar, County Mayo. The Department received an application from Mayo VEC for a physical education hall at the college in March 1996. The proposed project was included in section 8 of the 2004 schools building programme. I am pleased to inform the Senator that the project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning, a full design team has been appointed and the architectural design of the project is progressing. Departmental officials have received a combined stages 4 and 5 submission from the VEC on the detailed design and the bill of quantities. That is the final stage of the design process before the invitation of tenders.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Department of Education and Science are reviewing all projects that were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 schools building programme, including the sports hall project at Davitt College, with a view to including them in the multi-annual schools building programme from 2005. The Department intends to publish the 2005 schools building programme, which will operate in a multi-annual framework, after the current Estimates and budgetary process has been concluded. I thank the Senator again for raising this issue in the Seanad.</P>

    <Title>Live Cattle Exports.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss this important issue this evening. Following last week&rsquo;s announcement that P&amp;O Ferries will withdraw its service on the Rosslare to Cherbourg route from 19 December next, I ask the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to intervene immediately to ensure that access to continental Europe markets is not interrupted. This important issue has significance not only for the Department of Agriculture and Food but for all Departments. I am sure the Minister will raise the matter at Cabinet level.</P>
      <P>Urgent action is needed before the looming deadline if cattle prices, particularly weanling <Col N="958"/>prices, are to be maintained. This issue, which has been discussed for some time, has been brought into sharp focus by the decision of P&amp;O Ferries to end its service on the French route. The Government should act now to secure an alternative arrangement that will guarantee continued access to ferries for Irish farmers and exporters. The problems of on-off service should be cleared up and a genuine service should be put in place.</P>
      <P>This problem has particular significance for County Clare, which is one of the top three counties for calf registration. It is possible that farmers in the county will be those worst affected. The Minister of State is aware that most cattle born in the county are sold as calves and weanlings. There is a huge need for live exports to continue if we are to maintain a vibrant market.</P>
      <P>As an island nation, Ireland has a significant disadvantage because the only viable access to its market is by sea. The assistance of the Naval Service, which has great experience and expertise, should be called on to protect the industry, if necessary. It provides a similar service to the fishing industry, with which the Minister of State is familiar, by protecting fish stocks in Irish waters. The navy could readily operate ferry services on behalf of the State to ensure that our vital national interest is protected. The Army is utilised by the State when bus workers or fire fighters go on strike. I do not think it would be unusual to ask the Naval Service to provide its navigational skills at sea to manage a ferry in this way.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s live export trade is extremely important for the beef sector, which is worth &euro;1.5 billion, in terms of price competition and market outlets. Access to the EU Single Market should be guaranteed for Irish livestock farmers and live cattle exports, particularly in light of the introduction of decoupling, which will have an effect on the price of calves and weanlings as all Senators are aware. The live export of such animals, which has increased significantly in recent years, is vital if we are to sustain a level of profitability in this sector. There is a fear among many farmers that meat factories will not have any competition without a healthy live export trade. The Minister is well aware that a lack of competition in the farming sector leads to lower prices, which in turn leads to financial ruin and disaster for farmers. Senators would not like that to happen and neither would the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The live export trade, which is worth over &euro;150 million per year, involves the export of over 200,000 cattle. The Minister of State knows that many such cattle originate in my county and other counties along the western seaboard. Ireland is further marginalised following the European Union&rsquo;s increase to 25 member states because it is on the western periphery of Europe. It is one of the few island nations with no viable alternative to get to the markets. It is possible to use the land bridge over England for many dry goods <Col N="959"/>which are exported, but that bridge cannot be used for live cattle as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis. I would welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s thoughts on the crisis point we have reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Dooley for raising this important issue. I emphasise that the Government has consistently stressed that live exports provide a vital and legitimate market outlet for the livestock sector. The Government&rsquo;s role in the promotion and preservation of any commercial trade is to create an environment in which it can be conducted in an economic and sustainable manner and which allows it to make the maximum possible contribution to the economy. The preservation of Ireland&rsquo;s animal health status, the international reputation of its veterinary certification services and the existence and application of a framework that ensures that good standards and welfare considerations are taken into account are key elements in the case of live exports. In each of those areas, our record is exemplary.</P>
      <P>My Department&rsquo;s function regarding the transport of livestock by sea is to approve vessels based on statutory requirements regarding the protection of animal welfare. The actual provision of such services is a commercial matter. In that regard, however, I am aware of the recent announcements by both Irish Ferries and P&amp;O regarding services from Rosslare. Approval for the carriage of livestock on roll-on, roll-off vessels is considered on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the characteristics of the individual vessel, whereas specific statutory requirements apply across the board where dedicated livestock vessels are concerned. Within that framework, my <Col N="960"/>Department has approved 18 dedicated livestock vessels and three roll-on, roll-off vessels for the carriage of cattle since 1995 and works closely with applicant companies for approval to ensure that the conditions aboard such vessels are consistent with national and EU animal welfare requirements. Officials of my Department met a prospective service provider last week on the matter.</P>
      <P>The trade provides a valuable outlet for categories of younger animals and, as the Senator has pointed out, a degree of competition, thereby sustaining prices. Bearing that in mind, I can assure the House that my Department will continue to discharge its responsibilities regarding the live trade by ensuring that any such applications are dealt with in a thorough, professional and efficient manner and that our animal health status continues to allow producers access to markets in the EU and elsewhere. I can also assure the House that the Minister will take a direct personal interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>We consistently monitor the situation. This afternoon, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and I had meetings with senior officials in the two Departments to try to encourage a new entrant to the market. We hope that we will succeed. It will take a great deal of debate, dialogue and discussion, but I assure the Senator that we are working flat out to ensure that we retain a livestock trade.</P>
