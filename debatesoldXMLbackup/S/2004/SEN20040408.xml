	<P>I have received notice from Senator Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to substantially increase funding under the DION fund to relieve the plight of hard pressed Irish emigrants in Britain, particularly in the light of the recent RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; special programme; and the need to assist in the purchase of the Cricklewood centre for emigrants which is closing down.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian Hayes of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to clarify the reason school wardens employed by various local authorities, unlike other seasonal workers, can no longer obtain payment when out of work.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the reason she has not made a decision regarding the need or otherwise for work permits for postgraduate medical and nursing students on courses here where work is an integral part of the course of study being undertaken, with particular reference to the Euro College Institute of Education.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 &mdash;<?oasys [jy?>Committee Stage (Resumed), to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until<?oasys [jy?>2.30 p.m.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader indicate when it is intended to bring the social welfare (amendment) (No. 3) Bill before the House to allow for the Government&rsquo;s U-turn in respect of cutbacks against widows? I take this opportunity of apologising to every Member of the House opposite on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs for allowing them to vote against a measure they did not believe in on 24 March&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is not relevant on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and then landing them in it on Spy Wednesday. I would like to apologise on her behalf.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question on the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the Government has now, thankfully, yielded on this cutback against widows, what about the other 15 cutbacks that were announced in the Social Welfare Bill and in the Finance Bill this year? When will we see the other about-turn on those measures? Will the Leader provide time for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to come into the House to state categorically that the Government will bring in legislation to allow for this U-turn so that widows will not lose out financially? It is important that she is on the record of this House in that regard rather than running outside the House on Spy Wednesday and leaving her colleagues in the lurch.</P>
    <P>On an entirely separate matter, on Tuesday Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Bradford raised the issue of the way we deal with victims of the 35 years or so of violence in Northern Ireland. There is an open debate on this issue. A former leader of my party has outlined his support for a truth and reconciliation commission. I remain to be convinced of the need for such a commission but it appears that if we are to have an inquiry in respect of one of the unfortunate victims caught up in the Northern Ireland situation we must have an inquiry in respect of all the victims. There would be merit in this House debating the way we deal with the victims of Northern Ireland violence because they are the forgotten group. They have not been dealt with adequately in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and if there is to be any review of the Agreement, we need to review how we deal with the victims of that violence, North and South. We cannot have a hierarchy of victims. We cannot ensure that one group of victims is dealt with by way of an inquiry while another group is forgotten. A debate on that <Col N="351"/>matter in the House would be very useful because there are many voices which would add to such a debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise two issues, and perhaps we could have a debate on them in the weeks following the Easter recess. The first is No. 10 on the non-Government motions list in my name and those of Senators Norris, O&rsquo;Toole and Henry. The reason I believe it would be appropriate to raise it now is because it relates to declarations of interests. Our own declarations of interests will be released shortly, as will those of the Members of the D&aacute;il &mdash; that is a different and debatable issue &mdash; but I have a real problem with two groups which do not have to issue their declarations of interests, one of which is the Judiciary. I have never been able to understand the reason judges who make important decisions which affect a large number of people do not have to declare their interests and assets when making those decisions in case a serious conflict of interest arises.</P>
    <P>The other problem is that a presidential election is coming up and it would appear that if any candidate is nominated from the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, their declarations of interests will be in the public arena but if the sitting President goes forward, she will not have to declare her assets. That is an unfair position in which to put people because information on one candidate will be in the public arena but information on the other will not. A sitting President has to sign law and refer matters to the Supreme Court and those assets which he or she holds may involve them in a conflict of interest. No. 14, motion No. 10, on the Order Paper is now particularly relevant in terms of a presidential contest.</P>
    <P>We need a commitment to a debate on the issue of property. Yesterday&rsquo;s report represents a superb platform for debate for this House and it would be appropriate to discuss it here. I congratulate the chairman of that committee on somehow persuading all those diverse opinions to sign a report of that sort. While I do not agree with it all &mdash; nobody could &mdash; it raises extremely relevant, pertinent and controversial issues, which we should take the lead in debating in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not want to refer to the particular report in any detail, it is a model of how the Oireachtas can deal with a difficult and controversial issue and establish a consensus view. Another difficult issue has now been presented to us, which could still be addressed by that process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We could solve a problem, if it exists, by a process of consensus and agreement, which would eliminate the risk so eloquently described by Senator Minihan last night of a debate degenerating into something most <Col N="352"/>unpleasant and untoward. We could still refer the question of a proper definition of citizenship to the same committee that was able to deal expeditiously and efficiently with the question of property and I wish we would do so.</P>
    <P>Last week in Iraq four Americans were brutally murdered under conditions that nobody could justify. Yesterday a rocket was fired at a mosque. It is time that countries like ours demanded a fundamental change in the way in which Iraq is being governed and the way in which so-called security is being protected in Iraq, and raised questions about the definition of freedom, which bans newspapers. It is almost impossible to ban a newspaper in the United States no matter what it incites. Armed militia can make the most extraordinary claims and because the United States is in many ways a free society, such things cannot be banned. Apparently in Iraq, the same apostles of freedom banned a newspaper and, as a result, created the circumstances under which many young Americans and many more Iraqis have been killed.</P>
    <P>It is worth recording that objective analysts have concluded that at least 10,000 Iraqi civilians have died in the past year. Mr. Hans Blix now believes that the situation for ordinary Iraqis is worse than it was under the brutal regime of<?oasys [jy?>Saddam Hussein. It is time for Ireland, which currently holds the Presidency of the EU, to initiate a serious debate based on more than US interests and sloganeering.</P>
    <P>I compliment the widows of Ireland on the effectiveness of the lobby they conducted, which transformed Fianna F&aacute;il back to somewhere it used to be, on the side of the excluded and marginalised. Perhaps it is an augury of a future in which Fianna F&aacute;il rediscovers its roots.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator come back to us?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to today&rsquo;s Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not shifted all my life; it is Fianna F&aacute;il that moved. In the process of rediscovering itself, perhaps it could look at the other 15 cuts and in particular, given the daft notions that emanate from the Minister for Education and Science occasionally, it could look at the back to education allowance and its effective destruction as an encouragement to those from underprivileged backgrounds to continue in education, which is one of the stated objectives of the Minister for Education and Science. The back to education allowance was a simple, effective and workable way to help those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    <P>Could we occasionally hear from somebody here about the process of government? A description was given yesterday in another place of a fairly chaotic process of government, in which Ministers were continually interrupted by people bringing delegations to meet Ministers to such an extent that people could not remember <Col N="353"/>who they had met or what business they were doing that day. What sort of system of government is governed by perpetual interruptions by delegations? I thought we had a system of collective government. I now know it is a system of collective interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to highlight a worrying development in some areas of Dublin whereby a number of GPs in the city have requested the health board to fund security men for their surgeries. There has been an upsurge in violent attacks on GPs and their staff. According to the GPs, this is as a result of the numbers on methadone treatment and is at its worst during long weekends and holiday time. I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the matter. A number of organisations around the city have pointed out that there is an upsurge in the use of cocaine particularly among young people, which should also be debated as soon as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Science to take action as quickly as possible on a report issued today by the INTO which indicates the number of male primary teachers is declining at an alarming rate. The Cathaoirleach will be aware of the concern expressed by the GAA over the years at the decline in participation in hurling as a consequence. Other social problems will result because of the decline in the number of male teachers at primary level.</P>
    <P>During those formative years it is important to have a gender balance. Operating within the legal framework, the Minister should create a mechanism to address this gender imbalance. Action needs to be taken as quickly as possible as we approach the period during which recruitment to the teacher training colleges will take place. Over the past five years, only 10% of students were male, which will have very serious consequences. Of approximately 25,000 primary teachers, only 17% are male. The age profile of those clearly indicate that there will be a serious decline in coming years.</P>
    <P>I support what Senator Brian Hayes and Senator Ryan said about the back to education allowance. We discussed this matter in the House before Christmas and concerns were expressed by many in the disadvantaged sector. This should be the next cutback on which to have an assault.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday on the Order of Business, I raised the case of the murdered solicitor Mr. Pat Finucane in the context of a public inquiry. As the House is aware, this case was one of the subjects dealt with by Judge Cory with regards collusion by the security forces in a number of murders in Northern Ireland. The public inquiry obviously will not happen in the near future. Nationalist and Unionist tears are deserving of equal compassion and consideration. I am very supportive of the point made by Senator Brian Hayes on this matter. I met a large <Col N="354"/>group of families here in recent weeks, all of whom lost loved ones in the North of Ireland. It was most emotional to listen to their experiences. Ultimately, humanity must underlie everything we do on this matter. We must respect everybody&rsquo;s rights in this regard. I would be very supportive of any forum or method by which this can be done.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution, of which I am a member, yesterday launched a report on property rights. The Taoiseach, who requested the report, ironically was unable to launch it because he was appearing before the Mahon tribunal, which is examining certain land rezoning and corrupt payment issues. The report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution contains measures which could deal with the issue of land speculation and any corrupt payments by capping the price of land and so on. I ask that the Leader invite the Taoiseach to come to the House to update us on whether the Government will implement the measures contained in the report as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification of the announcement today of the reversal of the cut in unemployment benefit for widows. The position in that regard is unclear from the newspaper reports. What will be the position of lone parents who lost the same entitlement in respect of stamps paid? Will the decision to cut their entitlements also be reversed because not to do so would be very unfair? I welcome the proposed reversal of the decision in regard to widows.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the report in today&rsquo;s newspapers that the Road Safety Authority is of the opinion that one third of all fatal road accidents and one quarter of accidents involving pedestrians are alcohol related, will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport to make a special plea to all road users this weekend to slow down and not to drink and drive and to ask pedestrians to take care on their way home? Perhaps next Tuesday we will read that there have been no fatal accidents on our roads over the weekend.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Following Senator Ryan&rsquo;s comments, it is important senior politicians here provide us with facts rather than stories on events nine or ten years ago. I compliment the Leader on her ability to recollect events.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is not relevant to the Order of Business, although I appreciate the Senator was anxious to mention it. The Senator should confine his remarks to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mental Health Commission strategic plan was recently published and sets out the objectives of that body for the coming years. I have raised this issue on several occasions in the House. It is important that plan is implemented. The dreadful facilities and accommodation in <Col N="355"/>some of our mental institutions have been raised on many occasions. It is important the Minister for Health and Children comes to the House as soon as possible with a commitment to provide funding to implement that plan, which is vitally important. It is the first of such plans to come on stream.</P>
    <P>It is also important the House holds a debate on planning issues as soon as possible in light of the proposed changes to the regulations on motorways, landfill sites and incinerators and the proposed zoning of land in that regard in close proximity to towns and villages. The Government is considering a number of proposals for hazardous waste sites. Rumour has it that one of those sites will be located in the north Midlands. The Curragh was mentioned as was a location close to the homes of the Leader and I.</P>

	<P>The Senator is scaremongering.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important this issue is not dealt with in a cloak and dagger manner and that there is transparency. The public should be told the truth in terms of the location of such facilities. The Government is saying one thing and local councillors, in the run up to the local elections, are saying something else. We want the facts before the local and European elections.</P>

	<P>Order, please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Tuffy that we should have a debate on the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. It would be worthwhile teasing out what action it is necessary for the Government to take. While it may be unprecedented, it would be appropriate to invite the chairman, Deputy Naughen, who has done a great deal of work on this issue, to attend the House to deliberate on it. We have invited MEPs to the House and it should also be possible to invite a Deputy because he is familiar with the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has a short memory. The former president of his party, Proinsias De Rossa, when Minister for Social Welfare gave a £1.80 per week increase to the elderly.</P>

	<P>The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors has stated that the number of armed detectives in the Cavan-Monaghan region has been cut by half. No new detective has been appointed in the past 12 years. There are still many serious threats to the security of the State. Criminals are aware of the problems within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are aware of the lack of garda&iacute; being appointed. They are targeting particular areas of the country. In the past six weeks my shop and others have been cased by such criminals. There will be a serious crime epidemic in the next six months unless something is done and the garda&iacute; get the resources necessary to tackle increasing crime. In six months&rsquo; time, I do not want the Minister to come into this House and say that we are tackling it. I want it tackled now, because crime and drugs will be prevalent in our constituencies unless we get those 2,000 garda&iacute; promised at the last general election.</P>

	<P>On a technical point, last week a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights issued its consideration of the Barron report. Since that report was made to the two Houses of the Oireachtas, for the Government to take that further it must be debated in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. I therefore ask the Leader to arrange that at an early date so it might then be formally raised by the Government with its British counterpart. We should have a debate early after the resumption of sittings.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>So far this year, 100 people have died on the roads, 20 more than last year. That shows the penalty points system has failed miserably. It is time the Government led by example. We have heard about a dedicated Garda traffic corps being set up. The Taoiseach has said that it will go ahead, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has said it will not. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, does not know what is to happen. It is time we achieved clarity on the issue. We need a dedicated traffic corps, not just for the weekend, as Senator Kitt said, but all the time. It is appalling that a quarter of fatalities involved pedestrians. It is time we brought in laws in this House to force pedestrians to wear bright, reflective clothing on roads. That would help cut down fatalities. There is an onus on pedestrians to wear bright clothes and we can play a role in that.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>Recently I have heard rumours about the introduction of a zero alcohol limit for drivers. I would be completely opposed, since it would be the death knell for rural communities. While I accept that alcohol is a factor in some fatalities, it would be an absolutely knee-jerk reaction. I have previously raised in the House the incidence of drugs being found in the bodies of people involved in fatalities. We must accept that drug-driving is also a significant issue. Drugs also impair people&rsquo;s vision. We should examine that area too.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ulick Burke about<?oasys [jy?><?oasys [ic20]?>primary teachers. There is a wider issue, and the lack of promotional prospects for teachers is reflected in the lack of male teachers applying for positions. We all accept that teachers have a very good starting salary, but that remains on a plateau for a long time. It is important we acknowledge that women teachers do great work in sport. However, it is important that men have a substantial role in teaching too. As a teacher, I was amazed when parents came in <Col N="359"/>to see me. Their children might have a male teacher for the first time ever in fifth or sixth class and be very apprehensive. After a few weeks, they would accept it. It is appalling that children get as far as fifth or sixth class without ever having a male teacher.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>In the new term, perhaps we might have a debate on the tribunals again. People have certainly been bemused lately that we currently have a prisoner and a former prisoner asking questions at tribunals and masquerading as senior counsel when they are barely out of jail themselves or are currently in jail. That is farcical, and we should examine the whole purpose of tribunals. I also raised the issue of senior counsel quizzing people about donations when it emerges that the same people are earning five times that amount per day.</P>

	<P>I strongly support the remarks of Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Hayes pertaining to the victims of violence in the North of Ireland and elsewhere. Recently, I was present when a group came down and met members of all parties. The revelations made on that occasion were heartbreaking to say the least. I am a great believer in and supporter of members of the security forces, like everyone else in this House and outside it, I am sure. However, when they are involved in betraying the trust of those who pay their wages through taxation by colluding with murderers to kill decent, innocent people, it is time to stand up and call a halt. I strongly support the concept of a public inquiry into this matter. I am disappointed the inquiry pertaining to the murder of Pat Finucane has been postponed, though I do not know for how long or whether it is with a small or large &ldquo;p&rdquo;. I hope that it proceeds as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On another matter, there is strong evidence to suggest that society is inclined to look the other way on the pushing of soft drugs such as marijuana and cannabis, the attitude being that it is normal nowadays. Cannabis and marijuana are gateway drugs and are themselves the pathway to disaster for many young people. We have had many debates, but I ask for another in this House with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explore ways and means and perhaps make suggestions whereby new laws could be brought into force to combat this very serious matter.</P>

	<P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, asked about the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. He was appreciative of her about-turn but asked what we had done about it. We have done a great deal about it, and I am very pleased that she has done that. The Senator asked how it was to come about. It does not require legislation and will come into force very quickly through regulation. The Senator also spoke about the victims of violence, speaking about Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Bradford and how we deal with victims of violence from all groups rather than concentrating on one sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross mentioned the declaration of interest &mdash; motion No. 10 on the non-Government motions list. He asked about the Judiciary and its interests, as well as those of a sitting President. The Standards in Public Office Commission has been set up by legislation to deal with such matters. I understand, though I have no knowledge of the matter other than through my personal dealings as a Senator, that from time to time it reviews the circumstances under which various groups must declare an interest. I have no difficulty in passing on the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion to the commission.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan raised the property report. We should debate that in this House immediately when we return, since it is very comprehensive and requires intense reading. However, it is very worthwhile doing so, and I hope we can show a range of views. The Senator also mentioned Iraq, and of course the situation there is terrible. Hans Blix was correct when he said it is worse now than it ever was, even in the time of Saddam, evil as he was. The Senator complimented the widows on their campaign. I too thought they ran a very good campaign. They were full of dignity and yet did not go on about it. The back to education allowance is something we should hone in on and I had hoped the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, would have been able to come to the House before Easter, but that was not possible. It is hoped he can address the House early in the new term.</P>
    <P>Senator Brady spoke about general practitioners, some of whom need security for their surgeries because of methadone. He has asked for a debate on the drugs issue. We received a comprehensive report on drugs in recent days from the National Drugs Advisory Board. That could be the main feature of the debate, which will take place after Easter.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke spoke about male teachers. Despite what he said about the relatively low number of men in teaching, it is male <Col N="361"/>teachers who are appointed principals. He said that only 17% of teachers in primary schools are male, yet something like 80% of principal posts are held by men. That is another question altogether and it is extraordinary. I agree that combined male and female influences on young people in schools are good. I have often thought it harks back to the idea that when children start primary school, normally at aged four, they are still regarded as being just out of infancy. It is a wrong notion, perhaps, but it is generally accepted that a woman might be a better influence on the child at that particular stage. Men cannot be given extra allowances simply because they are male. That would be absurd. However, this is a social issue that needs to be debated. Teaching is a good career but I do not know how we can approach a debate on the issue. There is a need for gender balance in primary schools. In secondary schools and comprehensives, etc, the balance is much fairer.</P>
    <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the Pat Finucane case. He agreed with Senator Hayes about the levels of anguish among Nationalists and Unionists. He said the anguish is the same and that humanity should be the bottom line in dealing with such matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy, who is a distinguished member, along with others, of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, dealt with property rights and land speculation and asked if the Taoiseach would address the House. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, would be the appropriate person to talk about it because it falls into his lap. She asked about the lone parent&rsquo;s entitlement and that will be queried. They are caught in the same trap, I believe.</P>
    <P>Senator Kett made a plea for the curtailment of drink this bank holiday weekend, given that so many people will be on the roads. It would be amazing if we could have an accident-free holiday weekend. However, it would be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon is welcome back to the House. I know he was not well.</P>

    <P>Senator Mansergh noted that it was a mark of strength for people to change their minds when a matter was being reviewed.

  <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following definition:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;&lsquo;Mental Health Tribunal&rsquo; means the Mental Health Tribunal established under Part III of the Mental Health Act 2001 with <Col N="363"/>the additional condition that when determining matters in relation to a patient detained under this Act the Chairperson shall be a Judge of the Court which exercised criminal jurisdiction in relation to the patient;&rdquo;.</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys [is9p0]?>&mdash;(Senator Henry).</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be in compliance with the provisions of the Constitution or the European Convention on Human Rights to provide that matters relating to persons with a mental illness should be reviewed by a judge who had previously exercised criminal jurisdiction in the case. The body, therefore, that it is being established under statute in this case, is intended to make a decision independent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the trial judge.</P>
    <P>There are merits to preventing the possible confusion between the mental health tribunals, on the one hand, and the Mental Health Commission, on the other. I am receptive to the proposition that a more distinctive title, such as the criminal insanity review board, be given to this body. It is important that people distinguish between the bodies which perform such useful functions under the existing mental health legislation and the body that will be the deciding authority in respect of people who have been judged not guilty by reason of insanity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not argue with the Minister on the rights and wrongs of having a judge on the body, as he has greater expertise than me in this area. However, it would be wiser to treat mentally ill people the same way. We are hoping that these people are being detained in a medical facility. International obligations on the treatment of people with mental illness, such as UN principles and Council of Europe regulations, require that everyone is treated in the same way. I was sorry that the Immigration Act contained a clause preventing entry to individuals having attacks of florid schizophrenia. This is not allowed internationally. Instead, it is an obligation that some care be taken of the individual. If a person is mentally ill, he or she should be detained in a hospital. I know the Bill states it may be a prison but it is hoped that they are detained in a secure unit in a hospital with other people who are mentally ill but have not committed any crime. Those people may have been prevented from carrying out a crime but could be just as dangerous. The people covered by this Bill do not appear to have half the protections given under the Mental Health Act. Why is this so?</P>
    <P>The Mental Health Commission is already established and must have in its composition a lawyer with ten years&rsquo; experience ending immediately on his or her appointment to the commission. This cannot be a non-practising lawyer who has been brought forward simply to sit on the commission. The Minister informed the House that consultant psychiatrists&rsquo; advice will be <Col N="364"/>taken. However, many of them have advised that it would be wiser to have mentally ill people reviewed under the mental health commission tribunals. The Minister is right that a political officeholder should not be the person making the decision as to whether these people should be detained or allowed go free. Having looked again at the Mental Health Commission, I do not mind what recommendations the Minister makes as to who should be the chair. I assumed it should be a lawyer but it is fine if a judge is not constitutionally correct. However, I hope the Minister will look at the amendment again and see if the existing structure could be used rather than inventing another one. The body would have the same knowledge of these cases and the same type of people &mdash; although they have committed crimes &mdash; would be dealt with. The general public will understand this.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, during Private Members&rsquo; business on the proposed constitutional referendum, the Minister informed the House that the public was sophisticated enough to understand that it was not a racist issue. However, when discussing this Bill, the public has to be told that people are insane in capital letters because of possible confusion over the term &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;. Either the public is capable of understanding these matters or not. The public will understand if the mental health commission tribunals investigate such cases and decide whether the individuals should be detained.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys [ic20]?><Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In the neighbouring jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, the verdict given in such cases is &ldquo;not guilty by reason of insanity&rdquo;. This conveys to ordinary people what is meant and we cannot be too precious about language. The ordinary Josephine and Joe Soap on the street will understand that an individual has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. It is better to stick to that particular description. In 30 years time, the term may be considered outdated or relevant to a different age. However, it conveys an appropriate meaning and is easily understood.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>I do not see why the tribunals, established to decide whether mentally ill people have been appropriately committed and properly detained in the context of the civil law governing mental health, should be brought into play in this particular measure. What is needed is a body that will deal specifically with the decisions that must be made concerning people who have been acquitted of serious crimes on the grounds of mental incapacity. It is important that a dedicated body that specialises in that function should be established. I see no advantage to marrying the Bill to the Mental Health Act.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>People are being dealt with differently because one person is detained in time before committing an awful crime. The responsibilities of the tribunal members are just as serious. Getting a person with a serious mental <Col N="365"/>illness who has violent intent into hospital before he killed or injured someone does not mean there is less of a responsibility than if one is dealing with someone who actually committed a crime before they were committed to an institution. It would be better to deal with everyone in the same straightforward way. However, the Minister does not agree with me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are equally serious issues but public confidence in the law must be maintained. If an individual is acquitted by reason of insanity, the public must know if it is appropriate for that person to be released. Until now, it has been my unhappy chalice to make a decision as to whether the individual should go free from the Central Mental Hospital on the basis that he is cured. When he signs his decision on the file, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform knows, in the back of his mind, that he will not be easily forgiven by the public, the relatives of the deceased and, possibly, the relatives of a second victim if he makes a mistake and his decision turns out to have been wrong. It is a matter of huge gravity. If we remove that power from the Minister, as a member of the Executive, and confer it on another body, we must do so very solemnly. We must retain public confidence in decisions.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry knows &mdash; she could write the script &mdash; what will happen if the body makes an incorrect decision, if a repeat offence takes place as it has on previous occasions or if people are released in circumstances that give rise to controversy. One can imagine the reactions of the relatives of the victims of the first and second offences, just as one can imagine what the media would make of it all. Such thoughts enter my head from time to time when I sign one of these orders. I wonder if I am getting it right, if I can be sure and if I will be willing a day later to stand over the decision as absolutely right.</P>
    <P>A specialised board is being established, with the solemnity and formality that attaches to it, to deal with such decisions. That is not quite the same as somebody complaining that they have been wrongly committed to a mental institution against their wishes on flimsy or inadequate grounds, that psychiatrists have made the wrong decision about them and that they are entitled to go free. It is a question of public perception. Regardless of the individual ingredients of the decision, the people&rsquo;s confidence in the system will have to be fully maintained.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by Senator Henry. A psychiatrist who is deciding whether somebody should be committed, or whether somebody&rsquo;s committal should be continued, is making decisions of equal gravity, in theory and in fact. I accept that if the person is released onto the street, he or she might do something terrible. There may be an original set of victims, but the potential exists for a second set of victims. I refer to persons who have been excused criminal liability for what would otherwise have been a very <Col N="366"/>grave crime, most likely homicide. One must be certain that the decision-making mechanism one puts in place in such circumstances is independent of the Executive. Those making decisions should not have to spend many days assessing run-of-the-mill appeals by mental patients against the way they are being treated or the way they were committed.</P>
    <P>This solemn business must command public respect and confidence because every decision will be subjected to very grave public scrutiny. The public never hears &mdash; thank God &mdash; about the vast majority of people who are committed to mental institutions or mental hospitals. People have no idea that such people have been committed and do not know when they are coming out. There is little public scrutiny of the circumstances in which such people enter or leave institutions. The tribunals are important as part of the private protection of such people&rsquo;s rights, but it is basically a private matter.</P>
    <P>The tribunal function under discussion is a public one, however. It will be subject to absolutely searing media scrutiny if anything goes wrong. The members of the tribunal will make decisions of the utmost gravity. Although such decisions may be taken in private, the members of the tribunal will be made publicly accountable for them, even if there is no subsequent misbehaviour. Even if the patient is fully cured and leaves the institution to live an exemplary life thereafter, some sections of the media will kick up an almighty fuss about the fact that he or she was released in the first place. They will demand that the decision be justified and stoke up public hostility to the decisions that were made. It is important, therefore, that there should be a dedicated separate body to make such decisions, in which the public should have significant levels of confidence. It should not just be called on to assess run-of-the-mill protests by patients with mental illness who feel they have been wrongly committed. Dealing with such protests will be the ordinary business of the mental health tribunals under the mental health legislation.</P>

  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following definition:</P>
    <P LI="2">&rdquo; &lsquo;mental illness&rsquo; means a condition which seriously impairs, either temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person and is characterised by the presence in the person of any one or more of the following symptoms:</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) delusions,</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) hallucinations,</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) serious disorder of thought form,</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) a severe disturbance of mood,</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>e</i>) sustained or repeated irrational behaviour indicating the presence of any one or more of the symptoms referred to in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>);&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I move this amendment on behalf of my colleague, Senator Terry, who cannot be here this morning because she has another engagement. I apologise to the Minister on her behalf.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; in the Bill includes a reference to the term &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo;. This amendment proposes that a definition of &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; be included to give more detail. It would be helpful to define &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; in this section. The definition proposed by Senator Terry is taken from mental health legislation in New South Wales. I ask him to consider the proposed definition. We have defined &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;, but we suggest that the Bill should go a little further by specifically defining the term &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; which is mentioned in the definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand where this amendment is coming from. I do not think it would assist the criminal justice process to set out five manifestations of mental illness and then say that is what &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; actually means. The phrase &ldquo;serious disorder of thought form&rdquo;, which is mentioned in the amendment, might be seen by some as setting the bar very low for criminal insanity cases.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister on this occasion. However, a section of this exact type was included in the Immigration Act 2004, the Schedule to which refers to &ldquo;delirium&rdquo; and &ldquo;hallucinations&rdquo; at the port of entry. One would need to shape up and to look pretty normal. If such a provision was included in the Immigration Act, why is it not being included in this legislation? Why is there such inconsistency in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? The Minister does not like this type of provision in this Bill, but he liked it in the Immigration Act. I agree that we should not include a list of symptoms and signs in legislation, but we did so in the Immigration Act.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="368"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>A decision to admit to Ireland a person who is mentally ill is not the same as a decision to acquit a person of a crime on the basis that he or she is mentally ill. The approach that was taken in the Immigration Act was adopted to guide immigration officers and to suggest to them what they should do or what they should be concerned with. The acceptance of amendment No. 6 would tie down the criminal courts and the Judiciary, in respect of what is mental illness by setting down an exhaustive list of conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Henry&rsquo;s suggestion that I should adopt the same attitude in every Bill that comes before the House. I will not repeat the reasons why I do not have to adopt the same definition of &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; for civil mental health law and for criminal mental health law. I do not see why the same definitions should be adopted for people who are being refused admission to Ireland and for people who will be acquitted of very serious offences.</P>
    <P>I do not see any necessary connection. I draw the Senator&rsquo;s attention to the tyranny of consistency.</P>

	<P>Having been obliged to deal with matters in a practical manner all my life, while the Minister comes from a more esoteric realm, I know that if one tries to keep things consistent one comes out with a pretty good result in the end because everyone knows where they are supposed to be. We have international obligations &mdash; that is why I was so furious about the Immigration Bill. If someone looks as though he is having a florid attack of schizophrenia we are not supposed to put him back on the aeroplane to Manchester but should deal with him here.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>

	<P>Section 20 permits me to commence the Act, while section 9, by contrast, permits me to appoint an establishment day for the purpose of section 10. How can we have a situation in which I would be obliged to come before the House and have the establishment day and the commencement revoked? I do not think it would be a good idea to provide for the possibility of my commencing this Act and then being told 21 days later that I cannot commence the Act &mdash; that the process has juddered to a halt. Not every order under a statute must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s reasonable point that I should be accountable to the House for the manner in which, for example, I designate centres under section 2(1), I will be fully accountable. I will be answerable to the Oireachtas in this regard. Anyone who is dissatisfied with the way in which I am carrying out that function will be able to find out what I am doing through a parliamentary question and censure me or put down a motion of no confidence during Private Members&rsquo; Business. I do not think accountability <Col N="370"/>requires me to constantly lay orders before the Houses about the premises that will be designated centres.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, subsection (1), line 27, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, on the advice of the Inspector of Mental Health Services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This is an easy one. I am delighted to see that the Minister for Health and Children will be consulted, but we should not expect him to know exactly how things stand in the various mental hospitals of the country. It would be a good idea to allow him to rely on his Inspector of Mental Health Services.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>One thing that worries me about the Bill is that it is written as though people think there are still locked wards in many hospitals, which is not the case. There are very few locked wards that would be secure enough to keep inside the sort of person the Minister described. These people would have to be sent to the Central Mental Hospital. However, if somebody was not dangerous the Inspector of Mental Health Services would be in a position to give the Minister advice. For example, it is always wise, whether a person is a prisoner or a patient, to try to keep him in a location near his home and family because one hopes that at some stage he may be allowed out of detention. It would be useful for the Minister for Health and Children to be able to have the advice of the Inspector of Mental Services.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Senator for tabling this amendment. In principle I accept that the Minister for Health and Children should consult with the Mental Health Commission rather than the inspector, who is employed by the commission, before making a designation. I am not prepared to give the inspector a veto over my <Col N="371"/>decision, which would be the result of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment. However, I will consider introducing an amendment on Report Stage which would have the effect of requiring me to consult with the Mental Health Commission before I make a designation.</P>
    <P>I cannot allow the possibility of a veto, which would mean that if there were a policy argument between me and the people in the area I could be told I could do nothing and the Act would become inoperable. However, I will go halfway down that road and say that I favour an amendment which would oblige me to consult with the Mental Health Commission when I am exercising these functions. I cannot allow a body that is not accountable to the House to have a veto over decisions. If I were in dispute with that body I could, broadly speaking, make the Act inoperable.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I will rephrase it in a way the Minister would like. I asked that the Minister for Health and Children should consult with the inspector of mental services but that does not mean that the inspector has a veto. The Minister may think it is rubbish and proceed to do what he wants, anyway. The commission is very likely to ask the advice of its inspector, who is its employee and is obliged to inspect everywhere once a year and more frequently if possible. From a practical viewpoint, one cannot expect the Minister for Health and Children to travel the country to inspect places, whereas the inspector of mental health services is obliged to do so. If the Minister would prefer it to be done by the commission, that is fine, but it should be done on the advice of the inspector. I am not saying the Minister has to take the inspector&rsquo;s advice.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, subsection (1), to delete all words after &ldquo;designate&rdquo; in lines 27 and 28 down to and including &ldquo;centre&rsquo;)&rdquo; in line 31, and substitute &ldquo;an approved centre within the meaning of the Mental Health Act of 2001&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I wish to insert this wording because it is considered inadvisable, and is not considered therapeutic, to establish psychiatric centres in prisons. I have just been discussing the possibility of problems arising with detaining people in various parts of the country but such detention should mean detention in a hospital. I do not like referring back to the Mental Health Act 2001 but it would be better if we concentrated on getting people into hospitals and other specialised in-<Col N="372"/>patient facilities if necessary. It is not a good idea to settle for having an approved centre in a prison or any part thereof.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The designation of centres where persons will be accommodated, as covered by the terms of the Bill, is a matter for the Department of Health and Children in consultation with my Department in cases where such centres are located within a prison. That clearly illustrates the duality of responsibilities involved in the provision of care and treatment for persons who have been found by a court to be unfit to be tried, or found not guilty of an offence by reason of insanity.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>On the other hand, there may be rare situations where it might be appropriate to detain a person in a prison rather than a psychiatric hospital. That, unfortunately, is the reality of the situation. We cannot rule out the possibility that at some stage the requirements of public safety might override other considerations and that a person may have to be detained within the confines of the most secure facility available. I am talking about a rare phenomenon or possibility &mdash; a Hannibal Lecter kind of situation &mdash; where it would be necessary for somebody to be kept in the most secure accommodation possible. In such a case, no mental institution, including even the Central Mental Hospital, would be appropriate for that person. Any concerns about the treatment, care and well-being of a person detained in such circumstances are met by the provision of the Bill governing the establishment of the new mental health review board and by the extensive provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>I wish to indicate to the House that I will be proposing an amendment to this section on Report Stage, clarifying the position concerning the Central Mental Hospital to make it clear that the Central Mental Hospital is a designated centre for the purposes of this legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>This runs counter to the First UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Prisoners 1955, which was approved in 1957. That congress listed standard minimum rules for prisons, one of which stated that &ldquo;Prisoners found insane shall not be detained in prisons and shall be removed to mental institutions as soon as possible.&rdquo; The same set of minimum rules went on to suggest that &ldquo;All other mentally ill prisoners should be treated in prison, but their treatment should be of an acceptable medical standard&rdquo;. I will examine the Minister&rsquo;s proposed amendment on Report Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, subsection (1), line 32, to delete &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;care and treatment in conditions of high, medium or low <Col N="373"/>therapeutic security as designated by the Inspector of Mental Health Services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I am concerned about the use of the term &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo; in the Bill because &ldquo;care&rdquo; can mean controlling and detaining a person. It is unfortunate to use the term &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;. My amendment seeks to substitute the words &ldquo;care and treatment in conditions of high, medium or low therapeutic security as designated by the Inspector of Mental Health Services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My concern in this regard is the use of the term &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;. It has been suggested to me that &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; means one has to have a cure, but that is not so. I have looked up the meaning of &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; in medical and legal dictionaries. In one medical dictionary, &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;the means employed in the management and care of people&rdquo;. It does not mean that a cure will be possible. <i>Butterworth&rsquo;s Legal Dictionary</i> states that &ldquo;treatment in relation to disease includes anything done or provided while alleviating the effects of the disease, whether it is done or provided by way of cure or not&rdquo;. The definitions are much the same and, therefore, I think people are entitled to both care and treatment.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo; makes it look like the care is custodial &mdash; as it involves detaining the person &mdash; and the treatment is optional. The Minister should insert the term &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo; in this section. I am also suggesting that the centres should be designated as high, medium or low security. The matter that concerns me most, however, is substituting the term &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo; for &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two main difficulties with the amendment. The first is that the functions of the inspector of mental services are set out in section 51 of the Mental Health Act 2001. It does not appear to me that they can be read as including or inferring a power or function such as is envisaged in the amendment with regard to the designation of conditions of security in psychiatric facilities.</P>
    <P>Second, following discussions with the Department of Health and Children, I am considering tabling an amendment on Report Stage to the definition of &ldquo;psychiatric centre&rdquo;, which will meet the intention behind the Senator&rsquo;s amendment. It will allow in-patient facilities, which are not hospitals, to be designated under the Bill. I also intend to add the words &ldquo;within the meaning of the Act of 2001&rdquo; following the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; in section 2(4), line 43, page 4. As to the Senator&rsquo;s point about the term &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;, I will deal with that specific issue when we come to amendment No. 21.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, subsection (3), line 37, to delete &ldquo;Part IV of the Act of 2001&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;All of the protections of the Act of 2001, including Parts III, IV, VI and any other parts relevant to the independent review of the involuntary admission of such persons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I move this amendment because these mentally ill people should have the protection of the Mental Health Act 2001.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 relates to consent to treatment and its inclusion in this legislation ensures the protections in the Act regarding consent to treatment are also extended to persons who are treated in psychiatric centres under the legislation. It would not be appropriate, therefore, to extend the provisions of the remaining Parts of the Mental Health Act 2001, which relate mainly to the process of independent review of involuntary detentions, to persons detained under the provisions of this Bill because that function is being assigned to the review board to be established under the legislation and, therefore, I am opposed to amendment No. 13.</P>
    <P>I would like to consider amendment No. 129. It is a matter on which the Minister for Health and Children will have views and, following consultation with him, I will return to the House on Report Stage regarding the issue. It is a reasonable provision and I have no objection to it in principle.</P>
    <P>I would like also to consider amendment No. 130 in the context of section 13(6). I have concerns about powers of arrest of civilian staff of designated centres under section 13(7) and I will examine the issue between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I oppose amendment No. 13 because the consent to treatment provisions are guaranteed while the review of involuntary detention is being assigned to the review board that will be specifically established under the Act. I am attracted, in principle, to amendments Nos. 129 and 130. I want to consult the Minister for Health and Children on amendment No. 129 and I will consider amendment No. 130 carefully between now and Report Stage in terms of what to do about that issue.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 4 subsection (4), to delete lines 41 to 43, and substitute the following definition:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;&lsquo;relevant designated centre&rsquo; means the designated centre at the appropriate level of security for the part of the country where the patient ordinarily resides, or the Central Mental Hospital.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The amendment proposes a practical measure, which it would be wise to include. People should, if possible, be placed in secure units as near as possible to their families because it is important that prisoners should maintain contact with their families. Few patients in the Central Mental Hospital receive family visits. That is why I tabled the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>While I fully agree with the Senator that it is desirable that visiting should be facilitated, I cannot accept the amendment because the term &ldquo;relevant designated centre&rdquo; would mean the designated centre at the appropriate level of security for the part of the country where the patient ordinarily resides or the Central Mental Hospital. That means one could not be sent to an institution with the appropriate level of security or the Central Mental Hospital if it was not local. It would be unwise to introduce such a constraint into the system. However, I fully agree patients should be able to receive visits. Distance is not the predominant factor in the non-visiting of patients. There are other more dominant factors.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) An accused person is presumed to be fit to be ready to be tried unless the contrary is shown.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The amendment is proposed to provide additional clarity and certainty. All persons should be presumed fit to stand trial until the matter of insanity is raised and adjudicated upon. The Minister should not have great difficulty with the amendment, as it is not contrary to the policy underpinning the Bill. I hope he will accept it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that I do not accept the amendment. It would introduce a<?oasys [jy?>presumption in an area where it is not necessary or desirable. The court should have an open mind on the issue of whether somebody is fit to be tried and should not make a presumption one way or another. De facto, there is a day to day<?oasys [jy?>presumption that, unless the issue is raised, no inquiry is held into it. The amendment would <Col N="376"/>create a hurdle for the court or the accused to surmount if it wanted to establish that the accused was unfit to be tried. There should be a level playing field on which there are no presumptions one way or the other and the court should inquire into the issue when it is raised on an entirely neutral basis, objectively, and without an inherent presumption regarding the way it approaches the issue.</P>
    <P>The other reason it is unnecessary is that, as a matter of common sense, a court proceeds on the basis that everybody before it is fit to participate unless it receives a signal in the other direction. De facto, the courts do not ask everybody whether they are fit to plead and they do not normally inquire of the solicitor for an accused whether his or her client is in a position to plead. The issue only arises in most cases where there is an issue in somebody&rsquo;s mind. It is unnecessary to introduce a presumption in that context and it could, in the minds of some judges, raise a bar which the accused&rsquo;s representative would be bound to hurdle before getting to the correct decision. It is probably better to leave things without presumption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not a great difference between us. The de facto position is that the presumption is there. Normally if a person stands trial, he or she is considered to be fit to do so. We seek to add certainty. I take the Minister&rsquo;s comments on board but the presumption already exists. The Minister stated the amendment could create difficulties because people might seek to use it as an opt-out clause but, under the legislation, one can only say one is unfit to stand trial if one can prove it. I sought the inclusion of the amendment to provide clarity and certainty but, in a sense, it is there already. I will bow to the Minister&rsquo;s wiser judgment.</P>

    <P FLI="0">This is self-explanatory. It would be wise early in proceedings if a person is suspected of being mentally ill to have him or her seen by two approved medical officers. Seeing that he or she will be sent to a place of detention, one doctor should be the clinical director of the designated centre. Certain people may be so disturbed they have to be detained in prison and the clinical director may be able to tell the court if the facilities capable of containing the person were available. It would be of assistance to the court and the judge if this information was available at the beginning.</P>
   
   </Speaker><Col N="377"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am opposing this amendment and the more I hear the argument in favour of it, the more I am opposed to it. Section 3(2) states:</P>
    <P LI="1">An accused person shall be deemed unfit to be tried if he or she is unable by reason of mental disorder to understand the nature or course of the proceedings so as to-</P>
    <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) plead to the charge,</P>
    <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) instruct a legal representative,</P>
    <P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) make a proper defence,</P>
    <P LI="1">(<i>d</i>) in the case of a trail by jury, challenge a juror to whom he or she might wish to object, or</P>
    <P LI="1">(<i>e</i>) understand the evidence.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I see no reason for the requirement that the opinion of two doctors, presumably with psychiatric experience, be a prerequisite to making a decision which would stare a judge in the face. Sometimes one sees people in court who clearly are unfit to be tried. There is no need to bring two doctors to tell the court what is blindingly obvious and the person is probably well known to the court as somebody who is unfit to be tried. There is no point having a trial if the person is unable to participate because of his or her florid behaviour. In my view, having two doctors in those circumstances would not be practical.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Henry has perhaps let the cat out of the bag because what she is really saying is that nobody should be going down that line unless two doctors have given the green light as to whether there is a facility suitable to contain him or her. We cannot have a situation where the psychiatric profession or its representatives have a veto over a decision as to whether somebody is fit to plead, based on whether the facilities are available to deal with him or her. One is either fit to plead or not; the consequences of that are a different matter. We cannot have a situation where a doctor can say the facilities are not available or that the person caused a great deal of trouble. Section 3(2) provides basic protection for the accused and I do not believe that two psychiatrists or doctors of any kind should be allowed to override the court&rsquo;s function, which is not to proceed with a trial if subsection (2) applies.</P>

    <P>Section 3(2) states &ldquo;if he or she is unable by reason of...&rdquo; Would it be better to substitute &ldquo;incapable&rdquo; for &ldquo;unable&rdquo;?

	<P>I am opposed to this amendment for the reasons I mentioned before. The court has to make certain decisions, but the view of the person who is associated with the institution to which the person being dealt with by the court may be sent is not determinative of the issue. I do not want to give a veto or a quasi veto to psychiatrists in these institutions. I do not want a situation where effectively they can say they do not wish to receive a person. A function of the Central Mental Hospital is to deal with the patients sent to it, not to determine in a consultative role what the outcome should be of decisions leading to people being sent there.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="379"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is all very well, but there are no practical provisions in the Bill to make available resources to allow people to be maintained at the facility. The Minister is aware of the utterly appalling condition of the Central Mental Hospital. Approximately 30 beds at the hospital are unavailable because of an embargo on staff recruitment. What is the hospital supposed to do with people sent to it given the lack of accommodation? I suggest that whoever is running the facility must be given some say as to whether the hospital is in a position to take people in. If all 100 beds were operating but full, how would the hospital accommodate an extra ten people sent to it?</P>
    <P>One must consider the practicalities at some stage. The receiving facility will face a very serious problem if it is not in a position to place persons sent to it in safe custody. What is the hospital to do if it has no room to spare? I suggest the hospital staff should be listened to for that reason rather than to encourage the Minister to provide them with a power of veto. The Bill&rsquo;s enactment will lead to a requirement for resources only in the case of the review board. That is not so. The mental health services will also require resourcing and, certainly, money, to detain people properly. If the clinical director of the relevant centre has no beds available, he or she should be permitted to inform the courts. It is not a question of providing a veto; it is one of practicality.</P>

	<P>It is appalling.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I came to a number of conclusions about the facility. It is a sub-standard institution situated on grounds which must have a colossal value. It is an amazing irony that a substandard institution should be squatting on an asset which ought to be realised to provide adequate mental health facilities. That is very strongly my opinion.</P>
    <P>I found it difficult to understand why some of the sub-standard rooms, which are<?oasys [jy?>indistinguishable from cells, in the older building are open while more modern accommodation in a wing added in the 1970s or 1980s is closed. I could not understand the logic of how such a<?oasys [jy?>situation could come about, yet it is the case. I could not understand how, when the Prison<?oasys [jy?>Service can put a television into every cell in nearly every prison, somebody convicted of no crime is not provided with a similar facility in secure accommodation at the Central Mental Hospital. Considering the value of the asset on which the hospital is physically located, the <Col N="380"/>regime determined by the inadequacy of the buildings and the circumstances in which unconvicted persons are, in some cases, required to spend substantial parts of their lives, the matter requires extremely urgent attention.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>I make no secret of my view that the asset value of the current site should be realised to build a modern forensic psychiatric institution to the highest standards somewhere else. I found it dispiriting and slightly grotesque that one could be on grounds of such value but be faced with an under-resourced institution with a physical environment, in which staff and patients are required to exist, which is of a quality wholly indefensible in the 21st century. I am not criticising the staff for this state of affairs; I am saying that these appear to me to be incontrovertible facts. I have spoken to colleagues about this matter. I am strongly of the belief that the asset value of the land should be converted to build at a different location a forensic psychiatric institution of which we can all be proud. That should and could happen sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I find the current situation to be deeply unsatisfactory. Psychiatrically ill prisoners must have available to them an institution at which they can be securely treated for illnesses which may have nothing to do with the circumstances of their convictions but which may emerge during their terms of imprisonment. It is in that context that when I was first appointed I immediately toured some of our prisons, saw the padded cells currently in use and came to a very clear view that the practice of using them should be ended. Proper observation facilities for people who are psychiatrically ill should be put in place. Senator Henry has probably seen padded cells. The European Committee on the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has commented adversely on them. In their present form, which I am glad to say is being phased out, they are wholly indefensible as a means of dealing with psychiatric and psychological problems in prisoners. In some cases it is like being put into a shower cubicle with little or no light or ventilation. Prisoners are left in their underwear in semi-darkness lying on the floor of a rubber room about twice the size of a large fridge. That is not acceptable in the 21st century.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>I encountered the problem that people were being placed in these institutions while argument and debate went on as to whether they should or should not be accommodated in other, more suitable accommodation. That is not acceptable either in the 21st century. Senator Henry is pushing an open door with me in pointing out inadequacies and resource issues. Common sense must intrude when looking at a campus in Dundrum which must have a value of between &euro;60 million and &euro;80 million. If only half that sum were devoted to building an adequate forensic psychiatric treatment centre somewhere else, sig<Col N="381"/>nificant progress could be made and we could have an institution of which we were proud rather than one from which, at best, we must avert our<?oasys [jy?>eyes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware the Minister visited the Central Mental Hospital. Like him, I am very shocked by the padded cells in use. When the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, opened what the press called his &ldquo;estate agency&rdquo; for State property, I organised a Private Members&rsquo; debate in the House on selling something to pay for the building of a new central mental hospital. One problem with that site is that the old hospital is so antique there is a preservation order on it. It is one of the most antique medical institutions in Europe, and that is a serious problem. We might have to use part of the ground to build a new hospital.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I profoundly disagree with that proposition. It should be moved elsewhere. Whatever difficulty exists with that building should be addressed by either redesignating it or by a planning decision which would allow it to be converted into apartments or whatever with major internal structural alterations. Preserving it as it is and using that campus for the purposes of the Central Mental Hospital is a decision to keep &euro;80 million locked into an unsatisfactory situation. The facility could be provided in a more convenient location. I am not in favour of rebuilding on the current site as it would be a waste of public resources.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 5, subsection (3)(<i>b</i>), line 25, to delete &ldquo;approved medical officer&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;clinical director of the specified designated centre&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In terms of the clinical director, any doctor will not do in this case. Whoever receives this person has to be in a position to say whether the insti<Col N="382"/>tution is capable of taking him or her. The Minister will say they cannot have a veto over that but from a practical point of view I would have thought this would be useful.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the section generally, under the provisions of section 3(6) the approved medical officer is the consultant psychiatrist who will be treating the person concerning the designated centre. He or she would be the most appropriate person to provide the court with an opinion as to whether the person has a mental disorder. In any event, most consultant psychiatrists would consult with the clinical director of their centre in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department of Health and Children agrees with the principle that the treating psychiatrist should be consulted before the court commits or, perhaps more appropriately, refers a person to the psychiatric centre for an assessment. I also understand that Department considers that the period might be reduced from 28 to 14 or even fewer days. In those circumstances, I am prepared to examine the provision, consult further with the Department on those issues and come back on Report Stage with appropriate amendments.</P>
    <P>Before we end the debate on section 3, I would prefer to give the House some indication that I am thinking of including a further ground for unfitness in regard to a person&rsquo;s inability to elect for trial by jury in the case of an indictable offence. Sometimes one has to make an election as to whether one wants to be tried in the District Court or the Circuit Court. That right of election is just as important as, say, the right to challenge a juror at a later stage when we get to jury trial. I may bring forward a Report Stage amendment to that effect.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 5, subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) line 29, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I explained earlier the reason I believe it is important to use the term &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;. The custodial element of care is being preserved and separated from treatment but as I pointed out to the Minister when I discussed it earlier, treatment does not mean one necessarily has a cure. The medical and nursing professions would be in a terrible state if we had to say that every treatment would cure a person.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the points made by Senator Henry in support of the amendment and I would be very concerned that any <Col N="383"/>possibility might exist that people with certain conditions might be left to one side untreated or simply cared for. As this is solely a health issue my Department has discussed the matter with the Department of Health and Children and it favours the term &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo; as used in the Bill, which is also used in other legislation, because it affords greater flexibility. However, I note that in certain areas of this Bill, and this is the tyranny of consistency, we also refer to the &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo;. I exemplify sections 11 and 12 where &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo; is used. In those circumstances, between now and Report Stage I will examine that issue, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, to determine if we find a different approach more attractive.</P>

    <P FLI="0">We tabled this amendment because we believe that under the Bill as it stands, the return for trial process will be skipped.

    <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (8), line 9, after<?oasys [jy?>&ldquo;alleged&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;excluding any reference to a specific intent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I did not think it up on my own and was given advice on this matter as follows:</P>
    <P LI="1">This has caused confusion and difficulty in the jurisdiction of England and Wales since &ldquo;act alleged&rdquo; can be taken to mean the offence alleged. Where the offence is murder, a person may be technically found to have committed murder when if found fit to plead they would have had available to them the defence of diminished responsibility (see R -v- Antoine [2000] UKHL 20;[2000] 2 All ER 208 (30th March 2000). Similar problems can arise even in relation to offences such as theft where the capacity of a mentally disordered person to form mens rea can be severely impaired e.g. due to significant intellectual disability. It is essential that this section should specify that &ldquo;act alleged&rdquo; does not include any element of the mens rea for the offence as charged. In the alternative, in each case the trial should proceed to consider whether the person accused at material time had the mental capacity to form the requisite intent.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="386"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 4(4) states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Where on a trial for murder the accused contends&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) that at the time of the alleged offence he or she was suffering from a mental disorder such that he or she ought to be found not guilty by reason of insanity, or</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) that at that time he or she was suffering from a mental disorder specified in section 5,</P>
    <P LI="2">the court shall allow the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to prove the other of those contentions, and may give directions as to the stage of the proceedings at which the prosecution may adduce such evidence.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">Provision is made for a lesser offence, based on the absence of <i>mens rea</i> in that context. However, it is related to murder. The Senator&rsquo;s point is not confined to murder and there are many other cases where the <i>mens rea</i> is important, such as knowingly, deliberately or dishonestly doing things. The law uses various different degrees of mental intent to distinguish offences. I will consider this matter between now and Report Stage. I am not clear in my own mind whether the issue should be addressed generally and, if so, how this should be done. I am grateful to the Senator for raising the issue.</P>

    <P FLI="0">Under the provisions of section 3(8), if it has been determined that the accused person is to be tried, the court can consider whether there was reasonable doubt as to whether the accused committed the act alleged. If such doubt is established, the court could order the accused to be discharged. In cases where a court does not find that such reasonable doubt exists, but there is no full trial, the person could then subsequently be found fit to be tried. We believe that publishing the information that the judge did not have reasonable doubt as to guilt would be prejudicial to the defendant.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), line 26, to delete subparagraph (iii).</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P FLI="0">This is an important amendment. I have a copy of the third interim report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Mentally Ill and <Col N="388"/>Maladjusted Patients. As far as I am aware, the McNaughton rules, when first published, did not contain a section on the defence of &ldquo;irresistible impulse&rdquo; and that it in fact arose out of case law. Many people believe it folly to include this in the Bill because everyone will be claiming they had an irresistible impulse to do something. For example, the Minister spoke yesterday of kleptomania. A constant plea of those who sexually abuse children is that they had an irresistible impulse to do so and could not stop themselves.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>It is foolish to include such a provision in the Bill. It is not included in the legislation of any other country. It certainly is not included in UK legislation. I have been told that some states in America have included a similar provision. I suggest, no matter how great the wisdom of those judges who decided a person had an irresistible impulse to commit a particular crime, it is not wise to continue with the provision for such a defence in the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator raises an interesting point. The purpose of the Bill in terms of the test for insanity for the purposes of criminal law is to restate the current position as it exists in judge-made common law. The third limb of the test for insanity as it exists in our law and, as set out in section 4(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii) of the Bill, is known as &ldquo;irresistible impulse&rdquo;. It has lightly been referred to as the &ldquo;policeman at the shoulder&rdquo; case. In other words, would the person have still committed the act if a policeman had been standing right beside him. An affirmative answer indicates the test is met.</P>
    <P>I stress that to constitute this form of insanity, the person must have had an irresistible impulse and not an unresisted impulse and it must arise from a defective reason due to a mental disorder. The defence of irresistible impulse was clearly accepted by the Supreme Court in the case of Doyle <i>v.</i> Wicklow County Council in 1974 although earlier cases had given indications that it might well form part of Irish law. In the 1994 case of the People, at the suit of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> Courtney, the Court of Criminal Appeal stated unequivocally that<?oasys [jy?>irresistible impulse is a limited form of insanity recognised by our law.</P>
    <P>The Senator may be interested to hear the following. In English law, the celebrated <i>Criminal Law Textbook</i>, from which I learned my criminal law many years ago, Kenny suggested that it had been overlooked that from earliest times the common law recognised an irresistible impulse of a temporary character as a ground of partial excuse in the case of homicide committed under the emotional stress of provocation. He cited early English authorities which suggest that an insane irresistible impulse should be admitted as a defence because it meant that the act was not voluntary. Since then, the English Court of Criminal Appeal rejected a defence of irresistible impulse. Senator Henry will be interested to <Col N="389"/>know they described it as a fantastic theory which, if it was to become part of our criminal law would be merely subversive.</P>
    <P>The English courts will not recognise an irresistible impulse as a symptom from which a jury might deduce insanity but the issue is not so relevant in the light of the statutory defence of diminished responsibility in homicide cases. The defence of irresistible impulse is not recognised in Australian law as an independent ground of insanity. There is much law on this issue but I will not waste the time of the House reading it out. The information is available in McCutcheon&rsquo;s <i>Criminal Law</i>, page 1,113 and following pages.</P>
    <P>This fantastic theory is part of Irish law. The question is one of whether I should close it down. I have not attempted in this Bill to restate the common law test but to take it as a given and to restructure our law accordingly. What the English courts refer to as a fantastic theory has been solemnly confirmed on two occasions by the Irish courts. I would need to be heavily persuaded about the removal of this provision.</P>

    <?oasys [ic20]?><P FLI="0">This amendment refers to a special verdict in the case of a conviction. However, there is no special verdict in relation to a conviction and this amendment is not, therefore, necessary. Yesterday, the Minister mentioned he was retaining the reference to &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; to ensure there is a very high threshold for those giving such a verdict. There will be concerns, and have been in the past, that a person found not guilty by reason of insanity will possibly serve a short time in a psychiatric institution and will then be free to go. The doubts expressed in the past continue to exist. It is important the high threshold to which the Minister referred is in place. Presumably the legislation will be monitored as it progresses.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>

    <P>Amendment No. 38 not moved.</P>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) Where a person has been found guilty of an offence but, prior to passing sentence, the court becomes of opinion that the person is suffering from a mental disorder, the court, in imposing sentence, may direct that the sentence shall be served in a specified designated centre until such time as the person is no longer in need of in-patient care and treatment and shall thereafter be served in a prison or place of detention.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to address the situation where a person has been found guilty but, during the trial process, it becomes clear to the court that the person is suffering from a mental disorder though not one which would result in him or her being found not guilty. In such a situation, it should be possible for the court to make an order on the care of that person. The matter has also been raised in some commentary on the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a difficulty with this point. What the Senator is speaking of is a person, during a court case, exhibiting symptoms of mental disorder or illness which would enable the judge to convict and sentence that person on the basis that he or she was able to understand the trial because of his or her fitness to participate in the trial but that he would order that a portion of the sentence be served in a psychiatric institution. That would effectively give to the judge the role now carried out by the Irish Prison Service on advice: that a person convicted and committed to its care should be treated psychiatrically. Such a provision would give to a judge, other than in the context of guilt or innocence or fitness to participate in a trial, a new right to state that although a person was properly tried and convicted and should serve a prison sentence, he or she should serve such sentence in a psychiatric institution. That carries many implications with it, since it suggests that psychiatric institutions are substitute jails. Serving a prison sentence in a psychiatric institution could characterise such institutions as something that they are manifestly not, which is a place for the incarceration of guilty people as punishment. I am not happy with that mixture of punishment and treatment which lies at the heart of this amendment conceptually. Someone could be guilty and require to be punished but be punished by being sent to a psychiatric institution. I am not convinced that is a good idea.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment&rsquo;s intention was not that the person be sent to a psychiatric institution for punishment, but for care. The problem is that there would be a great many prisoners in need of such treatment. The Minister said that the Prison <Col N="391"/>Service deals with that currently, but is it doing so satisfactorily?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My argument in that regard is that, even if that is the case and there are people to whom this could apply, one is saying to a judge that, in addition to all the other functions, he or she now also has jurisdiction to direct that someone whom one is sentencing should serve part of that sentence while receiving care in a psychiatric institution. That would require a very substantial panoply of advice and I would be tempted to say that Senator Henry&rsquo;s duo would certainly have to come along on that occasion and say whether they wanted to receive someone in those circumstances. On balance, it is better for the Prison Service to make decisions of that kind rather than the Judiciary. If the judge wishes to make a recommendation that someone needs psychiatric in-patient treatment and that the Prison Service should have regard to it, that is one thing, but directing that a person should be sent to such a facility while serving his or her sentence is replete with all sorts of implications that I simply cannot accept on the hoof.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (4), line 10, to delete &ldquo;for murder&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for any offence <Col N="392"/>which on conviction carries a sentence of imprisonment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I was not clear why the Minister decided on murder alone. Let us suppose that the person is accused of a serious crime such as rape or a serious assault which did not go as far as killing the victim, should the accused not also be in that position? Even for lesser offences, the District Court comes into the situation. Should the accused not be able to use this section too rather than only those on trial for murder?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Where, in a trial for murder, the accused contends that, at the time of the alleged offence, he was suffering from mental disorder such that he ought to be found not guilty by reason of insanity, or that at the time he was suffering from a mental disorder specified in section 5, the court shall allow the prosecution to produce evidence tending to prove the other of those contentions and may give directions as to the stage of the proceedings at which the prosecution may produce such evidence. The relevance of this is that murder is an offence with a mandatory sentence. With all other offences, one is either guilty or not guilty and if one is guilty, the question of the appropriate way to deal with one is addressed in sentencing. Murder is a special case, with a mandatory sentence attached to it, and that is why, in this case, the provision applies.</P>

	<P>The existing law covering drug dealing under the 1999 Act mentions exceptional circumstances, which I have exemplified. However, I do not want to go down that road with commercial drug dealing. Someone is either guilty of it or not. It is not necessary to have such a provision.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision&rsquo;s purpose is to allow the prosecution in the specified<?oasys [jy?>circumstances to adduce evidence regarding the mental state of the accused person. It is based on section 6 of the English Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964. It makes it clear that, if the defendant claims to be insane, the prosecution can try to prove diminished responsibility and, similarly, if the defendant pleads diminished responsibility, the prosecution can adduce evidence to prove sanity. Without that provision, there could be some doubt as to what evidence could be called by the prosecution in such cases. <Col N="393"/>It merely facilitates the calling of evidence in certain cases.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a simple answer which might not be obvious, however. An &ldquo;approved medical officer&rdquo; is defined as somebody practising in the State. If we use the term &ldquo;consultant psychiatrist&rdquo;, it will allow somebody from abroad to discharge the function. There is no great mystery about it. The term &ldquo;approved medical officer&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it under the 2001 Act. One has to be geographically located in the Irish State. The term &ldquo;consultant psychiatrist&rdquo; which seems to mean the same thing does not carry that limitation.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (3), lines 42 and 43, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;or if any&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;been convicted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am interested in hearing what the Minister has to say about this amendment. I am talking about lines 42 and 43 of the Bill. Unless my understanding is incorrect, it appears that, under this provision, when an appeal is heard in the Circuit Court, the judge will be in a position to find persons guilty of offences in respect of which they ought to have been convicted. It is extraordinary that it can be declared a person ought to have been convicted of a charge which, if I am correct, may not have been laid during the original trial. Perhaps there is a good reason this provision should be inserted but it does seem to be an extraordinary power to give an appeal judge: that a person may, retrospectively, be found guilty of an offence in respect of which the judge decides he or she ought to have been convicted and presumably ought to have been charged with, even though neither applied.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There are references in subsections (3), (5), (8) and (9) in this section to &ldquo;offences other than the offences charged&rdquo;. This is to take account of cases where a person charged with one offence may be convicted of a different one. If, for example, a person is charged with murder and found not guilty by reason of insanity and the Court of Criminal Appeal considers the applicant was suffering from a mental disorder but that the act in question would have amounted to a lesser offence of manslaughter, the court should still dismiss the appeal. Logically, if an amendment is proposed to subsection (3) which deals with appeals to the Circuit Court, it should also apply in other courts such as the Court of Criminal Appeal, as provided for in the other sections. I do not propose to accept the amendment. If one looks at the bottom, there is a bracketed phrase, &ldquo;by virtue of the charge&rdquo;. It is not a matter of a judge saying, in effect, &ldquo;I find you not guilty of rape but guilty of larceny&rdquo;. It only arises where there is a choice open on the charge.</P>

	<P>Under section 12, can the review board recommend the discharge of a patient if it believes he or she is no longer liable to carry out a certain action? I have personal experience of the problems that can result from such a situation. The review board is often asked whether the person in question is likely to re-offend. One cannot give a definitive answer to that. Anyone in this Chamber could commit murder, although I hope none of us ever does. If a review board agrees that a patient is likely to re-offend, he or she is then detained. I have personal experience of a person being detained for 12 or 14 years, even though deemed by a number of psychologists and psychiatrists to be no longer insane following a year in the Central Mental Hospital. Is there any provision for a person to be discharged? I have been reading the Bill very quickly and may have missed some reference.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The powers that can be exercised include the power of making orders subject to conditions. There is no absolute certainty in this matter. To some extent one is looking into a crystal ball, and one cannot be certain as to what the future will bring. One must however make a fair decision regarding the person. Currently, such decisions are taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day on the basis of advice available to him or her. It is undesirable that this should be the case, because such Ministers even on the best occasions have to look over their shoulders to consider what the media might say if they get things wrong. The tribunal will at least be regarded as separate from the political process, and it will be expected to act without regard to media sensitivities. I trust however that it will have to take into account the fact that public confidence in its decisions must be upheld. It is better that these matters be dealt with by a group rather than by someone who goes to bed that night wondering if he or she will be out of office the following day if a wrong decision has been taken.</P>

If the staff member sees the person at a later stage and must then get a garda, he or she will lose sight of the individual. It is desirable that we are not inflexible in these situations. I will look at the amendment again but I am not convinced that the Garda should be the only force capable of carrying out these functions. There may be circumstances in which it would be dangerous to say that someone who is in a position to act cannot do so. Under criminal justice <Col N="400"/>legislation, everyone has the power of arrest for an arrestable offence where the penalty is over five years. This is not the same case but I want to review the practicalities of making the officers or servants of the designated centre incapable of using power of arrest. One will be told, particularly by the trade unions, that the officers will walk on by in circumstances where they do not have the legal power to return an individual to the centre of detention. The common good may require that people in these circumstances must act.</P>

	<P>I would be grateful if the Minister reconsidered the amendment in these days of better communications with mobile telephones and the like. One frequently hears the Garda advising members of the public not to approach certain individuals because they are considered dangerous. I would not like psychiatric institution staff members to believe they had an obligation to arrest an abscondee and risk possible serious injury.</P>

   <?oasys [ic20]?><Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. I do not know whether he saw the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; special investigation into the plight of Irish emigrants in Britain but it was a most graphic expos&eacute; of the squalor in which thousands of Irish people live in London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester. Seeing is believing. I believe &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; did a considerable public service by illustrating the squalor and deprivation endured by Irish emigrants.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>We should examine the backgrounds of the people in question. Who are they? They are Irish emigrants who could not find employment here. They were forced to emigrate because they wanted the dignity of work. They worked hard and helped to build Great Britain. Many of those who sent millions of pounds to relatives and friends in this country are now totally deprived, ill and old. Some are disabled, having endured hardship by working in arduous conditions. The tenements in which many of them are living are not fit for human habitation. A large number of the people to whom I refer are homeless.</P>
    <P>This country has a social, moral and political obligation to look after its people. Assistance for emigrants is administered under the DION fund. The name of the fund comes from the Irish word &ldquo;d&iacute;on&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;roof&rdquo;. DION is underfunded &mdash; just &euro;2.5 million is available, a derisory amount when one considers the needs <Col N="403"/>and demands of those I have mentioned. The Government&rsquo;s priorities are apparent when one recalls that it made &euro;15 million available to the Punchestown project.</P>
    <P>A special task force was established some years ago to examine the plight of Irish emigrants and make recommendations. Some 18 recommendations were included in a report submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs in November 2002 but few, if any, have been implemented. Given that it is mainly a question of funding and resources, the task force&rsquo;s key recommendation was that the minimum amount needed to administer help to Irish emigrants overseas was &euro;18 million.</P>
    <P>Fr. Paul Byrne is one of the people charged with looking after immigrant welfare in Britain. He said on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; that he had telephoned an official in the Department of Foreign Affairs, with whom he had been in contact previously, on the day a report was published to find out how much additional funding had been allocated. He said he was absolutely devastated when the official said, &ldquo;I am sorry, Father, not one red penny more.&rdquo; It is obvious, therefore, that the Government has neglected and abdicated its responsibility to emigrants.</P>
    <P>The problems I have outlined will get worse because one of the main centres in which Irish emigrants in Britain who are not able to look after themselves are cared for, Cricklewood Homeless Concern, is for sale. A fund-raising effort is ongoing in an attempt to ensure the<?oasys [jy?>Cricklewood facility is retained as a welfare centre but a substantial amount of money is needed to buy it. If the centre closes, the plight of those who live there will get considerably worse. Many of them will be sent onto the streets. My home county and province have been bled white over the years as a result of emigration. I saw many from County Mayo, some of whom I know, on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. They are living in conditions of the most horrendous and abysmal squalor in London.</P>
    <P>We have to get our priorities right. The people I have discussed have an irrefutable case for assistance from the Government which has a social and a moral obligation to do what it has not done before now &mdash; to enhance considerably the DION fund and give humane relief to those who find themselves in such a plight.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, was interviewed at the end of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme because DION is administered by his Department. I have to say it was one of the most insensitive interviews I have ever seen. The Minister did not seem to have any feeling for the plight and needs of Irish emigrants. He did not seem to sense that we had an obligation to do something about their problems. He certainly did not give any ray of hope in respect of the Government&rsquo;s intention to address this difficult and important issue.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="404"/>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I speak on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who cannot be here because he is in Rwanda representing the European Union at the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the dreadful genocide that took place there in 1994.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to Senator Higgins who spoke about the DION fund and Cricklewood Homeless Concern. The Government has provided assistance for Irish emigrants abroad for many years. It demonstrated its commitment to protecting and supporting those abroad in December 2001 when it established a task force to examine policy on emigrants. The task force was charged with addressing &ldquo;the special needs of those Irish emigrants abroad who are particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion&rdquo; and developing a coherent, long-term approach to emigrants and their needs. The task force presented its report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the end of August 2002. The report contains many wide-ranging and far-reaching proposals. It sets the issue of emigrants in a forward-looking context and provides a template for addressing the needs of the Irish abroad in the future. In line with the recommendations of the task force report on emigrants, responsibility for the DION fund was transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 5 February 2003. The DION fund is administered by the embassy in London through the DION committee, an advisory committee set up in 1984 in response to concerns about the situation of Irish emigrants in UK.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>The total amount allocated in grants by the DION committee since 1984 is now almost &euro;18 million. More than half of this has been allocated since the Government took office in 1997. The DION fund has increased by more than 300% since 1997, from &euro;762,000 in 1997 to &euro;2.573 million last year. In 2003, some 57 organisations received DION grants totalling &euro;2.573 million. This was 5% less than the total allocated in 2002. However, later in the year a further &euro;150,000 was allocated directly to the Federation of Irish Societies in London from savings. This brought the total allocation to emigrant services in Britain to &euro;2.723 million in 2003, representing overall a slight increase &mdash; &euro;15,000 &mdash; on the 2002 figure.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>In 2003, more than half the fund &mdash; approximately &euro;1.3 million &mdash; went to vulnerable groups. Of this, &euro;873,000 was allocated to projects to support the older Irish in Britain, &euro;119,000 to projects for returning emigrants and &euro;332,000 to projects for Irish Travellers in Britain. Several of these projects involve social activities which have added health benefits, helping older people to continue to live independently. In addition, older Irish people have access to welfare organisations assisted by the DION fund which provide advice on welfare and health benefits available to them. It is clear that a substantial amount is being done <Col N="405"/>by the Government through the DION fund to assist elderly and vulnerable Irish emigrants in the UK. Although we sympathise with the plight of the individuals featured in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, it did not give a balanced picture of the level of support being provided.</P>
    <?oasys [cl10.5]?><P>Eighteen organisations now receive funding on a three year basis and this accounts for 47% of the fund. Multi-annual funding is generally accepted to have a positive impact on staff retention in voluntary organisations and leads to greater prospects for securing funding from the statutory sector. Last year the number of Irish people assisted by Irish welfare organisations funded by DION was in the region of 23,000, with a further 7,500 or so in non-Irish managed organisations &mdash; more than 30,000 Irish people in all. The employment impact of the DION grants is now significant. DION supported 100 voluntary sector jobs in 2003, double the number of jobs supported three years ago. The total number of staff in the organisations approved for funding was 703, which means that DION supported almost 15% of their staffing. Last year DION supported 35% of the voluntary sector jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs announced in December that he had secured an additional &euro;1 million in the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs for services to emigrants in 2004. This brings the overall expenditure on emigrant services by the Department of Foreign Affairs this year to slightly more than &euro;4 million, an increase of one third on 2003. He also hopes to be able to find some additional funds through savings in his Department&rsquo;s Vote later in the year which will enable him to increase this amount even further. In addition, approximately 60% of those who qualify under the pension scheme introduced by the Government in 2000 for people with pre-1953 contributions are living abroad, mostly in Britain. Approximately &euro;80 million will be paid in these pensions to Irish people abroad in 2004. Many thousands of elderly Irish people living in Britain will benefit as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs intends to allocate the bulk of the additional &euro;1 million to the DION fund. There is no doubt that the UK is the country with the largest concentration of vulnerable Irish emigrants. Accordingly, he was pleased to announce that a total of &euro;3.57 million will be allocated to the DION fund this year. This represents an increase of 30% over the total expended in 2003. Included in this amount is funding for a project by the Federation of Irish Societies to provide greater support to their affiliated organisations to improve their capacity to manage their services and secure funding from local sources in the UK. This capacity building support is vital to enable the Irish welfare agencies to make the most effective use of the funds provided by the Government and to assist them in broadening the base of their funding to encompass other available sources. The provision of support for capacity building was a key proposal in the task force report and this project is giving direct effect to that recommendation.</P>
    <P>The Cricklewood Homeless Concern is a voluntary organisation which was set up in 1983. It <Col N="406"/>offers day care and other care opportunities to homeless people and people in insecure housing in the north London borough of Brent and surrounding boroughs. In 2002, about 60% of the organisation&rsquo;s predominately male clients were Irish &mdash; 433 out of a total of 705. In 1983, the organisation was offered the use of a building at 60 Ashford Road through the good offices of the local parish. The building in question was the property of the Catholic diocese of Westminster and the CHC had rent-free use of the property for almost 20 years. It is the location of the day care centre. Following a decision by the diocese to sell the building, the CHC was offered first refusal and negotiated a purchase price with the diocese for more than £700,000. It is estimated that repairs to and modernisation of the building will cost a further £1 million. The purchase of the building was completed on Wednesday, 31 March. The next stage of the CHC&rsquo;s plans involves the refurbishment of the building and a donor has funded the centre&rsquo;s PR company to work on the funding for this for a further six months.</P>
    <P>The Cricklewood Homeless Concern centre has been supported by the DION fund since at least 1989. However, building projects and the provision of accommodation are outside the DION criteria for funding and the Cricklewood Homeless Concern centre has not directly approached the DION committee to seek funding for this project. However, the Irish ambassador in London has met a representative of the company which is spearheading the Cricklewood Homeless Concern centre fundraising and he has indicated that he will give his ongoing support for the centre&rsquo;s efforts to raise funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs welcomes and shares the concern of this House about to the plight of our emigrants abroad. We owe an enormous debt to our emigrants. Through their sacrifices and generosity they have helped to make a better life for their families at home as well as themselves. Our emigrants have been a credit to their communities and to their native country and we owe it to those who have not been able to succeed on their own to provide the assistance and support they need. However, we should see our emigrant experience in a wider context than that shown by the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. Most of our emigrants have created good lives for themselves and their children and have integrated well into their adopted countries. They have made significant contributions to those countries as well as promoting a positive image of Ireland abroad. We can be proud of their achievements.</P>
    <P>There is much more that can and should be done to help those who require special support. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will continue to implement the report of the task force and work in partnership with the Governments of the countries concerned and with the voluntary Irish agencies at home and abroad to support our emigrants overseas.</P>

	<P>I would have expected, given the importance of this issue, to see the relevant Minister, who has an intricate knowledge of this matter, as opposed to someone who comes in to read a script. We have raised this matter in the past and will continue to do so, despite the rather flippant and arrogant comments I have received to date from those on the other side.</P>
    <P>We heard about the Government&rsquo;s U-turn on widows&rsquo; social welfare benefits yesterday. I now ask it to do a U-turn on the treatment of school wardens. The problem that affects school wardens, who do a terrific job at our schools ensuring that children cross the road safely, is that they are effectively seasonal or temporary workers. Matters have been made more difficult as a result of a circular issued by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs at the start of the year. School wardens did not receive any social welfare payment, as they had previously, at the last mid-term break. When they queried this with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, they were told that eight and a half accrued holiday days must be used up before they were entitled to this benefit. This had never happened before. It is the result of a bureaucratic mindset in the Department and directly affects those, mostly women, who are doing very important work in this low-paid job.</P>
    <P>Previously, the recipients were entitled to have all their holiday days approved and to receive them in July when the school term was over. Most school wardens received some form of unemployment benefit in the fourth week of the summer break. The arrangements that were put in place by local authorities for school wardens varied from one area to another. I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs paragraph 20 of section 3 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which states categorically that favourable arrangements with school wardens and local authorities could be put <Col N="408"/>in place in respect of annual leave. Paragraph 19 of the same section gives an undertaking to employees that they have a right to an unbroken period of two weeks&rsquo; annual leave.</P>
    <?oasys [cl11]?><P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has stated that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, and her Department have misinterpreted the Act, in that this group of workers has no comparable status with other groups of workers within the economy. School wardens are unique; they are not employed by the school system but directly by local authorities. Consequently, when they cannot work because of breaks in the school year, they cannot receive the social welfare benefits to which they were previously entitled. These workers are frustrated. They feel they have been very badly treated and, thus, they are asking the Government to re-examine the matter.</P>
    <P>The new circular, which was introduced in January this year, has had a detrimental effect on school wardens. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, and her Department, should respond to the representations they have received to date. This matter has already been raised in the Lower House by way of parliamentary questions. The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 allows for flexibility between local authorities and school wardens. I would appreciate a positive reply in respect of this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been requested by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, to deal with this matter on the Adjournment. I am glad of the opportunity to clarify the issue. The position is that school wardens employed by local authorities can &mdash; and do &mdash; obtain employment payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs when they are out of work. Unemployment payments are made in these cases on exactly the same basis that applies to all other seasonal workers.</P>
    <P>Social welfare legislation provides for the payment of unemployment benefit in respect of days of unemployment. Any day on which a person either receives or has an entitlement to holiday pay is not regarded as a day of unemployment and a person has no entitlement to unemployment benefit in respect of that day.</P>
    <P>With the exception of people in school-related employment, people in seasonal, term or limited contract employment who claimed unemployment benefit, have always had to supply details of all holiday pay entitlements due during each temporary lay-off period. Unemployment benefit is not paid in respect of any day for which there is an entitlement to holiday pay.</P>
    <P>These long-standing arrangements were extended to people in school-related employment in 2003, following the application of the<?oasys [jy?>Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 in their case. The new procedures are designed to ensure that all persons on temporary lay-off from their employment are treated in a similar manner.</P><Col N="409"/>
    <?oasys [cl10.5]?><P>Full details of holiday pay entitlements must be provided in respect of each school vacation period, so that the level of entitlement, if any, can be determined. A person can only have an entitlement to unemployment benefit for any day of unemployment which forms part of a period of interruption of employment &mdash; that is, where he or she is fully unemployed for a period of at least three days in any period of six consecutive days. In addition, payment of unemployment benefit is not made for the first three days of unemployment, which are known as waiting days. However, where a person had a recent claim in respect of certain schemes, payment may be made from the first day of the claim.</P>
    <P>The position is, therefore, that unemployment benefit is payable to people who are laid off from school-related employment, on the same basis that applies to people in all other seasonal, term or limited contract employment. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has requested the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to advise all local authorities of this change in procedure, which brings the treatment of school wardens into line with that of all other people in seasonal employment.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs has specifically asked that local authorities be advised of the implications for those school wardens who, by arrangement with some local authorities, receive their holiday pay entitlements by way of a lump sum payment at the end of the school year.</P>

	<P>This Adjournment matter refers to an administrative problem. Eurocollege Institute of Education operates as the only dedicated medical English-language training school in either Ireland or Britain. It is one of fewer than ten such specialist schools in the world. It has a close educational alliance with Trinity College&rsquo;s school of midwifery, which provides practical advice and assistance to the school on nursing educational issues, as well as allowing the school to use its clinical training laboratories for certain elements of the teaching programme.</P>
    <P>At present, there are just over 50 postgraduate students in the school, who have graduated from universities, medical colleges and medical schools outside the European Union. They are undertaking postgraduate study programmes in the school. This month the school hopes to recruit even more students in Korea and India. It hopes to have approximately 200 medical and nursing students next year and the figure may rise to approximately 400 in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>It is a requirement that students at the school should be issued with a residency stamp by the Garda national immigration bureau. However, since December 2003, there has been confusion about this procedure. The Garda national immigration bureau has refused to issue the required residency stamps for students undertaking medical English-language study programmes at Eurocollege. As of today, there is a total of 29 students <Col N="410"/>attending Eurocollege, who cannot gain the required residency stamps.</P>
    <P>The problem is that someone seems to think that the students require work permits to study here. All that is needed is a letter from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment stating that work permits are not required by them. The work permits information leaflet, published by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, states that &ldquo;all persons residing in the State are required to have up-to-date residency stamps. Without these stamps a person is considered to be residing illegally and is potentially liable for deportation&rdquo;. It also states that &ldquo;work permits are not required for the following: postgraduate students, where the work is an integral part of the course of study being undertaken (a letter is required from the college stating that they are studying).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One would think that all this should be in order because there has been contact between Eurocollege&rsquo;s director of operations, Mr. John McDonnell, and Superintendent Gerard Cadden of the Garda national immigration bureau. There seems to have been some hiccup in the situation, however.</P>
    <P>Dr. Cecily Begley, who is the director of Trinity College&rsquo;s school of nursing and midwifery, and is also vice-dean of TCD&rsquo;s faculty of health sciences, has written to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, confirming that the people in question are postgraduate students and that clinical placement is an integral part of their course of study. Dr. Begley&rsquo;s letter, however, has not elicited any solution from the Department.</P>
    <P>In addition, the work permits information leaflet states that</P>
    <P LI="1">Non-EEA nationals who have permission to remain in the State as students will be entitled to take up casual employment (defined as up to 20 hours part-time work per week or full-time work during vacation periods) for the duration of their permission to remain. As the primary purpose of their residence continues to be study, a work permit will not be required.</P>
    <P>It goes on to explain that students who wish to continue in employment following the completion of their studies will be required to obtain a work permit. Unfortunately, it is difficult to know what is going on and this is causing great embarrassment to Eurocollege, which is trying to attract more foreign students. The college is also having problems regarding students who do not have the required residency stamp. I would be grateful if the Minister of State could outline why the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has not managed to resolve this issue.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the issue. I am quite familiar with the work done by Eurocollege. I am replying on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Senator refers to a long-standing arrangement, agreed in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whereby non-EEA postgraduate medi<Col N="411"/>cal students may take up employment in the State without requiring a work permit to do so, providing the work is an integral part of their studies. That provision was never in question and the T&aacute;naiste does not have a decision to make in this regard.</P>
    <P>However, this concession only applies to non-EEA nationals who undertake postgraduate studies at a recognised third-level institution in Ireland. It does not apply to non-EEA nationals studying English in Ireland who may possess a postgraduate qualification from their home country.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The college in question informed the Department that the nurses undertaking English language courses in the institution possess postgraduate qualifications in nursing. This suggests they are not undertaking further medical studies, rather a course in English that may eventually allow them to work in the nursing field. Non-EEA nationals undertaking English language studies in the college in Ireland are, therefore, not postgraduate students, medical or otherwise, for the purposes of immigration law. This means they are not permitted to take up periods of full-time employment during their studies.</P>
    <P>Any non-EEA national student who has permission to remain in the State as a student is entitled to take up casual employment for the duration of his or her permission to remain. Casual employment is defined as &rdquo;up to 20 hours part-time work per week or full-time work during vacation periods, for example, summer and Christmas holidays. However, they are not entitled to undertake full-time employment during their studies, even for short periods.</P>
    <P>Students of the college in question have, in the past, undertaken periods of employment during their studies without obtaining a work permit to cover this employment. Non-EEA nationals with permission to remain in the State as students have no entitlement to undertake periods of full-time employment outside vacation periods.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not generally accept work permit applications in respect of non-EEA nationals with permission to remain in Ireland as students. The only exception is where a student gives up his or her permission to remain as a student in order to gain permission to remain as an employee. A non-EEA national cannot have permission to remain as both a student and a worker.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, the question arises as to whether it is in the public interest to issue work permits in respect of students of the college in question, and if so, on what terms. It is important not to confuse the periods of work placement <Col N="412"/>undertaken by students of the college during their studies with clinical assessment or clinical placement, as it was previously known. Clinical assessment is undertaken by non-EEA nationals who have received temporary registration from An Bord Altranais, the Irish Nursing Board. They are undertaken in designated teaching hospitals and generally lead to the individual gaining full registration with the board.</P>
    <P>This is not the case with the students in question. They undertake periods of work experience as nursing assistants without the involvement of An Bord Altranais. The Department has received mixed reports from the college on a number of occasions regarding where these periods of work placement take place. It was initially asserted that they generally take place in the Dublin area teaching hospitals. It was subsequently outlined that they take place in nursing homes and there was mention of work placement occurring in cr&egrave;ches. This raises questions regarding the benefit such experience offers to the nurses in terms of increasing their chances of obtaining registration with An Bord Altranais at the end of their studies.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is well disposed towards any initiative that would provide the Irish health system with a new source of suitably qualified registered nurses. In this regard, the Department is consulting with other public agencies such as the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, An Bord Altranais and the Health Service Employers Agency</P>
    <P>It is not clear what is the intended or likely outcome of attendance at the language courses in question. The Department has received mixed, and not altogether compatible, reports from the college and a number of other quarters regarding where the students will be working once they have completed their course of studies. A number of parties to the discussions have been told that the nurses in question will go to work in the USA or the UK while others have been advised that the nurses will seek to stay in Ireland to do two years &ldquo;work experience&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Department is also concerned that the students may have an altogether different expectation of their likely prospects and destinations after completion of their language course. The Department&rsquo;s inquiries in this area are continuing. It is likely the Department will wish to meet with the sponsors of the proposal in question to discuss outstanding issues in the week beginning 19 April.</P>
