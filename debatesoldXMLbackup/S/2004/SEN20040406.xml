	<P>I have received notice from Senator Leyden that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the current position regarding the development of an Alzheimer&rsquo;s unit and the provision of improved teaching facilities at the Sacred Heart hospital in Roscommon town.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the apparent imminent threat to the ambulance service in the Kenmare area of County Kerry.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator <?oasys [jy?>Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make a statement on Fingal County Council&rsquo;s decision that the Beechpark site, on which Castleknock Educate Together national school is located in temporary accommodation, is not suitable for a permanent school.</P><P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the position on proposals, if any, to reduce the number of beds in Plunkett nursing home, Boyle, County Roscommon.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Leader is aware, the report of the sub-committee on the Barron report made a clear recommendation that a joint resolution in respect of the findings of the committee would be put to both Houses of the Oireachtas. When is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to put that motion on the Order Paper so the matter can be debated?</P>
    <P>In my constituency on Saturday, as Members know, a grandmother was savagely killed in cold blood in her own house. She was another victim of the increasing violence and proliferation of guns in our society. It is clear that gun culture has taken hold and that we have an ongoing problem of violent assault on our streets. What plan of campaign does the Government intend to put in place to counter the threat posed to innocent citizens who stand in the way of these vicious thugs? When Veronica Guerin was savagely murdered some years ago, the Government of the day put in place a plan to bring down the drug gangs and criminals who challenged the State. We now need a plan to deal with the aggressive violence we see on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>It has come to our attention that the number of front-line garda&iacute; to counter this threat has gone down in recent years because of the prevalence of specialist units within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. When does the Government intend to honour the commitment it gave at the last general election to introduce 2,000 additional members to the force? It is also important that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform clarify the comments he made yesterday about a proposal to introduce an amnesty for illegal weapons. We need to consider this proposal seriously and tease out the details because the prevalence of guns in our society is causing havoc and chaos for families throughout the country. The Government needs to respond urgently to this crisis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>During the war on Iraq and the subsequent occupation the Leader has been diligent in ensuring that we debated the issue in the House at regular intervals. Will she arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House for another debate as soon as possible? <Col N="159"/>We have spoken about the detained prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, but there are probably 15,000 people detained in Iraq. Their families do not know where they are being detained. This reminds them all too clearly of the conditions that prevailed under Saddam Hussein. The Leader may not have time to organise this debate before the end of the session but I ask her to make sure it takes place as soon as possible after we come back.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to attend the House to discuss waste management. Yesterday, the Minister launched a report on Ireland&rsquo;s waste management over the next five years and said we need more incinerators. We need to pose a number of questions to the Minister in this regard. For example, if incinerators are to be built, where will that leave all the waste that is being recycled? Given the lack of recycling infrastructure, waste that is currently scheduled for recycling may have to be burned to sustain incinerators.</P>
    <P>Currently, recycled waste is being exported abroad but I would like to know what the Minister is doing to ensure that waste is not being incinerated in foreign countries. As far as I can see, he is more committed to incineration than recycling in this country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>A campaign is currently under way to promote the carrying of organ donor cards. Last week, many Members from both sides of the House attended a function run by the Irish<?oasys [jy?>Kidney Association. A number of us signed organ donor cards at that event and I have had one since 1999. The Minister for Health and Children should do whatever he can through Government agencies to support this initiative which has the capacity to save lives. While Ireland has a good record of organ donations from deceased persons, commitments to donate through the donor card system are much rarer than in other countries. We should examine that area and encourage the Minister to support the donor card initiative.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the issue of an amnesty for guns. It is clear that international experience has been positive in this respect because such amnesties have been successful. In his remarks that were quoted yesterday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made it clear that anyone who had committed a firearms offence, and where forensic evidence showed that such a weapon had been used illegally, would be subject to prosecution when handing in the weapon. Many of us wanted to hear such an assurance. I take the Senator&rsquo;s point that there is a serious problem with regard to illegal firearms but I am confident the Minister will address it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The ruthless killing of a 64 year old grandmother has shocked the nation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform reiterated a commitment that was given in the programme for Government to go ahead with the appointment of 2,000 extra garda&iacute;. I hope we will see a timeframe for the phased introduction of these extra garda&iacute; because the Garda training depot at Templemore does not have the capacity to cope with such a dramatic expansion of places. I would like to think that the Minister&rsquo;s intent is serious and not necessarily linked to the forthcoming local elections in June. I look forward to the Minister outlining his programme for extra garda&iacute;.</P>
    <P>The smoking ban has been very successful and anyone who visited pubs and restaurants over the past two weeks will have seen a noticeable difference. The ban has improved the whole situation. An Oireachtas Member from my area, Deputy John Cregan, said that these reforms amounted to the introduction of a police state, but I regard the smoking ban as an enlightened move. The co-operation of smokers is evident from the fact that people congregate outside pubs and restaurants to smoke. However, if anyone was listening to the radio this morning, they would have heard an eminent surgeon from St. James&rsquo;s Hospital say that in his clinic on Monday morning, of six people with broken jaw bones arising from weekend incidents, three were smokers who were assaulted outside pubs. It is an unfortunate trend for this type of assault to occur as a result of<?oasys [jy?>smokers abiding by the law and co-operating with the ban. I know some Government Senators are smiling but I regard this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>What point is the Senator making? I do not regard this as a joke.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dooley should check the facts.</P>

	<P>The surgeon has a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> today. What is the Senator&rsquo;s point?</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak through the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

	<P>The Senator should not be provoked by interruptions.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="161"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am appalled that Senators would laugh at this issue, when it is raised in a serious manner. A letter from an eminent<?oasys [jy?>surgeon at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital was published in<i> The Irish Times</i> today and he spoke about the issue on a radio programme yesterday. He stated that three of the six people who came in with broken jaws over the weekend were assaulted while smoking outside public houses. This should not happen to people who co-operate with and abide by the law by going outside premises to smoke.</P>

   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>The House has debated Northern Ireland issues on several occasions, particularly the peace process and the Good<?oasys [jy?>Friday Agreement and its subsequent implementation. However, the British Government&rsquo;s stance on the Pat Finucane murder is not helpful. Our Government, Mr. Justice Cory and the American Administration, by inference, have all expressed dissatisfaction with the British Government&rsquo;s refusal to hold a public inquiry. If the British Government persists with this refusal, the danger is it will lend weight and credence to the belief that not only was there collusion among the security forces but that it goes to the heart of the British Government. That will further alienate the Nationalist population. The House should debate this as soon as possible because it is not acceptable that the British Government should use the prosecution of a case as the reason for a delay. It is not fair to the Finucane family, which has set its hopes on this inquiry so that justice will be seen to be done. This House should continue its balanced and helpful debate because it has contributed to the climate in which progress has been made.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>During the past few years, we have spent a great deal of time debating insurance issues, particularly those relating to car insurance. I ask the Leader to draw to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment a directive issued by the European Commission last week on car insurance. It involves political correctness going mad. The Commission believes that, although women have fewer car accidents than men, it is politically unacceptable that they should pay lower insurance premia and insurance companies should not discriminate on the ground of gender. The directive will be transposed into Irish law unless we protect ourselves against it. A similar direction was given last year whereby, because women live longer than men, they should pay into their pensions at a different rate. This is political correctness going wrong. If women have fewer car accidents than men, they should pay lower insurance premia and we should not have a directive foisted on us by the European Commission that states otherwise.</P>
    <P>Legislation is being introduced today in Britain to place controls on telephone lotteries. I received a telephone lottery letter yesterday. It <Col N="162"/>provided a post office box number rather than an address as a contact. According to the letter, one makes a telephone call and is guaranteed to win one of many prizes. Such a call costs a considerable sum. Last year a similar scheme operated in Ireland and one individual made &euro;1 million. The company was then wound up but this was fully legal. The law was not broken because the prizes were correct.</P>
    <P>This is the second telephone lottery letter I have seen. It congratulates me and tells me it is my lucky day because I have won a prize. I must telephone a number and the call will not cost more than &euro;10. Ireland has led the way in terms of protecting its citizens through legislation such as that which provided for the smoking ban and the introduction of the plastic bag levy. The British are leading the way on this issue and we should examine what they are doing. I do not want Ireland to become a nanny state and I do not want us to be protected from everything but it is likely, if we are not careful, that legislation will be introduced to protect us from eating chocolate because it is not good for us. However, something must be done about this and we should ensure that what is happening in Britain is examined.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader allocate time after the Easter recess to consider penal reform in light of the announcement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, about providing 1,000 prison places in Dublin, 800 on Spike Island and 150 new places in Castlerea, County Roscommon? Currently, approximately 250 people are in prison for the non-payment of debts, which is not the place for this offence. Mr. Paul Joyce, from the Free Legal Aid Advice Centre, published a report in May of last year entitled An End based on Means, which suggested a way out of this. A Private Members&rsquo; Bill in 1999 provided for an attachment on earnings as the way to meet the non-payment of debts. It would be worthwhile to discuss and engage with the Minister on his proposals for the restructuring of the prison system and penal reform. Many of those in prison should be working in the community and helping people and An End based on Means offers options in this regard. Will the Leader have a debate on this document with a view to a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to assist the Government in its work?</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, a lady was shot accidentally in Boyle, hit by a ricochet bullet from a .22 rifle fired possibly one and a half miles. Many people out shooting are using guns without proper training and it should be borne in mind that this lady, who is in Sligo General Hospital, is seriously injured and has had to have a bullet extracted from the back of her head. Will the Leader raise with the Minister the issue of the control of guns?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>People prided themselves on the application of the three Rs in education. A survey on education today in the <i>Irish Independent</i> high<Col N="163"/>lights the plague of the three Ds, drink, drugs and Deputy Noel Dempsey, the Minister for Education and Science. We have invited the Minister to the Seanad to outline his policies to deal with the problems in education, many of which he has exacerbated by destroying the morale of teachers. The survey of attitudes among teachers shows that 30% of teachers want to change his or her occupation; 43% are stressed; 33% have taught pupils who were under the influence of alcohol; and 71% have taught pupils who were disruptive in class. Education is in crisis. Will the Leader ask the Minister to outline his policies in this House? The Minister, by not attending all the conferences on this occasion, has lost an opportunity to outline his policy. Talk is of little value and at this stage action is required.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys [ic20]?><Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the points made by Senators Brian Hayes and Dardis on the proposed gun amnesty. It is important that something is done quickly. I hope the Minister will review the issue of firearms. All legally held guns are supposed to be held in safes, but that is not happening. As Senator Leyden pointed out a .22 rifle is not safe, certainly at a distance of a mile. People who receive licences are not getting the correct training. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is proposing to examine the issue of firearms and should do so in general. Some guns are close to being antiques and should be taken out of use.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in requesting the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to explain how and when he intends to honour his commitment in the programme for Government to provide 2,000 extra garda&iacute;. As stated at the AGSI conference yesterday, front-line policing is at its lowest level for 20 years. That is an indictment of the Government. Are the extra garda&iacute; to go the same way as the designated traffic corps, which appears to have been abandoned? The programme for Government seems now to have been nothing less than a programme for promises.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I bow to general opinion. After yesterday&rsquo;s events, I agree that women have better memories than gentlemen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys [ic20]?><Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Ulick Burke in calling for a debate on disciplinary problems in classrooms in primary and secondary schools. While the problems referred to in the ASTI survey have their origins outside the school gate, they are manifested in the classroom to the detriment of teachers and pupils and reflect the fact that a significant swathe of parents seem to have opted out of their responsibilities regard<Col N="164"/>ing the welfare and education of their children. We must ask whether we are witnessing an unsavoury and unsatisfactory consequence of success and affluence. If so, it is one we can well do without.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>I remind the House that a guidance counsellor system is in place throughout the second level system. Counsellors provide counselling in areas other than careers. This may be an appropriate time to review their role and to evaluate their contribution in addressing this recent phenomenon. Most schools have highly motivated teachers who are very competent and effective. They are addressing disciplinary problems very well, notwithstanding a significant and growing minority of students who have serious problems.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I support Senator Quinn who raised a very serious issue. In the past six to nine months, in particular, I have encountered many parents who have expressed extreme concern about scams involving telephone, card and letter lotteries. Students and other young people are being induced to respond to letters by way of telephone calls and otherwise on the understanding that they have been awarded or have won a prize. Notwithstanding the fact that one or two operations appear to have been legitimate, a significant scam is under way. This is a serious development over which there appears to be no control. The consequences can be major for certain families, particularly those on low incomes. It is time to bring the appropriate Minister to the House to address this issue. Legislation should be considered to halt this problem which has domestic and international origins.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s request for a debate on Northern Ireland. In keeping with the tradition of the House, such a debate should be held in a balanced and fair manner. We cannot afford to become bogged down by selective inquiries. The nature of the tragic conflict in Northern Ireland, which resulted in more than 3,000 deaths, means blame can be apportioned across all sides and boundaries. Therefore, we cannot allow ourselves to be dominated by selective inquiries or selective amnesia. I ask the Leader to take on board the suggestion I made some months ago that we debate the concept of a truth and reconciliation commission. That concept was enunciated in more detail at the weekend by the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, who, during a very thoughtful speech, spoke of the merits of a system which would allow debate and where forgiveness, truth and reconciliation would be at the core of our thinking on the Northern Ireland issue. I understand the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is also contemplating this issue. While we will never come up with a perfect solution to the problems of Northern Ireland, the idea of some type of forum or agenda where people can recount the dreadful tales which affected their lives and com<Col N="165"/>munities could be helpful. Members of this House could usefully debate and try to progress that concept and it is something which merits consideration as soon as possible after Easter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes asked when the House will debate the Government resolution on the report by the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. We have had contact with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office and we are awaiting a response. I believe the resolution will be laid before both Houses following which we hope to have a debate on it but we are awaiting the date for that. I thought we would have it this week but we hope to have it soon after the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes also raised the murder of the woman in Tallaght. All of us were shocked by the random nature of that murder. All murders are wrong but the reason this woman was singled out is unexplained. It was a terrible thing to happen. The newspapers have been quite emotional about it, describing her as a living saint and so on. That is beside the point. I am sure she was a very fine parish worker but the way this murder happened was terrible and it shocked people when they heard about it. I agree with Senator Hayes, and I know the Minister would wish to come to the House because at the Garda conference yesterday he unfolded a comprehensive range of measures he intends to invoke including prison places and the guns amnesty, which the Senator mentioned. I understand from the newspapers, although I do not know because I have no word on it, that the Minister intends to go to Cabinet with his proposal. I stress I got that from newspapers and not from any direct knowledge. I accept there is a strong feeling abroad about murder, gangland killings, drugs and so on but I genuinely believe the Minister, Deputy Michael McDowell, will get on top of the difficulties we are all encountering.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry called for a rolling debate on Iraq. I agree with that, though it will be difficult. It will be near the end of April when we return after the recess and I wish to publicly thank the various Departments and Ministers because we have never been left wanting for a Minister, even though it is extraordinarily difficult for them during the Presidency. It is particularly difficult to get anybody from the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is not their fault; they are just very busy. We will endeavour to have a debate on Iraq because it appears events there are spiralling out of control.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy raised the issue of waste management and asked that the Minister come to the House to discuss the report he has just issued. I understand he or the Minister of State is due to come here this week, but we will endeavour to have a debate on waste management.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the issue of organ donation. A campaign on this was launched last week and I meant to go but was unable. It is a <Col N="166"/>very fine concept. He also spoke about a guns amnesty and said the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will address that issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane spoke about the need for additional garda&iacute; and I hope we will hear of developments on this matter soon. I heard the consultant talking about smoking outside and it would be a terrible development if there was a fracas because people were outside smoking cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; called for a debate on Northern Ireland and specifically what Judge Cory said in his report about Pat Finucane. Such a debate would need to be taken by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and would depend on their other engagements.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about car insurance. While I read about this matter, I did not fully understand it. He said that women currently get lower motor insurance rates and Europe wants to push these up to the same levels as those for men. I do not know whether we have fewer crashes or injuries than men, although most of the sad events of which we hear involve male drivers. We will ask the T&aacute;naiste about the directive being prepared in Europe, as it falls within her remit. I cannot help smiling because women want equality, but not when it involves such changes.</P>
    <P>The Senator also spoke about telephone lotteries. I have never received one of these letters but I understand that people are being told they will get unexplained wealth if they make a telephone call. While I presume they will not get any money, some people are gullible enough to believe they will. I remember chain letters that used to go around saying if someone receiving such a letter failed to send it to a further five people something dreadful, like the world ending, would happen. This seems to be a sophisticated version of that scam. Is someone making money out of this? Is it legitimate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is quite legitimate. It is inside the law.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden spoke about penal reform. We should have a debate on this matter after Easter. Rather than taking up valuable prison space, we should identify some other way for those who are in prison for not paying debts to make amends. He spoke of the terrible accident that befell a lady in Boyle following a shot from a .22 rifle.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke spoke about the three Rs. I have high regard for the Senator because he is a teacher but responsibility for children arriving to class drunk rests with the parents. Would a parent not be aware of a child going to school with drink taken? Where did the children get the drink or the money to buy it? It cannot be put down to anything in the education system and it certainly cannot be blamed on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey. He will attend two of the three teacher con<Col N="167"/>ferences, those of the TUI and the INTO. He will not attend the ASTI conference because they could not work out a format. However, if it was possible in the case of the other two, it should have been possible to make arrangements for the ASTI conference. However, it was not the Minister&rsquo;s fault. He wanted to attend, but not in the traditional format. I have sympathy with him. As I said here previously, it is a real Via Dolorosa. The delegates metaphorically throw things at the Minister. It is not a fun visit.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There is more than 80% disruption at that event.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is verbal disruption. However, the survey showed that it is a serious matter. It is a reflection of society and is not the fault of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan called for a complete review of the law on firearms. I accept that he has knowledge on that matter. Senator Cummins asked about the designated traffic corps and the additional 2,000 garda&iacute;. I hope there will be news on the second matter. Apparently there were legal difficulties with the extension of powers to the proposed traffic corps.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald said the role of guidance counsellors should be amplified and used to its full extent. He also supported the point raised by Senator Quinn. I wonder to whom the issue of a telephone lottery would be addressed? Perhaps we can discuss the matter later.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford sought a debate on Northern Ireland and referred to the truth and reconciliation commission in South Africa. I recently heard the UK Prime Minister speak on this issue and perhaps we should also consider it. I am aware the previous Taoiseach also spoke on the issue. It is a fine concept but, at the end of the day, people want to see justice being done. We could then perhaps move into the area of truth and reconciliation.</P>

Members will be aware that the Taoiseach made a statement on the European Council to the D&aacute;il on 30 March. The meeting was very successful for the European Union.</P>
    <P>The European Council adopted a declaration on combating terrorism; reached agreement to resume negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference on the constitutional treaty; iden<Col N="168"/>tified what needs to be done to promote sustainable growth and more jobs in the context of the Lisbon agenda; and had an exchange of views on a range of international issues.</P>
    <P>The first session of the European Council was devoted to combating terrorism. It was held as a direct response to the horrific terrorist bombings in Madrid on 11 March. The scale of that attack demanded a real and rapid response. That is the reason the Irish Presidency drafted, and the European Council adopted, a comprehensive declaration on combating terrorism. The declaration underlines that we are at one in the European Union in our determination to face down the terrorist threat.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>Since 11 September 2001, an enormous body of work has been ongoing in our fight against terrorism. The attacks in Madrid injected a new urgency in bringing this work forward. The declaration adopted by the European Council was considered at a specially convened meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers and was also considered by Foreign Ministers in a meeting which preceded the European Council. It highlights existing co-operation, seeks to improve it and emphasises the need to implement what we have agreed. It also sets out a number of important initiatives in the fight against terrorism.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>The declaration includes measures to improve intelligence-sharing, to strengthen border controls and the security of travel documents, to enhance protection for our transport systems and to counter the financing of terrorism. The European Council renewed our commitment to implement the European arrest warrant in every member state and strengthened our efforts to prevent the financing of terrorism.</P>
    <P>Combating terrorism demands a more effective and systematic approach to the exchange of information between our police, security and intelligence services. High Representative, Javier Solana, has been asked to report to the June European Council on how intelligence capacity within the Council structure can be integrated. The European Council agreed new strategic objectives for a revised plan of action on terrorism and will agree, in June, the key tasks and deadlines by which these tasks are to be achieved. Improved co-ordination across the whole of the European Union is essential to defeating terrorism. That is why a counter-terrorism co-ordinator has been appointed. Dr. Gijs de Vries will have the job of co-ordinating the work of the Council and following up on Council decisions to make the fight against terrorism more effective. He brings a great deal of experience to the job, having been interior Minister for a time in the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>The European Council recognises the need to enhance international co-operation. The<?oasys [jy?>declaration underlines the central role of the United Nations. It underscores the need to continue to enhance our co-operation with partners, including the United States. In addition, the <Col N="169"/>European Council agreed a declaration on solidarity against terrorism. That highlights an element of the draft constitutional treaty for Europe which commits the member states to act jointly in a spirit of solidarity if one of them is the victim of a terrorist attack. This is, of course, subject to the constitutional requirements of each member state.</P>
    <P>The message coming from the European<?oasys [jy?>Council meeting was simple. We are building on our existing co-operation. We seek to improve it, and we emphasise the need to implement what we have agreed. We are also looking at what more we can do. Following the session on<?oasys [jy?>terrorism, the Intergovernmental Conference considered the draft constitutional treaty. The session was both positive and constructive. There was great appreciation for the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s approach to the IGC. The Taoiseach asked<?oasys [jy?>colleagues to commit themselves to a timeframe in which to bring the Intergovernmental<?oasys [jy?>Conference to a conclusion. It was agreed to<?oasys [jy?>conclude it no later than the June European Council. That is a remarkable change in affairs since the December European Council, when the atmosphere was entirely negative. It is a very<?oasys [jy?>significant achievement on the part of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is still a substantial amount of work to be done in the context of the constitutional treaty. There are complex and important issues to be resolved. However, there is a strong will to find a way forward, and it is understood that there will have to be compromises. In negotiations, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. I mentioned on a previous occasion in the Seanad that if the political will existed I was confident that the Irish Presidency would find a way of constructing a path through the many difficulties that still face the constitutional treaty. The positive decisions at the European Council have confirmed my views in that regard.</P>
    <P>The process of bringing the constitutional treaty to a conclusion is a collective one in which we must all play a part. Everyone has shown some flexibility, and in the discussions that will follow, more compromises will have to be made. The Government would, of course, like to see agreement on the new constitution sooner rather than later. At the same time, the Government fully appreciates that the best possible outcome may require a little time. We should not forget that when we began at the start of the year there were many who said it would not be possible to set a target for the end of the 2004. We now have a commitment to finish the negotiations by June.</P>
    <P>While combating terrorism and crafting a constitution for Europe are critically important matters, the spring European Council was originally conceived as an economic summit. In advance of the European Council meeting, the Taoiseach had written to colleagues outlining the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s priorities on the Lisbon Agenda and our approach to making progress on it. The Taoiseach also used bilateral contacts to <Col N="170"/>emphasise the need for a focused agenda, concentrating on the main issues needing to be addressed. The Taoiseach highlighted the fact that overall Europe is well behind target in a number of key areas and that we must now give the highest level of political priority to the critical issue of delivery.</P>
    <P>Our approach underlined the importance of stepping up implementation at national level of the commitments to which member states had agreed over the past four years. Fortunately, the climate for delivering on the Lisbon Agenda is improving. The global economy is recovering, and the European Union must position itself to benefit from any upturn.</P>
    <P>We decided to concentrate on two urgent priorities, sustainable growth and more and better jobs. One of the problems with the Lisbon agenda to date has been that it has not been well focused. The temptation for every Presidency has been to bring on board its own favourite topic. We took the view that less is better &mdash; if we can add some focus, much more progress will be made. The true test of the Lisbon agenda will be whether the European Union will be able to sustain higher levels of growth and employment in 2010 compared to those recorded in 2000.</P>
    <P>For growth to occur, the right combination of sound macroeconomic policies and greater competitiveness is needed. To this end the European Council decided the draft directive on services should be agreed so that barriers to the Internal Market, which limited opportunities for business and consumers, would be removed. Services account for approximately 70% of the gross domestic product of the entire Union and yet there is less freedom of movement in this area than in any other. If progress can be achieved in this area and the barriers that prevent the growth of an Internal Market in services are removed, everybody will benefit. Consumers will benefit as of course will the economies in general.</P>
    <P>The Heads of State also committed themselves to accelerating regulatory reform, another issue that has been discussed in this House on more than one occasion. There is a problem with Europe regulating itself to stasis and the view of the Irish Presidency is that good governance requires less, or more focused, regulation. I am pleased to point that the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s view on the issue of regulation is shared by Holland, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom, which respectively will host the next three Presidencies. A common Presidency programme has been issued to cover the two-year span, focusing on the issue of regulation. I believe this will have a positive impact.</P>
    <P>The European Council also agreed on the need to invest in basic research in the life sciences. The level of private sector investment in research and development in the European Union is far too low. The private sector invests three times more in human capital in Japan and a staggering five times more in the United States than it does in the European Union. All member states have <Col N="171"/>been asked to improve the general conditions for research and development and to consider targeted support and incentives to encourage greater investment by business. The research and development area is obviously critical as Europe wishes to become the world&rsquo;s leading knowledge-based economy by the year 2010.</P>
    <P>Growth will not be sustainable if it is coupled with the increased use of finite natural resources. For this reason, the European Council called for the rapid implementation of the environmental technologies action plan. As well as protecting the environment, this plan will contribute to competitiveness and economic growth. The European Council also called for the full implementation of the Kyoto Agreement. It is worth reminding the House that environmental science is one of the key areas of technology that is currently being developed. Europe has an edge and advantage in this area and it should be pursued.</P>
    <P>Growth and competitiveness are not ends in themselves. They are means to securing and developing the European social model with its emphasis on sustainability and inclusion. Protecting the most vulnerable members of society is an essential part of the Lisbon agenda. I am pleased that the Council agreed that social cohesion was central to this. The other focus was on jobs. The European Council agreed that the EU&rsquo;s top priority must be to increase the employment rate throughout Europe. Higher employment will not only boost growth, but will also provide the best route out of poverty and social exclusion. The European Council focused on four major challenges, namely, increasing the adaptability of workers and companies, attracting more people into the labour market, improving the quality of employment and investing in human capital.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that a detailed response would be undertaken at next year&rsquo;s spring European Council meeting to examine the progress of members states in addressing the employment challenges. The European Council acknowledged that substantial progress had been made in a range of areas that would promote mobility including the European health insurance card. The Taoiseach displayed the first of the European health insurance cards at the Council. In addition, the reform of Security Council regulation 1408, which will protect the social security rights of migrant workers, is an important measure which will be agreed over the coming weeks. This too will be a significant achievement for the Irish EU Presidency.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>The European Council also called for political agreement to be reached by June 2004 on directives aimed at making it easier for workers to have their professional qualifications recognised when seeking work in other EU member states. I recall when I was a civil servant in the Department of Finance in 1973, when we first joined the European Union, we discussed the right of establishment of the freedom to move workplace from one place to the next. We <Col N="172"/>talked of the challenge of having a common set of professional qualifications. It is extraordinary that 30 years later this has not been achieved. One of the positive outcomes of the European Council meeting was to indicate a timetable for getting that work concluded, with June 2004 being the projected date. That is very ambitious, but would be a very positive outcome if achieved.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>The Government cannot on its own bring about the range of changes required. All stakeholders have a vital role to play. It was also agreed that each member state would establish national reform partnerships in accordance with its own national arrangements and traditions. The states would have to build commitment and legitimacy as a lever for change at national level. We do not often regard ourselves in Ireland as innovators, yet one of the great innovations in recent years has been social partnership. I know there are debates on the extent to which social partnership should be involved in the evolution of policies, yet one must accept that social partnership has been fundamental in creating a more flexible arrangement within the workforce, as well as creating a consensus and agreement on policies which would otherwise have been difficult to deliver. We believe, as does the European Council, that this model can be extended to the European Union.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>The Council also looked ahead to 2005, the mid-point in the Lisbon goal and the appropriate time for an in-depth review of delivery. While we all agreed that the continuing validity and relevance of the Lisbon agenda is not in question, we need a comprehensive mid-term evaluation to guide us over the second five years. The European Council therefore invited the Commission to establish an independent high-level group, headed by the former Dutch Prime Minister, Wim Kok, to undertake this evaluation. Wim Kok and his proven track record will provide continuity with the earlier work of the employment task force, given that employment is one of the key areas of the Lisbon agenda.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>The European Council discussed Kosovo, Afghanistan and the Middle East, focusing on our partnership with the wider region, and it also discussed Cyprus. European High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten reported on their visit to Kosovo on 24 March. While the situation appears to have stabilised, the recent outbreak of violence was a major setback. The European Union must try to ensure there is no further descent into the type of ethnic violence which destroyed so many lives throughout the western Balkans over the last 13 years. The European Council reconfirmed its support for Security Council Resolution 1244 and for the policy of standards before status.</P>
    <P>The Council welcomed Germany&rsquo;s decision to host the international Afghanistan conference in Berlin on 31 March and 1 April. The people of Afghanistan require a future governed by the <Col N="173"/>principles of freedom, justice, respect for human rights and fair political representation. The Berlin conference marked another step towards securing those objectives.</P>
    <P>The Middle East continues to be of grave concern to the European Council. Extrajudicial killings are contrary to international law and undermine the rule of law. The European Union has condemned the killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin by Israeli forces. Violence must cease in the region. The European Union called on the people of the region to look beyond the politics of the latest atrocity. They need to summon up the political will necessary to overcome the current impasse in the peace process. The European Council remains convinced that the Quartet road map offers the basis for a lasting peaceful settlement resulting in two viable, sovereign and independent states, Israel and Palestine, based on the borders of 1967.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency maintains close contact with the leaders of the principal Arab states to ensure the momentum in the peace process is not lost. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, visited Cairo last week where he emphasised the need for a concerted effort to advance our common goals of peace and security in the region through a just resolution of the conflict. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs intended to represent the Union at an Arab summit in Tunis last week, but it was cancelled.</P>
    <P>The European Council expressed the desire of the European Union for partnership with the countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. The European Council welcomed the interim report drafted by the Presidency, An EU Strategic Partnership with the Mediterranean and the Middle East, and which was endorsed by Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 22 March. The European Union and the countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East are neighbours, sharing strategic interests and concerns. Many of these countries face challenges that require far-reaching political, economic and social reform that must come from within. At the same time, the European Union stands ready to help.</P>
    <P>The European Council discussed Cyprus, at a time when the UN led negotiations on a settlement were at a critical stage. Heads of State and Government acknowledge the long-standing effort of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to create a unique and historic opportunity for a settlement to the Cyprus problem. The Government maintained close contact with the negotiations throughout and continues to be in touch with all parties concerned. It is now up to the people of Cyprus to decide on a plan for a settlement that Mr. Annan presented to the parties on 31 March. At its meeting on 26 March, the European Council reaffirmed its strong preference for the accession of a united Cyprus to the European Union. The European Council reiter<Col N="174"/>ated its readiness to accommodate the terms of such a settlement in line with the principles on which the Union is founded. As Members will be aware, if there is no agreement in the two Cypriot referenda, one of the challenges then faced is how to accommodate the arrangements for 1 May. Within these arrangements, there is sufficient flexibility to do that.</P>
    <P>The European Council meeting was good and productive. We are now at the half-way point of the Irish Presidency, yet much work remains to be done. As in the past, this term of the Presidency will be judged on its results over the entire six month period and whether it achieved what it set out to do. We can be satisfied with what has been achieved to date and that this good work will be continued.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche. Over the last 18 months he has presented us with the message from the European Union in a balanced and fair fashion. I agree the Irish Presidency will be judged on its results over the six months term. However, at this stage, we must say, &ldquo;so far, so good&rdquo;. The work done on EU issues by the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and their colleagues is excellent. I wish them well over the concluding three months of the presidency. I also wish, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, to extend congratulations to the Irish diplomatic corps and civil servants who it seems are working on an almost 24 hour basis.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency is an example of what a small country can achieve within the European Union. Future presidencies and the management of the Union will change but Ireland is finishing this presidency in style. The accession states, particularly the smaller ones, will notice this and emulate what Ireland has achieved in the management of EU business. Ireland is up there in lights and not only is it good for us but it is good for the accession states and Europe.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>Though it may not be pertinent to this debate, what those minority groups who speak for nobody in this country, or across the Union, will attempt through protest on 1 May must be discussed. Over the weekend, newspapers carried disturbing reports on planned protests due to take place in Dublin on May Day. Groups of thugs from all over Europe are being invited to Dublin by thugs in this State to bring anarchy and chaos to our streets. Who are these people? Sometimes they claim the title of &ldquo;Reclaim the Streets&rdquo;. One wonders what they are reclaiming, from whom and for whom. These people have no political agenda except a negative one of destruction. They have no electoral record. If they put themselves forward, they would get little support from the electorate. However, they are attempting to close down Dublin city and the country on 1 May. It is an absolute disgrace.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>The accession of new states to the EU will be marked on 1 May. Many of these states lived behind the Iron Curtain in fear and terror for <Col N="175"/>years. This will be an outstanding day in the history of the Union and Europe. Those groups across Europe, supported by a tiny minority who speak for no one in this country, should not be allowed to disrupt 1 May. The weekend newspapers gave details of a video on an Internet site speaking for direct action in a weekend of resistance to say no to fortress Europe and to drag down the EU. This is shocking.</P>
    <P>The democratically elected Oireachtas must say no to these unelected Trotskyite thugs who have nothing to contribute to the EU but to hark back to days long gone. These thugs are abusing the word &ldquo;globalisation&rdquo; to bring protests onto the street. Global trade has not just built up this country, but the Continent and its Union. It is time for us to strike back at these people. It is we who should be reclaiming the streets from these thugs whose record is one of trouble and misery. What is their agenda for Europe? They speak of bringing down the EU, the very body that has brought peace and security to the Continent. After 1 May, when the Union is 25 states, that peace, stability and economic progress will extend eastwards which any decent, thoughtful and constructive person should support. These people must be told they are not welcome to protest on our streets with their message of violence and thuggery.</P>
    <P>The European Council last week was dominated by the shocking and tragic events in Madrid. The EU had to respond and the putting in place of mechanisms to combat terrorism is welcome. It will always be impossible to combat terrorism because its ideology and operation is not just negative but secretive. One can never have an absolute security response to terrorism. I welcome the fact the EU is speaking with one voice, not only about the futility of terrorism but also about its absolute commitment to ensuring it will not bow to the threat of terrorism and the mechanisms used by terrorists. I welcome the decision to appoint an overall co-ordinator at European level. Every Government has a role to play, working in conjunction with the co-ordinator. It is important the legislation that needs to be put in place across the EU is debated urgently and enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Seanad debated the Transfer of Execution of Sentences Bill 2003, which is not as dramatic as it sounds. The Bill was waiting debate and conclusion for a number of years, apparently. It was mentioned during the course of the debate that a number of such similar measures are awaiting final debate and conclusion. If we are to try to combat terrorism from a European perspective, it is important that national Parliaments should do their work as quickly as possible. I am sure the Minister of State will work with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make progress in respect of any outstanding delays and to ensure we play our part in responding to terrorism.</P><Col N="176"/>
    <P>The Minister of State gave the House an indication of the progress that has been made in finalising the proposed EU constitution. He has spoken in the Seanad about the debate on the constitution on a number of occasions. It is disappointing the matter was not resolved at last December&rsquo;s summit. We hope the missing pieces of the jigsaw can be put in place during the final months of the Irish Presidency. It is too early to talk about the final picture that is emerging, but the fact the Government has succeeded in getting our EU partners to sit down and to engage strongly with the matter is to be welcomed. It is in the interest of all member states &mdash; the Europe of 15 as well as the Europe of 25 &mdash; that the constitution is finalised as soon as possible so we can put the constitutional question and the constitutional test to the people of Europe.</P>
    <P>It is possible the constitution, more than anything else, will be our response to those involved in the &ldquo;Reclaim the Streets&rdquo; movement and in other organisations that are anti-globalisation and anti-everything. When the people of Europe speak on the constitution of Europe, they will send the clearest possible message that the future of Europe is one of 25, and more, countries co-operating on economic, social and international issues. I wish the Government well in trying to conclude the constitutional process.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde and I have debated the Lisbon strategy at great length in recent months at meetings of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. We have had interesting and lengthy debates about many broad policy matters relating to the strategy. It is appropriate, as the Minister of State said, that a group should be put in place at the halfway stage to examine the progress that has been made to date. Significant progress has been made, but it is clear from the work done by the joint committee, chaired by Deputy Gay Mitchell, that many problems remain, for example in respect of job creation, sustainability and environmental issues. We have discussed broader matters such as landfill and incineration policy at recent meetings of the joint committee and some questions remain in that regard. If the EU ensures the issues of job creation, social security and building a fair and balanced Europe are at its core, we will be moving in the right<?oasys [jy?>way.</P>
    <P>When a delegation from Macedonia addressed the Joint Committee on European Affairs last week, members of the committee asked, as they asked when other delegations addressed the committee, about the cost to the Macedonian social security system of trying to underpin the economic advances necessary for accession to the EU. The Macedonian delegation and previous delegations said that although they recognise the social pain associated with economic advances, they are willing to look at the broader picture. They know their futures will be much more secure if they join the EU, as they will be able to participate in broader free trade and a more liberal economic market. If such countries are <Col N="177"/>willing to make certain sacrifices, we should be willing to work with them and to assist them in every possible way. In that regard, I hope the Lisbon strategy is progressed as quickly and strongly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said in his contribution that central issues such as competition and regulatory policy need to be discussed. We have to discuss issues at home if we are to put in place mechanisms to enable us to make further progress on competition and regulation. It is not simply a case of public transport but applies to a broad policy area. This great and interesting debate shows how dramatically Europe has changed, as well as how dramatically Ireland has been changed by Europe. It demonstrates, from the point of view of the social contract, the influence Ireland is having in Europe. We are benefiting from Europe and Europe is benefiting from us. That is the way it should be and long may it continue.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on the Minister&rsquo;s remarks about the EU&rsquo;s ongoing foreign policy work, for example in respect of Kosovo, the Middle East and Afghanistan. It is sad that today&rsquo;s answers to such questions may not be appropriate tomorrow. The EU is well placed to work to resolve global conflicts because countries that opposed each other bitterly throughout the history of Europe have successfully come together to co-operate on certain matters. Great progress has been made in respect of the problems in Cyprus. We all hope that a united Cyprus will be in a position to join the EU at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The German initiative on Afghanistan is to be welcomed. World politics moves quickly and it easy to forget that two or three years ago, the Taliban were in charge of Afghanistan, which is now moving forward and making progress. When I think of the Taliban being in charge of Afghanistan, I am reminded of those to whom I referred at the start of my contribution who want to destroy Europe rather than help to construct it. I refer to those who want to march and to claim and take over our streets on 1 May next. I asked earlier if they have any policies and for whom they stand. In a sense, they actually are the European Taliban and the Irish Taliban. We should say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to such people.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his work. He can be proud of his performance in his portfolio. I wish the Government well in the next few weeks as we draw nearer to the accession of the ten new member states and the conclusion of the Irish Presidency. Given that it might be the last time that Ireland has a conventional Presidency, I hope its legacy will be a good example of what small countries can do and the role they can play in an ever-enlarging Europe.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I congratulate him on his work in all areas relating to Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency and on his role in bringing the EU closer to the citizen. It is worth<Col N="178"/>while this morning to discuss the Irish Presidency and where we are at. A review of the spring European Council is necessary because we need to relate to the public at large again. It is natural that the debate so far has been mainly about the security problem. I am delighted we have received a clear message again that all member states should work together to demonstrate solidarity in the light of the bomb attacks in Madrid on 11 March last. In such a spirit of solidarity, we should support any member state that becomes a victim of a terrorist attack. I acknowledge the ground work that was done by the officials, through the Presidency, in getting a clear message and in forging an agreement on a declaration on combating terrorism. The Irish Presidency played a major part in that agreement and in bringing about these anti-terrorism measures. I also welcome the fact that we have now appointed a co-ordinator to encourage the exchange of information, police, security and intelligence co-operation and strengthening of border controls between member states. We need a co-ordinator to keep all these measures under review and keep member states up to date on developments. If the spring Council did anything, it brought about the reinforcement of these measures. Security is a very important issue for Irish people, who want to know what Europe is all about. Here is a golden opportunity to find out. The security measures adopted through this declaration will help in combating terrorism.</P>
    <P>The consultations of the Intergovernmental Conference are ongoing and there is a genuine hope that all outstanding matters will be agreed shortly. Among these are the size of the Commission and the issue of qualified majority voting. Knowing that the Taoiseach is at his best in these negotiations, I have no doubt that the June Council will bring about a satisfactory solution to these problems along with the finalisation of the constitutional treaty.</P>
    <P>The spring Council was initiated on the basis of the Lisbon Agenda, although part of it has been taken up with security and the IGC. I have taken a special interest in the Lisbon Agenda, the ten-year plan and our current position. I am delighted that our need to set the agenda has been acknowledged by the Irish Presidency. The pace has been slow and we have not really aimed for the targets that were set out for 2010. I support the idea of setting up national agendas, rather than following the Lisbon Agenda, so that we can investigate areas in which the pace has been slow.</P>
    <P>The focus of the Irish Presidency has been on the areas of sustainable growth, competitiveness and better jobs. How can we go about achieving these? As the Minister of State pointed out, the only way in which this can be done is to improve competitiveness through better education, better harmonisation of our qualifications and greater adaptability in the workforce. Investment not only from the Exchequer, but also from the business world, can enhance competitiveness. We <Col N="179"/>may not be sluggish about these matters in Ireland but other member states do not really have a grasp of how to handle it. Recently, I visited Istanbul for a conference on the issue of whether Turkey was ready to apply to join the EU. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of delegates from other countries who asked about Ireland&rsquo;s recipe for success and what model we were using. The whole of Europe seemed to focus its attention on our success story.</P>
    <P>We talked about the Lisbon Agenda. We seem to have got it right in some ways: we have better mobility and our education system is first class. Perhaps we need to work on the adaptability of workers in certain areas and encourage research and development to enhance the European store of knowledge. On the whole, however, we seem to be achieving our aims in a natural way. This was nice for the delegation from Ireland, whose members were able to talk about our success story. More needs to be done, however. The Irish Presidency has reinforced this idea.</P>
    <P>We are halfway through the Lisbon Agenda, which started in 2000. There still seem to be some loopholes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>A lot done, more to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good slogan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and it holds true for everything in life. I wish the Presidency well in that aspect of the Lisbon Agenda. If we do not provide more and better jobs, achieve greater competitiveness and work towards harmonisation of our qualifications we will not be able to help those who need to be helped. Unless there is competitiveness we will not have the money to work on our social model. An important part of the Lisbon Agenda is attempting to eradicate poverty and looking after those who cannot look after themselves. We can only make improvements in the health service and in the area of pensions if we have a vibrant economy. We have this, but we must work on maintaining it. That is the model we must sell to Europe. The only possibility for achieving this is to ensure greater competitiveness, sustainable growth and more jobs. This will ensure that we can help those who cannot help themselves.</P>
    <P>I note the points raised in the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution about the ongoing efforts in Kosovo, the Middle East peace process and Iraq. Part of the discussion on the accession of Turkey to the EU was about the reunification of Cyprus and whether this will happen on 24 April when the two referendums will be held. It was asked what would happen if the Greek Cypriots voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; and the Turkish Cypriots &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or if both sides voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. There are many possible problems. It is a difficult issue. I came away feeling that there was some doubt about the matter. The Turkish Cypriots seem to be agreeing to make progress but the other side seems not to have the <Col N="180"/>required commitment. However, we will see what the outcome is on 24 April.</P>
    <P>I understand a conference entitled Communicating Europe will take place on 7 and 8 April. This is an issue that is close to my heart. The conference was initiated by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and all the member state representatives will be discussing how we can bring Europe closer to its citizens. How can we get rid of the gobbledegook language? I became interested in this issue when I became a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and began to look at all the documentation that was coming through. I spent hours trying to understand jargon. I am here to bring Europe closer to its citizens &mdash; to make Irish citizens feel we are moving in the right direction and that without Europe we would be isolated. I welcome the Communicating Europe conference, at which we can discuss how we can best develop closer relationships with our citizens. That will be a very important day for the Minister of State and I look forward to the outcome of the conference. I wish him every success with it.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The date 1 May is D-Day and I look forward to participating in a full schedule of events. That date, however, should not be dominated by, as Senator Bradford said, self-appointed groups with no democratic mandate. Some may wonder from where such groups come. They come from the very countries that were under the mantle of the Soviet Union for such a long time. They seem to have no home, nor do they want one; they are just creating disturbances. We must be careful that proper security measures are in place so those thugs will not get an opportunity to disrupt proceedings, as we have read in newspapers in recent days.</P>
    <P>I hope 1 May will be a great success. As regards the second half of our EU Presidency, I extend every good wish to the Taoiseach and his Ministers for the conclusion of the constitutional treaty. I know it will be a great success. The challenge for us is that when all that is over we will not sit back but will continue to take pride in the fact that Ireland had a successful EU Presidency, hosting the enlargement ceremony on 1 May and completing the negotiations on the constitutional treaty. In the coming years we will continue the drive to maintain a strong economy.</P>
    <P>This debate has afforded us a great opportunity to discuss the recent spring Council meeting in Brussels. I am proud to be able to speak about our country in this manner, as well as recognising that the Taoiseach has spearheaded the EU spring Council so successfully. The next EU summit meeting in June will confirm Ireland&rsquo;s position as the EU&rsquo;s most successful economy to be used as a model for the accession states.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic. I join Senator Bradford and Senator Ormonde in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, on his grasp of this portfolio. <Col N="181"/>Since his appointment, he has demonstrated enthusiasm for and commitment to his job. The breadth of the Minister of State&rsquo;s address to the House was evidence of the wide-ranging nature of his portfolio. Last year, when I met the former French President, Val&eacute;ry Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing, he appeared to be criticising the Minister of State, Deputy Roche. In fact, however, Mr. Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing was critical of the Minister of State for being so committed to the case for small nations, while, at the Convention on the Future of Europe, the former French President hoped to ensure those nations would remain small and would not have the same power as larger states. I congratulate the Minister of State on what he has done. I also wish to congratulate the Taoiseach and the Irish diplomatic team for the progress they achieved on the new constitutional treaty.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus my remarks on the Lisbon Agenda. It was a tragic side-effect of the Madrid bombings that this European Council, which was originally to concentrate mainly on revitalising the Lisbon Agenda, had to divert much of its attention to other things. Some time was devoted to the original planned topic and some progress was made, but it is fair to say that the revitalisation of the Lisbon agenda did not take place. At the Forum for Europe last week, the Taoiseach said he found the need to re-inject momentum into the Lisbon strategy and he has done so very effectively.</P>
    <P>I wish to spell out why this matter is so important and why I was so pleased that the Irish Presidency has adopted the Lisbon Agenda as one of its priorities &mdash; perhaps its main priority. The Lisbon Agenda has as its central objective that the EU will become by the year 2010 &ldquo;the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs, and greater social cohesion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The importance of this declaration was that it provided an answer to a question that has been nagging at Europe ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, namely, what is Europe&rsquo;s place in the world? Is it, as some people continue to believe, as a type of second-level military power, designed to counter balance the United States on a global scale? Those who think so believe that international influence must be based firmly on military might and that everything, including trade, follows from that dominating fact.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with that approach is that, almost by definition, it involves casting the United States in the role of an enemy or at the very least as a rival. That is a very barren approach to adopt, however. We need never regard the United States as an enemy, however much we might disagree with its policies, as we do on many occasions. Surely it is much better to address these differences through the offices of a friend, rather than as a rival with whom we could never compete on equal terms.</P><Col N="182"/>
    <P>The main problem with the vision of Europe as a military power is that it is unnecessary. It is true that global influence follows from military might, but it is equally true that it can be brought about without the involvement of military power. Since the Second World War, the military power of Germany and Japan has been effectively neutralised, yet that fact has not prevented both countries from becoming major global influences on economic grounds alone.</P>
    <P>The Lisbon Agenda was, first and foremost, a statement that the EU would compete on the world stage by economic and social means, rather than through military might. In particular, it was a statement of how Europe intended to compete with the world&rsquo;s only remaining superpower, the United States. The aim was to close the economic gap between the EU and the US, and for Europe then to take the lead in the new knowledge-based economy that is opening up before us. In Lisbon, the member states agreed, in the Minister of State&rsquo;s words, to &ldquo;make our labour markets more flexible, stimulate innovation, encourage entrepreneurs, spend more on research and development and complete the Single Market&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>According to the European Commission, success with this reform programme could increase the EU&rsquo;s underlying annual growth rate by up to 0.75% over the decade, which would bring it into line with the US by the target date of 2010. Whether all the member states fully realised it at the time, the Lisbon agenda represented a fundamental choice as to the future direction the EU could take, a choice of the economic rather than the military path. Given our own non-militarist background and tradition, it is particularly appropriate that Ireland should emerge as the champion of this agenda.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as the Irish Presidency realised, agreeing the agenda was one thing but implementing it has proved a different matter. In its recent scorecard on the Lisbon Agenda, the Centre for European Reform summed it up as follows: &ldquo;Even the most enthusiastic proponents of the Lisbon Agenda can only describe the EU&rsquo;s performance over the last 12 months as mediocre.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The economic gap between the EU and the US is widening, rather than narrowing. The hard fact now is that there is little prospect of closing that gap before the original target date of 2010. The worst case scenario is emerging as a real possibility: that by the end of the decade, the gap between Europe and America will be even wider than it was at the start. The failure of Europe as a whole to match up to the targets of the Lisbon agenda has led some people &mdash; we have seen it in this country &mdash; to question the whole process. This idea is strengthened by the pattern of patchy performance across the 15 member states. A number of countries, notably in Scandinavia, are doing well. Ireland is doing well in terms of employment and productivity but its performance is still well below par in terms of both innovation and social inclusion. Other member states, includ<Col N="183"/>ing a number of the biggest economic players, especially Italy, have made little or no progress on the reform programme.</P>
    <P>This raises the question of whether the EU should abandon the Lisbon Agenda as a European project and instead allow each country to pursue its own destiny at the pace of its choice. The argument for doing so is strengthened because most of the actions required under the agenda must be taken at national rather than European level. Most of the agenda is outside the competence of the EU.</P>
    <P>Such an approach would be a disaster, however well an individual state might do by ploughing its own course. Part of the thinking behind the Lisbon approach was the introduction of the concept of peer pressure, as each member state monitored the progress of its partners and encouraged those falling behind to maintain the overall European pace. This device was also aimed at bringing a European dimension to policy making that would help to offset and overcome the narrow political motivations which too often dominate at national level.</P>
    <P>However, without the Lisbon Agenda, the Union would lack the vision that can bind it and all its citizens together in pursuit of a goal that everyone can relate to and share. Aspiring to realise and live up to such a vision is vital to the survival of the Union as an economic and political force. Turning our backs on that vision would be tantamount to turning our backs on the EU itself.</P>
    <P>Despite the window dressing of the Council communiqu&eacute;, and without wishing to undermine the modest progress made at the meeting, we have failed on this occasion to provide the Lisbon agenda with the reinvigoration it desperately needs. The Taoiseach was correct that momentum needs to be injected into it. My hope is that this failure will not put the Government off persevering with the project because the future of Europe depends on it.</P>
    <P>I attended and spoke at the Forum on Europe last week. When we focus on something, we sometimes do not recognise the immediacy required in terms of achieving its objective. I was on the board of a hospital 20 years ago, which was contacted by the Department of Health regarding the Government&rsquo;s job creation programme. The board was asked how many jobs it could create in the hospital, even if they were not required. However, the objective was job creation. Many of the jobs that were created were not needed. Sustainable growth, therefore, is an important aspect of the Lisbon Agenda. If the EU is to succeed in terms of job creation, it must be sustainable and a way must be found to ensure the Union perseveres with innovation. Ireland has slipped up in this regard over recent years and investment in science and innovation in our education system needs to be reinvigorated. While momentum must be injected into the Lisbon Agenda, momentum must also be injected <Col N="184"/>in this area. That is in our own hands and we can do it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the House. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, for his attendance because it was extremely difficult for him, given the programme being undertaken during the Presidency by the Government, to find enough time to outline the outcome of the Council to the House. We should register our appreciation to him and acknowledge the work being done by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, other members of the Government and the officials who give them the necessary back up to ensure the Presidency is successful.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday the Taoiseach gave a <i>tour de force </i>overview of the Council meeting when he spoke at the Forum on Europe in Croke Park. There was a long question and answer session and one could not but be impressed by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intimate knowledge of the issues without referring to notes. The Council addressed a number of issues, the first of which was the constitutional treaty. It is good that progress is being made in this area and congratulations are due to those involved. A negative message would have been sent to the accession states if the adoption of the constitution were to drag on for a long time and it is good that the hope is it will be concluded by 1 June. Each member state has outstanding issues but a consensus is emerging regarding the need to reach agreement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the issue of qualified majority voting last Thursday. There will be a combination of a member state&rsquo;s votes in terms of population and its votes within the Commission. There will be a debate on the balance involved but that is the way the issue is going and the Taoiseach is firmly committed to such an arrangement, which is welcome.</P>
    <P >Taxation and how it will be dealt with is a serious and important issue from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view. We still should be able to exercise control over our own taxation affairs because together with social partnership that has been central to creating the economic success we have experienced in the recent past. This is the critical issue from a domestic point of view.</P>
    <P>A view is also emerging that each member state should have a commissioner and that is welcome. While there is a debate about the reduction in the size of the Commission, how will it physically deal with 25 member states if it is small? It is important that the Commission should examine what is happening on the ground in member states. It is not desirable that the Commission should be so small that it finds it impossible to do its work and to visit member states. That is why each member state should have at least one commissioner and should have an equal voice at the table, irrespective of size. That is a critical issue.</P><Col N="185"/>
    <P>The Taoiseach also referred to representation in the European Parliament and the minimum threshold that will apply. When the Union was formed, a base level of five was decided. In other words, every member state started with five members. There must be a system of that nature whereby the smaller countries have a base level below which they do not fall. If one were to use a crude population measure to decide representation, the smaller countries would have little representation, which would be undesirable from a democratic point of view.</P>
    <P>The issue of terrorism is uppermost in all our minds, given what happened in Spain and the appalling loss of life following the train bombings. Our sympathy went out to the Spanish Government and people. It was good that Heads of State attended the memorial service in Spain to commemorate those who died and a declaration was produced at the Council on combating terrorism. While the declaration is aspirational and good, I am not sure about the practical measures that arise from it. In other words, real practical measures on the ground to combat terrorism are not much in evidence in the declaration. It is obvious that the only way to combat terrorism is through a European approach to sharing intelligence through greater co-operation between police forces. Notwithstanding the fact that the United Kingdom and Ireland are not a party to the Schengen Agreement, it would be wrong for all the national agencies to operate in isolation given that once a person enters the border of the EU he or she is effectively in one common country. That would not be a very strong basis on which to combat terrorism. A degree of detachment from these issues is evident, as people feel that Ireland should not participate in some of these pan-European forces, whether it be military or police forces or intelligence gathering services. That would change fundamentally in the unfortunate event of an incident occurring here. Obviously we hope that would never happen, but the public would expect Europe to intervene, which would be a dramatic change. Solidarity must be shown not just in regard to natural disasters, but in response to terrorism and intelligence gathering and that is the only way to deal with these issues on a European-wide basis.</P>
    <P>The Lisbon Agenda has been debated this afternoon. I was very impressed by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche&rsquo;s radio interview on this issue. He was explicit that it was vital that Ireland would move beyond the talks stage to the point where the European Union was acting on the Lisbon agenda. He stated very forcibly the responsibility of Ireland to ensure the necessary legislation was put in place to support the war on terrorism. He is to be commended for that. Senator Quinn is correct. The forecast for growth in GNP in Europe this year is of the order of 1.7%, which is very far short of the forecast growth in the United States. Rather than closing, the gap is widening and Europe is lagging behind the US, which has <Col N="186"/>serious consequences for Europe and the achievement of the objective of the Lisbon Agenda, namely social cohesion. It is through creating a knowledge-based economy and competitiveness that we arrive at the point where we achieve the desired social cohesion. The evidence of the Irish domestic experience suggests that can be done.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>Europe is still paying for German unification. I remember a German Minister stating to the Institute of European Affairs at the start of the unification process that it would not affect German growth as it had the resources in the economy to finance unification. I queried it at the time but it has turned out that German and European growth has been seriously affected by the unification of Germany, but it has been well worth paying that price. Nobody would suggest that Germany should not have been unified. A separate question, however, was whether the value given to the Ostmark against the Deutschmark was realistic, although I fully appreciate there was a political dimension to that decision.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we go beyond the talks stage on the Lisbon Agenda. One of the difficulties is that it is very diffuse. When we had the discipline under convergence, before the Single Market, there were very specific targets for economic performance in terms of the debt to GDP ratio, inflation and so on. The targets were a barometer of performance relative to the strategy. In this case it is much more diffuse and many more disciplines are involved. That was part of the problem because it is very difficult to focus on precise parameters by which progress can be judged.</P>
    <?oasys [ic0]?><P>One of the main areas that requires progress is the question of research and development. When we discussed competitiveness in the Seanad, I referred to an article in the past few months on the brain drain in<i> Time.</i> The reasons that some of the best people in research are leaving Europe and going to the United States are twofold, first, the level of resources for their research, particularly in the sciences and second, the salaries. Several stated quite openly that it would be difficult to imagine returning home to Italy or France given what was available to them in the United States. That is a major drain on the ability of Europe to compete. However, the Irish experience was given as an example of one of the more successful approaches to research and development.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>It will be a marvellous occasion on 1 May to welcome the accession states to the Union. The vision of the founding father, Schuman, and Spaak and Adenauer and Monet when they launched the initiative arising from the devastation of the Second World War and their determination that it would never happen again will be realised. I doubt if they could have imagined a unified Europe from the Atlantic to the Balkans. The enduring success of the project is the longest continuous period of peace <Col N="187"/>since the Second World War, notwithstanding what is happening in Kosovo and other areas. Senator Bradford correctly stated that some protesters from anti-globalisation and reclaim the streets groups have an extreme left wing perspective with no democratic mandate. The protest outside the D&aacute;il against the US military aircraft flying through Shannon gave a taste of their aggressiveness. One lady who wished to protest peacefully wrote to me in great distress because she had been swept aside by these people and when she spoke out against the way they were protesting, she was harangued by people half her age, which was a measure of their lack of commitment to democracy.</P>
    <P>The events in Palestine and Israel are very distressing, the assassination of Sheikh Yassin and the abhorrent image of a young boy being used as a suicide bomber. The Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, have reiterated our commitment to the quartet road map for peace and I accept it is the way forward and is the only show in town. I am encouraged by Deputy Roche&rsquo;s reference to the need for two sovereign independent states based on the 1967 borders. It will require a major effort by all concerned in Europe to try to make progress in that area in general. The European politicians and Foreign Ministers must be applauded for their commitment in this area but it will require dedication to bring it forward. It is disappointing to see more walls and settlements being built on hillsides. This is a direct provocation of the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>We welcome wholeheartedly the accession of the prospective member states. Hopefully, Cyprus will be among them in the sense that the entire island will accede on 1 May. While that has yet to be determined, it will be a good day for Europe as well as for Ireland. We have a great deal to bring to the party. Several of the accession states can identify with us as readily as with any other EU member given the way in which we used the opportunity afforded to us by membership to improve our economy, living standards and ethos. We made the transition from an inward to an outward looking society. Ireland is no longer solely obsessed with what is happening on the neighbouring island; it looks beyond that to Europe. As a small country, our experience can provide a valuable example to accession states in achieving their goals and objectives.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys [ic20]?><Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues on all sides in expressing appreciation and admiration at the manner in which the Irish Presidency has progressed. We are feeling a little complacent as whenever Ireland takes the Presidency, irrespective of the political complexion of the Administration, it has always excelled. This honour has fallen to Governments drawn from all sides of the Oireachtas since Ireland joined the EU. It must be said, however, that the <Col N="188"/>momentous times through which we are living now mean Ireland is playing a pivotal role in the development and shaping of Europe in the context of enlargement.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>The manner in which the House, the media and the public embrace debate on Europe always impresses itself on me. I could not help but reflect given Tip O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s overused clich&eacute; that all politics is local. Local authority candidates may be engaged on doorsteps come June explaining the intricacies and complexities of the constitutional treaty Ireland has rightly been lauded across Europe for progressing to the point where, hopefully, it will be agreed by the end of that month. Everybody has his or her priorities be they at local or macro political level.</P>
    <P>The presentation of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, covered the key areas of the European Council and the mid-term review. Inevitably, combating terrorism was at the top of the agenda followed by the Lisbon agenda and foreign policy issues, the subtext of which relates to several countries and areas of tension in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. Sadly, the spectre of terrorism continues to loom large. We must ask whether the world is a safer place than it was ten years ago. I feel less safe than I did then. In the aftermath of 11 September 2001, the direction of US foreign policy and its near obsession with certain unilateral rather than multilateral, inclusive approaches is cause for concern from the perspective of Europe. I am somewhat disappointed that while the recent meeting focused on the most immediate problem we face, there was not more emphasis on bilateral relations between the EU and the USA.</P>
    <P>That is not to say the matter was not mentioned. In fact, the Minister of State Deputy Roche referred to the need to enhance international co-operation and the Council&rsquo;s declaration underlining the central role of the UN. It underscored the need to continue to enhance co-operation with partners including the United States of America. I would have thought that would be at the top of the agenda. The USA has taken its eye off the ball and is distracted by internal soul searching and analyses of its foreign policy and the direction of the Bush administration since its election. Given the year that is in it, the decisions being taken in Washington as well as in US society generally have a direct bearing on our future.</P>
    <P>I am pleasantly amazed by the openness and transparency of democracy in the USA. What other superpower, of which there have not been many, would bring its chief policy adviser before a tribunal of her peers as will happen on Thursday with Condoleeza Rice? Superpowers are usually closed, authoritarian and totalitarian societies. Ms Rice will explain in detail why decisions were taken which affected hundreds of millions of people. I am sure the world will watch in fascination as that exchange unfolds. Hopefully, it will provide us with answers and, to make a strongly partisan political point, expose the neo-conserva<Col N="189"/>tives within the Bush administration. They seem to have thought the only way forward was to use force and that the only way to conduct foreign relations is according to the maxim &ldquo;might is right&rdquo;. They seem to have thought the USA could act alone and treated the UN and its members with total contempt in the lead up to the Iraqi war. Now they are approaching the UN with cap in hand to seek a joint resolution at the end of June to somehow get them out of the morass in Iraq. What of the parents, children, brothers and sisters of the unfortunate American soldiers being killed in increasing numbers in what is becoming as difficult and complex a war as that in Vietnam? The spectre of Vietnam rides over all American foreign policy. I will not point the finger at the responsible parties; the American people will make that decision in their wisdom next November.</P>
    <P>There have been flowery words and expressions of commitment to improving and enhancing international co-operation and taking decisive action. That is the least the citizens of Europe expect from their political leaders. We demand to be reassured that we can live safely and go about our business in our own countries. Is it not extraordinary that a small country like Ireland should be thinking about terrorist threats, something that was beyond our comprehension even a short time ago? I point to the hypocrisy of political leaders who should look back on the last decade of the 20th century with shame. Have we learned anything from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, Srebrenica, Rwanda and the continuing open wound of the Israeli-Palestinian tragedy? The civilised European Union stood by and did little about the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the Bosnian tragedy.</P>
    <P>We now have the problems of Kosovo. While the Minister of State was merely reporting on decisions taken by all member states, I question the Council&rsquo;s reconfirmation of its support for Security Council Resolution 1244 and the policy of standards before status. Surely, it is time to address the final status of Kosovo. Are we to continue to see images on our televisions of ethnic division and tension in a country in which Irish soldiers are holding the line and playing an international peacekeeping role?</P>
    <P>Serbia continues to shelter and protect two of Europe&rsquo;s greatest mass murderers since Hitler, Mladic and Karadic. We are told Serbia is an openly democratic society and yet the combined forces of the European Union, the United Nations and NATO have been unable to find these two murderers in a small parcel of land in this continent.</P>
    <P>President Kigami of Rwanda rules a country which still has not fully addressed the psychological, emotional and economic damage of the genocide of ten years ago. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs, rightly, will be in Rwanda on Wednesday when we will remember the tenth anniversary of a genocide which occurred while the world stood by, where, because of what had happened in Som<Col N="190"/>alia, President Clinton refused to expand the definition of what was happening in Rwanda to a genocide, which would have legally obligated American troops to get involved, and where the general in charge of the United Nations passionately called on the United Nations for a further mandate and said that if he could have 5,000 troops he could stop the killing, but what happened? The United Nations, of which we are a member, reduced the forces, yet Rwanda, which will be feted on Wednesday, is still involved in colonial adventures in Uganda.</P>
    <P>Mugabe continues to operate with impunity, sticking up two fingers at an impotent international community. There is little reference in the Council&rsquo;s declaration to what is happening in that sad and unfortunate country.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>We then come to the Middle East. We in Ireland are best positioned to understand the pain and suffering consequent on a policy of bombings and shootings. Both sides in the conflict, with the active participation of many countries, including the EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States, eventually came to realise that the war was unwinable. The terrorists would continue their reign of terror &mdash; I mean the IRA &mdash; while those charged with maintaining law and order, the British, would continue a policy of containment. The result, as we all know, was stalemate. Dialogue and parity of esteem is the only way forward. The initiative of the Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia, to recognise the right of Israel to exist, stated unequivocally and unambiguously last year, should be built on. The Arab states fund Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups. I applaud the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, went to Cairo where he attempted to engage the Arab states in that area. Unless the European Union addresses the underlying fundamental problems of Palestinian self-determination and what is happening in the West Bank, there will never be peace and there will never be a resolution.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the other areas of concern and interest in Europe, including Afghanistan and Cyprus particularly, although I remain pessimistic about an outcome there unless the people, given the chance in the referendum later this month, decide to take the logical step and accept the Kofi Annan plan, but I have my doubts. I wish them well.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>The Mediterranean was touched on and it was highlighted that in regard to relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries, we have common concerns and strategic interests. I hope the EU will continue to monitor political developments in those countries, especially in Algiers and Morocco. Morocco is now dangerously poised to go the way of Algerian Islamic fundamentalism. It is attempting to reform and democratise itself but it is under severe pressure from external forces in nearby Algeria. One has only to remember the terror of Casablanca less than 12 <Col N="191"/>months ago which now appears to have faded from the public view because of the many subsequent atrocities, not least what happened in Madrid.</P>
    <P>Overall, there is an urgency to ensure that despite the ongoing US presidential election which appears, on the face of it, to be a close contest, it is incumbent on the European Union, and on Ireland which holds the Presidency until the end of June, to ensure the United States continues to engage in international relations. I am convinced it has taken its eye off the ball in the Middle East, that it is no longer interested in the short term in what is going on and that it is engaging in a policy of containment. One of the main planks of the Irish Presidency was to use our unique position not only geographically, but historically and emotionally, and our relationship with the United States to rebuild the building blocks of friendship, fraternity and understanding between Europe, old and new, and the United States. That remains a fundamental plank of the European Presidency and now that we have got the constitutional treaty issues sidelined to a degree in that they are off the main agenda, I hope that in the remaining months the Irish Presidency will focus on improving EU-US relations because unless there is engagement at that level, I fear for the future. Despite the best efforts of the Council declaration on removing the threat of terrorism and strengthening the legal infrastructure that is necessary to identify, arrest and contain terrorists, unless there is a firm engagement between the United States and the European Union, I fear for the future.</P>     <P>I want to conclude on a positive note. The tone of the presentation by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, was upbeat and positive. As politicians and political leaders, if we eschew optimism and bow down to threats, pessimism follows and disintegration follows that. Overall, however, the tone has been well presented by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche. The Irish Presidency can be justly proud of what it has done to date and I hope it will continue to be a success.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>

   <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>On the European Council, the first item that arises is the terrorist attacks in Madrid. As Members of this House we all express our deepest sympathies to the Spanish people and it was important, therefore, that the first Council meeting was devoted to the issue of combating terrorism. Justice Ministers were convened especially to consider a declaration on combating terrorism and the Foreign Ministers presented this work to the European Council. The declaration was discussed and adopted by the Council. Within a few weeks of the Madrid bombing, our Presidency had forged agreement on a significant response to the threat of terrorism. That is vitally important not just because of the bombings that occurred, but because of the bombings that were <Col N="192"/>prevented. The bomb found on the mainline railway in Spain recently and the seizure of large quantities of explosives in London are an indication that active terrorism is continuing and it is important that we tackle those issues. The declaration was adopted but the Council members were not starting from scratch because this process has been going on since 11 September and the European Union has been concentrating on terrorism since that time.</P>
    <P>The spring European Council was originally conceived as an economic summit in order to advance the Union&rsquo;s jobs and competitiveness agenda, namely, the Lisbon Agenda, and it was a key priority of the Irish Presidency. The European Council agreed last week on the need to re-inject momentum into the Lisbon Agenda. The idea is to make Europe the most dynamic and competitive-based economy in the world by 2010.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach wrote to all his colleagues outlining the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s priorities and his approach to progressing them. He outlined two key areas on which efforts will be concentrated. The first is sustainable growth and the second is more and better jobs. On the first of these priorities, sustainable growth, we need the right combination of sound macro-economic policies and greater competitiveness. One call made was for a draft directive on services, to be agreed as a matter of priority, to benefit both consumers and business. An issue the Taoiseach stressed in his speech to the national forum on 1 April was the emphasis on research and development. He asked that all member states actively support research and development and also give incentives to encourage greater investment by businesses throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on European Affairs, of which I am a member, was credited with doing significant work, especially in terms of scrutiny of legislation from Europe which is phenomenal.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ormonde mentioned, the language in some of the directives is impenetrable. At times it would not be possible to write a more complicated document. I welcome that the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, has taken a major initiative on the European stage by hosting the first ever formal meeting of European Union Ministers to address the challenge of Communicating Europe, which will be held in Kilcoole, County Wicklow, tomorrow and the next day. This initiative is important as developments are taking place at an ever higher level and are not addressed at grassroots.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the European Council decided that agreement on the constitutional treaty should be reached no later than June. While this is an aspiration, I do not believe it will be realised. While I support the European Union and the constitution, I have grave fears about it. It is one matter to get the constitution written; it is another matter to get it agreed and ratified.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to discuss the history of any current or acceding European Union country<Col N="193"/><?oasys [cl11.5]?>without reference to its Christian heritage. We seem afraid to stand up and insist that this be mentioned in the preamble to the constitution. Milward Brown conducted an opinion poll for the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> last November, which showed that 49% of people want the constitution to contain a reference to God, 34% do not and 17% did not know. When the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t knows&rdquo; are excluded the majority is about 60% to 40%. The question put to those polled was as follows:</P>
    <P LI="1">As you may know, a new constitution is currently being drafted for all the member states of the European Union. It is currently being proposed that there be no reference to God within this EU constitution. Do you agree or disagree that there should be no reference to God in the new EU constitution?</P>
    <P FLI="0">Remarkably the poll in Dublin showed the strongest support for a reference to God with 50% of those polled saying they wanted God mentioned while 32% did not. This translates to more than 60% of those expressing an opinion. Among voters aged 35 and upwards the support for a reference to God was even higher. We cannot simply ignore this opinion, as it will arise. There is great concern about this matter not just in Ireland, but also in other countries.</P>
    <P>This preamble to the proposed constitution was pushed by Val&eacute;ry Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing, who has a humanist outlook and a brother who heads an extreme form of masonry. While the humanist outlook is mentioned in the preamble, there is no reference to God or Christianity. I cannot understand why we are afraid of it. Who are we afraid of hurting or insulting? If we did not want to mention Christianity, God can certainly be mentioned.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>For the first time the constitution will establish the European Union as a juridical body in its own right. Article 1-10 provides that the EU constitution shall have primacy over national constitutions and law. This was never stated in any European Community treaty before. This covers not just economic policy, but every area of government. Some 30 new policy areas will be transferred from having national responsibility to Brussels. This is in addition to all the decisions previously transferred under the treaties of Amsterdam, Maastricht and Nice.</P>
    <P>The constitution will extend the scope and competence of the EU by giving the Court of Justice in Luxembourg the power to determine the fundamental rights of EU citizens overriding national constitutions and Supreme Courts as well as the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. While the constitution in itself presents no difficulties, the power it will give to the Court of Justice presents problems, as it will end up with almighty power. It will bring this court into virtually every area of life and society as human rights issues arise everywhere includ<Col N="194"/>ing the right to life <i>per se</i>, the right to life of the unborn, family law, health and education, religion, property law, labour law, etc.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>In some sensitive areas there are differences in what are perceived as rights in EU countries, for example, preventative detention, legalisation of drugs, same sex marriages, abortion, euthanasia and trial by jury. Should the EU be empowered to lay down a uniform standard for such matters across Europe? This proposal has more to do with power than rights. Unless these issues are tackled and explained clearly to the people, I fear we will have great difficulty ratifying it.</P>
    <P>Article 1-24 of the constitution allows Presidents and Prime Ministers to move European policy areas from unanimity to majority voting without the need for new treaties involving ratification by national parliaments or referendum. Article 1-17 provides that if the constitution has not given the EU sufficient powers to attain its very wide objectives, the Council of Ministers can &ldquo;take appropriate measures&rdquo; to give themselves such powers. These articles open the way for ever further expansion of EU powers at the expense of national parliaments and the citizens who elect them, without the need for prior consent.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>We are trying to introduce a constitution so that the previous treaties, which were difficult to understand, can now be understood. While the constitution in itself is quite easy to read, I am not sure that people have read it or had it explained to them. I hope there will be a wide discussion on this matter in this House, the Lower House and everywhere else before the<?oasys [jy?>constitution is ratified, which may pose difficulties.</P>
    <P>I support the European Union and the new constitution. I have views regarding defence and our responsibilities, with which many Members of this House disagree. As one who has always been pro-European, I feel we are moving in the right direction. However, I caution the way we move sometimes. While I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, had to leave, he has heard me express these views in other fora. I will continue to voice my concerns until something is done about it. I do not know if anything will ever be done or if anyone pays any attention to what we say. However, if one does not speak about this, it would not be possible to stand up to oneself again.</P>
    <P>The European Council hopes to agree the constitution by June and I agree that it would be good if this could be done. I urge caution in some areas and I cannot understand why some areas are not tackled. I do not want to go into detail about the Presidency. However, when dealing with areas like Cyprus, Kosovo, the Middle East, etc, it is important that we do so with a unified voice in the European Union. The week before <Col N="195"/>last I attended a meeting of Asian-European parliamentarians held in Hue in Vietnam. When attending such a forum, it is possible to understand how importantly people view the Irish Presidency. While we sometimes see ourselves as a very small country with little influence, that is not true. With the European Union acting as a large union of people we will have a stronger voice. It is only 60 years since Europe was torn apart by horrific wars, which have not occurred since. We are clearly doing something right and I hope we can continue.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and look forward to the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>While the convention does not apply to war ships or navy ships, there is nothing stopping us from going further than what is contained in the directive. We have done so in recent times in a number of other European directives. It is often appropriate that we use our initiative and inform our legislative assembly of our intentions. There are times when one can make an argument to the contrary. There is nothing to stop us going further than the convention in terms of our legislation. It does not make sense to state that terrorists who seize civilian ships should be punished while those who, for military or other purposes, seize other ships will not be punished. I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply on this amendment.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>

   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am unable to accept the amendment as it is contrary to the specific terms of Article 2 of the 1988 convention, which is designed to protect commercial shipping against terrorism. Article 2 of that convention specifically provides that it does not apply to a war ship or a ship owned or operated by a state when being used as a naval auxiliary or for customs or police purposes or a ship which has been withdrawn from navigation or laid up.</P>
    <P>Moreover, Article 2.2 makes it clear that the convention does not affect the immunities of Government ships operated for non-commercial purposes.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>While I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, it is important to stress that there are occasions when we should not rely solely on conventions, directives and so on.

    <P LI="1">In page 4, subsection (1), line 5, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, in relation to an Irish ship, means such a ship wherever situate,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Bill does not state that this provision will apply to Irish ships wherever situated and, although I am aware, that is the intent of the provision, there is no expressed reference in that regard. I have tabled this amendment in the interests of clarity and hope the Minister of State will respond positively to it.</P>
    <P>The problem arises more acutely in terms of the following amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my intention to bring forward on Report Stage an amendment to cover the substance of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and will withdraw the amendment on that basis. However, this is the second such occasion in recent weeks in this House that this has happened. This scenario also arose during the Committee Stage debate on the Bord Bia Bill when the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, accepted the principle and ethos of a particular amendment but did not accept it in this House and signalled his intention to table an amendment in that regard in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>If there is a serious will on the part of Ministers to accept the principle or ethos of amendments, they should do so on Committee Stage in this House. I am aware they are in a position to remedy matters at a later stage. As regards the operation of this House and taking into account Standing Orders, it is important Ministers acknowledge the contribution of Members of this House and that this type of situation be prevented from recurring.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
  <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 10 and 11 to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding <i>section 1</i>, but subject to <i>section 3</i>, for the purposes of this section, a ship or fixed platform shall mean a ship or fixed platform wherever situate, and <i>paragraphs (a) </i>and <i>(b)</i> of the exceptions to the definition of &rsquo;ship&rsquo; shall not apply,&rdquo;.</P><Col N="197"/>
   <P FLI="0">There is contradiction between sections 1 and 3 in terms of the basic matter of jurisdiction. Section 1 states that a fixed platform, for example, oil rigs and so on, means a platform in the State&rsquo;s Continental Shelf and by definition does not include a fixed platform outside the State. The section also states that &ldquo;ship&rdquo; in respect of a non-Irish ship means a ship in the State. It says nothing about what is meant by an &ldquo;Irish ship&rdquo;. The inference is that in this Bill &ldquo;ship&rdquo; and &ldquo;platform&rdquo; mean such things in the State with the possible exception of Irish ships abroad although the Bill does not state this.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 7, in terms of offences involving acts outside the State, make it clear that it is intended that the Bill will apply to acts outside the State subject to the requirement that the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions is necessary and can only be given if extradition is refused under section 7(4).</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this amendment is unclear. The Bill has been carefully examined by the Parliamentary Counsel and it is considered that it meets the requirements of the convention and protocols. While section 2(1) relates to the ordinary jurisdiction of the State, that is, within the 12 nautical miles limit of the territorial seas, section 3 clearly confers extra-territorial jurisdiction on the State as regards unlawful acts outside the State which are also targeted by the convention and protocols. What the Senator is seeking is already adequately provided for in the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a manifest contradiction between the definition in section 1 and the trial provisions in sections 3 and 7. The amendment seeks to resolve the contradiction by stating that the offence provisions in section 2 will apply to ships or platforms wherever located. The provisions relating to powers of arrest or search as contained in sections 4 and 6 will only apply to Irish ships or ships in Ireland. It seems appropriate, in terms of the offence provisions, that war ships be included.</P>

  <?oasys [cl11]?><P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 5, subsection (2), line 12, after &ldquo;life&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, pursuant to which, that person shall serve a period of not less than 15 years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">In moving this amendment I am conscious the Minister of State mentioned an indictment of imprisonment for life for very serious offences.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>Nowadays, the criminal justice system, in terms of life imprisonment, has lost its definition. I am seeking that people be locked away for life but if this provision is to have any teeth, it is important to underpin it with a timeframe. The timeframe mentioned in the amendment is <Col N="198"/>15 years. The legislation would be strengthened if we underpinned that timeframe. Currently, what is considered a life sentence is discretionary. Anyone who analyses our current criminal justice system will discover that a life sentence is a misnomer in many cases in terms of the time subsequently served for an offence. It is for that reason I am seeking to include &ldquo; , pursuant to which, that person shall serve a period of not less than 15 years&rdquo;.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Finance&rsquo;s amendment which ties in with previous calls in this House for a debate on sentencing policy. There is a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system in terms of the sentences being handed down and time served in that regard.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>The Minister of State may correct me if I am wrong, but the idea behind sentencing a person to prison is to ensure a person is detained for a certain number of years thereby preventing him or her breaking the law and committing the same crime again. I am aware of the early release system and the conditions built into it. Generally speaking, the principle of this amendment is to ensure that when a person is sent to prison for life, he or she must serve a specified number of years of that sentence. This would make clear to all that the law is rigid and must be obeyed and that those who violate it will serve an expressed number of years in prison.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys [ic20]?><Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not been the practice in Irish law to qualify life imprisonment so as to specify a minimum term of imprisonment for serious offences. Accordingly, it is a matter for the courts in the light of the particular circumstances of each case and the gravity of the offence or offences to determine what is the appropriate term of imprisonment. Irish courts have, in the past, imposed life imprisonment on serious offenders considered to be a danger to the public.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 8, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4) Notwithstanding section 10(4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851, proceedings for an offence under this Act may be instituted within 12 months from the date on which the offence was committed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P FLI="0">The investigation of offences under this legislation could well be lengthy and, therefore, often involve international borders. The timeframe mentioned is six months. However, we could at least raise that to a year, since if one has a timeframe of a year for such investigations, there is pressure to complete the investigation within it. As we know, at present, if someone has to move within our criminal legislation, it lapses within six months. Specifying the period as 12 months would strengthen the legislation on the basis of the international dimension.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is not accepted. The 1851 Act applies only to summary offences, of which there are only two being created in the Bill, in sections 5(5) and 6(2). The 1851 Act already allows a period of up to six months after commission for summary offences to be prosecuted in court. If an offence under section 5(5) was of sufficient gravity, indictment proceedings would be taken. Such proceedings should not be required to be taken within six months of the offence being committed. On the other hand, section 6(2) offences involving obstructions of searches would be readily amenable to prompt prosecution and prosecution should not, therefore, be delayed beyond the six months allowed for in the 1851 Act.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>

   <?oasys [cl11.5]?><Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>Although I have some sympathy with the amendment, I must agree with the Minister. We should take any action we can to speed up cases. It is happening too often not only in this area, but the normal judicial system. We are constantly hearing complaints about cases taking far too long to come to court. Perhaps we might all be better served by much of the other legislation on our Statute Book if there were some sort of time limit. For that reason, the tighter we can keep this, the better. That is why I fully support the Bill as it stands.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to what the Minister said. He reassured us that, despite the international dimension, investigations in such cases would be completed within a six month period. On that basis, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from the prosecution of offenders, the issue was raised of the claiming of compensation where serious offences were committed. Very extensive expenses can arise in remedying the damage done by breaches of such conventions. As I mentioned previously, there is a grave doubt in my mind as to the efficiency and effectiveness of the convention, especially in cases where the State is left to pick up the cost involved in the contamination and cleaning up some of the side effects of the breaches and offences being created, especially by ships from outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>I raised the question of the clean-up of damage done by the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the costs that the State incurred at the time in the removal of oil and securing of the wreck. That involved the State in enormous expense to be refunded under these conventions. As far as I know, the final payments to the State have not yet been made. That undermines the whole purpose of such legislation. There is an international convention under which people can claim damages, but those claims are left unattended for a long period. The last time we had similar legislation before us, I raised the question of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> compensation. The State still has not been refunded the expense that it incurred through that incident.</P>
    <P>The second point, which was raised by several Senators last time, concerns nuclear vessels travelling close to the coastline, the risk of pollution involved, the difficulty and expense of controlling something of that sort if an accident took place and how that might be covered. Under this legislation, if one of those vessels got into difficulty close to a state constituting another jurisdiction, it would be very difficult <Col N="201"/>to prosecute. I am not satisfied that the legislation is effective or efficient in dealing with those two matters: the prosecution of offences and the claiming back of compensation for damage done.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding Senator Daly&rsquo;s concerns about the convention, it is currently being reviewed by the International Maritime Organisation in London. We will be putting forward some of the concerns raised here by Senators, including those of Senator Daly. The Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 will deal with some of Senator Daly&rsquo;s concerns regarding oil pollution, for example. On the nuclear issue, some of it is our responsibility. Although I do not wish to pass the buck, most of it is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. We will pass on Senator Daly&rsquo;s concerns regarding the movements of the nuclear industry through our waters.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to labour the issue, but if one of those nuclear ships coming from the United States to the UK got into difficulties off the south west coast of Ireland, it would have to be dealt with in a very specialised, professional manner. First, do we have the capability to do it? Second, the costs for the State will be enormous. If the convention is to be effective, we must be able to claim back from it fairly quickly. I presume that we would have to do whatever was needed to protect ourselves here and then the coastline and the environment. We would then have to claim it back through the convention. It is such an obscure and complicated mechanism that it would not happen for ten or 20 years. I am not sure when the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> caused difficulties, but I believe it was in 1987. Now, almost 20 years later, the bill for that has yet to be finally settled. I do not want to get too involved in this, but it is important, especially in view of the negotiations that the Minister mentioned, that we highlight these issues when the convention comes to be examined. That will have to done very speedily given the terrorist attacks, which were not really an issue when this was debated 20 years ago.</P>

	<P>On Senator Finucane&rsquo;s point, during recent debates in this House proposals have been put forward on the breaking down of jargon. Some legislative mumbo-jumbo, as it may be perceived, can be quite complex and confusing. I know the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, is initiating plans for a more user-friendly and reader-friendly scheme as regards services offered by her Department. The Minister of State could take a lead from Senator Finucane&rsquo;s amendment. Both proposals achieve the same effect, but the amendment is clearer on definition and content.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Parliamentary Counsel has strongly advised that the terminology in section 9 of the Bill, referring to the act which constitutes the offence in question, is correct. Moreover, it avoids argument as to what the term &ldquo;corresponding&rdquo; may mean when one compares offences under the laws of different states. Thus, in line with the 1998 convention and the protocol in section 2(1), certain acts are specified which, if committed unlawfully and intentionally, are criminalised and are to be punished by severe penalties.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for their support for the Bill and their agreement to have all Stages of the Bill dealt with before Easter, as I suggested earlier. This allows me to proceed to seek consideration of the Bill by the D&aacute;il as early as possible after Easter. Such progress will not only help to reassure our important commercial shipping, port enterprise and offshore energy producers, but will also confirm the resolve of the Government to deal effectively with the terrorism dossiers during Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of his State and his official for their presence in the House this afternoon. Our purpose here is to debate and eventually provide good legislation. The sole purpose of this House is to safeguard legislation and we have done that job this afternoon. It is important there is a recognition on both sides of the need to reach compromise and agreement regarding sections of Bills which eventually lead to better legislation. I also note the considerable level of input to this Bill by Senator Daly in his previous capacity as Minister of State at the Department.</P>

   <Title>Draft Guidelines on Rural Housing: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, back to the House. Senator Moylan was in possession.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys [ic24]?><Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his contribution to this debate. I mentioned on 10 March that most rural dwellers are not farmers and do not depend directly on farming. The backbone of many rural communities is the people who live in the area but commute to work elsewhere. Such people make a major contribution to the areas in which they live. We have to enable people to continue to build houses and to live in such areas, while working in adjacent areas. We will have a major problem if such practices are not allowed to continue. The viability of many important elements of rural parishes, such as schools and sporting clubs, will be called into question if the Minister does not make the changes he proposes. We have to take on board the contribution made by sporting clubs. We will go down the wrong road if we do not allow development and if we do not allow young families and new families to live in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the serious questions being asked by local authorities about people&rsquo;s connections with an area. I am familiar with the cases of people in my home county, whose parents moved from a rural area to a town some years ago after being housed by a local authority. Their families are now in a position to provide housing in rural areas. Such people are often unable to purchase sites adjacent to bigger towns and are forced to move to rural areas to buy a site and to build a house. We must afford such people the opportunity to return to rural areas to build houses. If we are not prepared to allow people to move to the <Col N="205"/>areas from which their parents came a few years ago, we are going down the wrong road.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>The Minister may have stated that local authorities are insisting on a seven-year clause in the cases of some people who move out and build. It is hard for a young couple or a young person to commit themselves to live in an area for seven years. They may have to change jobs for employment reasons, for example. The maximum period we should require a family to commit itself to staying in a given area is two or three years. People who would love to stay in an area may have to move to another area for reasons that may be beyond their control.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about risks to underground water supplies and aquifers as a result of development in rural areas. I am aware that many houses have been built in rural areas by people who received grant aid. At one time, most houses were built under the grant size, but that is not always the case now because houses are getting bigger. The grant became unnecessary as people started to exceed the grant size. When the inspector came to approve the grant aid, in most cases he looked around the house, for example to check whether the attic was insulated or the taps were flowing. Did he check the septic tank, which is most important, to see whether it was constructed in a proper fashion and in accordance with the tight guidelines that had been set out by the Department? I do not doubt that a substantial number of septic tanks were not constructed in accordance with the proper plans.</P>
    <P>The construction of inferior septic tanks has caused serious problems to underground water sources in certain areas. We have to be straight, honest and upright about the problem. New systems, such as the Puraflo system, have been approved and cleared. People have to sign contracts stating they will provide a Puraflo system in rural areas before planning can be granted. We now have a real solution to what was a serious problem in the past.</P>
    <P>I may have spoken on 10 March about rural parishes that do not have a proper village centre. The Minister and the Department must ensure local authorities insist on a development envelope around the rural village centre, which in many cases may consist of nothing more than a shop, a church, a school and possibly a pub. Local authorities must provide an envelope to ensure new sewerage systems can be put in place at a reasonable cost to service 30 or 40 houses in rural areas. If that is done, we can say to people from a rural village without a centre or serviced sites that we are giving them an opportunity to stay in that parish and to build where it is safe to build and where a family will not require a second car to take their children to school. I hope the Minister will push local authorities to meet their serious obligation to do that.</P><Col N="206"/>
    <P>In fairness, local authorities have provided private sites at subsided rates in some villages and smaller towns. The Department should be thanked for putting in place a system that allows the local authorities to help those who require housing to build their own houses. If we do not provide private sites or give people some help to provide their own houses, people will be placed on local authority housing lists and will have to be housed by local authorities. It can cost local authorities well over &euro;150,000 to provide houses in local authority areas. If people in rural areas have the ability to provide their own houses, we should try to help them by providing some serviced sites.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the Department has substantially grant aided group water schemes in many rural areas. At least a proper supply of water, from a group water scheme, is now available. Great credit is due to the Department for making so much money available. Great credit is also due to rural communities for taking up the grant aid available to provide group water schemes, thereby enabling people to stay in their parishes and to rear their families there, as well as ensuring that hurling, Gaelic football and soccer teams can continue to exist. This is necessary to prevent the problem that was encountered recently, when two or three parishes had to come together to try to field an under-age hurling team. No children are enrolling in some small rural schools in which a number of children used to enrol every year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision. I compliment the Department and all concerned for affording people the opportunity to build houses in rural areas. We must monitor planners carefully, as some of them are taking a strict line and sticking to the letter of the law in respect of planning. They are refusing planning permission if they can find any way of doing so. That is not the intent of these new guidelines. The intent is to loosen the regulations and afford people an opportunity to build homes where they can do so at a reasonable cost and in the areas in which they want to stay.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. I look forward to further developments in affording rural people the opportunity to live in rural areas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. There is no doubt that there is a need to rejuvenate our rural areas and villages throughout the country. The reasons, as outlined by other speakers, are so sports teams can be maintained, schools can be kept open and parishes can be kept alive. We are all in agreement about this. However, will the guidelines announced by the Minister make a blind bit of difference? Many planners have stated they will make little or no difference and <Col N="207"/>many members of local authorities have stated the same.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers talked about planners keeping to the letter of the law. I hope nobody is suggesting planners should not keep to the letter of the law. If guidelines are set down, planners, irrespective of the county they are dealing with, must comply with them and keep to the letter of the law as outlined by the Government. There can be no shilly-shallying on this. The guidelines to be laid down must be adhered to.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the guidelines. They seem to be trying to be all things to all men, especially with the local elections coming up. I wonder whether they have any substance. I spoke to Senator Henry before this afternoon&rsquo;s debate and she brought to my attention the meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government of 24 March, at which there were some very good presentations, especially by Professor Convery. His opinion was that people were opting to live in one-off houses because it was often the cheapest option. I do not necessarily agree with that opinion but it is true that for many people it is the cheapest option and sometimes the only one they can afford. This is because of the levies introduced by the Government through the local authorities, especially over the last year. Senator Henry also brought to my attention the presentation at the meeting of a paper by Dr. Donal Daly, who stated that 40% of Irish soils are not suitable for septic tanks and 15% of soils are not suitable for any type of sewage treatment because of the risk of contamination of groundwater which we all know is very serious.</P>
    <P>I read the speech of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, at the launch of the draft guidelines on rural housing. To state that the proposed guidelines will promote sustainable housing development is a fabrication. The Minister&rsquo;s stated objectives were to facilitate people who have roots in an area in obtaining planning permission and, in the interest of sustaining population levels, to accommodate any demand for housing in rural areas suffering from population decline. This sounds lovely, but it is an effort to con the people of rural Ireland in the run-up to the local elections, which is part of the culture of this Government. The objectives outlined in the Minister&rsquo;s speech were given with the warning that approval would still be subject to normal planning requirements and good planning practice. In other words, if a planning officer feels an application contravenes planning requirements it will be refused.</P>
    <P>If one asks planning officers around the country what the new guidelines will mean, one will hear many different opinions. Many officials say they will not make the slightest bit of difference to the policies which currently operate in many <Col N="208"/>counties. The vast majority of refused rural housing applications were rejected because they contravened the development plan or were not in accordance with good planning practice. This will not change under the new guidelines. It is dishonest to give people false hope that they will obtain planning permission if they have links to rural areas. That is only partly the truth. In the majority of cases, people who have been refused permission in the past will be turned down again. These people will vent their anger on the Government when they realise this.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he wanted planning authorities to adopt a more positive and proactive approach in dealing with rural housing. Very few on this side of the House disagree with that aim. However, he then stated that planning authorities should act as facilitators in bringing together various strands of opinion on how to deal with rural housing. Surely this is already the case every time local authorities discuss a development plan. Does a local authority not invite comment and consultation from all areas before finalising its development plan? If any local authority does not do this it should be reprimanded. Local authorities are being asked to do what they are already doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated he wanted planning authorities to have as constructive an approach as possible in helping applicants through the planning process. This is also something we all agree with, but is this practice not already in place? What is new? We already have pre-consultation before people apply. The Minister included this in earlier regulations. This has all been regurgitated as though it were a magic wand to solve all the problems of rural housing, which is not the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated he had made it clear that protecting water quality is a leading consideration in determining whether sites are suitable for development and that the necessary environmental safeguards will continue to be implemented. Most of the people who have been refused permission to build houses in rural areas over the last number of years were turned down because of these safeguards and the need to protect water quality. Again, this is a regurgitation of guidelines already in place.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to disagree with the points the Minister makes, but the guidelines are only a smokescreen to satisfy a particular lobby. What is so earth shattering about them? Some people have been hysterical, saying they have gone too far and will lead to endless one-off houses. I do not believe this will be the case. The Minister is trying to cod people into thinking they will obtain planning permission after being refused previously for various environmental reasons. There is no question that even with the new guidelines, these people will be refused again. They are being given false hope.</P><Col N="209"/>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s policies on planning and the environment seem to change like the weather. The Minister of State said the new guidelines supersede the provisions on rural housing contained in the sustainable strategy document. However, the national spatial strategy&rsquo;s policy is at variance with the decentralisation proposals, so there seems to be a different policy for practically every day of the week. There are no linkages and no cohesive approach, which are so important for sustainable planning. The Minister&rsquo;s aim in planning for rural housing is to confuse people. It is a con trick or sleight of hand &mdash; saying one thing while meaning something else. It is typical of the Minister&rsquo;s approach; he can talk a good show but when one examines the substance of these guidelines there is nothing there. The stated policy which the Minister has advanced is even at variance with his own proposed guidelines. It is only a public relations exercise and will be shown as such in the years ahead. History will prove that these guidelines are a wasted exercise. Everything is dressed up but nothing is different. When people in rural areas apply for sites, especially if they are reapplying in places where they have already been refused permission, I suggest that the vast majority of them will be refused again for similar reasons. The Minister has outlined those reasons in the guidelines. The same thing is being put to people as if it is a magic wand for rural areas.</P>
    <P>We all want to see proper development and growth in rural areas, especially where the population has declined in recent years in order to give such communities a pride in their culture. We all want to see infrastructural development so that small towns, villages and outlying areas can be built up into living communities with proper facilities, including post offices. The draft guidelines on rural housing may seem to address such problems but history will prove that they only amount to a window-dressing exercise.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis an Aire St&aacute;it toisc go bhfuil an t-&aacute;bhar seo in&aacute;r l&aacute;thair agus go bhfuil seans againn &aacute;r dtuairim&iacute; a nochtadh anseo. Bh&iacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht anseo cheanna agus t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil tuairim&iacute;ocht an-leathan. T&aacute; muid ag teacht go dt&iacute; an freagra ar an gceist diaidh ar ndiaidh.</P>
    <P>I want to declare an interest in this subject because I am a co-founder of the Irish Rural Dwellers&rsquo; Association and am currently a member of its executive committee. For several years the association has lobbied for such guidelines, although perhaps with some fine tuning. Submissions have been invited over a two-month period and I understand that we have not reached the end of that process. One of the reasons I requested this discussion while submissions are still being considered is so that we would have an opportunity of adding to the debate, which to <Col N="210"/>some extent is organic. We are learning as we go along.</P>
    <P>For a long period, many decisions concerning rural areas were influenced from outside the country, particularly through planners and various agencies. The Irish Rural Dwellers&rsquo; Association contacted the town planning association in Britain and posed a number of questions. We were told that the association had a special section dealing with planning in Ireland, but not for any other country. The association told us that was because it saw no difference between Ireland and Britain. That may be a historical viewpoint but it is fundamental to this debate. Many of the planning decisions we are currently witnessing are more suitable to Britain than here. The whole idea of a village, which is being used as an obstruction for development throughout rural Ireland generally, is based very much on the concept of a village in Britain.</P>
    <P>We have had the dispersed village which is traditional to Ireland and which extends over a period of four, five or six miles. If one goes to Kilmaley one will not see the village within a half-mile area. Kilmaley, or other such villages, can extend over five or six miles but the people living there have an identity with their village. The dispersed village was traditional to Ireland and that is what we are still talking about. To have planning guidelines or regulations in place, as was the case, which discouraged that, undermined the very communities that existed in such dispersed villages.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with this debate which is helpful and is throwing up questions to which we still need answers. When travelling through west Clare 30 years ago, I remember seeing houses that were locked up or with their roofs falling in. It was evident that the inhabitants of those houses had emigrated, particularly to America. I have been travelling to America over the past 30 years and have met Irish people there. I met people from west Clare and similar rural areas, and invariably they will tell one that they would love to come home. People used to say that rural Ireland was dead and nobody wanted to live there any more, but now people do want to live there.</P>
    <P>Members are well aware of decisions to refuse planning, which are hard to understand. I remember canvassing in Cashel during an election when I knocked on a particular door. A young lady with two young children came out of a fine big house which I understood cost &euro;170,000. I said she was lucky to have such a lovely house, and she replied that she did not want to live there, that her parents were farming out the road and were offering her a site but she would not be allowed to build there. She said her parents were getting old and if she could build on the site she could look after them and they could look after her children, their grandchildren, but as things were she was losing and her parents were losing. <Col N="211"/>Society also lost because somebody else will be looking after those old people later on. Worse again, she had to go into town and spend &euro;170,000 for a house, whereas with a free site she could have built her house for &euro;100,000. That is the background to the restrictive issues with which we have had to deal over the years.</P>
    <P>The draft guidelines on rural housing are possibly the most important development in decades regarding rural housing. There are certainly issues that need to be looked at, including occupancy. If I invest money in a house and am told that I cannot have access to that money after two or three years, the situation needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>Many problems could be solved if the<?oasys [jy?>conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; was changed to &ldquo;or&rdquo; in the draft guidelines where reference is made to<?oasys [jy?>&ldquo;people who work in or make a contribution to rural Ireland&rdquo;. If that was done, many people who have raised questions about this would be<?oasys [jy?>satisfied. It is only one word but it is fundamental to this issue. If people make a contribution to rural areas by spending their money and<?oasys [jy?>participating in the community, that would go a long way towards resolving many of the problems.</P>
    <P>The people of rural areas invariably have been good custodians of the environment through the years. They are the first to object to anything that would harm the environment in which they reside. They enjoy the environment and want to pass it on to future generations. I am not an An Taisce basher as I pointed out to Senator Norris last week when he made a general comment in this regard. Those who raise questions about An Taisce are not bashing the organisation. However, An Taisce is a statutory body, which is prescribed under legislation, and, for that reason, it must be open to scrutiny. An Taisce has gone down the wrong road and it should concentrate on heritage and national monuments, an area in which it has done magnificent work. The media has reported on deep division within the body on that issue. Members of An Taisce, nationally and locally, believe the organisation has lost its way and has attracted negative attention. Unless the organisation fulfils the role for which it was established, it should be delisted forthwith.</P>
    <P>I refer to the composition of An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The board primarily comprises professionals but it should be expanded to include representatives of people who are affected by its decisions. Representatives of rural Ireland should sit on the board because they could provide first hand information.</P>
    <P>The role of planners must also be examined. Some 25 planners have been recruited from New Zealand. Planners are welcome from all countries and I do not cast aspersions on their professional qualifications but they cannot be in touch with <Col N="212"/>many of the traditional issues, attitudes, practices, precedents and requirements that have been set and have percolated through the planning system.</P>
    <P>The problem with the guidelines is the perception that they will make no difference. The Government recognised this well in advance but at least one or two county managers have gone public, saying the guidelines will make no difference. That suggests they have decided not to study the guidelines and get off the hobby horse to realise what the Government and the people want. If that is the case, the Minister of State should ensure nobody will be allowed to circumvent what is required under the guidelines. For example, county managers must revisit their county development plans. However, this should also be scrutinised and they should be in no doubt as to the intention of the guidelines, which is to loosen restrictions that have stifled rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I get outraged on this issue because it involves a human right. All of us are committed to good planning and saving the environment. I sat through a lecture on the septic tank issue given by a university lecturer. He convinced me that so much progress has been made in this area that such tanks should not produce effluent damaging to the environment. I accept the tanks may cost more but this issue has been addressed and the tanks can be monitored. In addition, the normal requirements still apply whereby a trial hole must be dug to analyse what will happen to the water and so on.</P>
    <P>If people are pushed into villages, towns and cities, they will also have a grievance. The quality of life in villages, for example, will be changed beyond all recognition. People&rsquo;s quality of life in Dublin has been changed through overpopulation and industry and business saturation. Decentralisation provides that the rural economy will improve and infrastructure will develop while relief will be provided to cities and towns that are overpopulated. If the guidelines are not acted on positively and results not achieved quickly, we will have to revisit the issue in ten years because of the terrible damage that will have been done to towns and cities through the restrictive practices that applied in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Why can a person living 60 to 80 miles from the site of a planning application make an objection? Very often the same person is lodging multiple objections throughout the country. Serial objectors exist. They know nothing about the communities in which they object but they have tunnel vision, largely because of An Taisce. The objections are upheld by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, perhaps because of the composition of the board, and that must stop. It should be required that an objector must live within ten miles, for example, of a site or it should be become exceptionally expensive for serial objectors to pursue their objections.</P><Col N="213"/>
    <P>Submissions were invited on the guidelines and it is intended to revisit them to fine-tune them. That is what consultation is about and it is good but the basic document contains much detail. Issues such as serial objections and occupancy and the composition of An Taisce and An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be addressed and the planning authorities must understand the guidelines. The Government should convene a meeting of county managers and planners to explain in explicit detail what the guidelines entail and, if they are not adhered to and it is necessary to revisit them in a more substantial manner, that should be done.</P>
    <P>The Irish Rural Dwellers&rsquo; Association and many farmers are delighted that at long last a courageous, explicit approach has been taken in this area. Land ownership is also an issue. There is nothing wrong with farmers selling a site to a non-family member because they might need the money to put a child through university. They have lived on the land in worse times. While times are better now, they must receive a dividend for their custodianship of the land, which they have loved through the years. Most of them want to revitalise rural Ireland. If a neighbour or friend of a farmer wanted to build a house, would it not be great if the farmer could sell him or her a site? Would it not be good for the community because the future of local schools would be guaranteed and small shops would have an opportunity to expand?</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I have a small house in County Clare. Farmers primarily lived in the area but, over the past eight or nine years, more houses have been built. Recently a hairdresser opened and a business opened in another house. The infrastructure is following the<?oasys [cl11.5]?> population and if that is not good for morale, the economy and the quality of life of the country, I do not know what is. The only show in town are the guidelines and if the Minister will listen to the few points made by Members, I genuinely believe that combined with the submissions this will fine-tune the document, of which we will be proud. We will be delighted to see the results on the ground.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his forbearance in listening to the debate. I listened to the wise contributions of Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Cummins and Moylan with which I would find it difficult to disagree. I have no doubt the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is well intentioned and, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; stated, he intended to loosen regulations. An accurate general view is that planning has become overly restrictive in every county. What is required for the guidelines is strengthening enabling legislation or in the absence of that, them being put in a specific directive form. I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that there is a preconceived notion <Col N="214"/>that these are only guidelines. That framework is built into many county development plans, which is the bedrock for planners. I urge the Minister to strengthen the guidelines further by putting them in specific directive form, otherwise it will be necessary to enact legislation.</P>
    <P>All Members have been approached by people experiencing difficulties with the planning process. As councillors or legislators we have to deal with the issues at a certain remove. I was involved in making representations in two cases. In one case, a recently married couple living in an apartment wanted to build a home on a site donated by the groom&rsquo;s parents reasonably close to their home and sharing a common entrance. They experience nothing but difficulties. Having employed a planner who spoke to the planner in the county council and engaged in interminable talks, they were unable to overcome the difficulties and were refused planning permission. I advised them to appeal the decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and with the advice of an architect and planner, they won the case. The process took two and a half to three years, which has an impact on people. The other case concerns a professional man from Kerry who was engaged in practice in Cork all his working life, but when it came to retirement he wanted to build in his county of origin not too far from his birthplace. He had a site in one of these clusters of 20 or 30 houses and he was also refused permission. The case is ongoing and is still not resolved. One must feel for people in these circumstances. We all concur with the thrust of the guidelines and want people to be able to live in the area in which they have grown up or where sites may be provided by a relative. We are frustrated that planners are putting obstacles in people&rsquo;s way.</P>
    <P>I skimmed through the earlier debate and I compliment Senator Paddy Burke on his interesting contribution in which he raised the question of sustainable development. I was delighted that in response to this the Minister said people were at the heart of sustainable development. As Members know, planners believe in clusters and villages and very often, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; stated, the concept of the village can be wider than that as evidenced by Dromtariffe in the diocese of Kerry but in County Cork, which is an entirely rural area with no village as we would understand it. Is one to say that people may not continue to live there?</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s intention is to bring common sense to bear by issuing guidelines but I urge him to put them in specific directive form or they will not have the desired effect. I understand that up to 80 section 140 motions will be on the order paper for the next monthly meeting of Kerry County Council, which will totally dominate the proceedings. People accept this is not a professional way to proceed but councillors are frustrated and believe that until the system is <Col N="215"/>loosened they will have to continue to proceed in this way. Councillors from all political persuasions tell me that individually they have planning file cases on their books. Planning is taking up the time of public representatives and unfortunately it will continue until a less rigid approach is taken.</P>
    <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the occupancy clause. I am not sure of the constitutionality of the occupancy clause although I accept that some county councils have taken legal advice and have been told it may proceed in this way. However, there is variance between three and ten years. The country is too small for such variations and the Minister should bring uniformity to bear and for that reason I urge him to put the guidelines in specific directive form. We all subscribe to rejuvenating the countryside. In Glencar valley there was once 260 houses and now there is only 130, which explains the reason for so many section 140 motions in County Kerry. I sympathise with councillors in this matter. They would welcome the guidelines if they were in specific directive form. They feel nothing is being done for them in a practical sense as the points are already set out in county development plans. There are many outs in the guidelines. As drafted, they include phrases such as &ldquo;subject to normal planning requirements and good planning&rdquo;. Some councillors argue that the guidelines could be used to make it easier to refuse permission. As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said rightly, none of us believes that was the intention. The intention was to loosen up the system as it had become overly restrictive. Sadly, the new guidelines might not make much difference to current policies if they are allowed to stand. They must be strengthened.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>Many useful points have been made during the debate. In large valleys like Glencar, although there is nothing particularly problematic there, and others in the south and west of the country, one can see large multicoloured structures. They can appear jarring given the green-grey landscape and mountain backdrop. We should have an official, general policy to provide for stone facing given the amount of useful local stone throughout the country. If it was operated by local authorities individually, each might implement such a policy differently. We need not have multicoloured house fronts which fail to fit in with the landscape and can mar the beauty of the countryside. We can overcome problems in this regard. I encourage the Government to introduce an official policy of stone facing for rural housing. We have all heard of people who have witnessed the result of disastrous planning between Galway city and Connemara. If local stone product had been used, we would not encounter half as much criticism.</P><Col N="216"/><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>While I am loath to criticise anybody, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s comments about An Taisce made an impression on me. There are good and bad people in every organisation and An Taisce has brought much deserved criticism on itself. It is divided internally. Until An Taisce puts itself right and introduces agreed structures, there is a case to be made for not having a prescribed body. While I do not want to consider the matter in too much detail, there are serial objectors, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, who are like serial knockers. Perhaps a restriction needs to be imposed on them by providing for a distance limitation. In Killarney objectors from more than 25 miles away brought cases to An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding permissions the local authority was prepared to grant but which the board refused to allow.</P>
    <P>A new framework is required in this area but it must be very specific. Guidelines will not fit the bill. I have no doubt that planners have been taking a rigid view. While I welcome the thrust of Senators&rsquo; remarks, I urge the Minister of State to ensure that changes are made in specific directive form as he must if they are to have the desired effect. Otherwise, there will be too many loopholes in conditions and planning practices. Reference has been made to practices regarded as normal due to custom, but these could vary from place to place. I urge the introduction of strengthening legislation or a specific directive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys [ic20]?><Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. His Department deserves a great deal of credit for introducing the guidelines. The public has reacted positively to the measures which have been announced. Despite the negative criticism of the scheme from some quarters, the vast majority of people can see the value of the guidelines. My colleagues and I have been working to resolve this issue for some time due to the circumstances we have faced on the ground and the dissatisfaction the public has voiced.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a strong tradition of rural dwelling. About one third of the population lives in what can be described as the &ldquo;countryside&rdquo;. As planning policy stood, family members were being forced to move away from their homes and the areas in which they had grown up. It was contributing heavily to the decline in rural populations as people were forced to move to more urban areas. How could rural areas be expected to thrive and grow under such arrangements? It was clear that steps needed to be taken to support the development of rural communities.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>The majority of rural dwellers are not farmers nor are they directly dependent on farming. Less than 8% of the population is engaged in this activity. Despite this fact, planning permission for one-off housing was being restricted to farmers although people in this sector were affected also. <Col N="217"/>I know a number of farmers in Laois who were unable to build homes for their children on their own land. This is incredible. I doubt too many other countries would have allowed such a state of affairs to develop. Thankfully, we have addressed the issue and can look forward to people returning to rural areas. We can expect people who wish to be part of rural communities to be able to live among them. Teachers and those involved in forestry, the marine and other rurally-based occupations are the kinds of people who must be allowed to live in rural areas if such areas are to survive. Whereas we should be encouraging them, until the new guidelines were introduced they stood little chance of being able to build homes in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I note with approval the measures contained in the guidelines to help areas suffering from population decline. Planning authorities are required under the new guidelines to ensure that any demand for housing in rural areas suffering from population decline is accommodated subject to standard planning practices. This will stem the flow of people out of areas and encourage development. People will know they can build and raise families in these areas. It is welcome that people will no longer be required to have roots in a local area to receive permission to build. Declining rural communities will no longer have a severely limited pool from which to grow. People from all over the country and beyond will be able to build homes and breathe life into declining communities. In stronger rural areas, development will strike a balance between providing for local people and encouraging the development of smaller towns and villages. I agree with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, who said that such a step is necessary to ensure the provision of a balanced range of choices in new housing development.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest certain criticisms of the proposals when they were first announced. I was particularly bemused by the criticism that the Government intended to cover the countryside in concrete. This was never the case. The Minister&rsquo;s measures will permit the countryside to develop. The guidelines were introduced because of the Government&rsquo;s respect for rural life. We wish to stop the decline of rural communities and to enable people to live in and develop rural areas. No one wishes to see large scale development blighting the countryside which is why the guidelines simply allow people with links to local communities to build in rural areas which already have a healthy level of development. In areas of decline, there are opportunities for those without links to the community to establish homes. Neither measure will result in over development.</P>
    <P>The Government realises that natural beauty is essential to the country. It is one of our greatest resources. However, there must be a balanced <Col N="218"/>approach. Under the previous policies, we would have been as well off putting areas aside and preventing people from visiting them and disturbing the scenic beauty. That is how ludicrous circumstances were becoming. The primary purpose of the areas in question is to have people living in them rather than admiring them. The guidelines protect people&rsquo;s right to live in rural areas while ensuring the correct balance is struck to permit the countryside to thrive for many years to come. Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who is a nice man, said An Taisce should be de-listed. From the dealings I have with it over the years, it should be abolished because it has no idea what is happening on the ground.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to discuss this important issue. As somebody who represents a largely rural area in County Kilkenny I am familiar, as are all the previous speakers, with the difficulties experienced by people in obtaining planning permission in rural areas throughout the country. I have to admit, however, that I am not convinced that the guidelines as published by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, will do anything to seriously improve the situation. I regret that because there is much room for improvement in that regard.</P>
    <P>As soon as the guidelines were published I contacted the planning section in my own local authority in Kilkenny, Kilkenny County Council, to discuss the implications of the guidelines in terms of its development plan and rural housing policy and I was told in no uncertain terms by the staff of the planning authority that the guidelines as published by the Minister would have no effect whatsoever because the wording in the guidelines is already largely contained in the county development plan in Kilkenny. It is fair to say that particular wording is contained in many of the development plans already in existence throughout the length and breadth of the<?oasys [jy?>country.</P>
    <P>My response to the guidelines from the Minister is in light of the fact that much of what is contained therein is already contained within development plans throughout the country. If problems are being experienced in getting planning permission in rural areas of Kilkenny under the current development plan, those problems will not be resolved by the publication of these guidelines. That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I agree with what most of the previous speakers said about the planning guidelines. Senator<?oasys [jy?>Moylan in particular was correct when he spoke about the effect the difficulties in getting planning permission is having on rural communities throughout the country. He spoke about the difficulties for rural schools and villages in terms of facilities like post offices, Garda stations, sports clubs, etc. which are having difficulty in continu<Col N="219"/>ing in operation. He is correct in that regard and unless some action is taken, the decline in numbers in these rural areas will continue. I do not believe these particular guidelines will have any positive impact, other than in specific areas where population is declining.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>In the past few years more obstacles have been put in people&rsquo;s way when it comes to development in rural areas. I speak particularly about the recent large increases that have taken place in development levies. In my own county of Kilkenny and in various parts of the country there have been significant increases in the development levies which will, in effect, provide an extra stumbling block for people who want to build a house in their own rural area. It is rather unfortunate that these development charges have been hiked up across the country because this is another negative impact on the future development of rural Ireland. I genuinely believe, from the small amount of activity on the ground, that those people who support and have supported the large increases in development levies will get a firm clip around the ear when it comes to the local elections in June. I await that development.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>From speaking to a number of planning officials and councillors I understand that in certain situations the new guidelines published by the Minister may further hinder development in rural areas. I am talking specifically about the removal of hedgerows to get suitable sight lines for access to sites in rural areas. I am told that under the wording of the guidelines as published by the Minister this may make the current position even more difficult. That is not something that could be welcomed in any way.</P>
    <P>The major problem I encounter on a daily basis with the planning process is not necessarily that it is difficult to get planning permission in a rural area but the major inconsistencies that exist from county to county and even within counties with regard to planning and development. Throughout the country we see large, obtrusive developments getting permission yet we are all familiar with people in our own areas, with genuine need, who apply for permission to build modest dwellings but who find it difficult or impossible to get that permission. The major problem for planning in rural areas is inconsistency, and I hope these guidelines will bring a new level of consistency to planning decisions throughout the country. We will have to wait and see if that happens.</P>
    <P>Most people who speak on this issue say that if people have a genuine connection with a rural area they should be accommodated but that the curtain should be drawn at that point. I do not agree with that. There is something positive to be said about new people coming into areas. It is important in any area, whether urban or rural, that there would be an influx of new people from <Col N="220"/>time to time. The Cathaoirleach will know, through his involvement with sporting<?oasys [jy?>organisations, the importance of getting new people into areas. We might have a few Limerick hurlers on the Kilkenny team if we were to get some new families from Limerick into County Kilkenny.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I should not interrupt but we would welcome them if they were to come the other way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach is disobeying his own rules.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, the notion that in order to build in a rural area one has to have a cast-iron connection with the area and that permission will not be given otherwise is too restrictive. Some provision should be made for attracting new families into rural areas but that is not catered for in these guidelines.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has decided to publish the guidelines. If I were to be cynical, which I have been accused of being by different Government Senators from time to time, I would say that the upcoming local elections on 11 June might have something to do with this but I welcome the fact that it now appears to be part of Government thinking that something needs to be done about rural development and planning. I cannot see any significant improvement in my local area of Kilkenny as a result of what is contained in these planning guidelines in terms of the difficulty people are experiencing in gaining planning permission. That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to go back to the drawing board to ensure that people who have genuine links to rural areas and those who want to build houses in rural Ireland, which fit in with the character of the area, are accommodated. As many Senators said, we have a tradition of rural living. A large proportion of the population has always lived in rural Ireland. In the previous century there were many more people living in rural areas than are living in them now, and rural areas can sustain that level of development. I urge the Minister to re-examine the possibility of introducing planning and development guidelines that will have a positive impact in rural areas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<?oasys [ic20]?><P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. Like other speakers I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s initiative to facilitate rural people to get planning permission in their home areas. I believe this will make a difference. As Sligo County Council had difficulties in recent years, we established a five-person committee to review our county development plan to make it somewhat easier for local people to get planning permission. In addition to local people and farming families, it was also important to look after farmers finding themselves in financial dif<Col N="221"/>ficulty to allow them to sell sites to get out of financial trouble or to upgrade their farms or milking parlours to allow them to stay in business. We have implemented much of what is proposed in the new guidelines into our county development plan. While this has worked well, it was not enough, because in the event of an objection, An Bord Plean&aacute;la was able to refuse, as it did not conform to national guidelines. The Minister&rsquo;s proposals will resolve that<?oasys [jy?>problem.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that someone living 30 or 40 miles away has a right to object to those seeking planning permission to build a house for themselves and their family. It should not be acceptable to object unless the planning application has an effect on the objector&rsquo;s property or home. I am aware of two cases, one a small housing scheme with six houses and the other a single house, where the county council had granted planning permission and the inspector from An Bord<?oasys [jy?>Plean&aacute;la agreed. However, the board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused to grant permission. If the board takes the trouble to send an inspector to review a planning application and the inspector recommends granting permission, I cannot understand why the board should overturn that decision. They are faceless people, probably not based in the county, who have not seen the sites and may not know where they are.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>In response to what Senator John Phelan said, Sligo County Council has applied development charges of &euro;2,000 for water services and &euro;2,000 for sewerage services, and a &euro;800 development charge.</P>

	<P>The Senator should tell his party colleagues in Kilkenny.</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is that the council decides the charges. I have a brother with a valuable site in Portmarnock on which he hopes to build a house. He told me the service charge in that area on a five-bedroom two-storey house is &euro;63,000, which is unbelievable. However, once that house is built it would be worth &euro;1.5 million. It is inevitable that there be differences in every county. However, Sligo is a nice place to live and a cheap place to get planning permission.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, for attending. He is very assiduous in coming to this House and is very cheerful about his duties here. I congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, on introducing the guidelines.</P>
    <P>Of all the duties we have as Members of the Oireachtas, planning issues take up the most time and give rise to the greatest disbelief, upset and tensions within families who simply cannot understand why they cannot get planning permission. These guidelines will open the way to give planning permission to people who should have got such permission long ago.</P>
    <P>I have spoken with some colleagues who agree with my thoughts about planning officials. Occasionally local authorities are blighted with planning officials who believe their mission in life is to impose their wishes on the people of the county and have a doctrinaire approach to development, particularly on the question of where houses should be located. Over the years I have spoken to several such officials and two or three stand out in my mind. They had definite socialist principles and were so far to the left that they met themselves coming back. They wanted to impose doctrinaire principles on the planning department that had not previously been heard of.</P>
    <P>These planners did not believe it appropriate for a son, daughter, nephew or niece of a farm owner to build a house in the vicinity of the farm. I like the concept in the guidelines of getting together the elected officials, the county manager and planner and local organisations to work out a formula to drive proper planning procedure. We all know that it is not appropriate to have a two-storey house on the side of a lake and that <Col N="223"/>proper sewerage and water facilities need to be available to a potential development site.</P>
    <P>Senator John Phelan made a very good point about breathing new life into an area, which I will address shortly. However, there are endless refusals for decent relations of landowners who want to build a house to live in. It is impossible to explain these refusals to them as they get so irate. At the same time they may be able to point to a monstrosity up the road, which was built having received long-term planning permission some time ago before the planners got stricter. This gives rise to the most awful misunderstandings and tensions, which I can fully understand. It is extraordinary that a rural dweller with a chance to get a site at a reasonable rate from a relation to build a house for his or her own use cannot do so. The land belongs to the people, not nameless or faceless people, a term often used, with dogma written on their foreheads whose only wish is to implement whatever ideas they were imbued with in college. The land is for living on and for arable use. People should be permitted to build houses on their land, to live there and to raise their families in decent circumstances. Not everybody wants to build a mansion. Given the cost of building nowadays, I do not know anybody who could afford to build a mansion. Most of the people with whom I have dealt with on planning matters are seeking to build simple houses, usually bungalows. We have all heard about bungalow blitz but that is not relevant now.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas and members of county councils are faced every week during their clinics with at least three dissatisfied people who have been refused planning permission and one or two hopefuls. Senator John Paul Phelan is correct that many rural areas would benefit if people wishing to live in rural Ireland although they have no ties to a particular area, one of the first priorities of the guidelines, were allowed to do so. We have discussed the issue of population decline in rural areas for some time and how we can invigorate such areas. That can only happen if we grant not an over-abundance of planning permissions, but a decent amount of them. There has been a great deal of bad planning in urban authorities. One only has to recall the rows of local authority housing, something from which, thankfully, we have moved away. Such planning was not considered a blight but the unfortunate person living five miles outside a town wanting to build on his site was unable to obtain planning permission.</P>
    <P>The guidelines will illustrate to the local authorities and, hopefully in time, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, that what the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister of State, has commenced is the right way forward. However, it will require goodwill and co-operation from local authorities to make it happen. The Minister will not encounter prob<Col N="224"/>lems with the county councils because councillors have been seeking this type of development for a long time. It is important we open up the gate a little so that people do not continue to receive the usual letters as regards planning permission. One often questions, having read such letters, how a particular person could have been refused planning permission. The situation has worsened in the past four or five years in that it has been much more difficult to obtain planning permission.</P>
    <P>People lucky enough to have visited another country will be aware of developments there in terms of where people live, yet when one travels around Ireland all one sees is empty fields with no housing. How this impacts on local schools was also mentioned. We are all aware of the pupil-teacher ratio in terms of the retention of teachers. It is right that a specific requirement be laid down in that regard. However, if rural schools are to remain in existence and if people are to have an opportunity to obtain a great education in their local school we must increase the population in these areas.</P>
    <P>I recall when I entered the Department of Education in 1987 &mdash; I am sure the Minister will remember this &mdash; the pupil-teacher ratio changed. The local parish priest in one of the rural areas surrounding where I lived told the people at mass one Sunday to hoist up their buggies the next day, to put every child in the house into them and to enrol them in the local school regardless of whether they were of suitable age.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>While I applaud the Minister&rsquo;s work in this regard I hope it will be followed through. Sometimes people have good aspirations and ambitions, as this document illustrates, but often they are not followed through. I am aware the consultative process will not be finalised until the end of April. However, the Minister has clearly stated that he does not wish local authorities to wait until the end of April to finalise the process; he wants them to review the guidelines and to come up with ideas for moving forward. I believe the consultative process is necessary. I agree with Senator Scanlon&rsquo;s point regarding President McAleese, although the issue does not arise in the context of her presidency. Apparently, a man in Cork objected to her building a house in Roscommon. I have never heard anything quite as daft. How could a person living in Cork have a bearing on the decision regarding the building of a house in Roscommon? He could not say he was living near it and that the chimney smoke would affect his eyes or that the traffic would cause him trouble. However, he took it upon himself to arbitrate on where a person should be allowed to build a house. I am aware a revised plan has been submitted and that the build will go ahead.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck with the guidelines which have been debated on two separate <Col N="225"/>occasions in this House, bearing witness to the enormous interest in this issue. I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s closing comments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators for their valuable contributions on 10 March and today on the draft guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, regrets he is unable to attend the debate this afternoon but I assure Members I will brief him fully on their contributions. The views expressed will be carefully considered before the guidelines are issued in their final statutory form. Senators&rsquo; contributions were practical and many sensible suggestions were made. This is so because we are the people dealing with constituents&rsquo; queries on a daily basis. As Senator O&rsquo;Rourke stated, the receipt of a letter of refusal of planning permission can be devastating for an individual or family.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note the widespread welcome given to the publication of the draft guidelines particularly in rural parts of the country. I do not accept, contrary to statements by some commentators, that an acceptance of the importance of affording people in rural areas the opportunity of building their own homes means the Government is not fully committed to the principles of sustainable development.</P>
    <P>Sustainability must be about people. Surely the most sustainable rural area is one that affords its indigenous population the opportunity to build a home in their own area. The guidelines are explicit in a manner never before witnessed. Reasonable proposals on suitable sites for persons who are part of and contribute to a rural community must be accommodated. The guidelines are a giant step forward in defining what are reasonable proposals and suitable sites. I strongly believe it is reasonable that the housing requirements of persons with roots in or links to a rural community should be accommodated by the planning system. Beyond that, the guidelines clearly flag the importance of and provide guidance on the planning for housing in areas where the population is declining, carefully managing the development of sensitive areas and areas under pressure for development and housing policies which strengthen rural areas generally.</P>
    <P>The guidelines make it clear that a housing development in rural areas needs to be of good quality in its location and design and should complement rather than dominant its surroundings. They stress the importance of applicants, their agents and the planning authorities taking a collaborative approach in ensuring that the choice and location of site together with the design and development approach chosen is harmonious <Col N="226"/>with the physical environment surrounding the site.</P>
    <P>The guidelines also make it clear that protecting water quality is a leading consideration in determining whether a given site is suitable for development. Therefore, the development plan must clearly flag those areas where ground water quality is a critical issue and where particular requirements may apply. The Minister indicated earlier that he is considering the necessity of additional measures to ensure that septic tanks and other waste water systems are regularly monitored and maintained.</P>
    <P>Of course, in that regard we all know we have a duty of care. The guidelines are intended to progress what has become a very polarised debate. The role of the development plan as the mechanism to bring all parties to the table is stressed, for example, the councillors who make the plan, the planners who advise on it, and the public whom it serves. Adopting a development plan on a shared basis with ownership by all interests is the way to progress the debate.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the guidelines will detract from the policy thrust of the national spatial strategy. The critical mass and population of Ireland&rsquo;s major urban areas, such as those identified in the national spatial strategy, is growing fast. Between 1996 and 2002, the fastest growing areas were towns with a population of 3,000 and upwards and the main cities. Many of those growing areas are the gateways and hubs identified in the national spatial strategy.</P>
    <P>The rural housing guidelines emphasise the importance of managing rural development trends carefully and areas under significant influence from nearby urban areas to ensure the compact and sustainable growth of such cities and towns. The guidelines will underpin the policy objective of the national spatial strategy. As is standard practice for guidelines of this nature, they are being issued in draft form before finalisation. However, in view of the issue&rsquo;s importance, the Minister has requested planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to take the guidelines on board and put in place the measures necessary to implement them with immediate effect. I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the sustainable development of rural areas. The new guidelines reflect that and seek to promote and support the viability of rural communities. The guidelines will bring greater clarity for planners and applicants alike and should help ensure that inconsistencies and rigidities in rural planning are eliminated.</P>
    <P>There were references to the various local authorities and whether they might implement those. However, all variations to development plans made to reflect the guidelines will be submitted to the Department, and if they do not reflect the guidelines&rsquo; provisions, we will raise those issues with the relevant local authorities. Of <Col N="227"/>course, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will have to have regard to the guidelines under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000. If the guidelines are not implemented by the planning authorities, the option would be open to the Minister of issuing a statutory policy directive under the Planning and Development Act 2000, with which authorities would be legally obliged to comply. In other words, we will be monitoring developments very closely and will take steps if necessary.</P>

	<P>The structures and provisions are in place, but I am not sure whether they have been effected hitherto.

That should not be necessary, and this approach uses a carrot rather than a stick, but if it is necessary to issue such a directive, we will not be found wanting.</P>

	<P>My reason for tabling this motion is that Castleknock Educate Together school has experienced tough beginnings in temporary places of accommodation over the past four or five years. Thankfully, within the last three years it has been provided with proper temporary accommodation  on a school site at Beechpark in Castleknock. That school site was bought in 1981 and there is a long history surrounding the location of a school there. Castleknock Educate Together is being located on the site in temporary accommodation. The temporary permission was given by Fingal County Council two years ago on the express understanding that this would be the site for a permanent school. That was not surprising given that the county council in the late 1990s, when I was a member, changed the development plan from housing to amenity. This was to ensure houses would not be built on the land and that it would be reserved for a school site.</P>
    <P>In 2000 the county council compiled a list of all permanent, temporary and reserved school sites throughout the Dublin 15 area. This listed Beechpark as a reserved school site. However, on seeking information recently for an additional class<Col N="228"/>room, Castleknock Educate Together was advised that the location would not be considered as a site for a permanent school. This has thrown the parents, children and teachers into shock and disarray. The school had been temporarily accommodated in Laurel Lodge and then had to move to the Navan Road. At long last it found a home at Beechpark and now it is being told by the county council that this is not suitable as a permanent site.</P>
    <P>I am sure this will come as news to the Department of Education and Science which has owned the site since 1981. There have been three development plans in the area during that time, all of which have allowed for a school on this site. If this is not now going to be the site for a permanent school, which the Government has provided for under the school building programme with tenders to be invited for a permanent building later this year, the Department has a serious problem as have the parents. Where will the Department find a permanent site? I hope tabling this motion will make the telephones ring in Fingal County Council and that answers will be forthcoming as to why this situation has come about at this late stage.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>The building comprises a two-storey development at present. Some 260 children are in the school and a further 60 are enrolled for next September. Supporting the case for Castleknock Educate Together to be recognised for permanent status is the fact it has a five-year enrolment programme undertaken over the past couple of years to prove to the Department that it has some permanency in the area. I hope the Minister of State in his reply will allay the fears of the school&rsquo;s management and parents about the statement made by Fingal County Council.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>

	<P>I thank Senator Morrissey for giving me the opportunity to outline on behalf of the Department of Education and Science the position on the Beechpark Avenue site in which the Castleknock Educate Together national school is located in temporary accommodation. The Department purchased the lands at Beechpark Avenue in 1983 to provide a post-primary school in the Castleknock area. At the time of purchase the site was zoned residential. Subsequently, a decision was made to build a school at Diswellstown and the site at Beechpark Avenue was no longer required for educational purposes. A motion to change the<?oasys [jy?>zoning of the site from residential to amenity was put to the local authority and despite the opposition of the county manager, it was passed.</P><?oasys [ic2]?>
    <P>Since 1985 St. Brigid&rsquo;s GAA club has been leasing the site on a temporary basis. The club has been refused a long-term lease. A deputation from St. Brigid&rsquo;s met with the previous Minister for Education and Science and it was agreed that <Col N="229"/>an area of ground would be provided at the rear of the site to allow for its continuing use as a playing field by the club and other local and community groups. More recently, the Department gave permanent recognition to Castleknock Educate Together national school and decided to situate it on the Beechpark Avenue site, initially in temporary accommodation. The Department received planning permission from the local authority for the provision of an eight-classroom school in temporary accommodation. Senator Morrissey has suggested that this permission was granted on the presumption that there would be a permanent structure. It is now somewhat surprising to learn that this permission may not be forthcoming. However, I would like to make the point that this may be a verbal report, but the Department&rsquo;s consultants are currently preparing a planning application for a permanent school at Beechpark. As the application has not been lodged with the local authority, that body has not given a decision in the matter. However, I appreciate the parents are in shock and disarray at the suggestion, which hopefully is no more than that, that the site is not suitable for a permanent structure. A temporary permit was granted on the basis this would be a permanent structure eventually. I thank the Senator for raising the matter, and at the first available opportunity I will convey his strongly-held views to the Minister for Education and Science with a view to progressing this project.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, who has responsibility for older people, for attending the House. I also compliment him on his excellent work since becoming a Minister of State in this Government, following on the fine work of his predecessor, Dr. Tom Moffat, who was an excellent Minister of State. He and I worked together when I was chairman of the Western Health Board between June 2001 and June 2002.</P>
    <?oasys [ic24]?><P>The Adjournment matter I raise relates to the development of a much needed, dedicated dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease unit at the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon. This hospital can accommodate approximately 200 long-stay patients and currently accommodates 180 patients. I visited the hospital last Friday and saw a number of people suffering from dementia and from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.<?oasys [jy?>Speaking to hospital staff, I felt there was a need for a dedicated unit for those sufferers, perhaps also allowing long-stay care for them. The staff were working under extreme difficulties, because the number of people suffering from these diseases is in effect a new phenomenon in Ireland.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>
    <P>While I was chairman of the Western Health Board, and a member of that board, we were involved in a major refurbishment in the Sacred <Col N="230"/>Heart hospital of St. Michael&rsquo;s ward, at a cost of &euro;500,000. This has helped the hospital&rsquo;s work tremendously. The health board, with the aid of finance from the Department of Health and Children, has also carried out other refurbishment and improvements in the hospital, involving equipment, furniture and beds, and that has been very welcome. I place on record my appreciation to the director of nursing in the Sacred Heart hospital, the assistant director of nursing and all the hospital staff, who do an excellent job. We are very fortunate in having such care and attention given to our elderly in such institutions.</P>
    <P>Currently there is concern regarding the development of a central hospital kitchen required under health and safety standards, and the Minister of State might update the House on that. As chairman of the Western Health Board I had the honour of opening a very nice day care centre, which is located at the old convent at the Sacred Heart hospital. I invite the Minister of State to Roscommon to perform the official opening of the refurbished St. Michael&rsquo;s ward, which was never officially opened. I would like the Minister of State to view the facilities at the hospital, after which he might be in a position to give the go-ahead for work to proceed with the 12-bed dementia unit and 24-bed long-stay Alzheimer&rsquo;s unit.</P>

   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my good friend Senator Leyden for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for his kind comments. As Senator Leyden may be aware, more than 60 million people in the European Community are aged 60 and over. One in five of the population of the EU is an older citizen, and the ratio is set to rise to one in four quite rapidly. In Ireland, the expected increase in the number of older people reaching advanced old age is dramatic. It has been estimated that between 1991 and 2026, there will be a 75% increase, approximately, in the number of people aged 75 and over. Inevitably, this will give rise to an increase in the numbers of people suffering from dementia, and will present a major challenge to our health services in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The development of services for people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is based on the action plan for dementia published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People in 1999. Considerable progress has been made in service development since the publication of the report and in each of the years since 1999 the Department of Health and Children has provided additional funding of more than &euro;5 million to Psychiatry of Old Age and more than &euro;2 million to the<?oasys [jy?>Alzheimer Society of Ireland for services delivered. In addition, the Alzheimer Society gets a capital core grant. Carers of Alzheimer sufferers have also benefited from the &euro;5 million we have made available in the same period, specifically for the support of carers. In addition, health boards are making progress in the provision of stand-<Col N="231"/>alone dementia units. Having said that, we need to do much more for people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and ensure we have some level of adequate services in place in every region.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Leyden for the invitation to view the facilities of the Sacred Heart hospital, an invitation I am happy to accept. I will also be happy to open St. Michael&rsquo;s ward if that can be arranged. Senator Leyden&rsquo;s interest however is in the delivery of services, which is why he would like me to view the hospital facilities. I would like to do so, and to speak with the relevant service providers there, the matron and her staff. I will respond positively to Senator Leyden on that request and would like to respond similarly regarding the proposed dementia unit.</P>
    <P>Plans are at an advanced stage for the selection of a team to undertake the initial design to upgrade Our Lady&rsquo;s ward to incorporate a 12-bed dementia unit and a 24-bed long-stay unit. The estimated cost of this project is &euro;2.68 million, and progress will depend on the level of capital funding available to the Western Health Board and its priorities for such developments. I will very happy to drive this proposal through the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden also referred to the kitchen facilities at the hospital. I understand that the Western Health Board is currently examining the feasibility of shared facilities between the Roscommon county hospital and the Sacred Heart hospital. I am not sure if the Senator or the Sacred Heart hospital will be happy with this proposal, but it might be an item we could put on the agenda when I visit the hospital. I hope that is satisfactory for the moment.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I will be delighted to make arrangements with his Department and the Western Health Board, which has responsibility at least until 1 June for the Sacred Heart hospital, its developments and invitations. I will be delighted to welcome the Minister of State to the hospital.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>

   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for responding to this item on the Adjournment. I am concerned that in the near future the ambulance service in Kenmare may be amalgamated with that in Killarney. I understand that for about one third of every 24-hour period, the ambulance needs of Kenmare are to be serviced from Killarney. This could put lives at risk and is a considerable downgrading of the current service. The ambulance based at Kenmare hospital serves Sneem,<?oasys [jy?>Lauragh, Tuosist, Bonane, Blackwater, Kilgarvan, Kenmare and down to the Black Valley. This is a very large geographical area stretching from the County Cork border near Coolea to Ardg<Col N="232"/>room on the Beara peninsula, and to Castlecove on the Iveragh peninsula. The terrain is mountainous with poor roads and many remote glens on both peninsulas, covering an area of 80,258 hectares. The density of the population is one of the lowest in Kerry with only eight households per kilometre. Due to the uneven road surfaces, one has to drive slowly to prevent patients and staff being sick in the back of the ambulance. Journey times are, therefore, made longer, adding another 40 minutes to the response time which is totally unacceptable. The &ldquo;golden hour&rdquo;, the time GPs aspire to get patients with serious injuries, myocardial infarctions, etc, to the nearest hospital and which is vital for favourable patient outcome, will almost be over before an ambulance arrives at a patient&rsquo;s house to begin the long journey to either Tralee or Cork.</P>
    <P>Kenmare town is 75 km. from Tralee and 85 km. from Cork, making much of the area over two hours journey from the nearest hospital. The further reaches of either Sneem or Lauragh can add another tortuous 40 km. to this journey. It is inconceivable to imagine maintaining cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a collapsed patient or waiting for an hour at the scene of a road traffic accident while an ambulance is mobilised from Killarney.</P>
    <P>The 2002 census saw a rise of 12% in the population of the greater Kenmare area, while that of Kenmare town rose by 30% since the 1996 census. The 65 years of age and over group constitutes a higher percentage of the population than the national average. With an influx of immigrants, Kenmare is also one of the most cosmopolitan towns in the south west. Of those retired persons coming to live permanently in this isolated area, most are not only from abroad but also from Cork and Dublin. They are at a time in life when they are most likely to need hospital admission as emergencies via, for example, the cardiac ambulance in cases of suspected myocardial infarction. Kenmare is one of the premier tourist destinations in Ireland, having two five star hotels and numerous other hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation to service the huge influx of visitors in the tourist season, which now extends to most of the year. It must be remembered that 1.2 million tourists visited Kerry in 2000 with a resultant demand on services, including medical services.</P>
    <P>Kenmare has a vibrant night-life and can be called the Temple Bar of the south west. There are particular difficulties for emergency services at weekend nights when large discos, with up to 800 people attending, are held in the town. New night clubs have opened since licensing hours have been extended and are attended by large crowds of local young people, tourists and those from neighbouring towns such as Macroom, Bantry, Glengarriff, Castletownbere, Sneem and Killarney. The take-away food outlets do not close until 4 a.m. Such an influx of young people, with alcohol readily available until the small hours, has the potential to trigger incidents of <Col N="233"/>assault, accidents and road traffic accidents, as these young people journey home again having partied until daybreak.</P>
    <P>Maternity patients in labour need the services of a rapid response ambulance service to transport them safely and quickly to the nearest maternity unit in Tralee or Cork. This service is even more vital now that a large asylum seeker reception centre is based in Kenmare. Extending the response time to call-out will result in unsafe practice with deliveries of babies taking place in transit on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments justifying the removal of the service to Killarney is the low call-out rate &mdash; 370 calls per year &mdash; of the Kenmare ambulance. Over the years, the people in the area have always been aware of how isolated they are and the Minister of State is aware of the south doc scheme. The people of this area responded most generously when called on to fund the equipping of a cardiac ambulance. I would be glad if the Minister of State would consider appointing an additional emergency medical technician team to this area. I appeal to the Minister of State and the Southern Health Board not to take the retrograde step of downgrading the ambulance service in the Kenmare area. This service has the backing of all medical practitioners in the area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to alleviate any belief of an imminent threat to the ambulance service in the Kenmare area. Senator Coghlan spoke in great detail of the lie of the land of the Beara peninsula. I am familiar with the area, but the Muntervary peninsula is possibly nicer.</P>

	<P>Staring at the crossroads.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2001 report of the strategic review of the ambulance services forms the basis for the development of future pre-hospital emergency medical services. It identifies aspects of the emergency ambulance service which need to be addressed in order to bring the service into line with best international practice and to ensure effective and quality driven practices. The report recommends that the service be developed at a number of levels. Principal among the proposed developments are the elimination of on-call as a means of providing emergency cover, improved fleet reliability and the roll-out of the emergency medical technician advanced programme. There is evidence of a direct relationship between the speed of response and good outcomes in life threatening emergencies, such as cardiac arrest and major trauma.</P>
    <P>The elimination of on-call is designed to facilitate further improvement in response times. The Minister for Health and Children was pleased to provide funding in excess of &euro;3 million in 2004 to facilitate the continuing phasing out of on-call arrangements in a number of regions. It is hoped to extend this programme. Additional capital funding of &euro;2.5 million was provided in recent months to enable the service providers to <Col N="234"/>improve fleet reliability. This includes continuing with fleet and equipment replacement programmes which are essential pre-requisites for enhanced speedy and appropriate care. In addition, the Minister has announced approval for the development of the emergency medical technician advanced programme. Considerable work has been done by the pre-hospital emergency care council, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, in preparing the legislation necessary to give effect to the introduction of this programme in 2004. The introduction of emergency medical technician advanced training is the single most important development which is taking place in the emergency ambulance service. The health strategy also refers to the importance of the first response.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan is aware that responsibility for the provision of ambulance services in the Kenmare area rests with the Southern Health Board. I am advised that concern has been expressed by a number of GPs in the Kenmare and Sneem catchment area about the future of the service. The board was happy to be in a position to allay this fear and has advised the GPs that it has no plans to close or reduce the future of the Kenmare ambulance station. The board is addressing the key recommendations of the 2001 strategic review and is advancing arrangements for the reduction of the on-call element of the staff workload at the Kenmare station. The Department of Health and Children is advised that measures aimed at achieving this are the subject of discussion between members of the board&rsquo;s ambulance management team and ambulance personnel. The resource implications associated with the board&rsquo;s proposal for the elimination of the on-call element are the subject of consideration within the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Coghlan and the House that the Government is fully committed to the development of our emergency ambulance service. A great deal has been achieved in the development of the service, although I recognise that much more remains to be done. It is essential to maintain the progress that has been made and to continue the process of service development so that effective pre-hospital emergency care is accessible to those who need it most, when and where it is required.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan is concerned that there are plans to close, reduce or put into question the future of the Kenmare ambulance station. The Southern Health Board has indicated to my Department that there is nothing to fear from the operation, enhancement and development of the Kenmare ambulance station. The changes in the on-call element of the service are in line with the findings of the 2001 strategic review. If Senator Coghlan wishes to raise any aspect of the matter or any related issues, I will be happy to try to respond to him. Alternatively, he can take the matter up directly with the Southern Health <Col N="235"/>Board. If he has any further concerns, I will be happy to try to address them.</P>
