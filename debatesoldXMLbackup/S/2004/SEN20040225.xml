	<P>I have received notice from Senator Brennan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify access to school transport arrangements currently in place for students from Limerick city catchment area who wish to attend Salesian College, Pallaskenry, County Limerick.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the Government&rsquo;s decision to push ahead with legislation to bring about electronic voting for the June elections without the consensus of all parties, when will the legislation be before the House? When that legislation comes to the House, I intend to use Article 27 of the Constitution to ask a majority of Members in the House and at least a third of the Members in the other House to petition the President not to sign this Bill and to put it to the people by way of referendum.</P>
    <P>As the Leader well knows, Article 27 has never been used since the founding fathers of our State enacted the Constitution. However, I believe that the use of this article is appropriate because it refers specifically to issues of fundamental national importance. We should ask the President not to sign the legislation if the Government intends ramming it through the Houses of the Oireachtas and to have a referendum to allow the people to decide whether they want electronic voting. The people should have the final say, not some arbitrary Minister back on a kick from the Far East.</P>
    <P>Will the Progressive Democrat Members of the House please contact their former friend, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and ask him to stop this collision course that he has decided to embark upon with other Members and parties in the House? The Progressive Democrats are the key here because before the last election they told us they would keep an eye on Fianna F&aacute;il when this kind of issue came up.</P>

	<P>Come on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are they now? Many elements of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party have a difficulty with the concept of a paper trail, but it is vital that a paper trail exists, that votes can be verified and that people have confidence in the process. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, is not imbuing the system with confidence. I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, gave further ammunition to those people who are opposed to this measure last night on RTE radio because of his performance. Yesterday the Taoiseach showed himself to be at sixes and sevens on this issue. We need clarity and independent commentary which currently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a bit of objectivity from the Opposition.</P>

	<P>It is as easy as one, two, three.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;does not happen, which is why I will put Article 27 of the Constitution to the House when this matter comes before it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue is clearly beginning to gather moss among the general population. People are very upset and concerned about what is going on. From the outset I was actively in favour of electronic voting for two reasons; one reason was speed and the other was accuracy. It was suggested that, for the first time, we would have true proportional representation. It now appears that we cannot have true proportional representation. For me, this was the biggest reason for being in favour of the electronic system.</P>
    <P>I ask that the Leader convey to the Government the embarrassment people felt while listening to the Minister of State talking about this issue on RTE radio last night. This was picked up on by &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today. One would not hear the like in a pantomime; the Minister of State argued that these were voting machines and not computers and was not able to answer simple questions on the issue. This is the wrong way to go about giving trust and confidence to the population. A serious problem is arising here and it is a pity it is dividing parties along Government and non-Government lines. Each Member of the House should have a view on this. I speak as one disinterested in party politics. However, we should worry about this issue. Can someone indicate to me why this system cannot provide true PR?</P>
    <P>Cork, the capital city of Munster, has offered calculated contempt to the rest of Munster by choosing Dustin the turkey as the grand marshal for the city&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade. The leader of the Labour Party in this House often purports to be a Cork man. Does he associate himself with this?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Seanad has no control over this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In my experience of Dustin I have found that he is well able to answer for himself and has dealt with far more formidable critics than Senator O&rsquo;Toole. I will leave it to Dustin.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with what the two previous speakers said about electronic voting. Why did Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas insist that a detailed paper trail, requiring the signature of four Members of each House, be put in place when electronic voting was introduced here? When we take a vote electronically in the House there is a paper record that is signed and verified by four Members. The Oireachtas does not trust electronic voting sufficiently to dispense with a paper record.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1088"/>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is public voting, not a secret ballot.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not trust it when we have a public vote. While we vote in public we still want a paper record verified by four Members, yet we are telling the electorate that this will not be available to it. Why are we so different from the electorate?</P>
    <P>Representatives of the OECD recently visited this country as part of a review of higher education. Many bodies, including the Higher Education Authority, the Department of Education and Science, directors of institutes of technology, and presidents of university made submissions to the OECD. Yet again, the voice of the Houses of the Oireachtas has not been heard. Members have a variety of views and experience of higher education. I seek a debate on the future of higher education in the short term. Having completed the debate, we should send a transcript to the OECD to represent the views of Members on the issue.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of extraordinary and self-serving nonsense is being fed to the OECD. The submission of the HEA is about how important it is that the body be maintained. The submission of the Department of Education and Science is about how important it is to stop it from increasing funding for third level education. The political process ought to be involved in this. I call on the Leader to provide a debate on higher education in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>We should have a debate on democracy on this island as a matter of urgency. We are getting into murky waters when in one guise people can celebrate the achievements of an illegal organisation while in another guise pretend they have nothing to do with the organisation when it starts kidnapping and beating up people. There is a need for clarity on this issue. I am tired of lectures from people who claim to be on the same part of the political spectrum as me. I do not believe there is anything sufficiently wrong in this country to justify beating up or killing a single person. This is the difference between my party and Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the comments that have been made on electronic voting are beyond belief.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s party has said it has reservations about it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be an extremely grave matter that would require us to consider invoking Article 27 of the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and this is not a subject of that gravity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Let the people decide.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The secrecy of the ballot is sacrosanct and should remain so. It will remain secret under the new system. One uses cards in ATMs and expects the bank to provide the money. We do this with confidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a paper trail from the ATM and bank statements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>This is exactly the same. I have advocated electronic voting since I entered this House. It is a secure and good system. If we were to have electronic voting and someone were to say that we would also have paper voting, we would resist it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Brian Hayes said. Based on the last general election, I was in favour of electronic voting. However, since then and in view of the concerns expressed on all aspects of electronic voting, I have changed my opinion. I have changed my opinion because I am dubious of a Minister who keeps changing his position. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has been quite arrogant in the area. The Minister was in Malaysia when the Taoiseach announced that people would have the chance to spoil their votes. When the Minister returned, he said this would not be the case. How can one trust a Minister like this?</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of credibility and trust from the electorate. The Minister happens to be the director of elections for the local elections and as he is introducing electronic voting, people are bound to doubt it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not allow a detailed debate on electronic voting at this time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I would almost encourage a political party to move a court injunction against introducing this in June in order to ensure that it is properly researched.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader consider holding a debate on the role of voluntary organisations in community life? We all accept they play a major role in charitable works, tourism, sport and culture etc. The world is changing and these organisations face many <Col N="1090"/>challenges. Many groups have said that it is sometimes difficult to find volunteers. Community life will be the poorer for this and many of the things that are currently being done will be left undone. It would be good if the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs could discuss this matter with us. It would give us an opportunity to highlight concerns and also to salute the great work of such groups.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Brian Hayes on his idealism if he believes it is possible to invoke Article 27. He is much more idealistic than me; I do not believe for a minute that there will be a breaking of rank on the Government side and that large numbers of them will vote with us.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not have a debate on electronic voting on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aching for a debate. I raised this issue from a Luddite perspective four months ago. I do not like the interposition of machines between the voter and the result. Senator Dardis said this is not a serious issue. I would have thought that the undermining of the confidence of the electorate in this State is a dangerous threat to democracy. Since this debate has opened up, I have been in constant receipt of additional information casting doubt on electronic voting. Yesterday it was said that in the Florida election one of those machines registered minus 30,000 votes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, we are not discussing that now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been increasing concerns about it all along.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation will be introduced.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on violence in the North of Ireland. It is important to remember that people in Sinn F&eacute;in really do seem to be moving. I listened two nights ago to a senior Sinn F&eacute;in representative on Vincent Browne&rsquo;s programme. He was asked the very direct question whether he would like to see arms taken out of the situation now. He answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with uncharacteristic directness. He was also asked whether he would like the IRA to disband now and answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with the same uncharacteristic directness. That demonstrates to me that Sinn F&eacute;in is really attempting to move towards full democracy, and that should be encouraged. However, it is very difficult to disentangle people from the paramilitaries, because they have their hooks into illegal drugs and all those other activities. It will be a very complicated task to remove them from the equation.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1091"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Twice already I have called for an urgent debate on human rights at home and abroad. Today it was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Colombian Government had tried to segregate Niall Connolly from his two colleagues in La Modelo Prison and move him to a state penitentiary notorious for violence. Intervention by our ambassador to Mexico and Colombia, Art Agnew, and his staff was able to stop that move. As reported in the newspaper today, the lawyers are very concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this a question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that this is another instance of the Colombian Government pressurising the judge to postpone the verdict further until after the United Nations human rights report on Colombia.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator a question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very important for everyone in this House that three Irish citizens be treated in accordance with their human rights.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to have a debate on the proposal by the national lottery company to introduce a system for playing lotto by mobile phone. They tell us that they have the technology and that, within three months, they hope to take a decision. We must approach it with caution, since significant numbers of children use mobile phones throughout the country. We must ensure we do not become a nation of compulsive gamblers as a result of playing lotto by mobile phone. It is important that we have a debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>I also support our leader, Senator Brian Hayes, with regard to e-voting. The performance of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, was dismal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is supporting the debate. We cannot debate electronic voting on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and last week in this House he said that the paper chase would give a different result from the voting machines.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on higher education, particularly regarding the OECD report. I include in that the post-leaving certificate courses, the rationalisation of courses and how access can be encouraged through the PLC system. That would be very worthy of debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I might raise with the Leader comments made at the weekend by the head of the police force in Northern Ireland, Mr. Hugh Orde. In view of there being such a large number of unsolved crimes and murders there and throughout the island, many of which will <Col N="1092"/>remain unsolved and all of which are linked to the political conflict in Northern Ireland, he suggested that consideration once again be given to a truth and reconciliation commission. That issue merits consideration by the House and the Government. It has been suggested before and is seen internationally, particularly in South Africa, as a method of bringing some degree of closure and peace to many families. I would like us to consider that suggestion, and perhaps the Leader might arrange with the appropriate Minister that we have a debate in this House on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brendan Ryan has called for a debate on third level education. I assure the Leader that we on this side of the House are happy to debate third level education at any time and look closely at our record <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> that of others. Senator Ryan reminded us that the OECD is conducting an in-depth analysis of third level education commissioned by the Minister. However, as Senator Minihan has rightly reminded me, we are debating the issue in detail at the Joint Committee on Education and Science, starting tomorrow. We invite Senator Ryan to join us, since his colleagues from all sides will be there. It will be interesting to hear the views of the Opposition parties regarding the recent pronouncements of Dr. Garret FitzGerald. There may be something of a conversion on the road to Damascus. We await it with bated breath.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Leader has already organised a debate on this matter, however, I support some of the views expressed on electronic voting. The Minister was away on European Presidency business in the Far East, and I accept that he could not be in this House for that debate, but it would be appropriate, now that he is back and the Cabinet has discussed the issue, giving it apparent closure from the Government point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation will be coming into the House, and we can discuss it then.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that we debate the matter again in this House with the Minister, Deputy Cullen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>When we discussed electronic voting in the House some weeks ago, I mentioned in particular Senator Finucane&rsquo;s support for it, and I am sorry that he has changed his mind. I said at the time I believed that Senator Finucane would have been in the D&aacute;il if there had been electronic voting in the 2002 election. People talk about a lack of security with electronic voting. What security do we have with the current system? Think of the hundreds of votes unfranked or spoilt accidentally.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have ruled that we will not debate that now.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1093"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The current system is inadequate <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the electronic voting that will be introduced in June.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday we witnessed with pleasure the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, signing the Dublin declaration on behalf of the European Council as president of overseas development. I request that the Leader ask the Minister of State to come back to this House to explain the criminal negligence on the part of the European Union regarding the fact that, within the European fund, $14 billion has lain idle and unused. No one has taken responsibility for it, despite the fact that it had been earmarked for overseas development to combat poverty. It is an absolute disgrace that the body has failed to take its work seriously and utilise the money to save some of the 6,000 people who die daily in Africa and south-east Asia from hunger and poverty. I ask the Minister to come here and say clearly that he, acting during our Presidency, will insist that projects are initiated and that, if no one within the European Union can administer the money, it will be given to the charities which have worked on the ground over the years rather than having them penny-pinch and beg for funds from the public at large. It is a disgrace that such a quantity of money lies idle and unused&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can make all those points when the Minister comes in.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and no one knows about it. No projects are listed for alleviating poverty and hunger. We got a note from the Taoiseach as Members of these Houses requesting that we collect some momento of the Presidency of the European Union.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>All that is for the debate, when we have it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The best souvenir that we could have of our Presidency is activity on that fund.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls from Senators Ryan, Ormonde and Fitzgerald for a debate on higher education.</P>
   
    <P>The public has a right to expect the House to discuss the issue of electronic voting with a degree of objectivity and in a less crude, less partisan spirit.</P>
    <P>As regards the point made by Senator Bradford, before we get too deeply into a discussion on a truth and reconciliation commission, I would like the British Government to publish the Cory report.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt><Miles com="cl" par="113"/>
	<P>Last week, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, correctly referred to the constitutional and civil right of citizens to cast their ballot as they so decide. The Minister for the <Col N="1094"/>Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, appears to have forced the Government to make a U-turn on the issue. As Senator Dardis stated, the secrecy of the ballot is sacrosanct and was so upheld in the McMahon <i>v.</i> the Attorney General case of 1972, which was later unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court. As we know, if someone enters a polling booth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making a specific point. As the Minister informed us two weeks ago, if someone enters a polling booth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A specific point could lead to a debate, which is not possible on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>With the guidance of the Cathaoirleach, I do not intend to have a debate now. Under the electronic system, if a person does not want to vote for any of the candidates, the machine will have to be deactivated, thus breaching the secrecy of the ballot because the presiding officer, polling clerk and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may make these points when the relevant legislation comes before the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the Leader envisage that the independent commission will deal with this point?</P>

	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of electronic voting and asked when the relevant legislation would come before the House. The heads of a Bill to address the issue are being drafted, after which they will be presented to Cabinet and the legislation published. As the Cathaoirleach wisely noted, all the matters raised by Senators can be aired when the legislation comes before the House. The Seanad led the field on this issue by holding a debate on electronic voting before it became contentious. It was a healthy debate in which everybody participated. I note Senator Brian Hayes cited Article 27 of the Constitution. While it is a matter for the Opposition to choose the method by which it brings clarity and objectivity to the issue, we will await developments.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole called for clarity on electronic voting and asked a question about a development, of which I was not aware, regarding the grand marshal of the Cork St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade.</P>

	<P>Senator Ryan raised the issue of electronic voting. I will take up his point regarding a debate on the OECD report on higher education. While I am sure Senator Fitzgerald is correct that a good debate will take place at the Joint Committee on Education and Science, as a Chamber of the Oireachtas, it would be worthwhile for Senators to express their views on the matter in a cogent, well-structured debate on higher education. I believe the OECD would welcome such a debate. Although it may have been a little high-handed not to have had such an opportunity, we will consider the suggestion now that it has been made. Having read the OECD report, I should have considered the possibility of having such a debate, particularly as it seems that all the vested interests have given their opinion on it. We will try to have the debate as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis robustly defended the electronic voting system and made interesting comments on it. As regards the argument that those who favoured electronic voting system two years ago should still support it, the debate has moved to a new level and it is plausible for those, such as Senator Finucane, who previously favoured the system to want to raise questions about it. I believe our voting system will be sorted out in time.</P>
    <P>On Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s request that I ask the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to come to the House to discuss voluntary bodies, an opportunity to discuss the issue, albeit in a slightly indirect way, will arise tonight when the House debates a Private Members&rsquo; motion on the dormant accounts fund, an issue which embraces some of the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Referring to electronic voting, Senator Norris stated that voters&rsquo; confidence is being undermined. He also noted comments made by a senior Sinn F&eacute;in figure on a recent radio programme. I also heard the programme and found the politician in question refreshingly candid. Senator White called for an urgent debate on human rights and provided an update on the current position of a prisoner in a Colombian jail.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon referred to the possibility that people will be encouraged to play lotto on mobile telephones. I shuddered at the thought because it will make it very easy to play the game. The question arises, however, as to when one should play nanny and when one should give people rights.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde indicated that she would welcome a debate on higher education. Senator Bradford noted the statement by Hugh Orde concerning the large number of unsolved crimes and asked whether a truth and reconciliation commission should be established to give people an opportunity to address these issues.</P><Col N="1097"/>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald called for a debate on higher education and referred to an interesting article by Garret FitzGerald in <i>The Irish Times</i>. The former Taoiseach has reached the point where his views are read and listened to objectively. He is regarded as a man of wisdom to whom we listen and whom we commend or not, as the case may be. He is a place apart, so to speak.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy also called for a debate on electronic voting, while Senator Kitt pointed out the mishaps which occur under the current voting system. I remember an occasion some years ago when 38 unfranked votes, which is a considerable number, were found in a ballot box in a voting station. At any rate, I was still elected.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The lady in question was not re-appointed to do the job. I do not know to what Senator Ulick Burke was referring when he raised the issue of moneys which had not been drawn down and could be used to help tackle poverty or AIDS. We will ask the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, to come to the House. He is a worthy representative who adopts strong positions on various causes. Time is the problem now because of the upcoming legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh supported calls for a debate on higher education and wished that e-voting had not become a partisan issue, as it clearly has. Senator Bradford, while agreeing that the truth and reconciliation idea was excellent in itself, wished that the Cory report could be published as it would throw some light on the issues. Senator Coghlan raised the issue of e-voting and Senator Hanafin raised the issue of the faults of the present system of voting. Senator Feighan again raised the issue of e-voting. The legislation on e-voting will be introduced here. I understand the heads of the Bill are being prepared at the moment. If we get the Bill here quickly, we can debate the points being made.</P>

   <Title>Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003: Second Stage.</Title>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, I am pleased to be in the Seanad to speak on the Second Stage of the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has asked me to express his gratitude to <Col N="1098"/>the House for facilitating him in taking this Bill and to pass on his apologies for not being present today.</P>
    <P>During its passage through the D&aacute;il a number of amendments, which have strengthened the Bill, have been made. I will comment on the main amendments later when outlining the various sections of the Bill. First, however, I propose to summarise the background and context of the Bill, the basic aim of which is to strengthen the industrial relations procedures given effect through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.</P>
    <P>The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature. The fundamental approach of successive Governments to industrial relations has been one of voluntarism. There is a consensus among the social partners that the terms and conditions of employment of workers are best determined through the process of voluntary bargaining between employers and workers and between employers&rsquo; associations and one or more trade unions or staff associations. This approach to industrial relations has served us well over the years. In general, our laws do not try to impose a solution on parties to a trade dispute, but rather are designed to support the parties in resolving their differences. The State has, in general, confined its role to underpinning voluntarism through the provision of third party industrial relations machinery.</P>
    <P>We have a number of dispute resolution services, which are at the disposal of workers and employers to assist them in resolving their differences. The Labour Relations Commission alone chairs more than 2,000 meetings per year and 80% of these cases are settled at conciliation. Issues not resolved by the Labour Relations Commission may be referred for investigation to the Labour Court. In 2002, almost 600 cases referred to the Labour Court under industrial relations and other legislation were completed. Despite the fact that the majority of recommendations issued by the court are non-binding, there is an acceptance rate of more than 80% by parties to the disputes.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, has recognised and recognises there is a need for dispute settling mechanisms in situations where employees wish to be represented by a trade union or excepted body but collective bargaining does not take place. Under Partnership 2000, a high level group comprising representatives from IBEC, ICTU the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach was set up to devise a mechanism for resolving such disputes. In its final report the group recommended two distinct procedures to be put in place. Its recommendations laid the foundations for the procedures we have in place today.</P><Col N="1099"/>
    <P>The first procedure is a voluntary one provided for through the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution &mdash; SI 145 of 2000 &mdash; which was prepared by the Labour Relations Commission, in consultation with ICTU and IBEC, and promulgated by the T&aacute;naiste in May 2000. In essence, the code of practice provides procedures for the negotiated resolution of these disputes.</P>
    <P>The process under the existing code of practice for the successful resolution of a dispute can be summarised in four steps: (1) The dispute is referred to the Labour Relations Commission, which appoints an officer from its advisory service to assess the issues in dispute; (2) the advisory officer of the Labour Relations Commission works with the parties in an attempt to resolve the issues in dispute; (3) in the event that the issues in dispute are not capable of early resolution by the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, an agreed cooling-off period is put in place. During the cooling-off period, the commission&rsquo;s advisory service continues to work with the parties in an attempt to resolve any outstanding issues. The commission may engage expert assistance, including the involvement of ICTU and IBEC, should that prove helpful to the resolution of any differences; and (4) if, after the cooling-off period, all issues have been resolved, the Labour Relations Commission disengages. Before disengaging, the commission may make proposals to the parties for the peaceful resolution of any further grievances or disputes. In the event of issues remaining unresolved after the cooling-off period, the Labour Relations Commission makes a written report to the Labour Court on the situation.</P>
    <P>The second procedure, a legislative fall-back procedure, was provided for through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001. This Act gave new dispute settling powers to the Labour Court in cases where no arrangements for collective bargaining are in place. Under the 2001 Act, disputes may be referred unilaterally by an authorised trade union or excepted body to the Labour Court in a case where all of the following circumstances pertain: first, it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and the internal dispute resolution procedures normally used by the parties concerned have failed to resolve the dispute; second, the employer has failed to observe a provision of the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution, which I mentioned earlier, or has failed to observe such a provision in good faith; third, neither the trade union nor the employees, as the case may be, have acted in a manner which, in the opinion of the court, has frustrated the employer in observing a provision of such code of practice; and fourth, neither the trade union nor the employees, as the case may be, has had recourse to industrial action after the <Col N="1100"/>dispute in question was referred to the commission in accordance with the provisions of the code of practice. Cases that have satisfied these circumstances may go through the following Labour Court procedures: an investigation of the case by the Labour Court, which may result in a recommendation giving the court&rsquo;s opinion and, where appropriate, its view as to the action that should be taken; a review of all relevant matters, which may result in the making of a determination by the Labour Court; a review of the determination by the Labour Court; and an application to the Circuit Court for an order directing an employer to carry out the determination or review of the determination. Ultimately the 2001 Act provides for the issuing of a binding determination by the Labour Court, enforceable through the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to strengthen the procedures in the 2001 Act in line with commitments in the national agreement, Sustaining Progress. In the negotiations on Sustaining Progress, the trade union and employer organisations agreed that there is a need to enhance the effectiveness both of the procedures put in place by the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 and the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution. Under section 8.9 of Part 2 of Sustaining Progress, seven specific measures to enhance the effectiveness of existing procedures, as agreed between the Government and the trade union and employer representatives, are set out. Measure 1 states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The introduction of an indicative overall time-frame targeting 26 weeks &mdash; with provision for up to a maximum of 34 weeks where necessary &mdash; for the processing of cases under the Dispute Resolution Code and Act to the point of issuance of a determination, save when an extension is agreed by the parties.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This measure sets out the timeframe agreed between the Government and the trade union and employer representatives for the completion of cases under an enhanced code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution and the amended legislation. Allowance has been made for the extension of the timeframe from 26 to 34 weeks, if necessary. The introduction of a timeframe will shorten the length of time required to process a case through the code of practice and Labour Court procedures.</P>
    <P>Measure 2 states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The amendment of Section 2 of the Act to provide that engagement by the Court could now take place on the basis of a breach of the timeframes within the Code, the exhaustion of the timeframes or the indication at any time by the Labour Relations Commission that it is unable to assist the parties. These provisions would be substituted for the existing Section 2(l)(<i>b</i>), while preserving the remainder of the Section.</P><Col N="1101"/>
    <P FLI="0">This measure requires changes to the conditions to be met under subsection 2(1)(<i>b</i>) of the 2001 Act. This will facilitate the movement of cases from the auspices of the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Measure 3 states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The amendment of Section 3 so as to allow the Court to combine both the preliminary and substantive hearings, where it considers this to be appropriate.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Under section 3 of the 2001 Act, the Labour Court may hold a preliminary hearing to determine whether the conditions set out in section 2 of that Act have been met. This measure would allow for the combination of this preliminary hearing with the hearing of the case. However, the Labour Court may still hold a separate preliminary hearing, if it so wishes.</P>
    <P>Measure 4 states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The removal of the provision in the Act for the Labour Court to review a determination, prior to seeking enforcement of a determination by the Circuit Court, by deleting Section 9 and amending Section 10 to provide for an entitlement for the trade union or excepted body to apply to the Circuit Court for the enforcement of a determination immediately &mdash; or on expiry of whatever implementation period is provided for in the determination.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This measure was designed to contribute to the speeding up of the processing of cases to facilitate achievement of the agreed timeframes.</P>
    <P>Measure 5 states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The introduction of a new Code setting out the different types of practice which would constitute victimisation arising from an employee&rsquo;s membership or activity on behalf of a trade union or a manager discharging his or her managerial functions, or other employees, drawing, as appropriate, for consideration, on relevant definitions in existing Codes and legislation and best practice.</P>
    <P FLI="0">In this measure it was agreed to introduce a code of practice on victimisation. This code of practice will only be applicable in instances where the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution has been invoked or where steps have been taken to invoke that code of practice. This code will cover victimisation of trade union members, managers and other employees.</P>
    <P>Measure 6 states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The amendment of the Act to provide that the Labour Court should have regard to breaches of the Anti-Victimisation Code and where appropriate should provide for redress in making its determinations.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This measure provides for redress in situations where a breach of the code of practice on <Col N="1102"/>victimisation has been established. The decision to provide for redress requires legislative provisions, which are included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Measure 7 states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Transitional provisions will be developed to allow for the processing of cases in current disputes where access to the Code of Practice on Dispute Resolution as at the date of agreement is not available.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This measure provides for the introduction of changes to subsection 2(1)(<i>d</i>) of the 2001 Act. This subsection is one of the four existing conditions that must be complied with before the Labour Court can investigate a case.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the measures agreed in Sustaining Progress requires a revised code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution; a code of practice on victimisation; a number of amendments to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001; and the introduction of legislative provisions to provide for a prohibition on victimisation, to provide for the processing of complaints of victimisation and redress where appropriate.</P>
    <P>A new code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution will support the provisions of the Bill. This code of practice has been the subject of discussions between the Labour Relations Commission and trade union and employer representatives. Following these discussions the Labour Relations Commission prepared an enhanced code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution for the consideration of the Minister. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has signed the necessary statutory instrument under section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, SI 76 of 2004, to give effect to this code of practice.</P>
    <P>The enhanced code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution prepared by the Labour Relations Commission sets out the procedures for the effective and expeditious resolution of the issues in dispute. A period of six weeks will be provided for the processing of cases under the enhanced code. An advisory officer will be appointed to facilitate proceedings. Accordingly, a dispute, which has not been resolved by the Labour Relations Commission within six weeks, will be deemed to have been exhausted and the advisory officer will disengage. However, in instances where real progress is being achieved, the parties may agree a time extension during which the advisory officer will continue to work with the parties towards achieving a resolution. The code also sets out the actions or inaction involved in determining whether a breach of the timeframe has occurred.</P>
    <P>It was agreed to introduce a code of practice on victimisation. This will set out the different types of practice which will constitute victimisation arising from an employee&rsquo;s membership or activity on behalf of a trade union <Col N="1103"/>or a manager discharging his or her managerial functions or other employees.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to the legislative provisions agreed in Sustaining Progress. I will outline to the House a summary of the sections of the Bill and the main amendments which have been made during its passage through the Lower House.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard section in all Acts. It provides for the interpretation of certain references which are mentioned later in the Bill and also permits abbreviated references to sections, subsections and to other Acts. This section was amended on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to include definitions for the terms &ldquo;Act of 2001&rdquo;, &ldquo;Court&rdquo;, &ldquo;excepted body&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo;. As a result of a very useful exchange of views on the alternative definitions of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; put forward on Committee Stage, the Government brought forward a further amendment to the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; on Report Stage which was agreed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deletes section 2(1)(<i>b</i>) of the 2001 Act and replaces it with a provision that allows the court to investigate a trade dispute if one of three different conditions has been met. These conditions are a breach of the timescales in the amended code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution; the exhaustion of the timescales in the amended code of practice; and the receipt of a report from the Labour Relations Commission that no further efforts on the part of the commission will advance the resolution of the dispute.</P>
    <P>A further amendment to section 2 of the 2001 Act was brought forward on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to clarify that the provisions of the 2001 Act apply where the employer does not engage in collective bargaining negotiations with the grade, group or category of workers who are party to the trade dispute.</P>
    <P>Section 3 replaces section 3 of the 2001 Act. This section enables the Labour Court to allocate its resources more efficiently by allowing it to combine preliminary and substantive hearings in a dispute referred to it under section 2(1) of the 2001 Act, if it considers it appropriate. This section would also have the effect of reducing the length of time taken by the Labour Court to conduct an investigation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 replaces section 10 of the 2001 Act to enable a trade union or excepted body to apply to the Circuit Court for the enforcement of a Labour Court determination, if an employer has failed to implement its terms. The Labour Court&rsquo;s determination is binding and is enforceable by order of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the processing of cases, which had, at the date of enactment, been referred to the Labour Court under the 2001 Act. These cases will be treated, from a procedural perspective, as if they had been referred to the <Col N="1104"/>Labour Court under the new legislation. The cases being dealt with under the 2001 Act, as well as any new cases, will benefit from the streamlined procedures contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 enables the Labour Court to investigate disputes where, at the date of the ratification of Sustaining Progress on 26 March 2003, access to the Labour Court was not available due to industrial action. An amendment to this section was agreed on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to the effect that in order to avail of this provision, industrial action must have ceased when this legislation comes into operation.</P>
    <P>Section 7 enables the Labour Court to give priority to cases referred to it under this Bill to enable it to resolve the dispute within the agreed timeframe. Section 8 defines victimisation and allows for acts which will be specified in the code of practice on victimisation to be included within the definition of victimisation. A complaint of victimisation may be made in circumstances where there is a trade dispute in which the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution has been invoked, or where steps have been taken to invoke the code, and arises from an employee&rsquo;s membership or activity on behalf of a trade union, a manager discharging his or her managerial functions, or other employees. There were a number of minor amendments made to this section on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with complaints of victimisation and empowers a rights commissioner to hear such a complaint from an employee and to make a decision on the matter. Rights commissioners already hear complaints under 14 different sets of legislation and two sets of regulations and are experienced and well-positioned to adjudicate on the issues involved in any cases that might be taken under this section. This section also provides that a rights commissioner may award compensation, where he or she considers it just and equitable. The timeframe in which a rights commissioner can hear a complaint under this section was the subject of detailed discussion on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il, with both Government and Opposition amendments put forward.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as published, provided that a rights commissioner could hear a complaint of victimisation within six months of the occurrence of the alleged victimisation, or within six months of the most recent occurrence. A Government amendment to extend the period in which a rights commissioner could hear such a complaint by a further six months, where the failure to present the complaint was due to reasonable cause, was agreed on Committee Stage. While empathising with the Opposition amendment put forward on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il, the Government considered that an extension of the timeframe by six months was a reasonable one while providing certainty to all parties.</P><Col N="1105"/>
    <P>Section 10 provides for an appeals mechanism to the Labour Court from a decision of a rights commissioner. Section 11 empowers the Labour Court to take evidence on oath, to administer oaths and to compel a person to attend to give evidence where there is an appeal from a decision of a rights commissioner in a victimisation case as provided for under section 10. This section was amended on Committee Stage to provide that a witness in a hearing of an appeal before the Labour Court has the same privileges and immunities as a witness before the High Court. Section 12 allows the Labour Court to refer a question of law arising in an appeal of a rights commissioner decision under this Bill to the High Court. Also, with regard to an appeal of a rights commissioner decision under the Bill, this section allows a party to the proceedings before the Labour Court to appeal to the High Court on a point of law only.</P>
    <P>Section 13 enables a party to apply to the Circuit Court for an enforcement order of a decision of a rights commissioner or a determination of the Labour Court in respect of a victimisation case where the decision or determination has not been carried out within a period of six weeks. A new section 14 was introduced by amendment on Report Stage to provide for an amendment to the First Schedule of the Industrial Relations Act 1990. This amendment has the effect of increasing the level of fines which can be imposed by the courts in cases where there are breaches of registered employment agreements.</P>
    <P>Section 15, an amendment of the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984, was introduced by amendment on Committee Stage. This is a technical amendment to the Act to enable employees of insolvent companies to apply to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the insolvency payments scheme for payment of statutory minimum notice entitlements directly through the liquidator or receiver without having to obtain an award from the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 16 repeals section 9 of the 2001 Act which provided for a review of a determination by the Labour Court. This amendment to the 2001 Act, as in the case of section 3, will facilitate achievement of the overall timeframe and more efficient allocation of Labour Court resources. Section 17 gives the Short Title, collective citation and construction and prescribes that the Bill shall come into operation on such day or days as may be appointed by ministerial order. This section was amended on Committee Stage to take account of the inclusion of section 15.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to strengthen the procedures of the existing legislation, as agreed by the trade union and employer representatives. The Bill provides employers and employee representatives with the opportunity to negotiate a solution to industrial disputes in situations <Col N="1106"/>where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place. Only if the voluntary process fails will the Labour Court become involved and, as under the 2001 Act, the court shall not, in its recommendations and determinations, provide for collective bargaining. I look forward to hearing Senators&rsquo; views and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House and thank him for his overview of the Bill. I welcome the Bill which makes further and better provision for promoting harmonious relations between workers and employers. It amends and extends the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2001 and the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State outlined, the Bill flows from the national agreement, Sustaining Progress, and is another incremental improvement in our law. The Bill will strengthen the procedures of existing legislation as agreed by trade union and employer representatives. It provides them with the opportunity to negotiate a solution to industrial disputes in situations where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place. It is also welcome that the Bill puts time limits on and gives certainty to many of the procedures and processes of the industrial relations machinery for the resolution of disputes through the various bodies and structures established over the years. The various bodies provided for in law, such as the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, and other mechanisms of arbitration which are in use have worked well. The Bill, once enacted, will bring some speed to the resolution of many conflicts by placing time limits on those disputes in a comprehensive and collective way, providing certainty for all parties involved. That there will be a time limit provided within which they must exhaust all the processes of an industrial dispute is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the fact that our system of industrial relations is essentially voluntary resulting in a consensus between the social partners that matters are best determined through the process of voluntary bargaining between employers and workers, or between their various associations and the trade unions. This approach to industrial relations has served us well and it is better to build on that, as this Bill does, than to provide for some radical new departure. The Bill therefore underpins that role through the provision of third party industrial relations machinery.</P>
    <P>My party acknowledges the work done by employers and ICTU in coming to agreements to amend the 2001 Act. We are living in a different era from that in which we lived when partnership began in the 1980s. We have made significant economic progress over that period. The <Col N="1107"/>challenge for social partnership in the future is to set a new agenda of work to meet the great challenge of competitiveness which has been drifting in the wrong direction over recent years as national competitiveness deteriorates rapidly. The various studies carried out by the OECD and other reputable bodies show that our cost base makes Ireland far less attractive than it was approximately ten years ago. We have had a higher than expected notifiable redundancy rate in the past year which we should have done more to avoid and addressed through partnership. We failed to tackle the issue of research and development investment and infrastructural investment in our economy. We have not sustained the progress of the late 1990s and early years of this century to the extent we could and should have done and thereby have frittered away some opportunities for economic development. We approve of the giving of new dispute settling powers to the Labour Court in cases where no arrangements for collective bargaining are in place. This, together with the other measures, should enhance the effectiveness of the procedures put in place by the 2001 Act.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate about whether membership of a trade union should be mandatory but the most important point is that people have a right to join a trade union should they so wish. We have quite a high level of trade union membership and the unions have made a major contribution to social partnership together with employers, in conjunction with the State. The partnership approach has worked exceptionally well in facilitating the development of greater economic activity, better realisation of the problems facing the country and a collective method of dealing with these problems. The spirit of partnership, together with industrial relations procedures, has led to this legislation. We graciously acknowledge the work done by IBEC and ICTU in coming to the necessary arrangements and agreements to facilitate this amendment of the 2001 Act. Since the inception of partnership in the 1980s there has been sustained progress and hopefully resources will continue to be available for further implementation of the agreed programme.</P>
    <P>We are bedevilled by bottlenecks in infrastructural development such as road, rail, broadband and other measures needed to improve our competitiveness when we are under pressure from eastern European and Far Eastern countries. The National Competitiveness Council has warned us several times that we must improve. We are now playing catch up which is not easy. The national development plan has been cut back and there has been a slow-down in many projects. These are important for our towns and cities and essential for freeing up land, opportunities for investment and projects which would provide sustainable investment in the <Col N="1108"/>future. Partnership has changed in line with changes in the work agenda since the late 1980s. Employers and employees are being hung out to dry because of job insecurity and unnecessary market uncertainty following the deterioration in competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill introduces a new code of practice on dispute resolution which was part of the Bill in 2001. This is an improved and strengthened measure and the section also deals with the code of practice which will put a time limit on dispute resolution between six and 34 weeks, which is a reasonable length of time within which to come to an agreement. Some disputes were more protracted than others. The new machinery will bring certainty to the process and hopefully concentrate the minds of those involved at an earlier stage. Section 3 also seems a very worthwhile improvement because it establishes a single process to resolve the preliminary and substantive issues which are part of the problem or problems. Far too often preliminary hearings are held but the substantive issues are postponed for a period. While this may allow people to concentrate on the issues, the process of dealing with them at the same time will help to accelerate the process.</P>
    <P>Section 8, dealing with victimisation, is one of the most important sections of this Bill and I assume it covers bullying in the workplace. Perhaps the Minister of State might say more on this when he comes to respond because in his speech he referred to the code of practice on victimisation which I take it has yet to be drawn up and agreed.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation which brings to fruition the experiences gained from the 2001 Act which highlighted several issues requiring technical resolution. It will hopefully speed up the process of resolving disputes as originally intended by the 2001 Act on which this is a significant improvement. It will give greater clarity and early resolution to many of the problems prevalent throughout business and industry. No one wishes to see disputes drag on because extra time often entrenches cases more than necessary. Time limits for a resolution of disputes should advance the best prospect for resolution and enhance the industrial relations machinery provided.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill in the light of Sustaining Progress agreed with the social partners. Since Fianna F&aacute;il brought the social partners together we have successfully developed the economy to the point of being one of the most developed countries in the OECD, with one of the highest GDPs per person in that group. This stems from working together and sharing and achieving a more equal and just society, as this Bill does. We have come through difficult times <Col N="1109"/>since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre in September 2001 and the consequent stock market instability affecting world markets. Now the Central Bank is advising consumers to spend which is a sure indicator that the work of this Government with the social partners is paying dividends in the most difficult of times.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to implement the specific measures contained in sections 8.8 to 8.11 of part 2 of Sustaining Progress, the current social partnership agreement, one of the key aims of which is &ldquo;to consolidate the progress of recent years and to achieve a medium-term growth rate capable of sustaining high levels of employment and facilitating the evolution of a more equal society&rdquo;. This legislation represents a significant step towards a more equitable society for employee and employer and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and his staff, should be commended for their work in preparing it. It is intended to enhance the effectiveness of existing dispute resolution procedures created by the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 and the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution by introducing timescales. Section 8.9 of Sustaining Progress specifies &ldquo;the introduction of an indicative overall timeframe targeting 26 weeks &mdash; with provision for up to a maximum of 34 weeks where necessary &mdash; for the processing of cases under the Dispute Resolution Code and Act&rdquo;, hence the necessity for this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate that industrial relations have always been dealt with on a voluntary basis. There has been consensus among the social partners that the terms and conditions of employment of workers are best determined through the process of voluntary bargaining. The Government has done everything it can to support this voluntary process, which has worked very well on our behalf over the years. In the course of time we have had to introduce certain dispute resolution services. The Minister of State indicated that he fully supports this and he outlined on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il some figures indicating the success we have had.</P>
    <P>The Labour Relations Commission chaired more than 2,000 meetings in 2002, 80% of which resulted in settlement of disputes. This is an excellent success rate which shows the mechanism has worked very well. It is unfortunate that from time to time issues are not resolved through the Labour Relations Commission and need to be referred for further investigation to the Labour Court. While the recommendations issued by the court are non-binding, there is an acceptance rate of more than 80% by the parties to the dispute.</P>
    <P>The mechanism in place has worked well and it has served the country well to have a voluntary approach, which is welcomed by employer organisations, trade unions, staff organisations and individual staff members. However, a number of issues have arisen. One of the reasons <Col N="1110"/>for introducing this Bill is that there has been a degree of frustration particularly with the lack of timescales for dealing with disputes, which is specifically addressed in the Bill. There have been complaints over the length of time taken to process cases through the Labour Court. Matters should be brought to a head within a reasonable length of time.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deletes section 2(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Act of 2001 and replaces it with a provision which allows the court to investigate a trade dispute if one of the following three conditions has been met: a breach of the timescale in the amended code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution; the exhaustion of the timescales in the amended code of practice; or the receipt of a report from the Labour Relations Commission that no further efforts on the part of the commission will advance the resolution of the dispute. This section tries to deal with disputes in an effective way rather than allow them to go on endlessly with no resolution in sight. I welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 3 replaces section 3 of the Act of 2001. This section enables the Labour Court to allocate its resources more efficiently by allowing it to combine preliminary and substantive hearings in a dispute referred to it under section 2(1) of the Act of 2001. This goes a long way towards reducing the length of time taken by the Labour Court in conducting an investigation. It is still possible to take the preliminary hearings and substantial hearings separately. However, if the court feels time would be saved by combining them it will now be possible to do so, which is an important improvement to the 2001 Act. The length of time involved in resolving the dispute has caused considerable disquiet among parties that have had to go to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Section 4 replaces section 10 of the Act of 2001 to enable a trade union or excepted body to apply to the Circuit Court for the enforcement of a Labour Court determination. If an employer has failed to implement its terms, the Labour Court determination is binding and enforceable by order to the Circuit Court. As I mentioned, in most cases the Labour Court is very successful and parties accept its decision. It is hoped this trend will continue. However, we are all aware of a number of past disputes that have been quite contentious. When the Labour Court makes its recommendations it is important that the parties to the dispute implement them. If they fail to do so, it should be possible to go to court to ensure the parties comply. I welcome this section, which will enhance the resolution of disputes and importantly will give this Bill some kick and power.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the processing of cases which had, at the date of enactment, been referred to the Labour Court under the Act of 2001. These cases will now be treated under the new legislation. This is a procedural matter and it <Col N="1111"/>is important that any benefits that may arise under the new Bill should be applicable for cases previously referred to the Labour Court under the 2001 Act.</P>
    <P>As well as the issue of the timeframe, one of the critical areas for complaint under the current mechanisms is victimisation. I am delighted the Bill deals comprehensively with the issue, specifically under section 8 where victimisation is defined. It allows for acts to be specified and the code of practice on victimisation to be included in the definition. A complaint of victimisation may be made in circumstances where there is a trade dispute in which the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution has been or is intended to be invoked, and arises where an employee&rsquo;s membership or activity on behalf of a trade union is challenged by an employer, or where a manager discharges his or her managerial functions.</P>
    <P>When taken in conjunction with section 9, which deals with complaints of victimisation, it empowers a rights commissioner to hear those complaints from an employee, trade union or excepted body and to make a decision on the matter. The section also provides that a rights commissioner may award compensation where he or she considers that to be equitable. If we are serious about eradicating victimisation, the last part of the section, which allows compensation to be awarded, is important. It is important that victimisation is not tolerated in our system and that we are serious as legislators about its eradication. For that reason I welcome in particular these two sections which deal with victimisation.</P>
    <P>It is also important that there is an appeals mechanism to the Labour Court arising from a decision of a rights commissioner. This is specified under section 10. It is one&rsquo;s right and entitlement to have an avenue for appeal. The Labour Court is empowered to take evidence on oath under section 11, to administer oaths and to compel a person to attend to give evidence where there is an appeal of a rights commissioner&rsquo;s decision in a victimisation case, which is critical. There can be parties who are guilty of victimisation and are reluctant to come forward and give evidence. It is important that they are compelled to do so in such circumstances. This part of the Bill&rsquo;s &ldquo;get tough&rdquo; mechanism shows our determination to tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>The two most important sections deal with the timescale within which disputes can be settled and the victimisation issue. If we can cater satisfactorily for these two areas, it will allow an equitable system to exist within our industrial relations environment. It will also mean that disputes do not drag on endlessly without resolution and that people can see some light at the end of the tunnel. The voluntary manner in which we have dealt with industrial relations over <Col N="1112"/>the past ten to 15 years has been a great success. It is to be hoped that the mechanisms in place, such as the Labour Court, will be used as last resorts and that the voluntary system of resolving disputes about terms and conditions of employment will continue.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to wish the two main dispute resolution institutions well for the future. The trade union movement in Ireland, ably represented by ICTU, has played an enormous role in developing relationships between employers and employees and in ensuring its members have proper conditions of employment. Without trade unions, workers would not have the conditions that exist today and for which previous generations have fought. I congratulate those involved in the movement on the excellent work they have done through the years.</P>
    <P>I also praise IBEC, which is a registered trade union, because it has played a significant role in educating and advising employers about proper industrial relations and in getting involved at the coalface in negotiations on behalf of businesses. Small businesses in particular do not have the personnel with the necessary skills to negotiate agreements and conditions of employment with trade unions. IBEC has played a significant role in facilitating relations between employers and employees. Finally, I pay tribute to the staff of the Labour Relations Commission because they work hard to ensure all disputes are resolved. They are extremely committed to their work. I wish them continued success in the future.</P>
    <P>Industrial disputes will occur occasionally, and it is important that the supportive legislation is in place to allow the voluntary mechanism to continue. I believe the Bill does this and I commend it to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this legislation. During the negotiations on Sustaining Progress, the issues contained in the Bill were central to a resolution. In welcoming it, I also have some regrets. I regret that the Irish employers and business people do not have the confidence and courage to recognise fully the right of employees to be represented by trade unions. While there is a constitutional right for people to associate and by virtue of that to join a union, it is very churlish and shows a complete lack of understanding of industrial relations that they are afraid in some cases to deal with trade unions.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Minister of State to the House, I would be far happier if he were introducing legislation giving the right of recognition to trade unions representing workers in whatever enterprise, industry or service they were based. I fought for this during the Sustaining Progress negotiations with the particular backing of the ICTU and SIPTU. There were long nights of argument, negotiation and fighting on that particular issue. We did not get what we wanted out of it. I recognise, however, that we did make <Col N="1113"/>progress. Today&rsquo;s Bill fully reflects the final compromise agreement that was reached at that time. When the Bill was published some weeks ago I was less than enchanted by what I read. I welcome the improvements made in the other House, particularly on Report Stage, which will be crucial in gaining wider acceptability for the Bill.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>In many ways, this legislation should never have been here. The agreement of 2001 to which the Minister referred was supposed to deal with these issues. However, we found unscrupulous employers once again using the structures of the Labour Court, the industrial relations process and the agreement to repeatedly delay matters that needed to be dealt with. This was a good lesson for us; an agreement that was negotiated in good faith was exploited mischievously by employers, so it quickly lost the trust and confidence of the workers being represented by trade unions. Once this had happened, it was no longer of any use in industrial relations. The same could happen with this legislation. I welcome the step-by-step approach the Minister explained in his speech, but there are still gaps. We have tried to plug some of these gaps by providing for access to the courts to ensure enforcement. Other gaps were filled by moving away from the voluntarism that characterised earlier agreements in this area.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a major step forward. The most important thing about it, as mentioned by Senator Hanafin, is that it brings resolution. It is not always the case in disputes &mdash; in fact, it is rarely the case &mdash; that somebody is clearly right while someone else is clearly wrong, even in the eyes of the most objective judge. Generally, by the time a problem has escalated into a major dispute, matters have become clouded. It is always the case that the lower the level at which resolution is reached, the better. My hope is that this legislation, as the Minister said, will be a clear signal to enterprises, business people and employers that it is better to deal with things locally. It is better to sort out problems on the ground by reaching agreement with the local trade union office or group of workers. That is also the view of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>The fight is still going on for trade union recognition. It seems extraordinary, after the last 100 years or more of trade union involvement in Irish society, that trade unions are still fighting with some employers for recognition. It is extraordinary that after 17 years of partnership there are still people on the employers&rsquo; side who refuse to recognise trade unions &mdash; and on the Government side also, although no members of the Government have said so publicly. Many questions have been raised by Government Members on this issue. I have heard the Taoiseach, to his credit, say that he supports trade union recognition, but I would like to see this reflected in legislation. As Senator McDowell said last night, Fianna F&aacute;il Members are good at <Col N="1114"/>telling us how things should be but when they are in a position to achieve this they do not do so.</P>
    <P>I would prefer a simple resolution mechanism. If a group of workers choose to be members of a trade union and say they want to be represented by the trade union in the course of a dispute, that should be the end of the story. I have argued this with employers time and again. I have asked them to leave their prejudices and their anti-trade union feelings at the door so that we can talk about the issue in some other way. If somebody needs representation in court or in a dispute resolution process, nobody has any problem with allowing a lawyer or somebody else, even a best friend, to represent him or her. If employers have a difficulty with trade unions they should envisage them as a service industry looking after the interests of the members they represent.</P>
    <P>There is currently a complex range of industrial relations law. Those of us who have been dealing with it daily, in our working lives and legislatively, have great difficulty in advising people on aspects of the law without checking first. My colleague, Senator McDowell, coming from a legal background, might be more confident, but I always need to reread a piece of legislation before I advise somebody on any issue of equality, equal status or unfair dismissals. The range of legislation has been a huge success for the trade union movement, from the early 1970s, when the then leader of the Labour Party introduced some important legislation, culminating in the Employment Equality Act 1977, to the various Industrial Relations Acts we have today. The Taoiseach, as Minister for Labour in 1990, brought in the Industrial Relations Bill and moved things forward substantially.</P>
    <P>Today&rsquo;s Bill is important because this legislation will allow trade unions to represent their members fully in disputes. Now that there is a process that can be followed, trade unions will finally be able to get past the difficulty of dealing with employers who will not recognise their right to represent workers. I hope this will give employers a final opportunity to accept the way things are in the world. We are in a society based on partnership. The rights of workers are represented by their unions just as the rights of businesses and employers are represented by IBEC and other groups. There is nothing wrong with that. We need to be able to sit around a table and listen to and argue with each other, accepting and assimilating the views, objectives and arguments of the other side. That is how disputes are resolved. In the current climate there is no way IBEC should accept from any of its members the antediluvian idea that trade unions cannot be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The idea that trade unions are there to undermine the work of the business is completely wrong. Less than three years ago it looked as though Aer Lingus was going under, as had happened to half the airlines in Europe. It is a tribute to the workforce and the unions representing them that this was turned around. <Col N="1115"/>Aer Lingus is now fighting for business with the most competitive airlines in Europe. This was achieved through an act of partnership. It was achieved because people were committed to making their industry work. The view of the modern Irish trade union movement is that workers bring their brains to work and have views on the service, commodity or industry in which they are involved. This should go all the way up to their trade unions.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation. I ask the House to facilitate its being dealt with quickly. The Leader has indicated that it can probably be concluded next Tuesday. This legislation is needed in the workplace. Over the past ten years Irish workers have had the best productivity record of any workforce in Europe. It is worth pointing this out to those who ask what trade unions and partnership are good for. We have also had the fewest industrial strikes in Europe over the past ten years. This is important when we consider how places such as Belgium, Italy, Germany and France are sometimes completely brought to a halt because they have failed to grapple with trade union issues, agreements, arrangements and legislation such as that we are dealing with today. This is an important move forward. I hope it is a step towards full recognition of trade unions. In the meantime, we should make use of this legislation and move on from there.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation.</P>
    <P>It has resulted from, and is a vindication of, social partnership. Over a 60 year period we have developed a sophisticated labour relations machinery and culture which was well described earlier by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>There are persistent problems and a degree of reluctance with regard to recognition of trade unions and this legislation is a means of dealing with the problem. It mainly occurs in small firms but there is a number of large firms which do not recognise trade unions for one reason or another. However, many of them have a sophisticated parallel type of machinery. It is important to have dispute resolution mechanisms which avoid the need for strikes. Furthermore, in the case of small firms, there is a great danger of closure and job losses if the climate becomes embittered. This legislation is a welcome element of the implementation of Sustaining Progress. It is a credit to partnership.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to comment on industrial relations in general. Under the partnership process industrial relations have been pretty good. The number of days of work lost is relatively small. However, there are still some problems. I regret, for example, the dispute that is taking place at present in Irish Ferries, where there appears to be a stand-off between management and the National Union of Seamen. Another trade union is also involved. There is always a difficulty when there is more than one trade union and they do not see eye to eye. If <Col N="1116"/>their action is not co-ordinated, it is difficult for the employer to deal with it without the danger of a type of salami exercise developing.</P>
    <P>There is also a temptation on the part of a minority section of the trade union movement to import a more confrontational culture and practice from across the water. We have seen that in the past and, to a degree, in the present in some of our public transport undertakings. I am not referring to the main trade unions.</P>
    <P>In most instances there is, or should be, a common interest in best conditions for employees and an agreed method for solving disputes and moving forward together. That need not be incompatible with good pay and conditions. The ESB is an obvious example. We must keep working at improving industrial relations. The old adage, that if we do not hang together, we will hang separately, applies even more in a small country such as this than in some of our larger neighbours.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Many members of the Labour Party have an ambivalent attitude to this legislation and the 2001 Act that preceded it. It is, in essence, an admission of failure on the part of the partnership bodies &mdash; the employers&rsquo; representatives, the trade unions and the Government &mdash; to reach agreement at national level to deal with the issue of union recognition. This legislation provides a mechanism to get around that. There is now an enforceable procedure of arbitration in those cases. It is a reasonably adequate second best but it is a second best.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that after 17 years of partnership, the fact that representatives of workers spend hours in Government Buildings negotiating issues of great importance, which range from housing through social affairs to workplace issues, is now accepted as the norm at national level but we find it impossible to agree a mechanism whereby it can happen at local workplace level. We still cannot find it in ourselves to pass legislation, if that is necessary, to ensure employers recognise the basic right of employees to be represented by a trade union of their choice. Purists would insist that if an individual worker wishes to be represented by a trade union and wants the trade union to negotiate on his or her behalf, he or she is entitled to do that. However, most people will acknowledge that there must be a critical mass of workers in a workplace who want that right in order to make it work at a practical level. It is a pity we have been unable to secure agreement in this regard and, in default of agreement, that we do not feel able to legislate on the issue.</P>
    <P>It is incorrect to state that people do not have the right to join a union; they do. It has long been established in law and is also a constitutional right. It is also established that people have the right not to join a trade union or to dissociate from a union, if that is their choice. There is no power in this country to enforce a closed shop as <Col N="1117"/>there is in the United Kingdom. However, there is no right in this country to recognition, the right to be represented by a trade union. It is still possible for employers, while acknowledging that people are entitled to join a trade union, to blithely or wilfully refuse to negotiate with the trade union on behalf of workers. That is something I and my party consider unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In the absence of agreement at national level to deal with it, a mechanism of the type provided for in the 2001 Act was inevitable and represents a reasonable compromise. However, there are people in the trade union movement and in the Labour Party who probably feel that accepting a second best will make it impossible to achieve the desired outcome, namely, recognition of trade unions.</P>
    <P>This is, in a sense, a reflection of our corporate culture, if I can call it that, with regard to partnership issues and where we stand <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Boston and Berlin. This Bill is firmly in mid-Atlantic in that it is not in the tradition of corporatist Germany where, essentially, matters are dealt with by large trade unions and employer bodies. Likewise, most of us do not feel comfortable with the tradition in the United States where workers are dealt with on an individual basis, largely without corporate representation by trade unions or otherwise. The Bill is largely a compromise.</P>
    <P>The Bill shortens the time limits. If the legislation is to work, it is important that the time limits are realistic. There have been cases where employers have gone through the mechanisms provided for in the 2001 Act but in many cases there was a suspicion in the workforce that there was never any real intention to carry through on the recommendations that were ultimately made and that it was, in fact, a delaying process. I welcome the tighter time limits in this Bill. It is less likely that the process provided for will be deliberately used as a delaying mechanism by employers.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, in a sense, a stick mechanism in a carrot and stick situation. It is intended, I hope, not to be used. If employers know there is a mechanism whereby they can be obliged to go through what amounts to a compulsory arbitration process, they will negotiate. The less often this Bill and its predecessor Act are brought into play, the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the prohibition of victimisation in sections 8 and 9. The definition in the Bill is broad and it will be underpinned by a code of practice. As far as I know the code has not yet been published but work is being done on it by the Labour Relations Commission. I am not quite clear about how exactly it will work. I appreciate that the prohibition of victimisation provision can only be invoked in the context of this Bill or of the 2001 process and that it is not intended as a general prohibition of victimisation. In his response, will the Minister of State elaborate on how it will come into play and how it will relate to the provisions of this Act rather than the general <Col N="1118"/>prohibition on victimisation and discrimination as contained in the equality legislation?</P>
    <P>I read the report of the debate in the D&aacute;il much of which dealt with the general issue of partnership. There appears to be a seething resentment among some politicians, particularly on the Opposition side of the House, regarding the partnership process, which many see as sidelining the Houses. I, too, am somewhat ambivalent on this issue. We in the Labour Party have a particular difficulty in so far as we have a close relationship with the trade union movement which is locked in negotiations in Government buildings. On the other hand, as part of the Opposition we also have to discharge our responsibility to oppose. While we empathise, work and consult regularly with our trade union colleagues, we nonetheless are obliged then to leave our meeting rooms and come into the Houses and oppose what has just been agreed to in Government buildings.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>A Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour coalition was the ideal solution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This difficulty would be best resolved by putting us in Government as it only arises in the context of Opposition. I suppose in a sense we are just moaning about our impotence on the Opposition benches, or as may be, on the Government back benches. There is no doubt that the existence of the process, particularly as it expanded over the years to include the voluntary and community sector, has tended to sideline politicians, whether in Government or Opposition. Many of us feel the need to re-establish a relationship, whether by bringing the process into this House or to the committees. We need to re-establish a better balance.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the issue of immigrant workers. When setting out these mechanisms we leave an increasingly large group of workers, namely immigrants, totally unprotected within our system. This is largely because employers own the work permits and the immigrant workers come here on the basis of the permit issued to the employer. They do not have the right to work for whomever they wish but only in a particular job for a particular employer. This establishes a relationship where the employee is very much the junior partner and not in a position to negotiate, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>Some EU directives on the matter are awaiting implementation in this country and this is an issue of which we must become increasingly conscious. Our colleagues in the trade union movement have made an effort to organise immigrant workers, with some success in many larger enterprises but without success in many others. We are in the position where we must deal with the issue directly. We must acknowledge the particular position in which immigrant workers find themselves. I ask the Minister of State to address that issue and to outline whether it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to legislate with regard <Col N="1119"/>to immigrant workers, specifically to change the provision whereby the permit is in the hands of the employer.</P>

I congratulate the Minister of State on the legislation which has arisen out of commitments in Sustaining Progress as agreed between the Government and the social partners and which has been very successful. I am confident the Bill will enhance the effectiveness of existing dispute resolution procedures where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place, that it will strengthen the industrial relations procedures giving effect to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, and voluntary work, through the provision of third party industrial relations machinery.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Government recognises the need for a dispute settlement mechanism in cases where employees wish to be represented by a trade union or an excepted body but where collective bargaining does not occur. I am also satisfied that the Bill has arisen from extensive talks between ICTU, IBEC, the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, industry, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland the aim of which was to devise a mechanism for resolving such disputes. The reluctance of the Government and lawmakers to indulge in the temptation to impose solutions is welcome and this ideology has served us well over the years through voluntary bargaining procedures between employers and employees. We should continue this good practice in so far as possible to facilitate and provide solid foundations for conflict resolution.</P>
    <P>In 2002, a year in which the number of industrial disputes recorded by the Central Statistics Office reached a 30-year low, referrals to the Labour Court increased by 6% compared to the previous year. Since 2000, total referrals to the Labour Court have increased by more than 20%. The court completed 13% more cases in 2002 than in 2001. Public sector organisations, especially in the health and transport sectors, accounted for more than a quarter of industrial relations cases completed during the year. This is a symptom of the revolving door phenomenon where parties involved in a dispute fail to acknowledge the role of the Labour Court as a court of last resort and use it as a staging post rather than the last step in the dispute resolution process. On many occasions the court has expressed its concern, which I share, that this practice damages the operation of industrial relations procedures generally.</P><Col N="1120"/>
    <P>This is the background against which we must examine the Bill. This legislation is not the first employee related legislation which has arisen from Sustaining Progress. Earlier this year the Redundancy Payments Act provided for a doubling, and in some cases a quadrupling, of statutory entitlements in this area. The Government and the T&aacute;naiste must be congratulated on the speedy dispatch of that legislation. The Minister of State with responsibility for taking this legislation through the House has also acted to give equal rights to fixed contract workers.</P>
    <P>The Redundancy Payments Act was a great step forward. It has been an enormous help to those unfortunate to lose their jobs and the Government should be commended on its introduction. This legislation does not have a high profile and has not attracted much media attention. However, it is of great significance and has met support from all sides of the House, because Members realise how important it is in the long term. We look back on the grim days when many disputes brought us to our knees. I recall the electricity disputes when there was no continuity in supply. What occurred in the 1970s was frightening and this new forward looking legislation is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2002 and the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolutions instigated a new system, more than two years ago, to resolve issues in disputes where there was no existing arrangements for collective bargaining. However, there has been a considerable degree of dissatisfaction and irritation with these measures due to a lack of a timeframe for dispute resolution for the existing code of practice. Frustration also exists because to refer a dispute to the Labour Court, the onus is on the union or excepted body to show the employer has failed to act in good faith.</P>
    <P>There is also discontent with the length of time taken to process cases through the court before obtaining legally enforceable Circuit Court orders. Accordingly, this new legislation will enable the Labour Court to examine cases where the specific timeframe to be set out in a new code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution has been acceded. It will also enable the Labour Court to act where the Labour Relations Commission has acceded that no further work on its part will assist settlement of the dispute. To facilitate this the Labour Court will be able to link its preliminary and substantive hearings where it considers this to be correct procedure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which prohibits any victimisation of employees arising from membership of, or activity on behalf of, a trade union, from a manager discharging his or her managerial functions or from disputes relating to trade union recognition. We must stand by the fundamental right of an individual to join a trade union. My father was a member of the Cuffe Street union of stonemasons and bricklayers. He was proud to hold that <Col N="1121"/>membership throughout his life and like most members of trade unions he was also a member and supporter of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which always represented the cause of this country&rsquo;s workers. I became a member of SIPTU and I am delighted to be in this union. I am also on the labour panel of the House so it is appropriate that I have an opportunity to speak on this important Bill.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that SIPTU takes individual membership. Many companies which do not recognise unions have employees who are individual members of the largest trade union in Ireland, which gives them great support and service at certain times. I encourage all employees, irrespective of the companies involved, to obtain the support of the union movement, which has been most progressive in this country to date.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on getting us to this stage. Various sections have been carefully outlined to us by the Minister of State which faithfully parallel section 8.9 of Sustaining Progress. I look forward to the early enactment of the legislation, which arises from the experience of the 2001 Act which threw up a number of issues in need of technical resolution.</P>
    <P>It will speed up the process of resolving disputes as originally intended under the 2001 Act. This is an improvement on the Act and will give clarity and early resolution to many of the problems which bedevil companies. If disputes drag on, parties can become more entrenched than need be the case. Time limits to the resolution of disputes will advance the best scenario for resolution and enhance the industrial relations machinery of the companies involved and the State apparatus.</P>
    <P>The current dispute between the Prison Officers Association, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Prison Service should be resolved. I am disappointed it is taking so long to resolve the issues involved, which have caused hardship to staff and prisoners, particularly prisoners from the Curragh and Spike Island which have been closed. The introduction of the Bill provides an opportunity for all concerned to sit around the table and resolve matters and this must be done sooner rather than later. I hope all concerned, the Prison Officers Association, its officials and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, will sit down and resolve this issue which is causing great distress and concern to prison officers, their families and the prisoners to whom we have a responsibility.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and congratulate him on the legislation, which I commend to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, who has responsibility for trade and commerce, and his departmental officials. Ireland is a role model for countries in Europe and worldwide for its successful partnership between employees, unions and <Col N="1122"/>employers. This partnership has been one of the drivers of the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>I am most supportive of trade unions. In the mid-1970s I was on the national women&rsquo;s committee of the Federated Workers Union of Ireland. Senator McDowell should not smile. I was privileged to be elected to that committee.</P>
    <P>The main aspects of the Bill relate to voluntary dispute resolution and victimisation and I do not intend to go into the details of these issues. If timescales under the voluntary dispute resolution code have been breached and the Labour Relations Commission indicates that no resolution seems forthcoming, the Labour Court is entitled to investigate that trade dispute. The Labour Court is also entitled to investigate trade disputes which were ongoing at the time of the ratification of Sustaining Progress, 26 March 2003, and which the court could not investigate because of industrial action. A trade union can apply to the Circuit Court to have a Labour Court ruling enforced as soon as may be after that ruling has been communicated to the parties involved. The Labour Court can give priority to cases it receives, as appears reasonable to the Labour Court at that time.</P>
    <P>There was no code of practice on victimisation in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001. This code was introduced in section 8.9 of the Sustaining Progress document. It is now enshrined in law in the 2003 Bill. Some of the key provisions include a definition of victimisation provided in section 8. This definition will include that covered by the code of practice on victimisation as devised by the partnership of the Labour Relations Commission, ICTU and IBEC. Section 9 empowers a rights commissioner to hear a complaint of victimisation from an employee and to make a decision based on that complaint. The decision of the rights commissioner can be appealed to the Labour Court under section 10.</P>
    <P>My company, Lir Chocolates, was a very maternalistic one in the early years. We did not have a personnel department because we could not afford specialist staff. I was delighted when a trade union came in because as a small company it was very helpful to the employers, Connie and I. The trade union let us know in a professional manner to what our staff were entitled. It had a positive effect on us. That is the other side of it, from my point of view as an employer and from my participation on the national women&rsquo;s committee of the Federated Workers Union of Ireland.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate on the Bill, which I am pleased to conclude. The Bill amends and enhances the provisions of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001. That Act was groundbreaking legislation in that for the first <Col N="1123"/>time it provided a dispute resolution mechanism in situations where collective bargaining arrangements were not in place. Given the innovative nature of the 2001 Act, the Government and social partners agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that the Act and code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution which supports the 2001 legislation would be monitored during the course of the programme. The outcome of this monitoring process has resulted in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Like the 2001 Act, the Bill has emanated from an agreed approach by both the trade union and employer organisations to enhance the effectiveness of existing procedures for dealing with disputes where negotiating arrangements are not in place. I congratulate the trade union and employer organisation representatives involved in the negotiations on enhancing existing provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be supported by a new code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution and the code of practice on victimisation. The effect of the codes of practice essentially will be to enhance and strengthen existing procedures with a view to processing cases within a specific timeframe and to introduce a prohibition on victimisation of employees who are members of a union, managers discharging their managerial functions and other employees in the context of a dispute where the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution has been invoked or where steps have been taken to invoke the code.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general support for the Bill expressed by Senators on all sides of the House. Important points were raised during the debate and I wish to respond to a number of them. Senators raised issues in regard to the code of practice on victimisation. A new code of practice in this area has been prepared by the Labour Relations Commission following discussions with ICTU and IBEC. The purpose of the code is to outline for the guidance of employers, employees and trade unions the different types of practice which would constitute victimisation. I understand the new code of practice will be submitted shortly to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, for his consideration. As Senator McDowell pointed out, the prohibition on victimisation only comes into play in the context of the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution having been invoked or where steps have been taken to invoke the code. This is in line with what was agreed in Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and McDowell raised the issue of trade union recognition. Our system of volunteerism is strongly supported by both workers and employers. While the legislation may not be as revolutionary as some would wish, it reflects consensus between the ICTU and IBEC. The Minister has deliberately refrained from introducing legislation that was opposed by either unions or employers. It is not Government policy to impose legislation in the industrial relations <Col N="1124"/>area where parties are prepared to work together towards achieving progress.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell asked whether there would be a change for immigrant workers in holding work permits. I will raise this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with codes of practice, this legislation will result in more effective and efficient procedures in the dispute resolution arena. It will also contribute to greater stability in industrial relations. On the basis of the all-party support we have seen so far, I hope this Bill will be swiftly progressed through the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government welcomes the publication of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s preliminary report and consultation document on competition issues in the non-life insurance market. In the wider context, An Agreed Programme for Government includes tackling the high cost of insurance. It is the Government&rsquo;s firm intention to implement the measures in the agreed programme which relate to insurance.</P>
    <P>The insurance reform programme, which was launched on 25 October 2002, contained a co-ordinated set of actions across a range of Departments and considerable progress has been made in implementing the programme. This includes the implementation of road safety measures such as penalty points by the Department of Transport; enactment of PIAB legislation, where it is expected that the board will be up and running in the near future; the preparation of legislation by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform dealing with fraudulent and exaggerated personal injury claims &mdash; the Civil Liability and Courts Bill has been published and is expected to be before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly; and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the Irish Insurance Federation also have made progress in the areas of consumer information campaigns and codes of practice for insurers.</P>
    <P>The insurance reform programme comprises the 67 recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board&rsquo;s report, which was the most comprehensive study and analysis of the Irish motor insurance industry ever undertaken and <Col N="1125"/>provided a sound basis for addressing the problems we are experiencing in the insurance industry. To date, 32 of the 67 recommendations have been implemented. A further three have been partially implemented and 21 are being actively progressed.</P>
    <P>Three of the MIAB recommendations were directed to the Competition Authority. First, the MIAB recommended that the authority should review all further insurance mergers in the interests of the Irish economy with appropriate reference to IFSRA. The authority took over responsibility for mergers on 1 January 2003 and, to date, no mergers requiring review have taken place. Second, a consultation document on the authority&rsquo;s study of the legal profession is expected by mid-year. Third, there is the recommendation to carry out a study of motor insurance. In effect, the study also covers public liability and employers&rsquo; liability insurance.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority undertook the insurance study jointly with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department&rsquo;s involvement was mainly in the area of funding. The study commenced in the autumn of 2002. Following publication of draft terms of reference and an analysis of responses received, it was decided to limit the range of the study to motor, employers&rsquo; liability and public liability insurance. The focus of the study, in line with standard competition analysis of a sector, is on barriers to entry and rivalry. In other words, it looks at whether firms have difficulty getting into the Irish market and whether those that have entered compete against each other.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of this study are as follows: to identify anti-competitive practices or other constraints on competition in the non-life insurance market in Ireland, with particular reference to motor insurance, employer&rsquo;s liability and public liability insurance; to highlight any anti-competitive practices or other constraints that are particular to the Irish market; to make recommendations for legislative and other changes to ensure that competition works well for consumers in the Irish market; and to make, in the case of any problems identified at EU level, recommendations for change at that level.</P>
    <P>The authority has undertaken a considerable amount of research and analysis on the insurance sector since the start of the study. In addition, it has commissioned four substantial pieces of independent research, all of which are published on its website as a resource for anyone with an interest in this important topic. First, there is a report from Cass Business School, which is part of the City of London University, on the economics and regulation of insurance. Second, there is a paper from Vincent Hogan and Colm Harmon, of University College Dublin, on the prospects for empirical analysis in the non-life insurance market in Ireland. Third, there is a report from Europe Economics of an analysis of the state of competition in the Irish liability and motor insurance sectors. Fourth, there is an <Col N="1126"/>analysis from Dorothea Dowling of the 2002 statutory returns in the Irish insurance market and related matters.</P>
    <P>The authority notes that competition is by no means the only factor leading to increases in the cost of premiums. However, based on the information that it has received through its own research and from its various consultancy projects, it identifies a number of issues that caused competition concerns. These are the basis of a public consultation period over the next two months, during which all contributions will be welcome. I am sure the authority would expect most submissions to be made towards the end of the public consultation period on 18 April, but Senators have a chance this afternoon to make an early input to the process. I assure the House that the authority will carefully examine all comments made here today in preparing its final report.</P>
    <P>The issues that have given rise to preliminary concerns relate both to insurance brokers and insurance companies. In the case of brokers, the issues are as follows. First, there appear to be market-wide <i>ad valorem</i>, or percentage-based, commission fees, with little evidence of competition among brokers putting downward pressure on these despite basic premia rising sharply in recent years. For example, if a business paid &euro;10,000 for a liability premium in 2000, this increased to &euro;20,000 in 2002. If the commission payable to the broker in 2000 was &euro;900, it would have risen to &euro;1,800 in 2002. In other words, in 2002 the business in question would have had to pay its broker an extra &euro;900 in commission for the same service it received in 2000. While the cost of assessing and placing liability risk may have risen in a tighter market, or as a result of general cost inflation, it would be a remarkable coincidence if the changes in broker costs for both motor and liability insurance were perfectly correlated with the changes in the underlying cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>In some cases, insurance brokers enter into fee based arrangements with their larger clients. In doing so, the broker returns to the client the commission he or she would otherwise earn on that client&rsquo;s insurance business in exchange for a negotiated and normally lower fee. This fee is based on the extent and value of the services the broker provides for his or her client. However, the evidence of this practice the authority has received relates only to larger clients who are more able to exert countervailing power.</P>
    <P>A second concern regarding brokers is that a conflict of interest is possible. Incentives from insurers, including overriding commissions related to the quantity of sales, and minimum thresholds can cause a conflict of interest between the obligation to provide best advice to the client and best return for the broker. Third, there is a lack of transparency in that buyers do not necessarily know what incentives and commissions the broker might receive, nor which insurers the broker has contacted on their behalf.</P><Col N="1127"/>
    <P>A number of preliminary concerns have been identified with regard to insurance companies. First, there are limitations in the sharing of data that could help to assess and price risk. To determine its premium, an insurer needs to get statistical data concerning the frequency and volume of claims made in the past. Often, insurers are not in a position to collect a sufficient volume of reliable data on the basis of their business alone. European competition law, therefore, allows such data to be shared. On the Irish market, however, there appear to be problems regarding the extent, timeliness, reliability and availability of relevant statistics. The authority wants to explore whether this can be improved.</P>
    <P>Second, potential entrants to the motor insurance market have cited as a concern the system of handling and funding claims arising from uninsured and un-traced drivers. All companies selling motor insurance on the market are obliged to fund the payment of such claims in accordance with their market share. Companies which handle the claims are reimbursed from the funds collected from all other insurers. The concern raised is that this does not provide an incentive to minimise the cost and time of handling claims, which raises the costs of all companies in the market, irrespective of whether they handle claims. The authority is, therefore, inviting suggestions as to whether there are better ways to handle these claims, for example, by tendering out claims handling for a fixed period.</P>
    <P>Third, with regard to the motor insurance market, some potential entrants to niche markets have indicated they would have difficulty participating in the declined cases agreement as it currently operates. The declined cases agreement is designed to enable people to obtain a quote for motor insurance, even if they cannot do so on the open market. Cases accepted by the declined cases committee are given to insurance companies on a rota basis. The procedure, whereby insurance companies then potentially assess whether a specific quote under this system is so high as to be tantamount to a refusal, raises competition concerns. A separate problem cited by potential entrants to niche markets is that they do not want to run the risk of getting a case outside their niche. The authority is consulting as to whether there are other ways to run this scheme, which would be less likely to cause competition concerns, for example, using a tendering system.</P>
    <P>Fourth, solvency requirements are higher for new entrants than for established companies. The reason for this is that the likelihood of failure is greater in the first three years than in subsequent years. However, because this could put entrants to the market at a disadvantage, the authority is inviting submissions on whether these requirements have caused a problem in practice. It is also asking for input on whether a <Col N="1128"/>policyholder protection fund might be set up to deal with insurer insolvency.</P>
    <P>Many external cost factors unrelated to competition help to explain the level of, and recent spikes in, insurance prices. The wide ranging set of insurance reforms in train has the potential to make the market generally more attractive to insurers and thus encourage entry to the market. The implementation of such reforms can be expected to reduce insurance costs, with resulting reductions in premia for consumers and business alike. Competition has a vital role to play in ensuring that these cost reductions are fully passed on to the buyers of insurance.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>To quote Senator Ross&rsquo;s words to me as we entered the Chamber, &ldquo;Once a sinner, always a sinner.&rdquo; I am pleased today to have the opportunity to comment on the recent preliminary report and consultation document on non-life insurance published by the Competition Authority. The study began in autumn of 2002 and draws on the Competition Authority&rsquo;s research and that of various expert groups.</P>
    <P>Given the steady increase in insurance premiums in recent years and the widespread dissatisfaction with the insurance industry, the report is long overdue. The Competition Authority appears to lack the spontaneity required to deal with this issue. Instead of tackling an ever-growing problem actively and with a sense of urgency, it appears to be satisfied with drawing up a basic report over a period of two years. That is simply not enough. A consumer-based approach, rather than an academic study, is desperately needed to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The report outlines the Competition Authority&rsquo;s investigations into the competitiveness of the insurance industry, with particular reference to motor insurance, employers&rsquo; liability insurance and public liability insurance. The Competition Authority has invited submissions from all interested parties to provide further input into the issues raised in this report. It will then issue a final document outlining its recommendations and suggestions for future legislation or changes in the insurance industry to encourage competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I will briefly elaborate on the main concerns regarding insurance brokers and suppliers <Col N="1129"/>mentioned in the report. As regards insurance brokers, the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report touches on a number of issues which need to be addressed. It states that the manner in which insurance brokers operate lacks a certain transparency, which affects the consumer in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>Insurance brokers generally charge a fee based on commission or an <i>ad valorem</i> fee. This is typically 5% of what the buyer pays out on insurance. If the insurance broker achieves a lower insurance quote for the buyer, his or her commission is instantly reduced. The Competition Authority raises the concern that this reduces the incentive of the broker to shop around for the lowest price for the buyer.</P>
    <P>The report also states that in many cases brokers come to an agreement with some insurance suppliers. The insurer may offer an incentive of extra commission to the broker if he or she provides the supplier&rsquo;s company with a certain level of business. This can lead to a lack of competitiveness on two levels, with consumers losing out because the broker does not provide them with the best advice possible, and other insurance suppliers missing out on extra business because they are not given a chance to quote a more competitive price.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised in the report concerns the difficulties consumers experience in switching brokers. Many consumers have reported instances of their first broker essentially blocking them from switching policy. This happens when a broker approaches insurance suppliers before the renewal date arrives and asks for a new quote for the buyer&rsquo;s insurance requirements.</P>
    <P>When the buyer asks a new broker to shop around for a better quote, the suppliers refuse to consider the case a second time. Insurance suppliers say this is because of the amount it costs to take a second look at a policy and also because the company very often does not want to risk damaging its relationship with the original broker.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority suggests that a greater level of transparency should be adopted in relation to the regulation of insurance brokers to ensure competitiveness in the industry. However, the report focuses far too much on the inadequacies of insurance brokers. It is almost as if the authority believes that the large suppliers of insurance have nothing to do with the way the middle men operate and the way customers are exploited in the market.</P>
    <P>The real problem in the insurance industry is the limited number of insurance suppliers. The report does not fully explore the possibility of cartels and the general domination of the Irish market by a limited number of suppliers. In regard to insurance companies, the Competition Authority&rsquo;s concerns are largely focused on three main areas.</P>
    <P>First, the report highlights the issue of data-sharing and publication. At present, insurance companies share information mainly based on <Col N="1130"/>loss statistics, that is, the amounts paid out in insurance claims and the characteristics of the claimants. This information is available only to existing insurers. Those wishing to enter the market are not allowed access to any of these statistics, which makes it difficult for a new supplier to calculate premiums. IFSRA has already agreed to compile detailed statistics pertaining to the motor insurance industry and the report suggests that this type of information is gathered in relation to public liability and employers&rsquo; liability insurance. The Competition Authority also suggests disaggregating statutory annual returns so that detailed figures are made available to suppliers and not just an overall view of the industry.</P>
    <P>Second, the report voices concerns about the practice of the declined cases agreement. The report states that the declined cases agreement basically provides that all licensed drivers should be able to purchase insurance despite the fact that they might be a high risk to insurance companies. The agreement states that if three suppliers have refused a person insurance, the fourth company they approach must give them a quote. The Competition Authority raises the point that this agreement might serve as a barrier to entry as new companies might be dissuaded by the fact that they would have to adopt this rule in a niche where they may have little or no expertise.</P>
    <P>The report also disagrees with the fact that a board of existing insurers is given the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of this agreement. The Insurance Ombudsman and a member of the Consumers Association of Ireland are present on the board, but the Competition Authority maintains that this does not make the board an independent body and that perhaps the declined cases agreement should be put out to tender.</P>
    <P>The third issue raised by the Competition Authority in the report has to do with solvency requirements. At present, solvency requirements are higher for new insurance suppliers than for those in existence for more than three years. The report states that this could be interpreted as a barrier to entry of new competition. However, as yet, they have not obtained any evidence that suggests higher solvency requirements are more than a hindrance to new companies.</P>
    <P>The report also touches on a number of smaller issues, for example, the subject of renewal notices. At present, motor insurance legislation introduced in November 2002 requires the supplier to issue a renewal notice to the buyer at least 15 days in advance of the policy renewal date. The Competition Authority suggests that something similar be adopted in relation to liability insurance but with a longer lead-up time.</P>
    <P>In general, the report is informative about the current inadequacies of the non-life insurance industry. However, as I already mentioned, the Competition Authority attributes far too much responsibility for the problems that exist to the insurance broker rather than tackling the big <Col N="1131"/>issue of insurance suppliers. Also, the report does not touch on the measures that could be taken at European level to tackle the difficulties that lie within the industry. Surely this issue could be dealt with on a Europe-wide basis by enforcing regulations that would prevent a small number of insurance suppliers dominating the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>The report does not outline the Competition Authority&rsquo;s final recommendations. However, it gives us an insight into the issues that need to be addressed in the future. It appears that the MIAB has to some extent started to tackle the many problems that exist within the industry. However, it is important that the Government takes the Competition Authority&rsquo;s advice and final recommendations on board regarding the lack of transparency within the insurance industry. Moreover, it is imperative that something is actively done to try to make necessary, drastic changes, which will benefit the consumer. Insurance companies have been allowed to continue charging exorbitant prices for premiums without question until now. It is time for the Government to adopt regulations that force the insurance industry to give the consumer the necessary information required to make an educated choice.</P>
    <P>The report demonstrates that insurance brokers and companies may have colluded in the past for their own benefit to the detriment of the consumer. The number of complaints from customers in the past number of years supports the findings of this report and the obvious need for change. People are not willing to continue paying higher rates of insurance than many other EU member states. The Government must tackle this issue head-on and without further procrastination.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, and his officials. I wish also to place on record my appreciation that the Leader of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, has provided time for this important debate so soon after the publication of the report. It is an indication of how seriously this House views the issue of insurance. The Minister and his colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, have given this issue governmental priority and the Government&rsquo;s Cabinet sub-committee has dealt with it. We have made great progress in a very short time. I wish to place on record also my appreciation of the work of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I am a member. Last year this committee prioritised the issue of insurance and interviewed every sector of the industry. That committee is chaired by Senator Donie Cassidy who has been very active in this regard. I compliment him, Senators Coghlan, Hanafin, Ross and all the other members of the committee.</P><Col N="1132"/>
    <P>The report we published last year dealt with insurance brokers, which is the subject of this more detailed report. The joint committee recommended that there should be no production quotas established by an insurance company that might inhibit or prevent brokers from giving independent advice to their clients; that a scheme for licensed brokers should be established by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority that would permit any broker to deal on behalf of clients with any insurance company without any restriction; and that insurance companies should not discriminate against competing brokers in making available renewal information. The joint committee also heard views expressed that brokers should operate on a fee basis rather than for commission. With commissions brokers apparently have a vested interest in higher premiums. The joint committee recommended that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority should give consideration to the issue of whether brokers should operate only on a fee basis alone.</P>
    <P>Before I say anything further, I am aware that we must declare vested interests in this regard. I am not sure whether the fact that my brother, Patrick Leyden, is a broker in New York means I have a vested interest because I do not have any business connection with him. He works with a company called Tick &amp;  Company in New York. From what he has told me about his business over the years, it is providing an excellent service for its clients. He goes into the city and fights to get the best possible deal for his clients. I therefore have much respect for brokers and the work they do. Nothing in this report should take from their work. We need to take account of what they have provided over the years. When insurance costs were low, brokers' fees were low. This is where the issue of brokers' fees arises. It must be borne in mind that the Professional Insurance Brokers Association has 700 members and the Irish Brokers Association has 600 members. They, in turn, employ a number of people. Insurance brokers are very important employers and we must bear that in mind.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The Competition Authority&rsquo;s preliminary findings on competition in the insurance industry were launched jointly by the authority and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in autumn 2002 and focus on motor, employers&rsquo; liability and public liability insurance. The findings focus on barriers to entry and rivalry in the insurance market and have identified some specific issues that give rise to competition concerns. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the House about this as I have been involved in promoting competition throughout Irish industry during discussions facilitated by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. I agree with the findings of this report. I do not believe any Member of the House can argue against exploiting the potential for more <Col N="1133"/>competition in any industry or sharing relevant information among insurance companies.</P>
    <Miles com="cl" par="113"/><P>The report is extremely well researched and deserves to be studied in detail and implemented. However, I have difficulties with many aspects of the report. The broker has emerged as a scapegoat for large insurance companies reeling in massive profits from sizeable clients. If the economies of scale with respect to insurance companies are examined it is easy to see that a broker who has a client spending &euro;100,000 on insurance and is charging 5% commission, is coming out with substantially more in his pocket than the small-sized firm operating for a client spending smaller sums of money. It should be noted that brokers operate throughout the country and offer a decentralised service. They provide employment in rural towns and many would not have the client base available to larger brokers, so it is not a comparison of like with like. The Competition Authority&rsquo;s criticisms of how competition works at the broker end of the market bear little resemblance to brokers&rsquo; day-to-day business. I further believe that this report may be more representative of the top business people in the country. This is because bigger businesses have seen their motor, employers&rsquo; liability and public liability insurance premiums go through the roof. However, the broker is regarded as the handy whipping boy.</P>
    <P>I heard a spokesman for the brokers speak on Pat Kenny&rsquo;s radio programme. It is easy to use them as the scapegoats for the increases in insurance. They are not responsible for the increases. They operate on a fee-based system like architects, engineers and many other professions, including lawyers. There are currently only one or two insurance companies which will even consider taking employers&rsquo; liability and public liability clients and this explains the high premiums in these sectors. If there is no competition, then the solution must surely be to increase the number of companies in the market to drive the costs down. Progress is being made in that regard with the establishment of the PIAB. I have great confidence in Ms Dorothea Dowling and her team.</P>
    <P>I recommend that instead of this heavy handed approach toward brokers, which may in turn lead to job losses, we as legislators concentrate on promoting an increase in the supply of insurance agencies thereby increasing competition. If insurance costs are reduced, then the brokerage costs will reduce. The current situation seems to be that insurers are cherry-picking the small businesses. However, it would then be realistic for a client to expect a quote for all insurance but this is not the case even though competition between insurers is practically non-existent.</P>
    <P>The authority&rsquo;s report found there was little competition and a lack of transparency among brokers&rsquo; commissions and noted the potential conflict between their obligations to provide best <Col N="1134"/>advice to clients and incentives from insurers to steer a minimum volume of business in their direction. I believe this is an unfounded statement. In my experience brokers do their utmost to achieve the best possible quote for their clients. There are so few companies in the industry that it is at times very difficult for brokers to get that type of quotation. Like any individual offering a service, brokers must look after the best interests of their clients or they will find that consumers simply do not return. The broker is available to negotiate cover for his or her client. When the client runs into difficulties with claims, be it a motor or a public liability claim, the insurance broker is also there for the client to help minimise their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The majority of brokers look after clients very well and the majority of brokers are not in the big league. In my experience, most small brokers would refund some of the commission charged for a big account to the client. This is an admirable practice. As payment for sourcing the best motor insurance for a client, a broker might receive a 5% commission or &euro;25 for a premium of &euro;500, which is not exactly huge profit for the work involved. Most clients actually only pay &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000 annually in insurance premiums and it must be understood that brokers have to make a living through commissions. There should be a sliding scale and percentages should be capped at a certain level. I cannot stress enough that it is the large insurance agencies which have brought up the average commission earned by brokers and, therefore, I feel this report may not be as representative as may be desired. There are 1,300 brokers&rsquo; companies in the country and not all are large companies.</P>
    <P>I admit that regulation of the non-life insurance market is not as stringent as it is for life assurance brokers but I welcome the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s plans to converge the rules as this will put brokers on a level playing field with banks and insurers&rsquo; direct sales forces. I further welcome the period of public consultation which is planned before the report is completed as I feel this will shed new light on some aspects of the insurance industry which were perhaps overlooked in the preliminary document. I have no doubt that the brokers&rsquo; representatives will put their case on behalf of their clients. As in any other industry, transparency must be encouraged and the revelations in the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report will hopefully serve to shame the substantial insurance companies into reducing their commissions and, therefore, their premiums.</P>
    <P>With respect to smaller insurance businesses, it is important to remember that fixed overheads vary only slightly depending on the size of the corporation. Not only are large firms paying relatively the same fixed costs as smaller firms, but they are charging higher premiums as their clients are bigger and their accounts larger. The <Col N="1135"/>economies of scale come into play here once again. Larger companies are benefiting by being bigger while smaller organisations are tarred with the same brush in reports such as the one presented today.</P>
    <P>It is our duty to protect small businesses and therefore I cannot commend this report as much as other Members of the House. Aspects of it are to be welcomed but I cannot commend the approach in some areas. I have spoken to representatives of small companies. In Roscommon town one brokerage company employs three people plus the broker and the cost of new technology must be met from the commission charged. This report gives the impression that brokers are reeling in the money. That is the case in some instances and there is no doubt that the increase in premiums caused increases in fees as highlighted in the report. In my view a new relationship between brokers and clients will come about as a result of this report. Progress is being made in this regard. The subject has been examined in great detail, in this report and by the establishment of the PIAB and the report of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. Action has also been taken through legislation and further legislation is required and promised.</P>
    <P>I urge the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring forward the necessary legislation which will make it more difficult for those who make fraudulent claims. The revelations in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme showed how fraud was being perpetrated on the public. There is a new realisation that costs are coming down for the first time in many years. The combined effort of the Competition Authority, the Minister of State and his colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, the Cabinet sub-committee and the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business will bring about a new cost benefit for consumers. I compliment all concerned with this excellent report commissioned by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Competition Authority. I commend the report to the House subject to the submissions made by the brokerage companies, which should receive a good hearing.</P>

	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Norris.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report but following on from the last three speakers&rsquo; contributions I am somewhat out of sync with the views of the House. Senator Coghlan and Senator Leyden gave a robust defence of insurance brokers. Although they congratulate the Competition Authority, I am not <Col N="1136"/>sure what they said is in line with the report&rsquo;s message.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority has done a worthy and adequate job in highlighting the position of insurance brokers and the difficulties for them and consumers. It is due to give a fuller and final report on this issue in the forthcoming weeks. However, in light of the comments from the Minister of State and Senator Leyden and Senator Coghlan, the Competition Authority should not become a fig-leaf for the Government. I am concerned that when the Competition Authority, having thrown questions into the public arena, makes its recommendations on insurance brokers, it will be ignored because of strong political lobbying in this House and the Lower House.</P>
    <P>Insurance brokers are a strong political lobby. In the past, they were even stronger as a large number of Members of both House came from the profession, making it a difficult task to tackle them head-on. The Competition Authority, so far, has not done that but hopefully it will do so in its final report. Let us hope that the Government does not listen to many of its backbenchers but to the report it commissioned and acts accordingly. This particular body must not be allowed to be a fig-leaf for the Government. It must not be a wastepaper basket where problems go and come out diluted. It must be allowed to be proactive and its recommendations responded to with vigour by the Government.</P>
    <P>I noted the tactic of the last speakers when they rightly deflected much of the flak from the brokers and onto the large insurance companies. The large insurance companies are running a semi-cartel. They have behaved in a bullying fashion to the consumer for many years and have had it all their own way. It is an industry that behaves in a less moral way than the banks. However, if it is doing so, who is assisting it?</P>
    <P>The report found that 80% of motor insurance went through insurance brokers, with an even higher percentage for liability insurance. If the large insurance companies are guilty of overcharging, they are assisted in this abuse of the consumer by insurance brokers. We cannot have it both ways. This is an industry and they are all in it together. The suspicion is that it is a conspiracy against consumers, as it is no accident that they are being overcharged by the insurance industry. There is a conspiracy, an understanding, a tick-tacking between the insurance companies and brokers at the expense of the consumer. I must be living in a different world from Senators Coghlan and Senator Leyden because the evidence tells me that this is what is specifically happening in the insurance industry. Every time I investigate an individual case of insurance abuse or malpractice, I find that the consumer is being hood-winked one way or the other, either by the broker, the company or both. This is from my <Col N="1137"/>experience of the industry and it is invariably true.</P>
    <P>I understand the argument made by Senator Leyden and Senator Coghlan. However, is there any need for insurance brokers at all? Can we do without them? This is the fundamental question which the Competition Authority did not address. Senator O&rsquo;Rourke last week told the House that she had telephoned various companies when renewing her car insurance. By doing so on her own, she managed to reduce her premium by &euro;200. Do insurance brokers do this? Consumer inertia is the greatest benefit for the financial services industry. The average man on the street does not switch banks or insurance companies because it is too difficult with paperwork obstacles in the way. Part of the agreement between the brokers and the insurance companies is to make it difficult for the average man to switch, forcing him to stick with them and they can continue overcharging him. Anyone who has taken the trouble to shop around for their motor, house or employer&rsquo;s liability insurance will find a better deal than an insurance broker. It is an industry that lives on the inertia and sloth of the consumer.</P>
    <P>The most tangible item in the report concerns the commissions from which brokers earn their money. A simple question must be asked. Why in God&rsquo;s name do brokers not put the commission charged on every bill sent to a customer? I was a stockbroker once and, by God, they are parasites. Not so long ago, I was a parasite.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>An amazing admission for the Senator to put on the record.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am now poacher turned gamekeeper.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>He still is.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>In the days when I was a parasite, we charged far too much money for doing far too little, just like insurance brokers. Yet on every contract sent out, people were told how much we were ripping them off. People could at least see the amount paid on stamp duty, VAT and the brokers&rsquo; commission. It also allowed them to complain. Insurance brokers are different types of parasites in that they are much better. Insurance brokers do not inform consumers how much they are charging and they get away with it. With so few complaints, that is the sort of parasite I would have liked to have been. It is indefensible, particularly with cosy payments from insurance companies to brokers, that large bills go out from insurance brokers that do not inform the person involved how much he or she is paying in commission.</P>
    <P>It begs the question: what would happen if the brokers were not there? It is unarguable that, as commission would not have to be paid by the insurance companies, the cost to the consumer <Col N="1138"/>would be cheaper. Insurance brokers must justify what they are doing, but by refusing to let one know what one is being charged, they cannot do so. I had the recent experience where I telephoned the insurance company with which I have a policy for my house. I asked a number of questions which the company did not like. When I asked how much the insurance broker was getting out of the policy, the company told me to jump in a lake, as it was up to the broker to tell me. It was not its practice to give this information, yet all the company&rsquo;s business was done through brokers. The result is that the broker is a shield between insurance companies and the customer. Insurance companies are not accountable on this matter. The insurance broker does not seem to be accountable for anything either but if one turns to the company it refers one back to the broker although it is receiving the main and final benefit. This is a pretty rotten industry which has lived behind closed doors for a long time.</P>
    <P>Almost all insurance brokers earn their money from percentages, not from fee-based commissions with the result that their incomes have rocketed as premiums rose, particularly in the house price boom. They are doing just as much or as little work as they ever did yet are benefiting by the increase in value of the assets and the penal premiums and doing nothing extra to earn that, which cannot be justified. I query whether it is right that auctioneers, stockbrokers, lawyers and insurance brokers should be paid on the basis of percentage commissions. The report highlights the fact that because insurance brokers benefit from commissions it is in their interests to see that premiums are high. How can they act in the interest of the customer if they receive money for a higher premium? It might be &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000 for employer&rsquo;s liability, &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 for a house, or the value of car insurance. The higher the value of the commodity, the higher the premium and the higher the insurance broker&rsquo;s percentage. There is very little to stop an insurance broker who might be greedy and unscrupulous negotiating a high premium for the client. People who shop around can nearly always find a lower quote than that offered by the insurance broker, which reflects inertia on the part of the customer and a certain laziness on the part of the insurance broker.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about up-front fees. Many of us have had experience of an insurance broker, particularly one selling life or unit-based assurance, taking an up-front fee. Sometimes this is the whole of the first year&rsquo;s premium after which the broker receives a small amount <i>ad infinitum</i> so the effort goes into selling the package but not servicing it. The broker&rsquo;s only interest is a once-off sting of the consumer for which he or she receives a large commission but will not look after the customer afterwards. The Competition Authority should examine and make <Col N="1139"/>recommendations on that practice. The signs are that the Government will drag its heels on this but I look forward to it giving an active response to the report&rsquo;s findings, to making life easier for the consumer and much hotter for insurance brokers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister of State to the House. It is nice to be following Senator Ross and his admission to being a former stockbroker and parasite.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not make a meal of it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that open confession is the main comment that will emerge from this debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good for the soul.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We should read the full title of this report and acknowledge that it is a preliminary report and consultative document which is the start of period of consultation. I hope we will not be carried away by the contents of this report and the negativity in certain parts of it. Instead we should use it as a platform from which to move forward in an effort to improve the insurance industry. I am not a fan of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s approach as it deals only with pure economics and omits many other aspects of professional services offered by the professions it examines. I fully accept that the consumer must get value for money but that value cannot be measured only in retail terms; many other aspects of the service must be factored into the overall service. I support competition and the market economy but I am not a blind supporter of the economist&rsquo;s viewpoint; it is not possible to achieve a free market at any cost. There are instances when Government must intervene to protect the public interest, for example, in the provision of key social and health services. The overriding consideration must be what Government can do to improve services or ensure that quality services are available, whether directly or through the private sector on the Government&rsquo;s behalf.</P>
    <P>Competition and economics are not the be all and end all of providing professional services. When is competition really competition? Do we have a situation whereby, in the name of competition, regulation can be used to boost the coffers of the one who holds the monopoly? There have been many changes in the market and the cost of insurance has become prohibitive for many consumers, be it car insurance or the examples of small industry we discussed earlier. The Government has dealt with this through the introduction of the PIAB and legal reform, etc. There have been examples of improvements on <Col N="1140"/>behalf of the consumer and I hope that, as a result of the Government&rsquo;s initiatives, there will be more. The Minister of State has highlighted some of this in his speech today.</P>
    <P>It would be easy for me to attack brokers as soft targets but there are areas in need of change including a need for transparency, and for consumers to be fully aware of the service they receive for the broker&rsquo;s fee or commission. We should not be too quick to absolve the consumer of responsibility to examine the service for which he or she is paying. I have engaged and changed brokers and have been satisfied with the service I received. It is my choice to deal directly with an insurance company or to engage an agent on my behalf to negotiate the best deal for me. We often hear comments about the small print. How many consumers want to examine the small print? Some consumers out of choice hand over that responsibility to somebody on their behalf. I do not see anything wrong with that and I also feel such service should not be provided for free.</P>
    <P>As insurance is about placing and taking risk, how can some insurance companies give various pricing structures for the same risk, for example a private car? Hibernian provides motor insurance to the market through the post office, One Direct, Hibernian Direct, Broker Line Direct, brokers and the banks. Someone giving the same details to all these outlets will get different terms from each of them. Questions must be asked in this regard. Up to 85% of those in the commercial area rely on brokers to do this work for them.</P>
    <P>Up to three years ago many companies provided competition in the motor insurance market. However, company mergers have in effect reduced competition and reduced the number of companies we can access. It can be argued that by facilitating such mergers we reduce competition in the market. Brokers will not only seek quotations from companies in the Irish market, but will also do so outside the Irish market. Some of us have had experience of getting better insurance cover at a more reasonable cost from companies not based in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There have been many examples of insurance companies giving quotations to clients who have in turn gone to a broker to see whether it can be reduced. The brokers have found that the quotation given by the insurance company was stacked for a variety of wrong reasons, for example by adding children to the policy. When the broker pointed this out, the insurance company reverted to the client trying to reverse its decision. This is the job of a broker. Too often we remove the responsibility from the consumer who engages the professional to ask the professional to fully explain what he or she is doing. It is far too easy for us to attack brokers.</P>
    <P>In areas such as joinery and manufacturing the costs of public liability insurance have been huge <Col N="1141"/>over the years and must be reduced as too many small companies have gone out of business as a result of prohibitive costs. Insurance companies trade off risks and in doing so some of them refuse to quote to a small company. Some small companies that have been paying premiums of about &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000 per year and suddenly after three or four years of not quoting they come back into the market and offer a quote at a far reduced rate. We need to understand why this is happening.</P>
    <P>The same is true in the property market. With the increased cost of houses, those charging fees on a percentage basis such as solicitors have increased their fees dramatically. We need to consider what brokers do on behalf of their clients. The report seems to focus exclusively on commission. However, to bring balance to this debate we need to consider what a broker does. I am aware of cases where a broker not only prepares a prospectus for a client, but also outlines the different quotations and the differences in policies. This allows the client to engage the insurer he wants.</P>
    <P>In the event of a claim, the same broker processes the claim, deals with the issues concerned, meets the solicitors and in the case of a company may deal with the builders, solicitor and insurer, and sets about negotiating the settlement figure. I am aware of a case of flood damage in which the insured had to produce accounts showing the change in trading in that period. The accountant in providing that service charged a fee of &euro;3,500. The broker charged no fee. This service was provided as a result of initially engaging the broker to do the job required. It is not possible to look at the glass half full or half empty. We must consider this matter in its totality and some people choose to focus on only one area.</P>
    <P>Where should we go from here? Senator Ross referred to the responsibility on the consumer to shop around. When comments were made by the T&aacute;naiste recommending shopping around, the reaction was that the consumer should not have to shop around. There is a responsibility on individuals to shop around for the best value both in the retail area and in engaging professional services. It is a matter of personal choice. Brokers are obliged to give the best advice. This is particularly true of authorised advisers who have the ability to access all the markets. The brokers should take the opportunity to look at their own industry, to influence the changes that are coming about and to contribute to the debate about changes rather than having changes imposed upon them that may not enhance the profession overall.</P>
    <P>Many different insurance products now exist. The implications contained in the small print must be made clear to clients. The consumer has the utmost responsibility in ensuring this. Companies must explain why it is possible to get <Col N="1142"/>different quotations for the same item from various different channels. Someone looking for insurance through three or four different channels will get three or four different quotations. Brokers have a responsibility to provide a professional service. They cannot work in cahoots with insurance companies as Senator Ross stated was the case, which is not a sentiment I share. While there may be isolated examples, this has not been my experience. Any such isolated examples should be exposed. It is not possible to pool a whole group of professionals into one category because of an isolated example.</P>
    <P>Ultimately it is a matter of choice. There is no legal requirement for someone seeking insurance to go through a broker. That is a decision for the consumer. While some people may have the time and ability to read the small print, others choose to engage professionals on their behalf. The Competition Authority&rsquo;s report is not just about the retail side. There is a value on professional service and advice. This applies equally to the legal profession, the medical profession and insurance brokers. The consumer makes the choice to quantify and pay for that service. In coming weeks I hope the insurance industry, brokers and the Competition Authority will unite in bringing clarity to the issues highlighted by this initial consultative report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with a good deal of what Senator Minihan said.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am worried now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should be worried. Everybody who applies the power of reason inevitably ends up on the left, because that is the only rational place to be.</P>
    <P>The Senator was too gentle on the question of collusion. We all remember the change in mortgage interest rates when the Bank of Scotland arrived here. I do not believe the chief executives of the banks and building societies telephoned each other and decided not to reduce interest rates further. However, the level at which they competed was a comfortable one. Then a new agency arrived and defined a different comfort level and all the other rates dropped accordingly. I suspect that current mortgage interest rates are on average 0.5 or 0.75 of a percentage point lower than they were before the new entrant arrived.</P>
    <P>It would be too easy if the problem were simply that people picked up the phone and agreed to fix prices. However, I suspect that in the deal that was done to rip off consumers during the period between the locking of currencies and the introduction of the euro, this was almost what happened between the banks. It took the intervention of the European Commission to sort out their dodgy practices. I do not think it is necessarily a question of collusion; it is to do with what is comfortable and when it becomes too <Col N="1143"/>uncomfortable. There is a tacit belief among long-term players in the market that a certain level is what will be tolerated, in the knowledge that their competitors are in the same business and will not rock the boat.</P>
    <P>The current Minister for Agriculture and Food has a wonderful story, which I know is public knowledge, about his intervention in a cosy arrangement under which milk was sold in bulk to a big hospital in Cork. The Minister was the hungry young manager of a dairy which was outside the normal region which supplied Cork city. He put in a tender to supply milk in bulk in winter, when he was short of things to keep his people going. He ended up saving the hospital £40,000 per year. Whether there was a cartel involved is a matter of speculation; perhaps the arrangement had simply become too cosy.</P>
    <P>Let us not imagine that because there is no formal collusion, the reduction in competition is anything other than inimical to the interests of consumers, particularly in poorly regulated areas of the market, in the sense that they are not regulated in a way that measures their efficiency in terms of information available to consumers. Even before the report of the Competition Authority, everybody knew that it is inimical to the interests of the consumers of any service if the return to the service provider is proportional to the amount of money it can extract from the consumer. If the service provider always earns 7% of what the consumer pays, it gets 7% of &euro;50,000 if the consumer pays &euro;50,000 and 7% of &euro;100,000 if the consumer pays &euro;100,000. Where is the incentive to minimise the cost to the consumer? There is none. The only way to protect consumers in such cases is to make the charges transparent in a way which is obvious to them before they take a step inside the door of the service provider&rsquo;s premises.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ross correctly pointed out, inertia is a serious problem. How many of us will traipse around an area the size of Cork city, for example, looking for prices from various brokers if, once we get to the counter and explain our needs, all we obtain is a price? I do not accept that insurance is so complicated, particularly in the area of brokerage, that one cannot have scales of fees which are publicly available.</P>
    <P>The expectations people have of the Competition Authority are enormous. The chairman is a person of considerable skill but unfortunately, he is an economist. The problem with economists is that they believe in economics. People who live in the real world do not. A large part of first and second year economics textbooks, including all the mathematics, is based on the assumption of perfect competition. All through the reports from the Competition Authority, a wistful wishing for perfect competition can be detected. If only we had more information, if only we had more market <Col N="1144"/>participants, if only we had lower entry costs &mdash; all the things that economists throw up as inhibitions &mdash; everything would be perfect.</P>
    <P>In reality, there will never be perfect competition. It may exist in a couple of areas. I suspect that in the domestic heating oil business, in which there are 40 suppliers in Cork city alone, there is close to perfect competition. Although these businesses take prices from the major multinational corporations, in terms of their margins there is nearly perfect competition. There have been a couple of ups and downs &mdash; people have had problems with the quality of their oil which have sent them running back the oil company they dealt with. Nevertheless, in most areas of economic activity, perfect competition is an unattainable Holy Grail. The problem with the mathematical models of competition is that when one moves away from perfect competition one runs into all sorts of uncertainties. One does not move just a little bit away from the ideal &mdash; one runs into huge problems. That is what is happening here.</P>
    <P>We can probably never aspire to having perfect competition in an area such as insurance. How can we have perfect competition in an area in which one must forecast liabilities that could stretch ten or 15 years into the future? One can use the famous law of large numbers, as the Competition Authority has done. I do not believe there are any laws in economics, only good ideas which are more or less useful in different areas. There is no law to which an immediate exception cannot be found.</P>
    <P>As legislators, we have an important obligation to regulate to ensure that certain tendencies to make competition even less of an imposition on businesses are not followed through. Karl Marx suggested 150 years ago that big business had a tendency to move towards monopoly. In the USA, some of the toughest legislation in the world was introduced to attempt to prevent that happening. Left to their own devices, allegedly competitive large corporations will do the opposite of what the theory says. Instead of competing, they will collude. Adam Smith mentioned 200-odd years ago that when business people got together the first thing they talked about was not the competitive market but the possibility of fixing prices.</P>
    <P>The idea of the perfect competitive market is an intellectual error. We must therefore consider a mixture of competition and regulation to protect consumers. It is astonishing that so far into an economic debate about insurance costs, we still seem to be reluctant to provide the essential market signal for consumers, an indication of how much they will be charged, in a way they can figure out. The provision of a plethora of market participants does not necessarily make the position of the consumer any easier. One can read the chart in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i>, for example, which attempts to inform <Col N="1145"/>consumers about the best telephone services. I am reasonably numerate and I consider myself reasonably intelligent, although there might be different views on that in the House, but I defy anybody to read that and figure out which is the best deal. One has to assume that all the deals are essentially working in the interests of consumers. However, if one is going to prevent consumers from finding out through the price mechanism what their choices are, one will not enable consumers to shop around.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of a married couple, both of whom go out to work at 7.30 a.m. and get home at 5.30 p.m., five days per week. If one is to imagine that they will have the time to overcome inertia and traipse from broker to broker seeking a quote for their house insurance, we are fooling ourselves and reverting to this innocent belief of the Competition Authority that everything will be fine with just a little more competition. There are things one cannot measure or quantify.</P>
    <P>What purpose do insurance brokers serve? What do they do? Why is the consumer better off because they exist? Everybody says it is not fair to be too hard on them. Perhaps that is so. However, I have a simple view. When I see anything proliferating in any sector, for example, off-licences, I know it is because it has been identified as an area for making money. Nearly every corner shop in Ireland has a wine licence because people have developed a taste for wine and there is obviously a perception that there is money to be made. When I see insurance brokerages proliferating and people who have aspirations to be business people gravitating to the two areas of auctioneering and insurance brokerage, I do not need a Competition Authority to know there must be a perception that it is easier to make money in those sectors. Why are they not in the supermarket business? It is because they do not believe there is easy money to be made. These are the signals the market gives so we do not need the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>Other issues are raised in this interesting report. The more that is written about these matters, the more we understand them. However, that is all subordinate to the fact that if we wish to put the consumer first, he or she should have a simple way of working out what insurance will cost. If I go into Senator Quinn&rsquo;s supermarket, I know what every item will cost. He must sell thousands of separate items but I am entitled to know not only what the item will cost but what the unit cost of that item will be. How is it, therefore, that if I want to insure my house or my public liabilities, I cannot know, on any rational basis, what that will cost?</P>
    <P>The other fascinating information in the report was the comparative information on other European countries, particularly with regard to motor insurance. Two matters caught my attention. There is a need for public education <Col N="1146"/>about one of them, the study on motor insurance across Europe. The variation in liabilities in different countries was intriguing. How many of us, when we take our cars to Europe, are aware of the variations in liability that arise in different European countries? We assume we have the same responsibilities and liabilities but according to this report we do not.</P>
    <P>That is the reason one of the studies for the report discounted too much emphasis on comparative values, which is probably just as well. I took note of one. Road fatalities per million of the population in Portugal are 80% more than in Ireland on a comparative basis but motor insurance costs per vehicle in Portugal are roughly one third of the costs in Ireland. There would have to be a good rational basis, in terms of different liabilities, to be persuaded that this is not something to do with Irish consumers being ripped off.</P>

	<P>I welcome members of the Irish Brokers Association who are in the Visitors Gallery for this debate. I congratulate the Competition Authority on a comprehensive and informative preliminary report and consultation document. There is no doubt that an investigative report which highlights possible anti-competitive practice by elements of the insurance industry is both necessary and timely if we are to make informed recommendations for change to the insurance market which will benefit consumers, brokers and insurers.</P>
    <P>Brokers are an essential part of the insurance market and many are of great benefit in assisting the consumer in their endeavours to obtain the best products and prices appropriate to their needs and wishes. The existing broker-<Miles com="jy" />consumer and broker-insurer relationships are<Miles com="jy" />reasonable. However, in considering aspects<Miles com="jy" />of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report, recommendations can be made which, if implemented, would greatly enhance the industry for all participants.</P>
    <P>There is a stigma attached to all people involved in the sale of insurance products, whether these are companies, brokers or individuals, which has given rise to the public perception of being ripped off. This, in turn, has led to an increased lack of trust in brokers and insurance companies on the part of the consumer. This situation has been exacerbated over recent years by spiralling costs and the massive variance in quotations received by the consumer from different brokers and insurance companies. Appropriate regulation, administrative reform <Col N="1147"/>and increased freedom of information within the industry will help to increase consumer confidence and trust of brokers and insurance companies. This will improve the situation for everybody.</P>
    <P>Under the current system, an insurance broker receives approximately 5% commission for motor cover and 9% for liability insurance. Any reduction in these fees from an insurance company may well discourage a broker from selling that company&rsquo;s product even though it might represent the best value for money to the consumer. Although brokers are statutorily obliged to give their client the best advice available to them, the fact remains that the system under which most of the country&rsquo;s 2,500 brokers operate means that the more expensive the policy, the more the broker will earn. Such a system will only serve to reduce further consumer confidence and trust and will not encourage competition.</P>
    <P>Since the ceiling on brokers&rsquo; commissions was lifted in 1999, the cost of insurance has risen by 94%. However, brokers&rsquo; commission has increased by 126%. In motor insurance, average broker commission grew from 3% to 5% and broker income jumped from &euro;35 million to &euro;76 million. In liability insurance, commission dropped from 8% to 7% between 1998 and 2000 before increasing again to 9% two years ago. In that period broker income increased from &euro;25 million to &euro;58 million. These figures show that broker fees have been rising faster than the cost of insurance for most of the last decade. It appears clear, therefore, that the abolition of the cap on non-life insurance commissions in 1999 did not, as intended, introduce rate commission competition between brokers.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to broker commissions. On the contrary, I believe they are entitled to an appropriate rate of commission. Indeed, it is vital that brokers are appropriately remunerated to ensure they can offer optimum levels of customer service and professionalism to the consumer. However, there should be regulation which would oblige the broker, when preparing quotations for consumers, to state clearly the commission payable to them as a result of the sale of the product.</P>
    <P>There should also be regulation which would oblige the broker to provide multiple quotes from various sources for the same product, thus giving the consumer a wider choice. This would greatly enhance consumer confidence. It would be of great benefit to the consumer as the broker is best placed to advise on which product is the best from the quotes offered, based on a product&rsquo;s features. Given the sometimes highly technical nature of the products, the qualified expertise of a broker is required to simplify the information for the consumer. In this area, brokers are of tremendous value to the consumer in helping to <Col N="1148"/>ensure they obtain the product most suited to their needs. It is also important to realise that the best option is often not the cheapest. If all the information is presented in the manner I have outlined, brokers, insurers and consumers stand to gain from a better regulated and more transparent and competitive system.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>What I propose has been borne out in the life insurance industry over the past number of years. New measures introduced by the Central Bank, and implemented by IFSRA on its behalf, made it obligatory for life insurance brokers to do what is known as a &ldquo;fact find&rdquo; to ascertain the relevant needs of the customer and the products most appropriate to his or her needs before they quote a product. Then they must issue a recommendation incorporating what is known as a &ldquo;reasons why letter&rdquo; and this is followed by a quotation which includes commission disclosure.</P>
    <Miles com="cl" par="113"/><P>There was uproar among life brokers when these measures were introduced and the measures were treated with scepticism. However, increased transparency, administrative reform and increased professionalism have had a huge effect on enhancing consumer confidence through better information and a greater consumer choice. For brokers, the measures meant an initial investment in their housekeeping procedures. They also flushed out cowboys operating in the industry who were doing nothing for the reputation of brokers. Research I have done into the life insurance industry found that the measures introduced actually increased brokers&rsquo; income, as a result of better informed consumers with greater confidence in brokers. The measures have also enhanced competition. The financial services regulatory authority in the United Kingdom introduced similar measures in the past and the experience there has been equally positive.</P>
    <P>Motor and liability insurance brokers should not fear the unknown when precedent tells us that better regulation, administration and transparency help both consumers and brokers. Competition can be enhanced by such measures and that augurs well for all of us. Increased competition remains one of the biggest challenges of the Irish insurance market. While some good work has been done, we need to do much more.</P>
    <P>A recent survey commissioned by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland found that 75% of Irish businesses cited insurance premia as the largest increase in costs in the past 12 months. Such a statistic will not stimulate the growth of indigenous industry and will certainly have adverse effects on foreign direct investment, which in turn will endanger jobs. It is for such reasons that we must redouble our efforts to improve all aspects of the insurance industry. We can do this through increased competition, greater transparency and more professionalism.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report. Hopefully, its publication will help to remove elements <Col N="1149"/>responsible for hampering competition in the industry. I am confident the public consultation process will shed further light on the area. I look forward to the next stage of the report and congratulate the Competition Authority on its thorough investigations to date.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Mr. Fingleton and the Competition Authority on the excellent work done. I am glad Mr. Fingleton is moving on now to investigate the legal profession which richly deserves his attention. We are lucky also to have the services of people such as Dorothea Dowling. Theirs is the kind of incisive intellect needed to look into the uncompetitive practices of this industry. Senator MacSharry more or less gave the impression that it was a perception that people were being ripped off. It is not a perception but the reality and I will focus on some of the striking comments made in this regard in this preliminary report.</P>
    <P>There have been huge increases in insurance costs over the past couple of years which are not justified by the internal circumstances of the Irish market. We hear much rubbish about how it is related to the events of 11 September 2001, which are blamed for everything. I do not believe the increases are justified.</P>
    <P>When I got my insurance renewal notice last year the insurers appeared to think my house was worth &euro;2 million and that its contents were worth &euro;790,000. I rang the insurers and told the young woman who answered that I would like to know when they wanted to move into the house. She replied that she thought I had a wrong number. I said I thought she had a wrong number, that she seemed to think my house and contents were worth &euro;2.79 million, that I was prepared to move out the following day, taking only my underpants and toothbrush, and she could have the whole thing. I am not mean or grasping and &euro;2.5 million would suit me perfectly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the issue of loadings on policies. These exist, I have been told on reliable authority, and there was certainly a blacklist of particular areas of Dublin. This is not acceptable. If we want to get people to move into an area and restore houses, they should not be penalised on account of the area in which they live.</P>
    <P>Motor insurance is another area needing examination. I received a huge quote for motor insurance which was related to the horse power of the car and not its value. The quote was huge despite the fact that I was only getting third party fire and theft insurance under the Trinity group scheme. When I checked the market I got a quote &euro;400 cheaper for full comprehensive insurance. This is the sort of thing that happens regularly.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator did well with the old car he has.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Brokers are a mixed bunch. I had a broker who was a decent old school friend who did as much as he could for me. Brokers are convenient for people like myself who are phobic about forms. However, there are sometimes problems on the structural side of things as they are sometimes tied to a particular company and one does not know how much commission is being charged because they do not inform customers. Sometimes the renewal notice goes to the broker who holds onto it for so long that the customer cannot go to the market for an individual quote. The customer never actually knows what is being charged. I would like to receive a statement showing all the charges involved and which would also include the number of companies from which quotes were received. Sometimes they only get quotes from one or two companies which is unacceptable. Customers are entitled to a fair deal from these agencies but they are not getting it at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden mentioned that some large companies get concessions and write-offs in terms of brokerage fees. Bully for them. However, I am not bothered about large companies. I am much more bothered about the unfortunate individual who must scrape together an insurance premium. It appears that, as with all industry, if a business is a large commercial concern, it can use its financial might to bargain. However, the individual is in much greater danger of not being allowed access to information which would give a proper rational view of the market.</P>
    <P>Two striking statements are made early in the report. Page 8 states that the conclusion of the preliminary report was that both regulation and industry practices gave rise to serious concerns with regard to competition in the insurance broker market. It could not be clearer from this that it has been found that there are concerns about the lack of competition. The second statement went on to say that a lack of market transparency, particularly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the operation of the broker market, results in buyers of insurance lacking crucial information that would enable them to make more proactive and informed choices that would benefit them and drive greater competition in the market. That is the conclusion of the report. I cannot see how anybody can suggest that the whole insurance industry has been exonerated by the report because it certainly has not.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that either household or motor insurance reflect the reality of the internal Irish market. There are external forces operating here but we do not get a balance in the market and do not have European companies entering the market in any large way. The report examines this issue and draws some conclusions on it.</P><Col N="1151"/>
    <P>I wish the report was written in more accessible language. There is too much gobbledegook and too many tongue twisters in it. I will leave it to Senator Quinn to make further comment.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the fact that seven or eight questions are asked on pages 26 and 27 which the Department and insurance industry should examine and for which they should produce the answers for the next report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to follow some people and certainly not easy to follow Senator Norris. I will try to squeeze a lot into my five minutes. I too congratulate the Competition Authority on its report. However, it is important to point out that the report deals with only one aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to touch on four particular aspects of the report. Four interlocking factors apply to the high cost of insurance. The first is the number of claims, whether genuine or false. We have done something about this through road safety and safety in the workplace campaigns and through attacking the &ldquo;compo&rdquo; culture. I congratulate those responsible on the actions taken in this context, particularly against fraud which will shortly be a criminal offence and the recent decisions by a number of judges to award costs against claimants, which did not happen previously.</P>
    <P>My company had a case where somebody claimed against it and the judge decided to award costs against the claimant. The judge felt it was not worthy of allocating costs which has not happened before.</P>
    <P>The second issue is the cost of settling claims, about which we can do something. However, the legal profession has come to rely so much on the compensation culture that it has a vested interest in maintaining it. We have to do something about that. It is almost a case of a gravy train that has to be derailed if we are to be successful because so many lawyers have come to depend on it to a large extent.</P>
    <P>In a recent case we had 11 people representing us in defending ourselves. They were not all legal experts, some were engineers and doctors. On the day the case was due to be heard, they arrived at the High Court at 10 a.m. to find they were 46th in line. The case was not heard and they left at 4 p.m. The claimant had a similar number of people representing him. The case came closer to being heard, but the same thing happened the following day and this went on until the fifth day. This group of people stood around for five days from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. There were ten or 20 others waiting for the case as well, which eventually took place on the sixth day. The State should provide more High Court judges as they are badly needed.</P>
    <P>The third issue relates to the insurance industry itself. As the report points out there are many <Col N="1152"/>niche markets within the overall industry where there is only one supplier. There is no competition in a number of areas. Many people think insurance companies make excessive profits and their protests to the contrary have little weight in view of the secrecy in which insurance companies indulge and, to some extent, the way they have been caught out misrepresenting the true facts of the situation. We must do something about this.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to brokers&rsquo; commission. I have a hang-up in regard to my own business about the way architects are encouraged to spend more on buildings. If an architect has a choice between a wooden or gold door handle, he gets paid more if can manage to coax the client to choose the gold one. My approach to this is to negotiate with the architect, which is not easy, to try to convince him that the less he spends on the building the more he will get paid. That is in contrast to what normally happens. As Senator MacSharry stated in regard to insurance, the more expensive the policy the more commission the broker gets. Let us see if we can introduce a &ldquo;wooden door handle&rdquo; policy in this area. It will not be easy to achieve all that is set out in the report, but we need to tackle it.</P>
    <P>The fourth part was referred to by a number of people, which is the part the customer can play in terms of increased personal responsibility. As Senator Norris indicated, no matter how difficult, it is up to the customer to raise issues and we have to ensure this happens. The emergence of insurance customers as a strong lobby group is a good thing, as exemplified by the setting up of the Alliance for Insurance Reform. I am a member of this group so I know something about it. This lobby group has achieved results in the past two years and will probably not be needed in future if it achieves what it set out to do. If nothing else, it sent a clear message to the insurance industry that it has squeezed the customer far enough and for long enough and now it must put its house in order so as to avoid the consequences.</P>
    <P>I commend the report of the Competition Authority, but I stress that this is a problem with many facets. The insurance sector is bedevilled by problems and we must resist the temptation to rush off in one direction or another. It is vital to attack the problem on a number of different fronts. In that way alone can we succeed in removing what has become a real cancer in our economy and a barrier to future economic growth. This has gone on for far too long, but it has been tackled in the past couple of years as the Government listened to what was said. I commend the report because I believe we can do far more than we are doing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne. I wish to raise a few points as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. A severe lack of <Col N="1153"/>competition is evident in the insurance industry. Hearing some of the harrowing tales of the high cost of insurance that have nothing to do with brokers leads me to conclude that the consumer is paying for the cost of re-insurance that many of the companies undertook in Europe where they are based. The ones that are not based in Europe appear to be able to give better value, such as FBD and Quinn Direct. This is a pointer for the future. We need to attract more insurance companies to get competition into the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s preliminary report and consultation document into competition within the Irish insurance industry. I compliment its chairman, Mr. John Fingleton, on the extensive study undertaken by him and his staff in preparing the report.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I was extremely interested in the publication of the report which dovetails with a report published by the committee last July reviewing the insurance market. Representatives of the Competition Authority attended some of the joint committee&rsquo;s oral hearings and gathered a considerable amount of valuable information.</P>
    <P>The report focused on the competitive aspect of the non-life insurance industry and investigated whether any anti-competitive practices or other constraints existed which led to higher costs for insurance. Competition is one factor which influences the cost of insurance and any reform deemed necessary should be carried out in order to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority&rsquo;s report appeared to put more emphasis on the role of brokers rather than insurance companies. It found no evidence of price collusion among insurance companies and focused on brokers&rsquo; commissions. The report may lay too much blame at the door of the brokers for the high cost of motor and liability insurance. Many brokers do their best for their clients while trying to make a living. Brokers must do the best for their clients or they will lose them. They are also in competition with direct selling by insurance companies and with tied agents or authorised advisers of insurance companies. Brokers must obtain agencies from insurance companies to enable them to sell the products of the insurance company. The procedures behind the granting of agencies to brokers merit examination.</P>
    <P>I agree with the report&rsquo;s recommendation that production quotas should not be established by insurance companies that might inhibit or prevent brokers from giving independent advice to clients. Such a quota may exert influence over some brokers to give advice in order to retain the agency of the insurance company on whom they depend for a living.</P><Col N="1154"/>
    <P>A scheme for licensed brokers should be established by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority in order to bring about a level playing field. That would permit any broker to deal with any insurance company on behalf of clients with no strings attached. In addition, any licensed broker should be able to obtain renewal information given to the broker currently dealing with the client. Competing brokers should not be at a disadvantage. This would benefit the customer and allow free and fair competition to take place.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies rely heavily on brokers to bring them both motor and liability insurance business. Recent figures show that some 80% of the &euro;1.6 billion motor insurance market is broker-driven, while 95% of the &euro;600 million liability market is also broker-driven. The broker&rsquo;s dependency on insurance companies is greater than the other way around due to the large number of brokers that operate in the Irish market compared to the relatively small number of insurance companies. There is little incentive for insurance companies to bring about changes in the commission structure as this could lead to a loss of business if other insurers do not follow suit.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the cap on non-life insurance commissions in 1999 does not appear to have introduced rate competition among brokers. Commission levels have remained static at 5% for motor business and 9% for liability business, while the total value of commissions paid by the industry rose by 51% in motor vehicle insurance and by 126% in liability insurance. Insurance companies are not innocent parties to the rise of brokers&rsquo; fees since they go along with the commission-based system.</P>
    <P>Brokers should not be unfairly apportioned with blame. Insurance companies, in commenting on the profitability of markets, have not satisfactorily explained insurance increases in recent years. Insurance companies hold the key to reform and I call on them to reduce commission costs which could in turn be passed to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report&rsquo;s call for the up-to-date publication of data that underwriters need to be able to price risk in a given market. The availability of this information would be helpful in attracting more insurance companies and, therefore, competition into the market. Reforming brokers&rsquo; commissions cannot be seen as the only answer to reducing costs. We must endeavour to reduce costs in the insurance market. There are currently not enough insurance companies in Ireland providing a whole range of cover. If one is seeking employers&rsquo; or public liability cover, there are at most two insurance companies that will even consider it. All steps need to be taken to allow new insurance providers enter the market and give the customer as wide a choice as possible.</P><Col N="1155"/>
    <P>As the Competition Authority notes, competition issues within the insurance market are only one aspect of the problem. Legislative reform is also important in reducing insurance costs. I draw attention to the importance of three elements of legislation which will reduce the cost of insurance. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act is designed to reduce legal costs with regard to employers&rsquo; liability claims. I agree with the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that the PIAB should be permitted to deal with motor injury claimants as soon as possible. In addition to this legislation, the recently published Civil Liabilities and Courts Bill, in tandem with the Health and Safety Authority Bill will, upon enactment, also help reduce the significant insurance costs that currently exist.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to addressing the high cost of insurance and I am confident that this legislation will help bring down the cost of insurance premiums being paid by the hard-working people who helped develop our economy into a prosperous and resilient one which is admired by many countries throughout the world. I welcome this report into the Irish non-life insurance market and I hope that its publication will be of use in the fight to reduce high premiums. For too long the consumer has been losing out to insurance companies and even a 7% or 8% cut in commissions could result in savings of &euro;10 million for purchasers. I keenly await the next stage of this insurance report and I praise the Competition Authority on its thorough study of the economics and regulation of the non-life insurance industry.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to declare an interest. As vice chairman of the PIAB, I have taken a deep and abiding interest in this area. There are a number of issues regarding the whole area of brokerage and insurance on which we need further information. One of the recommendations of the report is that the client should be aware of the fees and commissions being paid. This should be made clear from the beginning. Brokers need have no apologies for charging fees. If one visits a dentist or doctor, one will pay a fee for work done. A broker doing his or her job properly is entitled to be well paid for it. I would be the last person to pull back on this point. That it is unclear or in some way clouded does not help matters and leads people to draw the conclusion that everyone is being ripped off. That is not necessarily the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to see brokers taking an interest in two areas, one of which they have no involvement whatever in and while they have a tangential involvement in the other, they could do much more. The first issue relates to the subrogation clause in insurance claims. This clause does not allow the client to insist that a claim be fought. <Col N="1156"/>This is a huge problem in many areas and Senator Quinn has referred to claims being fought on his behalf. I recently spoke to two business people about this issue. They decided that they wanted a claim fought. To do this, they had to write to the insurance company and accept liability if the case went wrong. They did not want the insurance company to do a deal, even though money would be saved, because of the wrong impression it would give and the attraction it would provide to other people. I am referring to circumstances where insurance companies conclude that it is cheaper to settle a claim rather than going to court for two or three days and winning a case against a person who has no funds. In these circumstances, insurance companies will calculate that three days in court may cost &euro;30,000 while it will only cost &euro;5,000 to settle the claim. This is fine until the person is buying a round of drinks in the pub that evening and tells everybody else about it. This sows the seeds for future claims.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies do not pay the cost of this and instead put it down to &ldquo;claims experience&rdquo;. The claims experience for that person, street or town is then dependent on it. As we well know, insurance companies are not in the risk business; they are in the profit business. We need to focus more on insurance companies than on brokers. The companies will add the claims experience on to the costs and charge premia accordingly. There is no incentive for the companies not to settle and to fight claims. Brokers negotiating with the insurance companies should at least begin a negotiation in allowing the client or broker to have some input to the decision on whether a claim will be fought.</P>
    <P>The other issue I wish to raise is probably a little outrageous. However, it is a role in which brokers could have a high profile and insurance companies could almost be taken out of the equation. I am referring to circumstances where people feel they are being overcharged for insurance cover. People could enter a tontine arrangement where those who felt this way could form a mutual group. This group would develop a fund over a number of years to cover itself. Let us say that 20 people invested &euro;5,000 per year. At the end of the first year this group, now with &euro;100,000 in the fund, would simply seek insurance for amounts greater than &euro;100,000. After the second year it would seek insurance for amounts greater than &euro;200,000 and so on. There would eventually come a time when the group would simply deal with re-insurers rather than insurance companies. I feel such an arrangement is legal, attractive and possible. However, such an arrangement could not be administered or developed by someone in another line of business and this is where brokers can bring their expertise to bear. They can do a real job, produce a real product and make a real development in something while ensuring they collect their annual fee in the same way as an accountant.</P><Col N="1157"/>
    <P>I would trust brokers to develop products along this line. I would like to see more development in this area. There is no reason that this should not happen. It is not like car insurance &mdash; people are not required by law to have certain types of insurance. It only requires someone to take a creative approach. While I understand that this is done in a number of places, it is not widespread.</P>
    <P>Under this arrangement, brokers would be able to develop a product and use their expertise to establish a new profile. This profile would have more value than that which currently seems to pertain. I would like to hear the view of the Department on this matter. While I am sure it will find 24 problems arising from it, 24 problems are easily dealt with by 24 solutions and that is the business in which we are engaged. Instead of being critical of the work brokers do, we should look at their role and seek ways of enhancing, progressing and developing it. Brokers are important in this and it is important that someone should bridge the gap between insurance companies and the client. Despite what is in the report, I feel a local person is better protected with a local broker than dealing with a direct insurer.</P>
    <P>It is not like buying an airline ticket. These are people to whom one will have to go again if there is ever a claim. These people will know their clients and say they are trustworthy. It gives added value and is preferable to lifting the telephone and speaking to somebody in India to get insurance for a property in Dingle. That arrangement does not suit the Irish psyche and I am not attracted to it.</P>
    <P>The brokers themselves should take the lead on some of these issues. The great problem with professional groups in Irish society is that they are always under pressure. For instance, it was interesting to hear Mr. Fingleton from the Competition Authority state this morning that his next target was lawyers. I was so relieved because I have been the target of lawyers since I got involved in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and I am losing votes by the day. Now that they have Mr. Fingleton to deal with, maybe they will take less of an interest in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that brokers are the important local link, that it is worth protecting them and that they themselves should take a stand. Lawyers have a problem because everybody saw the problem developing and did nothing about it. This House is currently looking at reform possibilities because we know that if we do not do something about it, it will be taken out of our hands. The same is the case with every professional group such as legal people and doctors.</P>
    <P>Brokers should now say they recognise the position and every time there is a meeting of the brokers of Ireland, half of those at the back of the hall will say that they will fight this and get <Col N="1158"/>on to the politicians to ensure nothing happens. That is not the way the world works. Change will happen. It is better for the brokers to ask what will happen if they do nothing and find themselves in deep water shortly. It is better to make a few proposals, do their business which adds value, show that they are important to the people of Ireland and to the industry and show that people can have confidence in them.</P>
    <P>I ask that it be put to the brokers that in all cases they simply set out their commission and fees. If clients do not like it, let them go somewhere else. At the end of the day, it is a cleaner way to proceed. They are entitled to their fee and should make no apologies for it. Perhaps the Minister of State could give some indication as to whether my idea of a mutual society &mdash; I also called it a tontine society but a mutual society would probably be the best description &mdash; could be used by people to develop their business protection.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, back to the House. The Competition Authority&rsquo;s report has been critical of insurance brokers. This is a little unfair because it takes the spotlight off insurance companies which have increased premiums at the rate of 100%, 200% and 300% over the past number of years. In fairness, the Government has done everything in its power, through the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill which has passed through both Houses, to reduce the number of claims and the number of accidents occurring.</P>
    <P>The brokers&rsquo; association must take a little responsibility here. Despite the fact that premiums have risen considerably over the past number of years, the commissions paid on these premiums to brokers stands at 5% for motor insurance and 9% for public liability insurance. Brokers should do more to show greater transparency in their dealings with the general public. People are concerned because there seems to be secrecy about the commissions paid. When they issue renewals there are obligations on the brokers to show the products and the companies for whom they work, but I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that the brokers could do much to improve their position in the insurance market and to make it more transparent.</P>
    <P>The brokers do a good job. As I stated at the outset, I would not like to see the insurance companies get off the hook here. Reading the report, one would think that all the problems lead back to the brokers. They do not. However, the brokers could do much more to improve their own position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys _dc20-?><Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the report. Of course I had to look at it from the point of view of medical negligence claims and so forth. Some really <Col N="1159"/>spurious arguments have been brought forward regarding the effectiveness of litigation in reducing medical errors, for example, and there is absolutely no evidence of this. On a recent edition of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; the director general of the Law Society stated that some 2,000 people die from preventable medical errors in Irish hospitals every year and it is likely that 14,000 people are injured or killed in Irish hospitals every year. This is really just information which has been taken crudely from the estimated extent of hospital errors in American hospitals and transposed into an Irish setting without anyone producing evidence that this is the case.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <P>What has been particularly resented was the claim made on that television programme that the courts have contributed hugely to the safety of our hospitals. There is absolutely no evidence to show that at all. Medical errors in general are due to people being over-tired or undertaking work in which they do not have adequate experience in many cases. I strongly support the Government&rsquo;s efforts to bring in a consultant-provided service. To date, we have had a consultant-led service and this certainly has been a problem with people having to undertake duties for which they were not perhaps qualified.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the legal profession compliments itself on things it is not doing. There has been a much better system in areas where we have had more open reporting of faults rather than in areas where people have been running to litigation immediately. Any way in which we can remove litigation from the centre of court processes and claims can only be to the advantage of everyone within our society.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators who contributed to this debate. Many of them were reasoned and some were slightly excitable but it made for an interesting afternoon.</P>
    <P>In my closing remarks, I will highlight the pertinent points of my opening address. The Government welcomes the publication of the Competition Authority report on competition issues in the non-life insurance market, which is a preliminary report and a consultation document. The undertaking of a study on competition in the insurance market is one of the recommendations of the MIAB report and is a key element of the reform programme.</P>
    <P>The insurance reform programme comprises 67 recommendations of the MIAB report and 32 of these have already been implemented. The MIAB action plan and a ministerial committee monitors the progress of the implementation of these 67 recommendations.</P>
    <P>The MIAB action plan covers a broad spectrum of activities which impact on the insurance market. It includes measures aimed at <Col N="1160"/>improving the law on personal injuries. The Civil Liability and Courts Bill has been published and is soon to be before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the legislation to establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board was signed into law in December 2003. Significant progress has been made on the logistics with a view to the PIAB hearing cases by the middle of the year.</P>
    <P>On implementing and enforcing the Road Traffic Acts, penalty points have been introduced by the Minister for Transport and a new road safety strategy statement is expected shortly. On providing greater transparency and protection to consumers, IFSRA set up a one-stop website on 26 November 2003 and published its code of practice for insurers in December 2003. On the provision of greater information to the consumer, IFSRA published the first set of its three monthly comparative tables showing motor insurance quotations in December 2003.</P>
    <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s firm intention to continue to implement the measures in An Agreed Programme for Government which relate to tackling the high cost of insurance, and to implement any recommendations which result from the final findings of this study by the Competition Authority. The authority has identified some specific issues which give rise to competition concerns with regard to barriers to entry and rivalry in the insurance market. These concerns are being explored further in a public consultation process which will last for two months.</P>
    <P>As regards insurance brokers, competition concerns for further consideration include the existence of <i>ad valorem</i> or fixed percentage fees which do not appear to have been computed downwards despite rapid increases in underlying premiums; the possibility of conflicts of interest arising from, on the one hand, the obligation to provide best advice to the client and, on the other, incentives from insurers, including overriding commissions related to quantity of sales and minimum thresholds of business; and a lack of transparency in that buyers do not necessarily know what incentives and commissions the broker may receive or which insurers the broker has contacted on their behalf.</P>
    <P>As regards insurers, several issues of concern for further consideration have been identified. With regard to data sharing on lost statistics which helps to assess risk and calculate premiums, questions have arisen about the extent, timeliness, availability and reliability of data, all of which need to be explored further. With regard to the funding and handling of claims arising from uninsured and untraced drivers and the method of operation of the declined cases agreement, suggestions are being sought as to whether changes could be introduced which would deal with competition concerns. On solvency requirements for insurance companies, the policy of setting higher margins for new entrants than <Col N="1161"/>for existing companies is being examined further to ascertain whether it acts, in practice, as a barrier to entry.</P>
    <P>The comments of Senators are welcome and will be taken into account by the Competition Authority in the public consultation process. This process will conclude on 18 April next, after which the authority will prepare a final report and recommendations which it aims to conclude during the summer.</P>

   <Title>Dormant Accounts: Motion.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
    <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann condemns the decision of the Government to undermine the independence of the Dormant Funds Account Board by transferring all decisions on dormant fund disbursements to the Government and noting that the initial proposal for such a fund came from the Public Accounts Committee where it was recommended that moneys be ring-fenced for the most disadvantaged communities within Irish society;</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="is" par="0p10"/><Miles com="ix"/>that the Dormant Funds Account Board was established by the Oireachtas by the Dormant Funds Act 2001;</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="is" par="0p10"/><Miles com="ix"/>that the Oireachtas gave the board responsibility for decisions on the disbursement of moneys under the fund;</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="is" par="0p10"/><Miles com="ix"/>that the Oireachtas decided that the board should be independent in the performance of its functions;</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="is" par="0p10"/><Miles com="ix"/>and the comments of the Minister for Finance on 20 June 2001, that the legislation was enacted in this way to prevent the Government having access to a slush fund that Ministers would use to favour pet projects, urgently calls on the Government to reverse this decision.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">The Dormant Accounts Bill 2001 was introduced in the D&aacute;il on 20 June 2001. It received universal welcome from all sides of the House. Approximately &euro;150 million of unclaimed bank and building society deposit accounts, together with funds from unclaimed insurance policies, was to be put into a fund to be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency if the accounts were dormant and the owner had not carried out any transaction in respect of the account for a period of not less than 15 years. A new independent board, the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, was to be established to disburse the funds. The board would invite applications for funding from charities and from community groups.</P>
    <P>One of the most welcome commitments given by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, <Col N="1162"/>was contained in his summing up on the Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il when he stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">The PAC recommended that it [the money] be used for . . . societal and community purposes. To get away from the problem of having the Government blamed for having a slush fund, it has been decided to establish a board of trustees. The board will distribute the money, subject to guidelines and [this is the important thing] without direction from the Government. This will [according to the Minister] get away from the problems of having Ministers accused of favouring pet projects, having the fund as part of general Estimates processes of Departments or having it as part of policy initiatives of Departments. I think this is the best approach.</P>
    <P FLI="0">He further said &ldquo;. . . the best approach was [one could say &ldquo;is&rdquo;] to give the power to distribute it [the money] to a disbursals board and not the Minister&rdquo;. The Minister could not have been more explicit. There would be no Government slush fund. No ministerial hand would touch the funds. To avoid any such taint, any such suspicion or any such allegation, an independent disbursements board would decide on who would benefit from the &euro;150 million.</P>
    <P>This Government has had its fair share of U-turns in its 21 months in office. Without doubt, however, the announcement last week that the Government was sidelining the disbursement board and giving full disbursement powers for the &euro;150 million, which I understand is now &euro;175 million, and full discretion over the appointment of the ADM board, a new board appointed by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, represents the most blatant and shameful of political somersaults.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, in speaking to a Private Members&rsquo; amendment to a Government motion on decentralisation, I accused the Government of unprecedented arrogance. However, the sheer arrogance and indifference to public opinion regarding this motion, the U-turn and somersault shows that matters are getting worse week by week.</P>
    <P><i>The Irish Times</i> editorial on Friday last could not have been more blunt or accurate. The headline &ldquo;A Political Slush Fund&rdquo; aptly describes this political U-turn. The Taoiseach has defended the about-turn by trying to explain that the change is being made in the interests of transparency. What baloney. The absolute and only guarantor of transparency, as the Minister emphasised in the D&aacute;il three years ago, is an independent disbursement board. Now this independent disbursement board is to be dumped. It is to be relegated to the role of being able only to comment on decisions taken by a Minister on where the money should go. In other <Col N="1163"/>words, it has been sidelined and is now to become a hapless bystander.</P>
    <P>What wrong has it done to merit such shabby treatment? That is what I would like to know from the Minister of State when he rises to respond. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, for his part, has attempted to defend the decision by saying that the removal of the decision-making process from the disbursement board would make the process more efficient and effective. He suggested there would be better co-ordination. That is more pathetic political baloney.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear that what we are talking about here is a large amount of money, &euro;175 million, on which the Government has set its beady eye and which it sees as a useful slush fund to fund the pet political projects in the run-up to the local and European elections. This is nothing but a smash-and-grab raid on moneys that do not belong to the State, private moneys left untouched for 15 years. The Minister for Finance on that fateful day, 20 June 2001, acknowledged such in very explicit terms. This is money to which the Government has absolutely no right. While the Government indulges itself in the greasy till, what about the community groups, those working in the area of social, economic or educational disadvantage? What about those groups working in the grossly and scandalously under-funded area of disability?</P>
    <?oasys _dc20-?><P>I have admired the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in the past. He is somebody who shoots from the hip, who says what he has to say. I admired his stance on the public finances in the early 1980s. I admired certain political decisions he made about who should lead his party. I always recognised him and gave him credit for being a straight talker and a fairly straight actor. How the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, can countenance such a complete and absolute betrayal of the commitments he gave to the Oireachtas three years ago is simply incomprehensible.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <P>I now turn to our friends in the Progressive Democrats, the great custodians of the common good, the public watchdogs. We all recall the Minister, Deputy McDowell, up that pole in Dublin with that very decisive poster, &ldquo;Single Party Government &mdash; No Thanks&rdquo;. What has happened to the watchdogs? The watchdogs have become lap dogs and are nothing other than a spare wheel, a mudguard on this vehicle that is rolling roughshod over the public weal. The Acting Chairman should not nod his head; he is supposed to be independent when in the Chair.</P>

	<P>The great watchdogs have become lap dogs. What about Punchestown and all the other decisions? Of all the decisions taken by this <Col N="1164"/>Government that the Progressive Democrats are prepared to stand over, this is the shabbiest of the lot. If they are not prepared to stand up on this issue as they were in the matter of the disbursement of lotto funds, then they should throw in the towel and call it a day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not try to involve the Chair in any debate or be provocative.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was only a gentle attempt.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion. I thank Fine Gael for asking my party to support this motion which it does enthusiastically. Fine Gael and the Labour Party do not agree about everything and sometimes we disagree quite strongly, but it appears we have an instinctive sense of what is decent in politics that the biggest party in the State has lost. We would make mistakes if we were in Government; we would do things that perhaps many of us here in our different parties would not be too happy with. I am certain that neither Fine Gael nor the Labour Party would allow themselves to be pushed into this sort of smash and grab raid on money that does not really belong to the State. This is money which the State has expropriated. When one becomes involved in expropriation, one has a certain obligation to be honest, fair and transparent about it.</P>
    <P>When the Dormant Accounts Bill was going through the Houses of the Oireachtas, there was a fairly unanimous view that it was a timely Bill, that when the money was assembled it would be used for worthwhile causes as additional expenditure and that the method of disbursement would be independent and be seen to be independent. The only great question that arose was that nobody was quite sure how much money would be involved. There was a tendency, perhaps correctly, on the part of the Minister for Finance, to warn people that this might be a small sum of money because some of the figures quoted in the media were huge. Like the rest of us, he was a little sceptical about how much money people would leave in accounts. It then emerged that it was not such a tiny sum of money. Even after a few hours searching, I find it difficult to ascertain precisely how much money will ultimately be disbursed. One newspaper report states it could be as high as &euro;250 million. It seems certain that it is at least &euro;150 million and rising, as Senator Higgins stated.</P>
    <P>This sum of &euro;150 million obviously began to tempt Fianna F&aacute;il. As I have observed over the years, Fianna F&aacute;il has a couple of key characteristics. One is its inherent allergy or inherent tendency to be allergic to real transparency, as has been seen in the electronic voting debacle and as is evident in its deliberate filleting of the Freedom of Information Act. It also has a profound capacity to be allergic to real <Col N="1165"/>project appraisal, as has been seen in Punchestown, Abbotstown and many other projects. It has its pets and wants to spend money on them. However, Fianna F&aacute;il is not allergic to money and its disbursement. In this case it saw &euro;150 million on which it was not going to get its hands. When it was a trivial sum, in its eyes, it was quite prepared to be the advocate of accountability, transparency etc., but when it could make a difference it became different.</P>
    <P>Even as it does so, Fianna F&aacute;il tries to talk out both sides of its mouth. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was reported as saying the Government has to change the procedures because nobody realised how big the sum of money would be. The Committee of Public Accounts was invoked. Last week the Taoiseach stated that it was a very small amount of money and nobody should be making a fuss about it. The Taoiseach thinks it is a small sum of money, the Minister thinks it is a big sum of money and Fianna F&aacute;il grabs it and hopes the rest of us will not notice. We did notice and we will continue to notice.</P>
    <P>I have a couple of issues to raise with the Government. It has stated that it will continue to give the dormant accounts board an advisory role. As I heard that said, I thought of the human rights commission which also has an advisory role and which the Government has blissfully ignored on every single piece of advice it has offered. Advisory boards will be listened to and will be ignored and Fianna F&aacute;il will spend its slush fund as it wishes.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I am talking about Fianna F&aacute;il because something has happened in the past six months. I was first elected to this House 23 years ago and never had the misfortune to have to serve here under a majority Fianna F&aacute;il Government. In the past six months we have effectively seen a majority Fianna F&aacute;il Government with a collection of PD poodles who no longer know how to be different from Fianna F&aacute;il. It is the long spoon syndrome yet again. The PDs lost their long spoon some time around June 2002 and have been drawn into the Fianna F&aacute;il circle. We have a Fianna F&aacute;il Government with all the arrogance that we read about in those dreadful days 25 years ago when Fianna F&aacute;il was accountable to nobody. Now Fianna F&aacute;il is telling us that it knows what is good for all of us, that it will do it better than the board it set up. There is no rational reason for this except one &mdash; it is too big a sum of money for a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister to allow into anybody else&rsquo;s hands when it could make the difference in a variety of election contexts. The Government has announced that the money will not be disbursed before the local elections which I think means it has given up hope of doing well at the local and European elections and will hold on to it for the real one which will come two years later, the general election. I recall a Minister for Social Welfare <Col N="1166"/>who travelled the country with cheques in his pocket from a slush fund which he gave out as £1,000 here and £1,000 there. Fianna F&aacute;il knows how to give out money; it is what it is best at&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Making itself accountable for how it gives out money is what it does not like doing. The evidence is there in the amendment tabled by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke. I would love to see a PD name on this amendment but there is none. This is among one of the most fatuous amendments I have read from the Government side. The last line of the amendment states: &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes the commitment to publish lists of all successful programmes and projects&rdquo;. Are they not wonderful? Fianna F&aacute;il will tell the House what it does with the money. Its members will go around the country with their slush fund and apparently, except for the fact that they put it down here, they were not planning to tell anybody about it. Fianna F&aacute;il comes into the House with the brass neck to claim the credit for touting this money. Expenditure of this money will be announced several times and promises made to four places. Yet, when the election comes close, only one place will be chosen for funding. That is the Fianna F&aacute;il style.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two Bills to pass through this House in the next six months. The first is for electronic voting and the second is for this Fianna F&aacute;il slush fund. The Opposition will fight every comma of these Bills. Together they epitomise what is wrong with Fianna F&aacute;il and its majority Government which is oblivious to what anybody else thinks. Fianna F&aacute;il believes it owns the electoral system, other people&rsquo;s money, Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann, the State, the Civil Service and every semi-State body they will dispatch around the country. In the past, the capacity of the Opposition to shame Fianna F&aacute;il was the only obstacle to this attitude. Now the Opposition must alert public opinion to frighten the Fianna F&aacute;il Party as it cannot be shamed but only frightened. It lost its shame years ago.</P>

	<P>The Senator is a close student of this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The prospect of losing power, and the patronage that goes with it, is the only influence on Fianna F&aacute;il. If it is afraid that inept and sleazy disbursement of other people&rsquo;s money will bounce back and reverberate, then it might change its mind. However, Fianna F&aacute;il now knows its situation is so desperate. Up to 65% of the population has copped on to it and decided whoever its votes for the next time, it will not be for Fianna F&aacute;il. If Fianna F&aacute;il is aware that it is liable to lose more seats by the image of the slush <Col N="1167"/>fund than it can buy with it, then perhaps it can be persuaded to do what the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, so wisely tried to prevent them doing.</P>
    <P>Who knows Fianna F&aacute;il better than the Minister, Deputy McCreevy? He had 20 years of observing it as an outsider on the backbenches. He knows what Fianna F&aacute;il does with money and he summed it up better than the Opposition when he said that if Fianna F&aacute;il gets its hands on this money, it will turn it into a personal slush fund. We will not let them.</P>

    <P el="5" FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House. I also welcome the discussion on this topic because many red herrings have been raised about it in the last number of days. It is clear from the Opposition&rsquo;s contributions that it is so upset about this issue because there is a lack of validity to its argument. The reality is that the money is still there.</P>

	<P>The terms &ldquo;smash and grab&rdquo; and &ldquo;slush fund&rdquo; have been heard in the Chamber. I could understand this outcry if the Government <Col N="1168"/>had decided to move the moneys into the Exchequer and make it part of day to day budgeting.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition has awoken to the fact that it is not in Government and, therefore, not in a position to manage the economy. In recognising that it will not be in Government for a while, there is this outpouring of grief.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>My good colleague on the Labour benches has indicated that there is a necessity to introduce this Bill because Fianna F&aacute;il will lose so many seats in the local elections. I wonder if this is a recognition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator get the message from Clare that there was no room for him? He should stay in Dublin.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on the Opposition&rsquo;s part that its only opportunity is to rule by committee. It must be accepted that our system of government means that the Executive manages the economy.</P>

	<P>It was the same a year ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The dispersal of funds or the management of those functions are purely the function of the Government. While the Oireachtas and different agencies have a role, the Government is there to manage. While this situation is a change in the direction of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator means a U-turn.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it is a recognition of what needs to be done. It fits clearly into line with every other aspect of governmental management. I am delighted that this decision has been taken. Why does the Opposition want a different process for the dispersal of these funds?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Remember that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, wants one.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Far too much authority is delegated to State boards and agencies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>One was established for these funds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition will be aware that this is a catch-22 situation from its time in <Col N="1169"/>Government because it is damned if it does and damned if it does not. The Government will be blamed for the agencies&rsquo; decisions. It will be blamed if it interferes with what is set down in statute and regulation, such as an independent commission that might have the power to disperse funds. If the Government does not make a decision on advice coming from a State board, it is criticised. The Government has taken a difficult decision and, once and for all, it has taken full authority and stood over its decisions in an open and transparent way, as the amendment to the motion recognises. The legislation will also set that out clearly. It ensures that the Government is in a position to manage the economy well. It is putting its neck on the line and I congratulate it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals to retain the dormant accounts board as it is important that an outside body is prepared to advise the Government on its policy. It is advice as opposed to decision-making. The Government is the one in the position to make the decision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This is why we are debating this motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dooley without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>One Senator made the point that it was obvious the advice that would be given would be considered unimportant. I argue that the advice will be well-used and recognised by the Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the underlying objectives of the proposals that target persons with personal and educational difficulties and those who are socially disadvantaged. The principles behind the board&rsquo;s establishment in the first place are still there. The focus of where the funds will be dispersed is still part of the legislation. I want to see funds made available to tackle mobility issues in rural areas. The proposed legislation will focus on the RAPID and CL&Aacute;R areas which shows how all facets of Government policy have been included.</P>
    <P>The Opposition asserts that the board has been abolished. It has not and it will have an advisory role as it did in the past.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It was originally a statutory body. It is no more.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been sidelined.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true as it will be involved in the preparation of the plan. It will prioritise areas of funding and will assess the impact of the spending of the money.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That would happen regardless of what changes are made.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It will even help the Opposition in doing its job in assessing the spending of the <Col N="1170"/>funds. I am sure Opposition Members will come into the House, waving its report. The Government is helping the Opposition to do its job.</P>
    <P>The proposals on the governance and the organisational arrangements are important and will ensure enhanced accountability to the Oireachtas and the Committee of Public Accounts. It is important that the Committee of Public Accounts will have a scrutinising role and the Opposition generally holds the chair of the committee.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Dooley finding it hard to keep going?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am somewhat concerned that I will not get the chance to say everything I want. I am delighted with the commitment that the spend will be additional. The money is not coming back into central funds. It will not substitute for spending that is already there. It is an addition and while it is difficult for the Opposition to accept this, we will be in a position to resolve many of the problems arising among those who are disadvantaged. Scrutinising that will give the Opposition something to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure that many who had those accounts will be turning in their graves tonight.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be delighted to hear the Opposition&rsquo;s views on that. It will be a transparent and open process by which applications&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe a word of it. The Senator has had his say and it is full of ambiguity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The word &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; is a straightforward one and there is little ambiguity in its definition. I would be delighted to see the Opposition come forward to identify which of those groups should not have received the money as a result of the advertisements and applications. There will be great silence from the other side of the House when the lists are published and I doubt that anyone there will identify groups which should not have received money. We will leave it open.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it 8 June?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator knows the Government is prepared to stand on its record and does not take decisions for electoral benefit.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will not survive in Clare with that attitude.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>

	<P>I am delighted to commend the amendment to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator expecting a vacancy there soon?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We have heard the views of &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il on this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Now we will hear the comments of &Oacute;gra Fine Gael.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which are no different to those of the senior party. I remind Senator Dooley that his former colleague and Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, was once advised &ldquo;when pressed on this keep repeating the above&rdquo; and the Senator did a very good job of that in the last eight minutes. He told us that the principles are still in place. I am delighted to hear that but we are not interested in the principles, we want to know whether the money is still in place. That is the issue that has been hived off to the Executive that calls itself the Government. He also said that the new dormant funds board will remain. There will be a new board as a result of the Government&rsquo;s U-turn and it will be as effective as the old tea council in terms of making executive decisions about distributing the money. This is a very bad day&rsquo;s work.</P>
    <P>Last week I heard our spokesperson, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, filleting the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; because he had nowhere else to go. The Minister was brought up in Dublin 4 although one would not know that from listening to him now. He gave us CL&Aacute;R and was allegedly behind the RAPID programme for procurement of funds for disadvantaged urban communities. Very few funding initiatives have come forward for RAPID despite the fanfare with which the Taoiseach launched it before the last general election. We must get serious on this complete reversal of policy. It is a U-turn representing what Fianna F&aacute;il does best, taking unto itself public moneys, which exist to be spent on public projects, for its own procurement and pet projects within the economy. The Opposition intends to highlight that and to scrutinise the Government because we have heard no arguments in its favour from Senator Dooley or any of his colleagues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is only highlighting the fact that his party is not in Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They will not be able to put forward arguments for this reversal. The problem is that this came from a cross-party consensus. When the Committee of Public Accounts produced its excellent report following the DIRT inquiry its first recommendation was that this money should be obtained for disadvantaged <Col N="1172"/>communities to give them a boost. The Government accepted all the recommendations and put in place a scheme whereby they could be implemented. Why are we seeing a U-turn on this policy in the past two weeks?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is displaying his political inability.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not suit the political times of the party opposite which wants to take this money and decide where it goes. It will go to marginal constituencies in advance of the next general election, of that there is no doubt. Every Member of this House knows that the appalling abuse of public funds by Fianna F&aacute;il in advance of the last general election was the worst example ever of how public funds were used only for political purposes. The criteria were marginal seats, based solely on giving funds to constituencies where there was a marginal Fianna F&aacute;il seat or the possibility of a gain. That is the reality in the schools building programme and lotto dispersal and so it is true of the funds that will shortly become available under the dormant funds accounts. This is utterly regrettable given that the original proposal on this was a cross-party one.</P>
    <P>When the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 went through these Houses I argued here that we had an obligation to ring-fence moneys proceeding from crime for the communities worst affected by the scourge of crime and drugs. I regret that the Government to which I gave allegiance at the time did not do that but I believe there is an obligation on us to ring-fence any money that becomes available for these communities because we have a long way to go to make up funding to them for educational and social projects. Those communities have a long way to travel. I recently saw in my own constituency a drugs prevention group which has existed for the past ten years on very small sums of money. Now, after its ten-year review, it is asking for funding to come from the Government so that it can decide what it needs in its community. These are the people who make life and death decisions. The Government&rsquo;s recent decision on this fund smacks of the worst kind of political opportunism such as only the party opposite can devise.</P>
    <P>Before the last election we heard major announcements on RAPID but since then the funding has not been very rapid. There was a large cutback in the funding that should have been given to some of those communities and, in other cases, there has been a reversal of the very notion that those funds would be front-loaded to allow people to get on with their projects. This is an example of how money going into those communities could make a significant difference. When this legislation comes before the House after the local elections, we will fight it tooth and nail. It reverses the promises made following the <Col N="1173"/>first report of the Committee of Public Accounts, what the Minister for Finance told the House three years ago and this Government&rsquo;s commitments to the most disadvantaged and marginalised communities.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very happy to speak on this motion on behalf of the Government. There have been many inaccurate and mischievous reports regarding the proposed legislative change by the Government on the dormant accounts. It is extraordinary that some of that continues here this evening and people do not seem to be listening to the facts. I note the Opposition&rsquo;s glowing comments in praise of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I have never heard such glowing tributes and if he were here I am sure he would be almost embarrassed by the wonderful comments from the Opposition benches.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister for Finance agree with the speech of the Minister of State?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extraordinary how the Opposition is so complimentary towards the Minister for Finance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should tell us what he will do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This represents a real about turn.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is wasting time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to clarify a number of issues. When my Department began implementation of the Dormant Accounts Act, it was found that there were deficiencies in the arrangements in the Act for the spend of the dormant accounts money, including the size of the spend.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was not able to get his hands on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It would help the Senator if he listened.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should allow the Minister to respond.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>These related, in the main, to administration and accountability issues. Under the current legislation, there is no provision for any explicit organisational structure, chief executive officer or executive accountability. Instead, the law provides that a part-time chairman providing a few hours&rsquo; work a month on the dormant accounts should be accountable <Col N="1174"/>to the Committee of Public Accounts. Perhaps Members of both Houses slipped up when the original legislation was passed. We might have been carried away with the great idea and the benefits we could bestow without putting a structure in place, as is now clearly required. It is absolutely unfair and unrealistic to expect that a person who gives just a few hours a month to the board could be accountable for the spending of hundreds of millions of euro.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the Act allows the Minister to provide, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, some staff to the board to administer the spending of the dormant accounts fund. Currently, five staff are working in the dormant accounts secretariat. No one can reasonably expect this level of staff to administer a fund of the size now materialising.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should give the board more staff.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That can be done. The Senator should wait for the rest of my speech. In view of these administrative issues, it was apparent that two possible routes could be followed. One was to establish an independent agency with a large staff, chief executive officer, offices, etc, to administer the fund and the other was to use the existing mechanisms of State and accounting procedures, including Accounting Officers of different Departments, to ensure strict criteria for the application process, transparency and the evaluation of projects.</P>
    <P>The first approach would have led to an inordinate amount of the funds being dissipated on administration. Implicit in the second route, using existing agencies, was the requirement that Departments or their agencies would make proposals regarding disbursement of the funds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we get copies of the Minister&rsquo;s script?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The advantage of using the existing infrastructure of State to carry out the above work is that it means that much less of the money than otherwise would be the case will be spent on overheads and administration and that the benefit or the expertise of the whole State system will be available for the evaluation of projects. This would mean legal responsibility for decisions would ultimately lie with the relevant Minister and accounting responsibility with the relevant Accounting Officers. This is a much better arrangement from a governance, financial and accounting point of view.</P>
    <P>As originally enacted, the whole structure represented a time bomb waiting to explode. Within three or four years we would have been faced with a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General wondering how on earth we had set up a structure like this without proper financial control and governance arrangements. We are taking action now to avoid having such a <Col N="1175"/>hullabaloo in a few years&rsquo; time. It is not appropriate to spend that kind of money without having a proper system in place.</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>In considering the best arrangement and to <Miles com="ch"/>ensure that the commitments given by the Government on the fund will be maintained, it is proposed that the dormant <Miles com="ch"/>accounts board will be retained as part of the new Act. However, its role will be changed. Under the new Act, the dormant accounts board will draw up the dormant accounts plan. It is intended to retain the dormant accounts plan in its current format. The board has spent considerable time on that plan which was submitted to the Department some months ago. We made some small changes to copperfasten it and ensure the issues mentioned by Senator Brian Hayes were crystal clear so that the funds would not go to marginal constituencies, but to areas and constituencies with people living on the margins. This is what is being done and this is the reason the fund exists.</P>
    <P>The underlying objectives of the current legislation, which are to target persons who are personally, educationally or socially disadvantaged or have a disability, will be retained. The dormant accounts board will, in its future role, prepare future plans and advise annually on priority areas for disbursement. Furthermore, it will critically assess the additionality and impact of spend on a regular basis. This is of critical importance and arrangements will be put in place to ensure that spending under the dormant accounts board will be kept separate from the normal Estimates process so that this additionality can be verified, as we want. The proposed improved arrangements will lead to much better governance and will <Miles com="ch"/>secure and enhance the accountability to the Oireachtas and the Committee of Public <Miles com="ch"/>Accounts. It is also the intention to publish the list of all beneficiaries from the fund.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
    <P>I will now deal with comments made in recent days by politicians and the media. Last December, the Government announced that it intended to make&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On December 18, during the holidays.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>It was announced before I got my holidays.</P>

	<P>Some of us work through the holidays.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Last December, the Government announced that it intended to make modest changes to the way in which money from the dormant accounts fund would be disbursed. This announcement was made when the Houses were still in session. To my disappointment and despite my efforts to inform those in the media, the announcement was absolutely ignored by the media.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1176"/>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>

	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The changes represent a complete somersault.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Senator&rsquo;s opinion; I do not agree. The announcement was made in December and was totally ignored by the media until such time as the Opposition chose to cynically distort the facts.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s spin doctors failed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Even the press release from Deputy O&rsquo;Shea did not receive any publicity for about ten days. Some media people asked me for information and were satisfied with what I told them. While it got one or two small mentions, the matter was knocking around for weeks. The Government was absolutely clear until some media person picked up the term &ldquo;slush fund&rdquo; and suddenly people started running around like headless chickens. The information was in the public domain for weeks. It is nonsense to suggest that we suddenly made a decision last week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>What does that change?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The only thing it changes was that the information was known and was supplied in answers to parliamentary questions. Let us make up our own minds about matters and not just jump up and down in response to a newspaper headline. The information had been given to several Deputies. We knew it and everybody seemed happy. However, suddenly we got excited when we read it in a newspaper.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister definitely got excited.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to put a number of facts on the record. Disbursements are continuing under the current arrangements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will we have problems with the Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The disbursements will continue until the new legislation is passed. We had originally indicated that the board could allocate about &euro;30 million per year. It has about 300 applications and has allocated about &euro;2 million to about 20 groups thus far. Despite the comments in the media and from the Opposition, I can absolutely confirm that no decisions on disbursement will be made under the proposed legislation before the elections next June. We will have to see what happens when the legislation is <Col N="1177"/>passed, but nothing will happen very quickly. To suggest that this is a fund for the local elections is just cheap electioneering.</P>

If there was any doubt about this matter, why would the Government propose that the board be asked on a regular basis to monitor spending under a number of criteria, including adherence to the objectives of the plan, additionality and impact? There will be a double-lock system in place in disbursing these funds, representing recognition of the source of the money and the fact that the Government is underwriting 100% of these funds.</P>

	<P>There will be accountability to the dormant accounts board, in terms of its role under the proposed Act, and to the Oireachtas directly.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate in recent days, I wondered about the underlying objection of the media and some Opposition politicians to these changes. All of us who work in the State system, as employees or elected representatives, are subject to a stringent system of checks and balances in the distribution of money. These have been added to considerably in recent years. Ministers are also answerable on a week by week basis to the House. Departmental expenditure is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is also subject to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts. In this case, as a further check, the dormant accounts board will also analyse spending under the criteria mentioned above.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand some of the concerns being raised. This fund is designed to target people who are socially or educationally disadvantaged.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech was the most appalling and pathetic display of incompetence and justification of a case that was ever presented to the House. The Minister was named as the person with direct responsibility for this board and for the dormant accounts. The distrust in people&rsquo;s minds in the House as well as outside it stems from events that took place during the lifetime of the last Government. The former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, declared publicly that he had no function within the Department and the Taoiseach, as a gesture of goodwill, allowed him to create the CL&Aacute;R programme, whose functions were set out on paper. The reality is that if we are to judge the potential of a slush fund based <Col N="1181"/>on the record of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v as controller of CL&Aacute;R, it is no surprise there is distrust. The record speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>There is approximately &euro;175 million in the fund currently, but when dormant insurance policies and so on are taken into account there may be something in the region of &euro;500 million to disburse. That is of concern to many people. The record of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s efforts under the CL&Aacute;R programme in County Galway shows that he has provided, for example, footpaths to the doorways of individual supporters. He has provided roads and boreens to the homes of certain supporters. This is not hearsay &mdash; it is a matter of fact. We are now going to give him far more funds. I do not know what share he will give the Minister of State but in light of his record there will be little to spend on RAPID or the drugs task forces in Dublin and throughout the country. He will not lay a hand on the money if that Minister gets his hands on it first. He will have it allocated; he probably already has most of it allocated. That is the fear and concern as a result of past experience.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I challenge the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to come to the Seanad and justify what he has done with CL&Aacute;R funding. That will give a clear insight to the Minister of State, if he does not already have it, to the Government and to the public of what that man is capable of and, if he gets his hands on this massive amount of money, what he will do to his personal advantage in the internal conflict within the constituency of Galway West, a conflict he created.</P>
    <Miles com="cl" par="113"/><P>More recently, we discovered the Minister has taken responsibility for a new scheme. He has taken it from F&Aacute;S and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. He said he will take 150 jobs into his Department and take responsibility for payment under a scheme which he has not yet described. He has not said how one can apply to it. All he said was that if anybody wished to participate in the scheme, they must have a herd number. Nobody has heard anything since budget day about the Minister&rsquo;s intentions. In this dormant accounts fund he sees a means of getting funding for the scheme and I am suspicious of what he is capable of doing. The public, knowing what the Minister has done over the past couple of years, is equally suspicious. That is justifiable cause for putting this motion before the House.</P>
    <P>The motion is not put down in response to parliamentary questions in the Lower House. The motion is based on facts and on the fear of allowing the Government, in the person of the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and with the Minister of State carrying the can, to use this fund as a slush fund.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I tell the Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister of State explain why the independent board established <Col N="1182"/>by legislation is being sidelined and stifled in its endeavours? It has done good work and the record will show that. However, when the Minister discovered that he could not influence it in line with his preferences, he decided to move the goal posts and take the responsibility. The urgency with which the change is being made makes everybody suspicious that it is related to the run up to the elections and to shore up some of the difficult areas in the country.</P>
    <P>The people have had enough lies. They are waiting. They will not be bought off for the second time running. That is the reason it is so important that the <i>status quo</i> be maintained. An independent body would distribute the fund for many worthy purposes. That is the way it has been operated until now. We put this motion forward in support and recognition of the work it is doing. We have confidence in the board and its capacity to deliver funding fairly to where there is greatest need. The applications put forward by the various community bodies should simply state: &ldquo;We want money for this, assess our project and then our need and grant us accordingly&rdquo;. If there is any deviation from that, the public will know that the Minister and the Minister of State are doing something that was never intended.</P>
    <P>The board was established by legislation in 2002. Now that the Ministers are desperate for funds, they have decided to sideline it. They will give it an advisory role in the background and it will be allowed to make occasional recommendations of insignificance. That is what the Minister seeks. The Minister of State said &ldquo;it was found that there were deficiencies in the arrangements&rdquo;. That is not the case. There were obstructions to their plan. When they failed to get their hands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. There appears to be much rhetoric and hot air tonight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On the Government side.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Higgins was quite good at it too.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>He was honest, particularly about the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There were also some nice comments about my party and I heard them with <Col N="1183"/>interest. In the course of this debate, phrases such as <i>status quo</i> were used and it was suggested that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained. However, the <i>status quo</i> has changed.</P>
    <P>When this fund was established, people thought it would amount to approximately &euro;30 million. While I can understand the political concerns of the Opposition, we must bear in mind that governments are elected to govern and executives are appointed to administer. The arbitrary element that dictates that is the public. That is the reality. However, it is increasingly evident in this country that a paralysis of government is being brought about by minorities. That causes me concern.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has a right to raise issues of concern and to promote ideas. All Members will agree that the principle of applying this money to disadvantaged areas is correct. It is putting the money to good use. Previous speakers have highlighted where the money should go. Disbursement should be among the people affected by economic and social disadvantage, those affected by educational disadvantage and people with disabilities. The figure of &euro;30 million that was initially anticipated is now projected to be between &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million. We cannot have a situation where an independent body comes into competition with the Government of the day with regard to the delivery of services. The Government is responsible for the delivery of services and we do not want communities to fall between two stools in the context of who should provide a service or funding for a project.</P>
    <P>Speakers have referred to comments made by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, when the legislation was being debated, that there was an onus to have transparency and accountability and that it would not be perceived as a slush fund for pet projects of Ministers. That is fair and reasonable. I believe that should remain the overriding principle.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the legislation has not yet come before the Houses. Hopefully, this debate will have an impact on the legislation which comes forward. Given the change in the anticipated figures for distribution, we should consider allowing the <i>status quo</i> remain for the &euro;30 million initially anticipated and placing all moneys in excess of that in the Exchequer for distribution, under the same principle and among Departments which would target the areas identified in the initial criteria. The adoption of this approach would recognise the initial principle under which the scheme was set up but would equally acknowledge that the goalposts have changed. They did not change by political will but because the amount of money now available for distribution has far exceeded what was initially anticipated.</P><Col N="1184"/>
    <P>If one removes the political rancour and point scoring, there is merit in both sides of the argument. There are moneys to be distributed and it is important those moneys reach the target groups and communities identified by the various guidelines set out initially and that they are used for the betterment of those people. There is merit in the fact the Government now needs to re-examine the matter, given the change in the amount of money available. Notwithstanding that, I emphasise that we should not arbitrarily abolish the initial idea.</P>
    <P>We can look at both sides of the coin. We can allow the initial &euro;30 million to be administered and distributed as initially set out. However, if we want growth from the growing amount of money, it would not be reasonable to have an independent body compete with a Department to provide a service to the community. We need a proper cohesive effort to ensure the community benefits in the way initially intended.</P>
    <P>I support the Government amendment while anticipating the legislation coming before the Houses will be debated fully. I ask the Minister to consider the compromise I suggest of allowing the initial &euro;30 million to be distributed as set out and of applying the legislation to the moneys in excess of that amount.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I came to the Chamber with an open mind on this issue because I have a fairly long memory of what happens with such matters. Inevitably, whoever is in Opposition picks up these issues, hits the Government with them and then when in Government behaves just like the criticised Government, and <i>vice versa.</i> However, listening to Senator Minihan I became convinced that this side of the House is correct.</P>
    <P>There are serious flaws in the arguments being made by the Government side of the House. The arguments are utterly inconsistent with behaviour and speeches made previously. The principal argument is that the fund has reached such a size that it cannot be left to people who are independent of Government. Have those on the Government benches never heard of the State agency F&Aacute;S which has a budget of &euro;2 billion a year? Do they know about the IDA, Enterprise Ireland or any other bodies which administer grants at their own discretion? Those bodies are trusted, rightly or wrongly, and some of us might be critical of the manner in which they distribute their funds. They do so without too much Government interference although some pressure has been apparent.</P>
    <P>This particular fund appears to me to compete, not with the Government but with the national lottery. Members may remember the setting up of the national lottery, which incidentally reported figures today. At the time we got similar assurances that the national lottery funds would be ring-fenced and not interfered with by politicians and that money would be granted to <Col N="1185"/>specific projects, originally just sport. The funds grew, rather like this, beyond all expectations and party politicians and Governments of both views got their paws up front as fast as they could. Immediately, the original purpose of the national lottery fund was diluted and the moneys were distributed, and have been since, for the advantage of politicians in certain areas, depending on who is in power. That is what has happened.</P>
    <P>This fund will be somewhat smaller, although at &euro;400 million I agree with the Government that it is quite large. I remind it, however, that just a few months ago in this House Senator Mansergh described &euro;380 million as a pittance. I do not know whether &euro;400 million is a pittance or a very large sum as one day it seems a large sum and a pittance another day. It all depends on which arm of the Government is speaking on which day and on which issue.</P>
    <P>It is not particularly easy to listen to the admonishments of the Opposition because it did not do much with regard to the abuses of the national lottery funds when in power. It appears to be a regrettable feature of Irish political life that when politicians see a lot of loot they go for it. I am not suggesting any corruption in the matter, contrary to what I think the Minister of State indicated in his final paragraph. What I do suggest is that politicians find it impossible to resist an amount of money because they want to be seen as the people who distribute it, which is natural. However, it is our job to try and stop this happening.</P>
    <P>There is no problem about &euro;400 million being distributed by independent people. I suggest that the people who distribute it will have less reason to benefit if they are seriously independent than politicians. The Minister realises this. I was a member of a political party for a while where I saw the mechanism of how grants and moneys were administered. It is quite obvious that this money is good news. There is no downside to approximately &euro;400 million to give away. Politicians want to be the people giving it away and to benefit by eventually getting the votes of the recipients. The Minister and those on the Government side of the House want to be the people who make the announcements. Before my unhappy departure from Fine Gael, I used to get notes from various Ministers telling me something was going to happen in my area &mdash; usually money being allocated &mdash; on a certain date. The message was for my eyes only and I was to announce it in order to get the credit for allocating taxpayers&rsquo; money. This has been happening since the foundation of the State. I no longer get the notes but I expect it still happens.</P>
    <P>Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Deputies, Senators and councillors will get wind of where this money will go first and will go to the constituencies to announce it. This will be another opportunity for this sort of time <Col N="1186"/>honoured abuse. Why can we not leave this be and say thank God, is this not wonderful, we have &euro;400 million for disabled people and those with other disadvantages? I do not understand why we cannot commit ourselves to getting people who are not seen to be overtly political to distribute such moneys.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister&rsquo;s speech and, as far as I can see, his reason is that it would not be fair to ask the board&rsquo;s representatives to go before the Committee of Public Accounts. I am open to correction and I apologise if I read it wrongly. Why not? What is wrong with it? They would not have much explaining to do. All they would have to do is say why they gave money to people. Why are politicians any better at doing that than people who have no axes to grind and nothing to benefit from it? They cannot be any better at it and they can be a lot worse.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern. In many ways the legislation is testament to the successful career of the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, since he was Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs. At that time he introduced many measures that helped people in the Gaeltacht. I often looked across with envy from my base in east Galway at some of the benefits of those schemes.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to the fact that, as Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v introduced other initiatives outside of Gaeltacht areas, particularly the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID programmes which have been a great success. The CL&Aacute;R programme highlighted the plight of rural areas where there has been a reduction in population. Measures had to be taken to help such communities.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition speakers appeared to knock these initiatives, but the RAPID programme, in particular, has helped in the provision of community employment schemes and the appointment of more than 80 educational welfare officers in some of the major towns throughout the country. As I indicated recently, they will shortly be appointed in Ballinasloe and Tuam.</P>
    <P>The programme has also been useful in getting top-ups and grants from the sports capital fund <Col N="1187"/>under the national lottery. We should not knock those schemes and give credit where it is due to the initiatives under the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID programmes. As the Minister of State said, drugs task forces also come within the remit of the proposed amending legislation on the dormant accounts fund.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that we are retaining the disbursements board. At present it has nine members, including the chairman, Conleth Bradley, a barrister, people from the disability area such as Seamus Thompson, CEO of the Irish Wheelchair Association, Gerry Ryan, former general secretary of the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland from the educational disadvantage committee, and David Brennan from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. These people are in a good position to help us target people with disabilities and those who are disadvantaged educationally, socially or personally. While we might score points in other areas we are all agreed on this important issue.</P>
    <P>Speakers have referred to new boards being set up and I agree with the points made in that regard. I have argued both here and in the D&aacute;il on the difficulty we have in trying to question Ministers. I had this problem a few weeks ago in regard to the closure of a post office. Senator Ulick Burke and I were not successful in raising that issue. If a Minister were in charge of post offices a new post office owner could have been given at least six months to see if he or she would be able to improve the business in order to save it.</P>
    <P>Although some boards have been successful I share the concerns of Senators about how to deal with a fund when it becomes larger than anticipated. Senator Ross referred to the national lottery where it was difficult to foresee the amount of money this fund would generate. Perhaps the dormant accounts fund will also increase in a similar way.</P>
    <P>As I understand it we have a disbursement plan and we intend retaining the board. Area Development Management Limited will manage applications for assistance from the fund. All those things are in place and it is now a matter of trying to put the pieces together and ensure this funding is provided for people who are disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Disadvantage is not a new concept. We struggled for years in the west of Ireland trying to get funding from Europe. All political parties tried to resolve that issue when in Government. While we made slow progress we succeeded to some extent. South Galway was left out for many years and a great deal of politics revolved around issues of pre-election announcements.</P>
    <P>I reject the charges made against the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v. In fairness to him, any project he brought forward was done with the aim of helping <Col N="1188"/>people in disadvantaged areas. As I said, he was successful in the Gaeltacht areas. Last year he was criticised when the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant was abolished other than in Gaeltacht areas. There are reasons certain benefits go to a Gaeltacht area that do not apply to the rest of the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>That is discrimination.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Other problems exist in the Gaeltacht in regard to planning. Not everybody in these areas is involved in tourism. Although I do not live in a Gaeltacht area, I welcome the benefits that pertain there. I am interested in these areas and see the benefit of certain schemes. One has to be clear on the supports required in areas of disadvantage and try to get funds to that area.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the proposed legislation. The debate has been useful in terms of raising certain issues and alluding to some of the pitfalls that may exist. When the legislation comes before the House we will get a clearer picture of how moneys from the dormant accounts fund will be decided and where it will go. Above all, let us make sure that it goes to people in disadvantaged areas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to support the motion on the dormant accounts fund and refer to the manner in which the Government is turning it into a political slush fund. I listened to the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech and want to pick up on two elements. He justified the Government&rsquo;s decision to fundamentally alter the terms of the fund and completely change the nature of the board and how the funds are dispersed. The Minister of State talked about the need for accountability and transparency. He said there were two routes that could be followed to deal with what he termed an unfair and unrealistic expectation on one person, the part-time chairman, to give a few hours to the board every month and the five staff working in the dormant accounts secretariat. Let us accept this is the case and there is a need for reform. One of the routes the Minister of State suggested was the establishment of an independent agency with a large staff and CEO etc. He said this &ldquo;would have led to an inordinate amount of the funds being dissipated on administration&rdquo;. As it is too expensive to establish an agency that would give full accountability, be independent of the Government and could have public trust, the Government chose the second route.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting if one were to take this logic and apply it across the board regarding the disbursement of all Government funds. The Minister of State has just undermined the establishment in legislation of a huge number of boards that have been set up to administer funds in an open, transparent and accountable manner. It would be worth spending money on the proper administration, if the Minister of State says it is <Col N="1189"/>required, so there might be public trust. This is not the Government&rsquo;s money but the public&rsquo;s money which has been sitting in dormant accounts. All parties agree it should be used for special needs groups and disadvantaged groups etc., as was envisaged in the original legislation.</P>
    <P>How the fund is administered is hugely important. While it is not its money, the Government is acting as though it is. It is like money from the lottery. The Government grabs it, spends it on its pet projects, ensures its friends are supported and this is conveniently done a few weeks before election time. That is how the public sees this is happening and it is how it sees the disbursement of lottery funds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>What aspect is the Senator referring to?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about public perception.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should stop spreading and creating it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to this in a roundabout way at the end of his speech. He referred to the fear that politicians exercising decision-making powers might get thanks for spending money properly and wisely. He said that some people have placed an emphasis on an independent board and that it would make better decisions than those elected by the people. The Minister of State continued, &ldquo;The logical inference of this is that those people believe that politicians are more venal and dishonest as a class of people than non-elected people.&rdquo; I have news for him: more and more people think this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>We are giving credence to it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we should stop, gather our thoughts and stop spreading that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>This kind of action only leads more people to believe that politicians are only concerned about making decisions for their friends and for themselves. I am appalled at the extent of this. In recent meetings with people that I had never met before, they automatically assumed I was a particular kind of person once they heard I was a politician. Until recently, I did not believe this was rampant. The general view of politicians is that we are low life and cannot be trusted with decision-making.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not true; only a small percentage of people think this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Did Senator Feeney see the recent polls?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true. A growing number of people think this and one will find this around <Col N="1190"/>the issue of electronic voting. The Government is not trusted to bring in the proposed system. The Government had better face up to this because it is true. The changes proposed to the dormant accounts fund only adds to this perception.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that the Government has so insulated itself from the views of the people that it can no longer see this. This is what happens when a Government sits in power for seven years and becomes so arrogant that it can no longer hear the people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I could give the Senator a lecture on how to keep in touch with the people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>The day will come when the Government has to listen.</P>
    <P>Trust is at the heart of this. It is not surprising as the Government lied to get elected and totally undermined the trust the electorate may have had in it. The Government is not trusted with decision-making with the result that the whole political system is so damaged and undermined that I wonder if it will ever recover.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to reconsider this issue. The legislation has not been passed and therefore it is not too late. The board should be given more support if it needs it. Nobody would object to this. The Minister of State should not peddle the pathetic argument about how much it will cost. It costs money to run health boards, hospitals and schools.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator wants more of them. Have we not learned the lesson about setting up more bureaucracy?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>This should be done with value for money in mind and with a sense of public service&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we are trying to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>This money does not belong to the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I enjoyed listening to what he had to say. I am delighted to support the Government amendment to this motion. There is much hysteria and confusion among the Opposition. It does not want to listen, it only wants to shout and roar back. As the Minister said, this was in the public domain and nobody took any notice of it until the media ran with it and started using provocative terms such as &ldquo;slush fund&rdquo;. All of a sudden, the Opposition ignited; it was like turning on an engine. It is sad that this is the only kind of opposition that is offered. The media gives the Opposition a little prompt and everyone in it starts jumping up and down. I listened to Senator O&rsquo;Meara wondering where it will end and if we can save any of it. Are Democratic Left and Labour to be the saviours of the world or are they <Col N="1191"/>only going to try to save Ireland? It will be a sorry day for Ireland if that is what we have to look forward to.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the dormant accounts fund was a wonderful initiative by the previous Government. The Dormant Accounts Act 2001 and the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003 underpinned this. These important Acts allow for the transfer of moneys from these unused accounts and unclaimed policies into a special dormant accounts fund. The fund is designed to target persons that are personally, educationally and socially disadvantaged, or have a disability. How the fund is administered is important. However, given this is going to be transparent, I do not see why the Opposition is getting upset.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs looks after CL&Aacute;R, RAPID and drugs task forces. His Department has the expertise to pinpoint where disadvantage exists. It makes sense that a Ministry such as this should look after it. I would go so far as to say to the members of Fine Gael who tabled the motion that, if recommendations come from the commission, or the board as it will be, I am sure they will be known publicly. At the same time if, as the Opposition claims, the Minister repeatedly ignores the recommendations of the commission, giving money, as Senator O&rsquo;Meara says, to the Government&rsquo;s friends or spending it in places where it benefits those on the Government side, surely to God that will also be known. The requisite level of transparency is there, and there is no need to worry.</P>
    <P>It is a wonderful initiative, and we will see approximately &euro;160 million spent. Areas such as economic and social disadvantage will have 40% of that funding &mdash; projects such as those which we know in the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID programmes &mdash; and 25% of the funding will go towards breaking down other barriers, such as those affecting the educationally disadvantaged. I have looked at the matter inside out and upside down, and I cannot for the life of me see what is the concern. The Senators could make better use of their Private Members&rsquo; time than in having a go at something there is no need to attack.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to many of the contributions. I return to what Senator Higgins said originally. It is remarkable that Opposition politicians are being accused of using the term &ldquo;slush fund&rdquo;, since the expression emanated from the Committee of Public Accounts and the great work of the late Jim Mitchell. It was flagged at the time regarding dormant accounts. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, perhaps in one of his more enlightened moods, first used the term. He said that the legislation had been enacted in that way to prevent the Government having access to a slush fund that Ministers would <Col N="1192"/>use to favour pet projects. In view of this, the Fianna F&aacute;il Members should not criticise the Opposition for saying what the Minister for Finance said originally.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to lottery funding and what has happened to it. A weighting factor was supposed to have been introduced, with various points awarded depending on the project. From experience &mdash; not sour grapes or anything of that sort &mdash; I can say that largesse was poured into my constituency, which was marginal before the last election. In the final two weeks before polling day it was applied generously, whether by the Department of Health and Children or the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State asks us to believe his statement that it is unfair and unrealistic to expect that a person who serves on a board for just a few hours a month could be accountable for the spending of hundreds of millions of euro. He should catch himself on. He said that he had announced changes in December. Possibly it was late December, and possibly when we were in recess. Does it matter? He is disappointed that the newspapers did not pick up on it. The Minister of State is very good at spin-doctoring; if he wanted it picked up on, that would happen. The point is this is the document that we received this week from Comhairle, which does very good work. It is dated February 2004. It is a pity that the Minister of State did not even tell Comhairle that he was making changes, because the document states &ldquo;The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board is a statutory body which is responsible for disbursing the money from the fund.&rdquo; The word used is &ldquo;statutory&rdquo;. This comes from an organisation that I would trust much more than the Minister of State, who refers to a part-time chairman disbursing funds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government should know.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister of State will give me a chance I will explain. The truth hurts. The document also states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Applications are invited for funding in accordance with the criteria set out in the disbursement plan. Applications may be submitted at any time. Area Development Management Limited (ADM) [which is familiar to many of us] is administering the funding process.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It goes on to state &ldquo;ADM assesses the applications and makes recommendations to the Board. The Board then makes the decisions on who gets funding.&rdquo; The Minister of State has tried to spin the impression in a long speech that the board could not do the job properly and that the amount of money was too great for it to cope with. At present there is &euro;185 million in the fund, which will be dispensed. I am sure that shortly, when the insurance aspect arises in April 2004, this largesse will increase dramatically.</P><Col N="1193"/>
    <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Meara, although Senator Feeney disagrees about politicians being distrusted, since I saw her shaking her head. Such changes as these maintain the level of distrust. People are liable to talk about various polls asking whom one trusts most &mdash; journalists or politicians. We are far down the pecking order. When the Government makes changes such as this, it lends credence to that, since everyone knows that it wants to get its grubby hands on this money.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross is correct. I can assure Senators that, if there was good news for any project in west Limerick I would be the last to know, even if I were making representations on its behalf. Other Oireachtas representatives in west Limerick will know long before me what will happen with the money when it is dispensed. When it came to lottery funds before the election, they could telephone the different project promoters and say that the money was there. In the case of one project it was &euro;500,000, and in the others &euro;100,000 or &euro;50,000. It did not matter that I was making representations to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. One might say that is politics, and I accept that, but in this case we are talking about more funding again.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts is to be lauded for suggesting the establishment of this fund. At the time, the Minister for Finance said that he would establish a statutory board. Why can its members not be allowed to administer the money? Reading this document gave me a great appreciation of what the dormant accounts fund was about.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Committee of Public Accounts not recommend a structure?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>For God&rsquo;s sake, the Minister of State should catch himself on. He is trying to defend the indefensible.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The document dated February 2004 was logical and sensible. It is a pity the Minister of State did not tell them about his plans. He said he was disappointed the press did <Col N="1194"/>not pick up on it, but he could not even tell Comhairle what he was doing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It was to be referred to an agency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane should address the motion without interruption. He has one minute.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not even need the extra minute. I have made my point. This is being used as a slush fund by the present Administration to dispense largesse when it is favourable and convenient to it. It is a retrograde step, and the body politic will suffer for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not rehash the arguments in this debate except to say that I too have grave concerns at the reported changes in the distribution of dormant bank account funds. The money is there because people have passed away. It does not belong to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to share out among Fianna F&aacute;il projects. It belongs to the taxpayers and everyone in the country to benefit from the projects.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State mentioned ADM, I immediately thought of the taxi hardship panel and its role in that. It effectively overruled an all-party transport committee when it recommended that changes be made. We saw how the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, got his way with ADM in compensating taxi drivers. There are issues still to be resolved.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise for being a little parochial. As the Minister of State may be aware, three applications for funding under the dormant accounts fund have been submitted by the Carlow regional youth service. I wrote to the Minister recently to explain that, unfortunately, Carlow town is a RAPID area due to its drug problem which has become so bad that people are injecting drugs into their eyeballs because they cannot locate a vein in other parts of their bodies. We also had recent cases of drug dealers giving themselves up at a local Garda station because they were terrified of their customers who were going berserk searching for their next supply of drugs. This is the reality in Carlow town.</P>
    <P>The success achieved in stopping the so-called Westies gang from operating in Dublin has unfortunately resulted in the problem spilling into Carlow and other towns within a similar radius of Dublin, such as Tullamore. We, in Carlow, are bearing the brunt of the problem. It is for this reason that I ask the Minister, when disbursing the dormant accounts fund, to consider carefully the three applications by the Carlow regional youth service. These are for a youth worker for the Greycullen area, which is a RAPID area, a support worker for secondary schools in Carlow &mdash; four or five schools in the town have expressed a willingness to get involved in this scheme &mdash; and, most important, for the <Col N="1195"/>redevelopment of the town&rsquo;s old library for youth facilities, for which approximately &euro;1 million is being sought.</P>
    <P>The applicants have been messed around in recent times to the extent that the local authority, which offered to transfer the old library building to the youth service free of charge, is now seriously considering withdrawing the offer because the organisation has not used the buildings. I urge the Minister to look favourably on these excellent projects, which I hope will contribute to alleviating the drug problem in Carlow. The reason the dormant accounts fund was established in the first place was to assist these kinds of initiatives. Senator John Phelan has indicated he would like to make a contribution on this topic. May I share time with him?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my constituency colleague for his generosity in sharing his time. I am delighted to have an opportunity to support the motion tabled jointly by the Fine Gael and Labour parties on the dormant accounts fund. I noted a number of excellent contributions to the debate, particularly from the Opposition side. I was struck, in particular, by the comments of Senator Ross when he affirmed his support for the motion and outlined his concerns. Having listened to the Minister of State and all the speakers on the Government side, I am not convinced in any way, shape or form that the proposed change is necessary. Nothing the Government side stated indicated any requirement to change the structure of the dormant accounts fund, as it was envisaged several months ago, in the manner described.</P>
    <P>I was shocked to learn of the proposed changes in the past week or thereabouts. Perhaps the Minister of State lives in cloud cuckoo land, one in which Ministers do not use funds for political benefits. This practice has taken place in County Kilkenny, from where I come, and I heard other speakers outline other instances of it.</P>
    <P>Several speakers referred to the schools building programme. Before the previous general election, a number of schools in Kilkenny were given definitive commitments by the two Fianna F&aacute;il Party Deputies in Carlow-Kilkenny that new buildings would be constructed in the near future. The principal of one school, through its students, asked parents to support the local Fianna F&aacute;il Party Deputy in the election because he would deliver a new school building but, lo and behold, once the election results were announced and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was returned to power with its poodles in the Progressive Democrats Party, nothing more was heard about the schools promised before the election.</P><Col N="1196"/>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago, I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education and Science about Wandesford Church of Ireland national school in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, which is another of the schools promised a new building several times in recent years only to discover that there is no prospect of it materialising for a long time.</P>
    <P>I see no cogent case in the Government&rsquo;s argument for removing from the independent body the final decision making power as to where these funds should be allocated. We are now seeing the establishment of another political slush fund for the Government and it should not be accepted. It is the task of the House and other bodies to ensure we do not accept this kind of practice, which most non-political people believed was a legacy of the past of which they would see no more in the future. By all indications, particularly the amendment before us, the common saying that a leopard never changes its spots certainly applies to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. I urge the House to support the motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to speaker after speaker on the Government side attempt in vain to defend what is an indefensible plundering of funds which do not belong to the Government or taxpayers, but to private individuals who, for some reason, have not activated bank accounts or building society accounts or have not accessed insurance policies they should have drawn down. I note, in particular, that the amendment is tabled in the name of the Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, who has been noticeable by her absence during the debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>All Government amendments are tabled in the name of the Leader.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>One wonders whether again her views on this matter, the disbursement of funds, diverge from those of her colleagues. She probably regards it in her conscience as totally unjustified.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify the position, Government amendments are always published in the Leader&rsquo;s name.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but one would imagine that if an amendment is published in a person&rsquo;s name, he or she would have the courage of his or her convictions to come into the House and defend it, particularly if it has been tabled by the party to which he or she belongs and is part and parcel of its policy.</P>
    <P>I listened to the defence of the proposal mounted by Senator Dooley who was sent in first to punch on behalf of the Government. The word &ldquo;punch&rdquo; is an overstatement because he did not punch at all. He stated that the Executive manages the economy and that far too much <Col N="1197"/>power is vested in agencies and semi-State bodies, but did not advance a single cogent argument in defence of the Government&rsquo;s actions. I wonder who sent him into the House.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister of State indicate that deficiencies were discovered with regard to the disbursement of funds. The only deficiency in this regard is that the Government could not get its hands on the fund, failed to anticipate its enormity and now wants to disburse it. The Minister of State stated, for example, in an odd form of acknowledgement, that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, slipped up when introducing the legislation. I read the Minister&rsquo;s Second Stage speech and summation in the D&aacute;il on 20 June 2001, when he was at pains to point out that his officials and the officials of the Office of the Attorney General had done tremendous work in laboriously going through all the possible infringements of the rights of the public as regards access to money and the State&rsquo;s right, in certain circumstances, to access money belonging to the public. It was, he stated, only after the officials had gone through the legislation line by line and dotted the i&rsquo;s and crossed the t&rsquo;s that they decided to introduce it. Where were the deficiencies to which the Minister of State referred at that point? The only deficiency is that the Government has discovered there is a bonanza waiting to be tapped and it cannot countenance the possibility of any independent agency having access to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to a recent meeting he had with the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board and stated it only has five staff. The easy way to redress that problem would be to transfer staff from Departments and provide the fund with additional resources, instead of making a decision to sideline the new disbursements board by replacing it with ADM. The composition of the board was seen as manifestly suitable when the Minister appointed it. It was composed of one representative of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; one representative of the financial services industry nominated by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority; three persons with knowledge and experience of the sectors that would benefit from the fund, that is, from the voluntary community sector, the disability sector and the education sector; and three nominees of the Minister, including the chief executive of a disability organisation. The Minister had the power to appoint four board members. That simply was not good enough. It could not guarantee that the money would not be dispensed as a political favour in the context of pet projects identified by the Government. Now the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is proposing to give the Government responsibility for appointing the <Col N="1198"/>chairperson and the board of directors of ADM and has asked that the existing ADM members stand aside. What neck, gall and arrogance. This is in order to allow the Government to stuff the board with its own political cronies in order to decide where the money should go. That is an absolute disgrace.</P>
   
    <P>I was very interested in the PDs&rsquo; suggestion that the <i>status quo</i> should remain for the &euro;30 million that is about to be disbursed &mdash; what a sop that is &mdash; and that the proposal should go ahead. That is a typical PD out. It is a way out because the PDs do not have the gall, the guts, the conviction or the political determination to stand up to what is manifestly a travesty of justice in the disbursement of these funds.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>What I cannot understand about the PDs is that once they showed bottle. They showed bottle in regard to Abbotstown, the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo;. They showed bottle regarding the disbursement of lottery funds. They insisted on legislation being introduced to ensure that the disbursement of lottery funds would at lease have some fragment of transparency to them. Here there is a fundamental wrong, an indefensible situation, a<i> volte-face </i>by the Government, and the PDs are prepared to jog along with it. I know from the comments of Senator Minihan that he has a problem with this. If he has a problem why does he not take the ultimate action and go to his party leader, the T&aacute;naiste, who is second-in-command in the Government, and tell her the PDs cannot countenance this and will not agree to it and that the Government will simply have to reverse the throttle? The PDs have lost all their backbone. They are what we always believed, a microcosm of Fianna F&aacute;il, and they should go back to their roots.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>In supporting this amendment one has to say the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his Ministers of State are making many contradictory statements on the issue. Last week the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, made the best case for verification when he stated that he feared that the accompanying paper ballot trail could yield a different result to the electronic one. This is a serious fact. Many people are quite annoyed about it. Last night on the radio another Minister of State said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This is legislation which we do not want to see adopted in its present flawed state. The Minister and his Ministers of State are running around like headless chickens on this issue.

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not happy with this matter as it is. At this late stage the Government should withdraw the introduction of e-voting in the interest of confidence in the system. While I accept that electronic voting represents the way forward, it should not be introduced now. The European and local elections will take place in 14 weeks and I do not believe it will be possible to train a staff of approximately 15,000 in that time. We may have difficulty in getting staff to man the polling stations throughout the country. I ask the Minister of State to advise the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to postpone the introduction of e-voting until after the local and European elections to allow time for testing in the interests of the people. People are fed up and their confidence has been undermined. This matter is the topic of almost every radio and television show in the past fortnight and particularly in the past week.</P>
    <P>As the Cathaoirleach was told this morning, Members on this side of the House may take the matter further and ask the President not to sign the Bill into law.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>A Chathaoirligh, I know you have given us very clear guidelines. However, perhaps you will be somewhat tolerant and give me a minute to answer the point. I did not think I would have to take the opportunity to advise Senator Bannon on the different mixes. Voting electronically will differ somewhat from voting with the traditional ballot paper as that method depends on the mix and the particular bundle selected. There are no headless chickens as far as that matter is concerned. This is a fact that cannot be disputed. Senator Brady made reference to the Fine Gael suggestion of Internet voting. Is Senator Bannon saying that the ideal solution is to use the Internet, which can be hacked as opposed to a machine that has been developed and designed specifically for that purpose alone? I rest my case.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I have deviated. Sometimes it is difficult not to respond to some questions raised by Senators. In response to amendments Nos. 1 and 7, as I said on Committee Stage, the Parliamentary Counsel and the office of the Attorney General, who are the Government&rsquo;s advisers in the drafting of legislation have advised me that this amendment is unnecessary.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment would add definitions to section 1 of the Bill. These amendments are unnecessary as the Minister is defined in section 2 of the Electoral Act 1992 and in section 2 of the 1997 Act, which is being amended. The proposed addition of &ldquo;the Electoral Act 1992&rdquo; is linked to amendment No. 5. As I indicated last week on Committee Stage when discussing the other amendment, I understand the reasoning behind the amendment as it is a matter that is discussed by candidates and elected representatives coming up to an election. There is no perfect solution. However, my advice is that this amendment is not necessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 not moved.</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P><Col N="1206"/>
    <P LI="1">In page 3, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">2.&mdash;Section 6 of the Act of 1997 is amended&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) in subsections (1)(<i>b</i>) and (2) by the deletion of &ldquo;statutory declaration&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of &ldquo;statement pursuant to this section&rdquo;;</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) in subsection (2) by the deletion of &ldquo;said declaration&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of &ldquo;said statement&rdquo;;</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (4):</P>
    <P LI="4">&ldquo;(5) A person who furnishes a statement pursuant to this section which is false or misleading in a material particular shall be guilty of an offence and on summary conviction shall be liable to a fine of not more than &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for a period of not more than 12 months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P FLI="0">I know the Minister addressed this matter in his response on Committee Stage. Under section 6 a European national who wants to be on the register in Ireland has to furnish a statutory declaration. For example, he or she must go to a solicitor to confirm that he or she is not in a position to vote abroad. This is extremely inconvenient and goes beyond the European Union directive, which merely requires a formal statement to that effect. My amendment allows for a more convenient form of statement pursuant to the subsection, which would not need to be witnessed by a solicitor and could be incorporated. It reduces the burden of responsibility on the person in question and reflects the reality of the European directive in a more reasonable way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. I support Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s amendment. Earlier I referred to a similar matter. Independent candidates must round up &mdash; if that is the correct term &mdash; up to 30 people to sign a declaration before they can be nominated. This issue needs to be addressed urgently. We live in a democratic State. Those not representing a party are entitled to stand for Parliament and the Minister should introduce legislation to ensure this provision does not apply in future. The Constitution requires that all our citizens be treated equally. There is no evidence of equality when such candidates have to submit 30 signatures to a returning officer prior to nomination.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said on Committee Stage, this amendment is unnecessary. I refer to the EU directive that defines the requirements in this area. It specifies that resident EU citizens wishing <Col N="1207"/>to vote in their member state of residence must certify their nationality, address and any other details as are required on the form. They must do this by way of formal declaration which, if inaccurate, makes the person concerned liable to penalties in accordance with the national law applicable. I recognise that the Senator&rsquo;s amendment makes it very clear there should be a fine in the event of a person providing the wrong information. We have agreed on the penalties.</P>
    <P>We have had such a formal declaration for 66 years following the enactment of the Statutory Declarations Act. I see no point in deleting and duplicating in electoral law a system that operates satisfactorily. This procedure has been used extensively since then in all types of legislation. Electoral law already provides for such declarations to remove any doubt in the case of registering individuals as electors.</P>
    <P>When I first read this, prior to Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, and saw the term &ldquo;formal declaration&rdquo;, I presumed immediately as do many Senators that it would require a declaration to be witnessed by a commissioner for oaths.</P>
    <P>That is not the case. It can be witnessed by a peace commissioner, a notary public or a commissioner of oaths. We are asking those from other member states resident in Ireland to provide a formal declaration. What we are doing here applies in all member states. It is similar to the statutory declaration for Irish citizens who require a postal vote by virtue of their employment, which must be signed by a peace commissioner or a commissioner of oaths. I do not believe it is more onerous than that. There is no discrimination whatsoever. I am regretfully unable to accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, to delete lines 39 to 47 and in page 5, to delete lines 1 to 18.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We have had many long debates in the House about the abolition of the dual mandate. Eventually people came around to the idea that it would happen, with one notable exception. The reasons behind it were well articulated in the House by the Minister and various others. It was argued then that the dual mandate went much further than the interlinking between local government and the Oireachtas. Looking around the House, one can see a number of business people, doctors, teachers and so on, who in effect have their own unique dual mandates.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the dual mandate was a good thing. We are sometimes reluctant to acknowledge what is good, but this is something we all sought when we were sitting on county councils. People have now done what is required in terms of resigning their seats, organising <Col N="1208"/>replacements and so on. It is good to see the new system up and running. It is wholly unacceptable, however, for us to allow the European dual mandate to operate until 2007. It gives the Government an advantage because some of its Deputies are standing for election as MEPs and under the current system no by-election will be required, so the Government will maintain its presence in the Oireachtas. I understand that would be the case no matter who is in Government. The <i>status quo</i> may suit the Government but it may not always suit the Opposition, which is the case currently.</P>
    <P>The codes dealing with dual mandates are inconsistent. It is not proper to operate a system which allows a lucrative and time-consuming dual mandate while not allowing another one. In the interests of consistency and leadership, the Government cannot allow this to continue. The Minister of State did not accept this amendment on Committee Stage &mdash; that is why we are discussing it now. However, I urge him to reconsider. He knows best about taking advantage of a dual mandate in terms of being able to return to domestic politics after a time in Europe. I would like him to consider the inconsistency that currently exists and I urge him to accept the amendment so that this anomaly may be addressed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s amendment, which deals with the blatant manipulation of the system in the Government&rsquo;s favour. The Government&rsquo;s track record means it would not now have the confidence to go before the electorate if some of its Deputies were elected to Europe. It is playing a cowardly game.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The electoral system we have here is unique in Europe. It is a system of proportional representation based on a single transferable vote and incorporating multiple-seat constituencies. If we had a rainbow coalition government with a majority of one or two seats and a couple of their Deputies or Senators decided to run for Europe, I am sure those on the far side of the House would be supporting them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>We would not be on the far side of the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot change things. If we tried, we would need a referendum to change the Constitution. It is not on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Brady. The dual mandate has been discussed fully in the House. We must respect the decisions of the courts. I pay tribute to the Deputy who took the case to court in the interest of the common good. The current system benefits all parties. It gives a choice to the parties that are finding it hard to obtain European candidates.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1209"/>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate what I said on Committee Stage. The effect of this amendment would be that the temporary derogation for Members of the Oireachtas who stand as candidates in next June&rsquo;s European Parliament elections to hold the dual mandate until the general election to both Houses would not apply. The arrangement negotiated during the 1998 to 2002 discussions allowed for a rolling derogation because of the requirement, as pointed out by Senator Brady, for by-elections to fill vacancies, especially for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. To fill vacancies by way of a list system or an internal arrangement would require an amendment to the Constitution. It is true that where there is a minority government or one with a small majority this could lead to a general election and would create uncertainty. This would not necessarily be in the best interests of the country, which should always come first. Any party could find itself in this situation.</P>
    <P>Members will recall the European election in 1984. I cannot remember the candidates who stood, but I am sure there were some from the Government party. There was an opportunity for the coalition Government of 1982 to 1987 to take an initiative at that time, but it was not taken. I appreciate the points made by Senator McCarthy and Senator Bannon. There are political points to be made; I am making the political point about the mid-1980s.</P>
    <P>I also accept Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s point about inconsistency. He is correct &mdash; it is inconsistent that the dual mandate allowing Members of the Oireachtas to be members of local authorities is no longer operative. We should not implement legislation to give that a mirror image. A minority government or one with a majority of one or two could be affected and we would not want that. However, we are making it known well in advance of the next election, whether it takes place in 2007 or earlier, that this will no longer apply and that this Government will not make any case for further derogations.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The provisions which permitted the dual mandate are set out in European law. It was only in September 2002 that agreement was reached on ending the dual mandate for Members of both Parliaments. Reference has been made to the position of the dual mandate involving local authorities. This was flagged for a considerable time. The ending of the dual mandate has been on the domestic agenda for many years. The directives of June and September 2002 are relatively recent and include the derogation agreed at EU level. It was a derogation for Ireland and the UK, with specific focus on Northern Ireland, in view of the triple mandate of Dr. Paisley and the dual mandate of Mr. Hume. This no longer applies in view of their decision not to contest the election. Our approach was practical and pragmatic. The Government <Col N="1210"/>will not seek to negotiate any derogation so those who are participating in the European election as Members of the Oireachtas will know where they stand at the next general election.</P>
   
    <P>Perhaps the Senator will consider withdrawing this amendment as the situation will no longer apply after 2007 or the next election.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt><Miles com="cl" par="115"/>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. This amendment is in the interests of consistency. The Government had a clear policy to end the dual mandate in the context of membership of the Oireachtas and local authorities. When the legislation was introduced there were some good debates in this House and the legislation was subsequently enacted. Accordingly, the dual mandate finished. There is a small number of exceptions and Senator Bannon might be one of them but, by and large, that policy has been implemented.</P>
    <P>We have been lectured about the dual mandate at local and national level and the dual mandate at national and European level will finish in a number of years. However, if there is something morally wrong with the dual mandate it is worse to have it at European level than at local level. The Minister is one of the few people who finished with domestic politics and took that gamble. Then he returned, which was a selfless thing to do.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good example. If the project had backfired in the election, it would probably have been classed as something else. I feel strongly about this amendment. If the dual mandate is to be abolished at one level, the policy should be applicable across the board regardless of the type of dual mandate. Obviously, it is more high profile when it occurs in politics but there are also the professions and occupations. These people have dual mandates. During the four years I was a member of the local authority I found it difficult to continue my ordinary occupation. Indeed, I had to resign the job to contest the general election.</P>
    <P>There must be consistency across the board. The Minister of State can argue with justification that this dual mandate will finish in 2007. With regard to the instability of a previous Government, the Minister must have been referring to Fine Gael MEPs during the 1980s because the Labour Party lost its four seats in 1984. However, it caused considerable political uncertainty for some Governments. In the overall political context, the dual mandate is applicable to every role a politician can have, whether it is their ordinary profession outside the House or their membership of another body. The Minister of State made a salient point about the triple mandate in Northern Ireland. It is also a <Col N="1211"/>significant burden on the Exchequer but that is the will of the people.</P>
    <P>I accept the position the Minister takes but I am unhappy that he will not accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for their co-operation in bringing the Bill through the various Stages. I appreciate their interest. They put their amendments down in good faith and I hope they accept that the points I made in response are in the best interests of the House, particularly with regard to the derogation period. I hope I provided good and justifiable reasons for not accepting the amendments.</P>
    <P>The urgency of having the Bill passed arises from an EU legal requirement to have the Council decision of June and September 2002 adopted by the end of February. It is also necessary to give legal effect to the changes in the European Parliament constituencies so candidates and political parties will have certainty before they get down to the serious business of campaigning for the June poll. While I had to differ on the amendments proposed by the Opposition Members, I appreciate the courteous manner in which the debate on the Bill was conducted.</P>
    <P>I believe I speak for both Houses when I pay tribute to all our MEPs, particularly those who will not seek re-election. I thank them for their commitment to the development of Europe and to the development of Ireland&rsquo;s interest within the ever increasing and changing landscape of Europe. Many of these Members served in the European Parliament for a number of years and have seen many changes. However, at all times practically all Members wore the Irish jersey and worked in the best interests of Ireland. I wish all those who are not seeking re-election well in their retirement. They are relatively young and fresh so their retirement is from public life.</P>
    <P>Those who served us well over the years were, in alphabetical order, Nuala Ahern, who served for ten years, Niall Andrews, who served for 20 years, Mary Banotti, who also served for 20 years, John Cushnahan, who served for 15 years, and Jim Fitzsimons, who spent 20 years in Europe representing the constituency of Leinster. In addition, Liam Hyland served for ten years and my constituency colleague for many years in Connacht-Ulster, Joe McCartin, served for 25 years. All of them made a remarkable commitment to and were closely associated with the development of the Union.</P>
    <P>Two other MEPs from the island of Ireland served in Europe since the first direct elections in 1979. They are Dr. Ian Paisley and Mr. John Hume. They worked closely with the 15 Irish MEPs on the International Fund for Ireland, the European Fund for Peace and Reconciliation, INTERREG and CAP reform, which were so important for this island. I wish them well. I wish both the Members and their families continued success.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to conclude the debate on this Bill. We all know he has served on every rung of the ladder. He has served on Donegal County Council, in the national Parliament, at ministerial level and as an MEP for the Connacht-Ulster constituency. I regret that we have not retained the name of that constituency because the names of the provinces refer to our Irish identity.</P>
    <P>I join the Minister of State in his tribute to the outgoing MEPs of the island of Ireland. They did an excellent job and kept Ireland to the forefront in mainland Europe. We have always had the proud distinction of having good people to represent us in Europe, both Commissioners and MEPs. No matter what part of Europe to which one travels, people know at least half of the Irish MEPs, which shows the high esteem in which they are held throughout Europe. I wish them well. I also wish the best to the candidates going forward and hope the best will be selected by the electorate next June.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I too would like to thank the Minister of State and his officials. It has been a demanding week for him since the Minister, Deputy Cullen, was away in the Far East on European business. Who would have known when he was leaving what brouhaha would be caused here on a number of issues?</P>
    <P>It is important to note the excellent work done by our MEPs. All politicians moan but MEPs can justifiably complain about the lack of publicity they get. I know MEPs who work diligently but by and large their work goes completely unnoticed until the election comes around and then they are accused of not having been seen since the previous one. This could not be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to a number of MEPs who will not contest the election. The seven or eight he mentioned have 120 years of service between them which is phenomenal. They deserve the tribute paid to them.</P>
    <P>In the context of the legislation, we are here to do the best we can and that is why we propose amendments. We try to improve the legislation where we think improvements are needed but the Minister has the prerogative to decide what is necessary. Although the Minister of State did not accept any of our amendments the job was done and I thank him and his officials.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, thank the Minister of State. The depth of his answers here and on Committee Stage shows that he has a good grasp of this complicated legislation.

    <P>Much confusion has arisen in recent times regarding changes in the transport system. The school transport section of the Department gave a commitment in February 2001 that the <i>status quo</i> would be maintained pending a review of the current arrangements and of the catchment boundary situation as pointed out by the school transport section of the Department at the time. <Col N="1215"/>The Department also stated that those involved should appreciate that this would involve extensive discussions with the relevant interested parties and that it would contact them in due course. Parents are confused as to the current arrangements and as to what arrangements are in place for the next school term. I ask the Minister to make a commitment to maintain the <i>status quo.</i></P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it affords me, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, the opportunity of outlining to the House the position regarding school transport to Pallaskenry post-primary centre from the Limerick city catchment area.</P>
    <P>The school transport scheme was established to cater for children in rural areas who, if living a long distance from school, might otherwise have difficulty in attending school regularly. Approximately 140,000 primary and post-primary pupils use the school transport scheme on a regular basis. The scheme is administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department. Approximately 2,900 vehicles are used to provide the service, covering around 5,000 routes. The co-ordination of school transport provision under the terms of the scheme at post-primary level is the responsibility of the transport liaison officer of the relevant vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>To be eligible for transport under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme a pupil must, among other things, live three miles or more from his or her appropriate post-primary education centre. Those eligible may be <Col N="1216"/>transported to the post-primary centre which caters for the catchment area in which they live. Pupils may be allowed the concession of transport, otherwise known as catchment boundary transport, to a centre other than the post-primary centre catering for the catchment area in which they live, provided there are spare seats available on the bus after all eligible pupils to that centre have been catered for. In this particular case, pupils residing in the Limerick city catchment area may avail of catchment boundary transport to Pallaskenry post-primary centre, subject to the specific terms of the school transport scheme as previously outlined.</P>
    <P>While it is the prerogative of parents to send children to the school of their choice, it is not the object of the school transport scheme to facilitate them in exercising that choice. The Department will liaise with the transport liaison officer of County Limerick VEC regarding any difficulties that may arise through the implementation of the terms of the school transport scheme.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Brennan that I will bring his views to the Minister at the first available opportunity and will request that the Department liaise with the transport liaison officer of County Limerick VEC at the earliest possible date. I hope there will be no delay in ensuring that this happens. I thank Senator Brennan for raising this matter, which is important to him. Although neither the Minister nor the Minister of State was available to take the Adjournment debate, I assure him I will communicate the details of the case to them within a matter of days.</P>
