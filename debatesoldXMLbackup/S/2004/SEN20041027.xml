	<P>I have received notice from Senator Kitt that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make a statement on the arrangements in place for incentive payments and top-up grants for persons who have sold bog and turbary rights; and if a review of the scheme could be carried out to assist people who had bog designated since 1998.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Phelan of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to make a statement on the actions her Department is taking to ensure the viability of deer farming as an integral part of the agricultural industry in the future, with particular reference to the changes taking place in the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Wilson of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the steps taken to implement the proposals contained in the Department of Health and Children statement of 29 September 2004 on Cavan and Monaghan general hospitals.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide additional special language teachers for Sacred Heart national school, Hartstown, Dublin 15, which has an international pupil intake of 225 out of a total enrolment of 930 students.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P><Col N="582"/>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to carry out an urgent and thorough review of the job losses in Ballinasloe, County Galway, in consultation with local task force groups and other statutory bodies with a view to directing investment in job creation to the town which was stated to be a priority for this Government since 1999.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to explain the conditions which apply to the provision of grants towards public leisure centres; the number and location of applications currently being processed and the average length of time it takes to process an application.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Kitt, Phelan and Wilson and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Feighan, Burke and Morrissey may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It has long been accepted that the weakest link in the European institutions has been the European Parliament. Whatever one&rsquo;s position in respect of the postponement decision taken today by the EU Parliament concerning the new Commission, we would all accept that this is a good day for the Parliament. At the very least, parliamentarians have shown their strength and resolve in standing up to the Commission and the Council of Ministers and doing so in a way which demands that we pay respect to the European Parliament. At some point in the future, we should debate the particular crisis in which the EU finds itself at present. Given the fact that the new constitution will be formally signed and ratified this weekend, a debate at some stage over the coming weeks would be opportune. I thought the common sense shown by the President of the EU Commission, Mr. Barroso, in his decision today to postpone the vote is the type of common sense that he will have to show going forward. I welcome the fact that he, rather than the European Parliament, blinked today.</P>
      <P>As the Leader knows, this House was the first to debate the issue of co-habiting couples and how we can provide protection for people in such relationships. Bishop Walsh of Killaloe made a number of interesting comments yesterday on <Col N="583"/>this area. These comments were generous, forthright and reflected the kind of reality that exists in modern Ireland. Given the fact that Senator Terry has produced a position paper on behalf of our party and that there is impending legislation from Senator Norris, does the Leader agree a useful way to proceed would be to establish a standing committee of the House under Standing Order 98, which would allow us to progress the matter, develop a Green Paper and see exactly what consensus can be reached in this area? This is a particular area of work in which this House has expertise. It has shown initiative and can lead on this matter. I ask the Leader to consider my proposal that we establish a standing all-party committee of the House which would allow us to develop a Green Paper on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I strongly support Senator Brian Hayes in what he said about the need for a debate on the situation in the European Parliament. I do not agree with him about the cleverness of Mr. Barroso. He has shown himself to be totally incompetent. There are issues about several other Commissioners. For example, Mr. Barroso nominated a Commissioner in the competition directorate who has serious conflict of interest problems. There is a real difficulty with this man.</P>
      <P>Despite what has been said by various people, this is not an attack on Mr. Buttiglione because of his religion or his beliefs. This is a man who said that AIDS was a divine punishment on homosexuals. He voted against, lobbied against and attempted to prevent the introduction of equality legislation, particularly governing women and gay people. It is extraordinary that he has been put in charge of this area. They say turkeys do not vote for Christmas. This was like putting a fox in charge of the hen house and asking the chickens to join its re-election campaign. It is a complete farce and it has reduced the European Commission to a situation of contempt.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader will reply to a further question I would like to ask while I am at it. Why were Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael actively lobbying for Mr. Buttiglione if they knew of his record? Why was a former Member of the Seanad, Mr. Brian Crowley, MEP, for whom I have great respect and who has benefited from equality legislation which has been supported by people like me, lobbying for somebody who would make a person like me a second-class citizen of Europe to be given responsibility for the equality portfolio? It is not good enough. I recall that Mr. Buttiglione&rsquo;s friends in the Vatican issued an instruction to Roman Catholics to vote against such legislation. That is not tolerable. I would strongly welcome a debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s helpful suggestion that a standing committee be established. I have received considerable help in the area of domestic partnerships from leading persons on all sides of the House. It is something of an embarrassment to me that there were delays <Col N="584"/>in the production of my legislation, which has just been completed. I had hoped to introduce it today, but I did not do so because of difficulties in rushing it to the printers. I was not keen to suggest changes in a sensitive area without having an opportunity to talk to my colleagues. This matter will affect the future welfare and happiness of many people. I do not think I would have shown respect to the House if I had tried to save face by rushing something in hurriedly. I would be happy to make my Bill available to such a committee.</P>
      <P>I wish to conclude by raising a parallel issue of social justice. Members of the House will have been horrified to discover that some people who earned over &euro;1 million in a single year paid no income tax. In that context, I support strongly the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, who said he will examine the possibility of removing moneys from special savings incentive accounts from means tests conducted on social welfare recipients. It seems to me to be obscene to allow people earning &euro;1 million to pay no income tax, while those who have taken the Government&rsquo;s advice by investing in SSIAs are penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On the final point made by Senator Norris, in recent days the Labour Party has been making the case, to which it will add further nuance, for a minimum rate of tax for people whose earnings are above a certain threshold. I do not believe such a suggestion would be divisive on a party political basis. I think we would all agree that there is merit in maintaining the integrity of the system to ensure that those who earn very high incomes pay a minimum level of tax.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s basic point that it is a good day for the European Parliament, which has faced down a Commission with which it does not agree. I agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s point about the judgment of the President designate of the Commission, who clearly went to the European Parliament without intending to pay the blindest bit of attention to the Parliament&rsquo;s views. It is clear from everything Mr. Barroso said, his demeanour and the way he went about his business since the relevant committee rejected Mr. Buttiglione a couple of weeks ago that he had no intention of paying any attention to the views of the Parliament. It is good that it has been established today that Mr. Barroso cannot get away with such an approach. On a more general level, his judgment has to be called into question. Given that his judgment has been shown to be fundamentally flawed, I wonder if it is possible for the President designate to come back to the Parliament with a Commission in the next three or four weeks.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Norris, I feel it is worth asking why virtually all the Irish MEPs were willing to vote for the proposed Commission. I suspect that the views which have been expressed by Mr. Buttiglione would find little enough expression in <Col N="585"/>this or the other House. I find it deeply disturbing that the overwhelming majority of Irish MEPs, including all Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael MEPs, were willing, for whatever reason, to vote for a Commission that included Mr. Buttiglione. They may have faced political pressure, they may secretly agree with Mr. Buttiglione or they may think that nobody here will notice what is happening in Strasbourg. Perhaps people in Fianna F&aacute;il felt that he was one of their allies, as the Italians are within that particular group. It is a good day because events in Strasbourg are being given a measure of attention here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree it would be useful to debate the European Commission, the role of the European institutions and the future of the European Union. However, even the Vatican would have difficulty rising to the degree of sanctimoniousness which has been expressed about Mr. Buttiglione&rsquo;s appointment. It is obvious there was a great deal of politics in all this. In this House, we are all confident that we can distinguish between our personal beliefs and our responsibilities to the country as legislators. Irrespective of what pressure might be put on us by the Vatican or anyone else, we act independently, prudently and in the interests of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Have Senators studied his voting record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, Senator Norris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure that my voting record is dramatically different from that of Senator Norris, but that does not make it any less valid.</P>
      <P>The other matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He is in charge of equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems that intolerance is not confined to a single area of public life.</P>
      <P>It is important that this matter be resolved quickly, and I am critical of the Commission President that it has been left in abeyance. Critical issues face the Union, not least the question of whether Turkey should be admitted. An interregnum with the outgoing Commission, which has already decided to pack its bags, operating the Union and the delay in introducing the new one should be avoided. In that context, the most critical matter of all is that the Commission President works quickly to resolve this issue. It is important for the Parliament to have a say in such matters, but there has been an element of its flexing its muscles and showing it has more power than the Commission. The one deficiency that we may have identified is that it is probably wrong to have a system whereby, if one votes down one Commissioner, one votes down the entire Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past six weeks there has been a problem with fireworks which are now being set off continually. We have all recently heard the concerns of the visually impaired, especially regarding guide dogs. In many cases, they have failed to function effectively as a result of having been terrified by such fireworks. The problem is now in every urban community, and I would be surprised if all Senators had not been receiving complaints about it. The night is punctuated by loud noises. Young children cannot go to sleep and older people are terrified &mdash; in many cases scared out of their wits &mdash; because fireworks have been dropped through their letterboxes. What is happening on this issue? Fireworks are illegal in this country. They are illegal in the North of Ireland, where one has to get a licence. The Minister must say that if they are illegal, they are illegal, and must take action accordingly. If we are to adopt a responsible attitude, there are certain fireworks that are permissible. Then one could issue licences but one should at least do something about it. It is now happening each year and it will continue in future. We must grapple with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unacceptable that any Irish citizen should suffer the harassment Christy Moore recently suffered in Britain. He was held there under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for several hours. I am worried at the type of questioning engaged in. It seemed that he was being intimidated for his pronouncements and his stance on human rights. He was asked about the lyrics of his songs and personal details of his family.</P>
      <P>As we know, over the years, thousands of innocent Irish people have suffered under the same legislation. I had thought that those dark days were gone. I was once on the receiving end because I would not translate my name from Irish to English, with the result that I was also detained for several hours. Arising from my case, three other countries in the European Parliament put pressure on Britain to stop that type of intimidation. Perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, might be invited in. I do not want to see that sort of activity return, particularly when the peace process is proving so successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two points, one of which has already been raised. I ask the Leader to organise an immediate debate with the new Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, so he might assure both Houses that those who accepted the minimum share scheme offered by the special savings incentive accounts will not have their social welfare payments negatively affected. It is critical that we secure an immediate assurance on that. After all, many of those savers were encouraged by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to take up the scheme. It is important we clarify that matter.</P><Col N="587"/>
      <P>I agree with the decision taken on the European Commission by Mr. Barroso. It is a sad day when the majority of our representatives would have voted for someone who was to take up the justice portfolio in light of the comments he made about homosexuals and single parents&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That point was made very ably by the Senator&rsquo;s leader and we cannot have a debate on it at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The man concerned is not fit to be a Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; regarding the singer Christy Moore. At a time when there are more and more queries about passports and identity cards when travelling between Ireland and Great Britain, and identity is now such a big issue, it is unbelievable that such questions are asked.</P>
      <P>Regarding the western rail corridor, I understand that part of the line between Claremorris and Athenry was inspected last Friday week, which I welcome. This is the first time in three years that an inspection car has been on that line. Given that the working group of the commission appointed by the Government is to report on 5 November, I hope we might have a debate about that rail corridor, which affects all of the west and mid-west region. I am hopeful that the working group will favour the re-opening of the line, which will be the basis for further development of the west. I am sure that all in this House support the re-opening of the line and would agree to a debate before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some years ago the T&aacute;naiste appointed an interdepartmental committee to look at issues of public safety. The group recommended that a new public safety agency should be urgently established to ensure that the highest standards of public safety apply. Does the Leader know if the Government will give effect to the recommendations of the review group?</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, I have heard of people having a twinkle in their eye, but the Leader&rsquo;s rather fetching fashion accessory is twinkling, I think, or maybe it is just my eyes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Why do I always end up following comments like that in the House?</P>
      <P>I support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s comments and I believe the situation in which Christy Moore found himself is indicative of what seems to be happening in the civil and human rights area. Cat Stevens, an equally well known international singer, was deported from America for alleged and unproven funding of terrorist-related activities, when his record showed his opposition to such activities. Irish citizens travelling to the US must now be finger-printed at airports before being allowed to embark. In a world of democracy and democratic ideals, I share the concerns <Col N="588"/>of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others that a more repressive approach is being taken, especially against those who might be deemed to be anti-establishment and not conforming with the mainstream views of some of our political leaders.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, returned in recent weeks to his consideration of a press council. It is now almost certain that he will introduce legislation in this area over the next few months. That matter should come before this House because, as the Cathaoirleach and others who have been Members for some time will be aware, the Seanad has a long and proud tradition of debating media issues. It has prepared reports on amendments to defamation Acts.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue as a member of the Council of Europe, where I have presented reports on broadcasting over a number of years and where, in the context of freedom of expression in the media, I have in recent weeks been subjected to media attention regarding matters which have nothing to do with my parliamentary duties or activities. Many Members of this House will be aware of this issue. To appear on radio programmes to defend the legitimate expenses which one must expend in the course of one&rsquo;s parliamentary duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those issues can be raised during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>While I fully support the right of the media to bring all of us to account, I believe &mdash; I am sure the Leader agrees &mdash; it has an equal obligation to report on the parliamentary activities of all elected Members rather than merely focusing on the sexy issues such as whether we stay in three or four star hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s call for the establishment of a standing committee to deal with civil partnerships and cohabiting couples. It is time the House dealt with this issue. I welcome the fact that Senator Norris is about to publish his Bill and I look forward to seeing it. The time is right to take action on this matter and many Members would support such action. Anything that can be done to bring forward a debate on the issue but also to progress the concept of establishing a standing committee would be welcome.</P>
      <P>I attended the launch of the Women&rsquo;s Aid statistics for 2003 this morning. The statistics to which I refer relate to calls received by the Women&rsquo;s Aid helpline. It was alarming to discover that the figures for 2003 show an increase of 23% on those for 2002. Most of the calls received relate to domestic violence in one form or another. This issue is of serious concern to many people and it should be debated in the House. I ask the Leader to provide us with an opportunity to hold such a debate. The Women&rsquo;s Aid helpline needs far more resources because the figures show that it missed well over 5,000 <Col N="589"/>calls. That is frightening and it should be a matter of concern to everyone, particularly if women are trying to access the helpline and the organisation in question does not have adequate funding to provide the necessary resources for its helpline and for legal services. The matter of legal aid and the Legal Aid Board also needs to be discussed. I would appreciate it if the Leader could arrange for a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have often heard it said that there is nothing as intolerant as an Irish liberal. A person may be entitled to his or her own religious beliefs. If we are to have a debate on events relating to the European Commission, we should reflect on the fact that tolerance must be across the board. I hope that tolerance will prevail in Europe.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt that some of the people who are taking entrenched views in Europe would gladly support partial birth abortions, which are nothing short of infanticide, and transsexual adoptions, which I find dubious. However, when it comes to someone else&rsquo;s personal beliefs they are completely intolerant. Perhaps people should look in the mirror and reflect upon themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a personal belief. It is an attempt to tell the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend those who have suggested that a minimum level of taxation be paid by people who earn &euro;1 million. I would like to bring balance to the debate by stating that some of those people have actually lost money. A number of them invested in business expansion schemes and have lost 100% of their money, namely, the 42% of tax they got back and their own capital. Many schemes would not have proceeded had there not been risks involved. I predicate my remarks by stating that these people should pay tax. However, if there is a risk involved and a benefit to the community, that should also be acknowledged in some way. One of the schemes to which I refer relates to seaside resorts. Everyone has seen how beautifully the quays in Dublin have been restored as a result of people making investments. Other areas in which people have invested are the film industry and business expansion schemes. There must be balance in the debate.</P>

    </Speaker><Col N="590"/>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a great deal of concern about the way the system operates. It is important that the House debates the matter. The system has become extremely bureaucratic and decisions in respect of cars differ from one centre to another. Inspection lists for national car tests contain minor items, such as scrapes in paintwork, missing hubs, etc., which could not be considered road safety issues. It is important the House has a debate on the issue because it causes considerable inconvenience to the general public. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be useful to invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the House &mdash; I realise he is new to his brief and has not yet come before us &mdash; to discuss the charges levied by mobile telephone operators which are much higher here than in any of our European neighbours or, as far as I can gather, any other country in the world. We have debated the matter at great length in the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which has been informed by the operators that the reason is that people here talk for longer on mobile telephones than people anywhere else. We have been unable to determine a basis for their charges. Perhaps a debate in the House would highlight the abuses taking place.</P>
      <P>I fully support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s comment that fireworks should only be used by responsible adults in certain controlled environments, which include Hallowe&rsquo;en bonfires. I am aware of at least one residents&rsquo; association in Waterford which has banned a Hallowe&rsquo;en bonfire because it is being used to dump domestic waste, sofas and so forth. Bonfires are becoming an environmental hazard not to mention the problems they cause for residents in the areas in question. Local authorities must adopt a hands-on approach which could include licensing some such events. To do so, however, they will need additional funding because waste removal incurs costs. While it may be too late to take action this year, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government could introduce a pilot scheme. I ask that this proposal be conveyed to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my colleague, Senator Bannon, on the national car test. I raised this issue last year and requested that the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, come before the House to discuss it. It is time we did so. When the Minister comes into the House, it may be apt to ask him what he proposes to do about continued significant delays between submitting an application for a driving test and receiving a test date. It appears nothing is being done to reduce this delay, which must be addressed as soon as possible.</P><Col N="591"/>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste has not come before the House since her appointment as Minister for Health and Children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps she was but it was not on my watch. It would be opportune to invite her to come before us again to discuss comments she made last week, particularly on the crisis in hospital accident and emergency departments in this city and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>It would also be opportune for the T&aacute;naiste or her colleague and good friend, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, to come in to discuss the issue of nursing homes. According to at least one of the daily newspapers today, hundreds of families were ripped off by the State by being forced to pay the costs of care in nursing homes which they should not have had to pay. The relevant Minister should come before the House to discuss this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the European Parliament is centre stage. While it is a wonderful day that events in Europe have caused controversy in the House and aroused strong feelings, we are discussing them in something of a vacuum. I ask the Leader, who I know has made some efforts in this regard, to ensure the House has available to it an information channel which allows Senators to find out what is really happening in Europe when circumstances such as the current events arise.</P>
      <P>This morning, it appeared that if the Commission were to be defeated, we would be on difficult ground. Nobody appeared to know what would happen for at least a month. It would have been appropriate for someone, even the Minister with responsibility for European affairs, to come before this and the other House to explain the matter and its implications. We are left stranded when these sorts of circumstances arise in Europe.</P>
      <P>There may be some benefit for Ireland in this, and perhaps the Leader of the House would convey that message to the Taoiseach. We could have Deputy McCreevy back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is the reason we could have him back here. I do not know if the Taoiseach would welcome that, but the Leader could relate to him the expressions of some Members of this House that, given that Deputy McCreevy will be unemployed for the next month, he could play a role here which could be of benefit to the Government, the Taoiseach and all those who promoted him so enthusiastically for his new role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues, Senators Bannon and Phelan, in seeking a debate on the <Col N="592"/>NCT centres. I raised this issue last year. It has arisen time and again in various areas.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Finucane that we should debate the fact that although fireworks are illegal, they are widely available. Public awareness campaigns highlighting the dangers of fireworks have failed and the House should acknowledge that fact. Last year I spent Hallowe&rsquo;en in Dublin and, like every small town in the country, it was like downtown Baghdad. There were hundreds of thousands of breaches of the law. Many children and parents have been injured by fireworks. The House should call for the law to be enforced to ensure that illegal traders who sell fireworks are made responsible for the harm they cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Kitt in seeking a debate on the western rail corridor and related issues with the Minister for Transport. There has been discussion in this House for some time about the extension of a rail corridor along the west of Ireland. Another aspect of the rail debate is the suggestion of a rail link between Shannon Airport and the Ennis-Limerick line. The previous Minister asked Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to conduct a feasibility study on such a link. Will the Leader ask the new Minister for Transport to come to the House as soon as possible to discuss both matters?</P>
      <P>With regard to fireworks, the situation is outrageous and every village and town in Ireland is suffering. Elderly people and children are prevented from getting a night&rsquo;s sleep. I compliment the garda&iacute; on their response. Yesterday, they enjoyed great success in County Clare and seized a quantity of fireworks from illegal traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the points made by my colleagues about nursing homes. It is amazing that this issue is before the House again. In 2001, the then Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, produced a report on nursing homes but it appears that the Government has failed again in this area. Almost 15,000 pensioners in long-term care, aged 70 years and over, might have been paying money they need not have paid for their nursing home care. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to clarify the situation? I am aware that the 1970 and 1990 health Acts are relevant to this important issue. I hope the Minister will come to the House to make a statement on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes declared this a good day for the European Parliament and I agree. The Members of the European Parliament have rights and they exercised them. Others would wish they did not but the general feeling in this Chamber is that we were glad they did. The Senator sought a debate on the European issue. He also said he was glad that the Commission President blinked rather than the parliamentarians. I believe the parliamentarians never intended to blink and that they were determined to follow through on their rights, as they did.</P><Col N="593"/>
      <P>The Senator also referred to Bishop Willie Walsh&rsquo;s sensible and forthright statements yesterday. I, too, read those statements with delight. I am glad he was so forthright on the matter. The Senator asked if we could set up a standing committee of the House with the aim of framing a Green Paper on those issues. That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. We could put a query to the Cathaoirleach on that matter. The Senator also stated that Senator Terry produced a paper on the matter which was briefly discussed on the Order of Business last year.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris blamed the President of the Commission, Mr. Barroso, for the line taken in the recent dispute. I would blame him for arriving 15 minutes late and not giving an apology. If one was five minutes late for a class, one would apologise, but he arrived and said nothing. It was not a good basis on which to start.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked why Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael were prepared to support Commissioner Buttiglione. While I imagine this was seen as pragmatic and the thing to do, I commend those who decided they would not support him. The law is wrong and should be amended so one can disagree with the nomination of one Commissioner without disagreeing with the entire 24. Underlying this is the point that Deputy McCreevy has no job in Europe while there is no job here for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>He is still a Deputy. He did not have to resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The by-elections are off, Senator Walsh.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris also raised the matter of domestic partnerships. I know the Senator&rsquo;s Bill will soon be available and that he has received help on the matter from other parties in the Houses. The Senator also referred to those earning over &euro;1 million per annum while paying no tax and contrasted this with the proposal on the special savings incentive accounts. We will look for a debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator McDowell referred to the minimum rate of tax and asked why Europe was ready to vote Mr. Buttiglione into office. The issue has gone beyond the Commissioner and now centres on the readiness of European parliamentarians to exercise their rights rather than being done down. However, the issue highlights the feelings towards parliamentarians in the higher echelons of European politics. The Commission was ready to suggest the parliamentarians had no clout until they exercised it.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis stated a debate would be useful on the European issue and the impact of private beliefs on public policy. It has gone beyond that point and of all the remarks attributed to Mr. Buttiglione, those on single parents were the most nefarious. Senator Dardis was also critical of the President of the Commission.</P><Col N="594"/>
      <P>Senator Finucane raised the issue of fireworks, which frighten many people, especially at this time of year when darkness falls so early. Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the questioning undergone by Christy Moore following a boat crossing to Britain. This was due to the type of songs he sings and the beliefs he has held, rightly and truly. The Senator was subjected to similar treatment because he would not translate his name from Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; to what others wanted. On such occasions, it would be easy to do what others wanted.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy wanted the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to come to the House to debate the issue of special savings incentive accounts and he also called for a debate on the issue of Europe.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt supported Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and called for a debate on the western rail corridor report when it is published next week.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Coghlan, the Senator&rsquo;s eyes are quite twinkly.</P>

	<P>One can have it whatever way one likes, but not in the Chamber. On that note, I congratulate Senator McHugh, who I understand has become engaged.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan asked about the review which recommended the setting up of another public safety agency. I do not know what happened regarding that recommendation but I will inquire into it.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney supported Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and mentioned the experience of Cat Stevens who was also subjected to quite obnoxious questioning. He also raised the issue of the proposal of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, regarding the establishment of a press council. I will inquire as to whether the Minister will come here to debate the issue. I strongly agree that if the media are willing to question on one issue, they should be willing to report on what is being done at the Council of Europe which, I am sure, is of great relevance.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry attended the launch of the Women&rsquo;s Aid national helpline statistics. I had intended to go. The statistics show that more than 5,000 calls could not be attended to and that there were many more calls in 2003 than in 2002. Senator Terry requested a debate on the issue.</P><Col N="595"/>
      <P>Senator Hanafin stated that there should be tolerance across the board. We would all agree with him. On taxation, he agreed that people who earn millions of euro should pay a minimum level of taxation but that there should be a balance in the debate about taxation and the risks people take, for example, by investing in business expansion schemes, should be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon raised the issue of car testing arrangements. I will arrange to have a debate on that matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Kenneally asked that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, be invited to the House to debate the charges levied by mobile telephone operators. He agreed with Senator Finucane&rsquo;s comments regarding fireworks and bonfires. I agree that local authorities should take a more proactive role in the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Phelan raised the issues of the national car test, accident and emergency facilities and nursing homes. Senator Shane Ross suggested in the context of the debate that developed in Europe that there should be a direct information channel to this and to the other House so that people could find out what is going on in Europe. He also suggest that the relevant Minister should come here to give us his opinions on the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan also sought a debate on the national car test. He stated that legislation relating to fireworks had failed. There is legislation but it is not being enforced.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooley sought a debate on the western rail corridor and echoed what Senator Finucane said regarding the terror caused to elderly people. It is not too exaggerated a description because elderly people are living in terror after nightfall.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne raised the issue of nursing homes. It is the interpretation of the legislation that is in question. Different people give different interpretations.</P>

    <Title>Report of Strategic Task Force on Alcohol: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power. I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him every success with that portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to introduce the second report of the strategic task force on alcohol. This report addresses what many regard as one of the most serious threats to public health in Ireland, that of the excessive consumption of alcohol by society and its related harm. It provides a comprehensive review of alcohol trends, both in terms of use and consequences, in an Irish and European context. The report&rsquo;s recommendations are based on inter<Col N="596"/>nationally proven measures which are evidence-based and are appropriate to Ireland&rsquo;s complex alcohol problems.</P>
      <P>The strategic task force on alcohol was established in January 2002 by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, under the chairmanship of the Department&rsquo;s chief medical officer, Dr. Jim Kiely. Its remit is to recommend specific evidence-based measures to Government to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm. Membership of the task force is broadly based and comprises public health experts, non-governmental organisations, the drinks industry, representatives from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Departments. This comprehensive report includes a list of recommendations, the purpose of which is to enhance society&rsquo;s capacity to prevent and respond to alcohol-related harm; to achieve the targets set out in the World Health Organisation declaration on young people and alcohol; and to provide for early intervention to ensure effective treatments. This wide-ranging report, which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children will bring to Government shortly, contains recommendations relevant to many different sectors in society.</P>
      <P>In the past decade, Ireland has seen many changes which have influenced the context and nature of drinking and have in turn increased alcohol-related harm. Against the backdrop of the fastest growing economy in Europe, Ireland has seen the highest increase in alcohol consumption among European countries. Between 1990 and 2002, alcohol consumption <i>per capita</i> in Ireland increased by 41%. Irish people continue to be some of the highest consumers of alcohol in the world. In EU terms, Ireland ranked second <i>per capita</i> in terms of alcohol consumption in 2001. Among adults, the consumption level was 14.4 litres of pure alcohol per adult. A recent European study shows that in 2002 adults in Ireland had the highest reported consumption per drinker and the highest level of binge drinkers in comparison to other European countries. This study shows that binge drinking is the norm among Irish men with every 58 of 100 drinking occasions ending in binge drinking while the figure among women is 30 occasions out of 100.</P>
      <P>There is a tendency to believe that alcohol-related harm occurs only to the heavy drinker or alcoholic. However, it affects those who do not drink, those who drink small amounts but in risky situations, those who sometimes drink to excess and those who regularly abuse alcohol. There is also a tendency to focus on under age drinkers as the main problem group. While cases involving young people are the ones that hit the headlines, the majority of alcohol-related harm happens in the adult population.</P>
      <P>Excessive alcohol consumption is a significant contributory factor in personal harms, including accidents, injury, unprotected sex, aggressive behaviour and depression. It is a contributory factor in social harms including fights, assaults, violence, drink driving, relationship and marital <Col N="597"/>difficulties and poor work and school performances. Mortality caused by cirrhosis, cancers, suicide, homicide, alcohol dependency and alcohol poisoning are results of excessive alcohol consumption. It is the combination of high consumption levels and the high rate of binge drinking that leads to greater alcohol-related harm. Alcohol-related deaths have increased over the past decade. Chronic conditions specific to alcohol rose by 61% and acute conditions rose by a staggering 90%, which contrasts sharply with a decrease in the overall number of deaths, 14% for all cause mortality.</P>
      <P>The global burden of disease study, sponsored by the World Health Organisation and the World Bank, found that alcohol was the third most detrimental risk factor for European ill health and premature death. In 2002, alcohol-related death and disability accounted for 9.2% of all burden of disease, with only tobacco at 12.2% and high blood pressure at 10.9% causing more harm. Between 1992 and 2002, 14,223 people died in Ireland from five of the main alcohol-related mortality causes, namely suicide, cancers, alcohol poisoning, liver cirrhosis and alcohol abuse. That statistic excludes road deaths and drownings caused by alcohol consumption.</P>
      <P>Alcohol continues to be a major contributor to the workload of those working in the health service. I am aware, as I am sure are most Senators, of the high number of alcohol-related incidents that accident and emergency services in hospitals throughout the country have to treat, especially late at night and at weekends. The current pressures on accident and emergency departments are exacerbated by these preventable injuries and accidents.</P>
      <P>International research has demonstrated the involvement of alcohol in injuries. Several studies conducted in Ireland have shown the high level of alcohol involvement in accident and emergency attendances. Alcohol-related accident and emergency admissions have been monitored in Cork University Hospital and the increased demands on accident and emergency services can be linked directly with an increase in drunkenness in the city. Drunkenness among girls in Cork city is up by 60% and violence among this group is an additional phenomenon.</P>
      <P>A North Eastern Health Board study found there was an 80% increase from 1997 to 2001 in acute alcohol intoxication admissions. Over half these admissions were at the weekend with the average length of stay being 2.7 days while just under a quarter were discharged on the same day. Neither a rise in population nor changes in demographics accounts for the phenomenon.</P>
      <P>In a study of alcohol and drug use among young attendees to accident and emergency services, alcohol was identified as a significant problem among the young population in north Dublin where over 38% of those under 31 years of age in attendance in the emergency room were there primarily due to alcohol.</P><Col N="598"/>
      <P>A pilot study carried out in the Mater Hospital in 2001 showed that alcohol was a contributory factor for one in four patients attending the accident and emergency department. The research showed that 30% of male admissions, 10% of female admissions and almost 25% of total accident and emergency attendances met diagnostic criteria for alcohol misuse or dependency. This study, using a WHO protocol, was expanded nationwide to include six major hospitals: Beaumont and the Mater hospitals, and hospitals in Waterford, Galway, Sligo and Letterkenny. The data is currently being analysed and should be available before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>A study in treatment service demand in the Southern Health Board and South Eastern Health Board regions showed that over 70% of those treated reported alcohol as their main problem drug. Alcohol use during pregnancy is also a growing concern.</P>
      <P>As I already stated, Irish people continue to be one of the highest consumers of alcohol in the world, which comes at a cost. The harm experienced as a result of excessive drinking has personal, economic and social consequences. This harm is not limited to the individual drinker but also to those around him or her and to society.</P>
      <P>On a purely financial level, nearly &euro;6 billion of personal income was spent on alcohol in Ireland in 2002. That represents &euro;1,942 for every adult over 15 years of age. It is estimated that alcohol-related harm cost Irish society &euro;2.65 billion in 2003, which is 2.6% of GNP, an increase of 12% from the last estimate. Therefore, we are all paying for something which, for the most part, we believe to be someone else&rsquo;s problem.</P>
      <P>The sum of &euro;2.65 billion is just the economic cost. Employees pay when a colleague fails to turn up for work, when a driver gets into a car having consumed alcohol and cannot take a sharp corner on the way home and families pay when a member is aggressive or abusive.</P>
      <P>The strategic task force published an interim report in 2002 and since then some progress has been made in tackling the problem. An important marker, that of overall consumption, fell last year for the first time in over 16 years. This was as a result of the implementation of one of the STFA&rsquo;s recommendations from the interim report of May 2002 which called for increased taxes on alcohol products. This change must be preserved and built upon and, in tandem with the implementation of other recommendations, in time we will see a reduction in alcohol-related harm.</P>
      <P>Progress has also been made in several areas based on the measures recommended in the first task force report. This includes a three-year alcohol awareness campaign which raised public awareness of alcohol as a public health issue. In addition, the Road Traffic Act extended the grounds for requesting a breath specimen and represents a move to random breath testing. The Government has also strengthened the licensing laws through the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, <Col N="599"/>which contains measures to counter drunkenness and disorderly conduct, and to combat under age drinking, including the prohibition on happy hours and the prohibition on persons under 18 years of age from being in the bars of licensed premises after 9 p.m. The Act also prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor to drunken persons on licensed premises and licensees may not permit drunkenness in the bar of licensed premises.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsman is drafting legislation which aims to reduce the exposure of children to alcohol marketing. Several research projects have been undertaken to monitor and inform alcohol policy decision-making. The Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s code of ethics and good practice for children&rsquo;s sport has been instrumental in encouraging national sporting organisations to promote alcohol-free sporting environments. This code contains several recommendations. To date, 62 of 67 governing bodies of sport have signed up to the code and appointed national children&rsquo;s officers to implement the guidelines at local level.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit produced a framework for the development of a college alcohol policy in association with the heads of colleges and the Union of Students in Ireland. The framework provides guidelines for a comprehensive approach, which includes measures on controlling promotion, sponsorship and marketing on the college campus, providing education and support services as well as alternatives and limiting harm in the drinking environment. The responsible server training programme, developed by the Department of Health and Children and the drinks industry, is now being delivered nationwide by F&aacute;ilte Ireland. However, while there is an improvement, it is only the beginning and much more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that the responses in this report are many and varied to reflect the nature of the harm and the costs to society. The recommendations in this report incorporate the community, the workplace, parents, the drinks industry, youth organisations and the health service and the breadth of the recommendations reflect our responsibility as a society. The recommendations include building community action projects to enable communities to address alcohol-related problems in their areas, providing support for families and providing professional training for those in contact with alcohol problems through their work. It also recommends that employers put in place guidelines for alcohol policies; restricting any further increase in the physical availability of alcohol; that national sporting bodies with high youth participation develop a proactive strategy to find an alternative to alcohol sponsorship; and increasing alcohol-free alternatives. It recommends putting in place early interventions in a variety of settings &mdash; primary care, hospitals, health clinics, courts, colleges and juvenile programmes. It recommends the development of responsible serving practices which discourage high-risk drinking.</P><Col N="600"/>
      <P>There are 78 recommendations based on international research evidence of what works in reducing alcohol-related harm. We can therefore say with certainty that the measures recommended in this report, if implemented, will be effective in addressing the problems associated with excessive consumption of alcohol. The task ahead of us as a Government and as a society must not be underestimated. Introducing a climate where a cultural change can take place is a considerable challenge, but the task force has made a very important start towards bringing about that change. The members of the task force worked hard to provide the Department of Health and Children and the Government with tangible plans. We have two reports from the task force, which together contain a comprehensive range of effective recommendations and provide a blueprint for a co-ordinated framework going forward to tackle alcohol problems at national, regional and local levels.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children intends to bring this report to Government to seek approval for the implementation of its recommendations. The Government is committed to tackling the problem as evidenced by alcohol being listed as one of the special initiatives of the Sustaining Progress social partnership agreement. The task force has produced a comprehensive, robust report which I urge every public representative, public servant and medical expert, every relevant organisation and institution to examine with a view to working towards the implementation of its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House. It is good to have a discussion on alcohol and it is time to have a mature debate on it. There was much hysteria about banning alcohol and people being in bed by 10 p.m. This may sound great as a possible solution but it will not work. I am very encouraged by groups such as the Mature Enjoyment of Alcohol in Society because that is the core objective. The difficulty is that we cannot stop drinking. People in other European countries drink just as we do, but they stop. They can have one or two drinks and then go home. Unfortunately, we cannot do likewise. We have all been in situations where we have had one or two drinks and try to leave a group who react as if the night will collapse. When we tell them we are not having any more to drink, they look at us with complete incredulity. There is something wrong in a society where that happens. One should be able to say one does not want any more to drink and leave it at that.</P>
      <P>This is a social issue. Much of this derives from parental example and guidance. If parents and other older relatives show good example, it follows that the children will drink modestly too. I was bemused to see on the day after the All-Ireland hurling final when Cork beat Kilkenny that TV3 was in a hotel in Dublin with the victorious team. They were in the bar and one of the <Col N="601"/>leading players was drinking pints of lager. The clear inference was that alcohol was in some way linked to the victory. It is anything but and the reality is that all those players probably were not drinking alcohol for weeks or months before the game.</P>
      <P>We all accept that alcohol is detrimental to our health, which the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech proved. It is unfortunate that the media did not interview that player either outside the pub or without a pint in his hand. That image sent out all the wrong signals. How can we be surprised here by young people drinking if they are bombarded with those images from an early age? There is an onus on advertisers and the media in that context to interview sportspeople away from a setting associated with alcohol. That image brought this home very clearly to me.</P>
      <P>Many friends of mine have made the valid point that minerals cost almost as much as alcohol. Surely the Government has a clear role in this regard. It could reduce VAT on minerals or non-alcoholic beverages to ensure that people have at least the option and some incentive to save money, have a clear head in the morning and do not risk offending a friend. Instead, non-alcoholic drinks are as expensive as alcohol and there is no real incentive to choose those drinks. That is a practical area in which the Government can play a role and control prices.</P>
      <P>When I started going to discos about ten years ago in Carlow, we were served dinner in the local nightclub. One paid an entry fee, received a ticket, had a few drinks and then went in to get a chicken breast and chips, or whatever was provided. At least it sobered one up a little. The difference now is that people go in and drink non-stop for the whole night. Unfortunately, they are also taking drugs with the drink, which is a lethal combination. I thought there was an onus on licensed premises which open late at night to provide some form of food. I have sought clarification on this and perhaps the Minister might know. It certainly was the case in the past, but it seems to have been abandoned recently. It might play some part in sobering people up as they are drinking on empty stomachs. On New Year&rsquo;s Eve there will be people going into places at 8 p.m. and remaining there until 3 a.m. In a seven-hour period, they will have no food. Surely that is wrong and they should get some food to help them balance things up.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the idea of a national ID card and why the Government is so lax in that regard. It makes common sense that everyone should have a national ID card. A friend of mine told me recently that her husband collapsed in Dublin after just two pints. It happened at night and most people would have assumed he had been drinking to excess, but he had not been doing so; he just felt unwell. In that case, it would make sense to have a national ID card so that someone could find out who he is because there would be basic information on his ID card, such as his blood group. At least that <Col N="602"/>information could be given to the emergency services.</P>
      <P>God forbid that any of us might be beaten up and left in a heap on the street. It could happen easily if one met the wrong people at the wrong time. Surely it would make sense in that case to have a national ID card. I have not even mentioned the fact that it would eliminate the problem of under age people buying alcohol. They can alter some of the existing ID cards. They would not be able to do that to a national ID card.</P>
      <P>I feel sorry for publicans and those who own off-licences who are convicted of selling alcohol to under age people. I saw a case in my own county where a girl went into an off-licence with an ID that had been clearly forged, yet which looked perfect to the person behind the counter. She produced the ID card which declared that she was over 18, so the person behind the counter had no choice but to serve alcohol to her. It then emerged that she was not over 18 and the off-licence was closed for a few days and its owner fined heavily. The irony of it was that the girl in question got away scot free, having deliberately tampered with an ID card. Surely that is wrong as it does not punish the person and make her responsible for her actions.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also referred to women drinkers. He stated that in Cork, drunkenness among girls was up 60% and that violence among this group was an additional phenomenon. That is unfortunately the case on every street in Ireland, yet it was certainly not the case in the past, which is very worrying. I am not too sure what the solution involves. However, some form of a breathalyser test should be introduced. If someone goes out with &euro;150 in his or her pocket on a Saturday night, plans to drink that amount of money, gets exceptionally drunk and injures himself or herself, then that person should have some responsibility towards the cost of going to an accident and emergency unit. The whole purpose of such a unit is for genuine cases, such as someone at home who suffers a heart attack. It is terrible to see fully able people deliberately making themselves disabled. There should be some sanction in that regard. There should be an onus on all of us to know that if we hurt ourselves through being exceptionally drunk, then we have some responsibility. It is not good enough and they should not be clogging up accident and emergency units, depriving genuine patients of the care they deserve.</P>
      <P>There are many recommendations in the interim report such as increasing taxes. However, I wonder whether that would drive people to drink more at home, which might not be good. At least a pub is a controlled environment. There is always a grave danger that people drinking at home might drink even more than they would in a pub. The establishment of a national ID card makes sense.</P>
      <P>There are also recommendations to restrict greater availability on any new licence that meets specific criteria and to provide for health boards <Col N="603"/>to intervene in licensing systems. While that might make sense, I also have to question it. If one goes abroad to any EU country or even further afield, one will note that alcohol is freely available, even in ordinary shops, yet the local people are not drinking to excess. Prohibition, therefore, may not be the correct approach. A liberal market might actually have the opposite effect to what we envisage.</P>
      <P>Drink driving is a major issue that has been tackled very successfully in the past few years. There is a recommendation to introduce random breath testing, which is a welcome proposal. There is also a suggestion to lower the blood alcohol content to 0.5 mg per litre and lowering it to zero for provisional drivers. I agree with the second recommendation, but I have reservations about the first one. Lowering the blood alcohol level is fine in a city area because people have the choice of taxis, buses, the Luas, the DART, the Nitelink and so on. In a rural setting where people who work late and want to go to the local pub for one, two or three pints and can handle their drink, it is not such a good idea to close them down completely. In some respects, it would make people drink more.</P>
      <P>The reality is that if people know that they can drive, they will go out for one or two drinks and drive the car home while under the current limit. However, if we lower the limit to an unrealistic level, such people will get a lift to the pub instead of driving and instead of staying out for a short while, they might stay out for a full night. They know they are not driving and will probably drink much more. It is an issue that should be examined and was raised in the last D&aacute;il by former Deputy Austin Deasy. In the rural setting, draconian measures should not be brought in that would result in people not being able to go out for one or two drinks. We should be realistic and recognise that people do not all have the same transport facilities.</P>
      <P>The section of the report on advertising and reducing exposure of alcohol marketing to children also makes sense, as does the encouragement of sports organisations to promote alcohol-free environments for children. It is also regrettable that when the under eight and under ten teams win something, invariably they all end up in the pub. Regrettably, all their parents are drinking and it is turned into a major drinking event, which gives a bad example to the younger children. At communion and confirmation time next year, parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts will invariably end up in hotels and pubs drinking, in some cases to excess.</P>
      <P>The provision of information on education and services is a good point raised in the report. We clearly have to link alcohol consumption and poor health and get that message across. We must also provide proper sports facilities. This Government does not have a great record in that area. I am aware of one school in Donabate, County Dublin, that was told to divide its PE hall into <Col N="604"/>two classrooms, instead of being granted a new classroom. It means the children in that school will not even have a PE hall, even though PE is part of the national curriculum in primary school. That sends out a very bad message.</P>
      <P>The collection, collation and proper interpretation of research and data on road fatalities and suicides is very important although I appreciate it is very hard to measure in some cases. I am also interested in the results of prosecutions for the sale of alcohol to minors. I reiterate that if a minor deliberately enters a pub or off-licence with false identification, there should be some onus on him or her to bear some responsibility for that. If I owned a pub or off-licence, I would feel very aggrieved if I discovered that an ID card which was presented to me was not valid, even though it looked as if it was. The sooner national ID cards are introduced, therefore, the better for everyone concerned.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organisation has issued a declaration about young people and alcohol. I agree with most of the targets it hopes to meet by 2006, many of which are mentioned in the report under discussion by the House. How can the targets be achieved? That is the main question. Ultimately, we have to encourage the mature enjoyment of alcohol and introduce basic individual responsibility on the part of parents and juveniles. We would do quite well to follow the example of our European colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus gabhaim comhghairdeas leis. I welcome the second report of the strategic task force on alcohol. The report&rsquo;s recommendations aim to enhance society&rsquo;s ability to prevent and respond to alcohol-related harm; to achieve the targets set out in the WHO declaration on young people and alcohol; to provide for early intervention to ensure effective treatments; and to increase the responsibility of the drinks industry in reducing alcohol problems.</P>
      <P>We have to appreciate that alcohol is a socially acceptable drug. Contrary to common belief, it does have the same effect on everybody. The British Medical Association&rsquo;s definition of an &ldquo;alcoholic&rdquo; was not an incorrect assessment. The World Health Organisation considers that a person whose drinking, or behaviour as a result of drinking, affects any of the three main areas of life &mdash; family, work and social activity &mdash; is an &ldquo;alcoholic&rdquo;. It might be appropriate to state that such a person certainly has a drink problem. It does not matter how much one drinks, but how alcohol affects one or how one behaves after one has been drinking.</P>
      <P>The second report of the strategic task force discusses at length the various difficulties which can arise after people have been drinking. Alcohol is all the more dangerous, and all the more difficult to deal with, because it is a socially acceptable drug. The Minister, Deputy Martin, has pointed out that one of this country&rsquo;s biggest problems with alcohol is one of cultural accept<Col N="605"/>ance, although it might be more accurate to refer to it as cultural indifference. I do not doubt that there is a tolerant attitude to alcohol in this country. Nobody wants to be a killjoy, but it is evident that the pub forms a traditional centrepiece to Irish life. I am aware of that as somebody who goes to the pub from time to time. The atmosphere, music, song and craic found in pubs are intrinsic aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry. It is obvious today that Ireland may lack good weather, but we often compensate for that with conviviality. That does not need to change as long as we are responsible.</P>
      <P>It is important to consider the difficulties caused by the abuse of alcohol. I refer not only to the number of working days lost as a result of alcohol abuse, when men or women do not turn up for work, but also to the resultant decrease in production. The Minister of State has mentioned that many workers have to do additional work to compensate for the absence of their colleagues.</P>
      <P>Many organisations have been established to deal with alcohol problems. I acknowledge the great work done by Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon and Alateen. The latter organisation has not been greatly successful, but attempts have been made to get it to work. INCA has also played a pivotal role in highlighting the dangers and attending difficulties of alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>Ireland should not be proud of its position in the alcohol league table of nations. There is stark evidence that a significant proportion of the population is not content merely to enjoy a drink. Ireland&rsquo;s <i>per capita</i> alcohol consumption in 2001 was the second highest in the European Union, including the ten new member states which joined the Union in May 2004. Ireland&rsquo;s <i>per capita</i> alcohol consumption peaked at 14.4 litres of pure alcohol per adult in 2001. The first fall in consumption for 16 years took place in 2003, when the relevant figure decreased to 13.5 litres per adult. While this decrease is welcome, there is a very long way to go.</P>
      <P>Many things have been said during the debate on alcohol consumption. I do not think the demonisation of vintners during the debate has been fair. One is responsible for one&rsquo;s own drinking and one&rsquo;s own health. I will speak on the health aspects of alcohol consumption in a moment. Parents have a major responsibility to prevent under age drinking. It is regrettable that a sizeable number of parents seem to have abdicated their responsibilities in that regard.</P>
      <P>I took a course in alcohol therapy and substance abuse some years ago when I worked in the psychiatric nursing profession. A 22 year old woman who was a reformed alcoholic was also taking the course. She was the only daughter of two doting parents. By the time they discovered their daughter had a problem, it was far too late and they eventually disowned her. The woman&rsquo;s journey back from skid row was long, arduous and tedious, but she succeeded in making it. She was taking the alcohol therapy course with me and 13 other people at the age of 22. It is clear <Col N="606"/>that while alcohol might be a social drug, it has great dangers.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne has asked why a national identity card has not been introduced. I understand that young people have a great talent for producing ID cards with the aid of personal computers. We have not yet come up with the ideal card. I agree with the Senator that some foolproof identity card would be most useful. There is evidence to suggest that such identity cards have been used and will continue to be used with particular effect, for example in off-licences.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have referred to the impact of the abuse of alcohol on the health service. People who have indulged in alcohol, or have been assaulted by people who have over-indulged in alcohol, for example in unprovoked attacks, contribute to inappropriate bed occupancy in accident and emergency units. It may not be the fault of such people that they have found themselves in accident and emergency departments. There is strong evidence to suggest that many people are creating mayhem in accident and emergency units because of their own wilful ingestion of alcohol. That should stop.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about a certain practice, often involving alcohol, which has affected psychiatric services in the past. I hope that it is no longer going on, since I have been out of that profession for several years. In acute units, people who had drunk a great deal would present themselves on the pretext that they wished to be admitted. The following morning, having had bed and breakfast provided, they would thumb their nose at the nursing and medical staff and go on their way until the next occasion. Hospitals have been used as hostels. This matter was previously raised by Senator Norris and perhaps also Senator Henry regarding the Eastern Health Board, when it was the subject of a special motion. What are we to do? Many recommendations in this report have been referred to, but when it comes to how we can take the drinks industry to task, we must address the manner in which alco-pops are pushed. They are designed for the young drinker. I agree with Senator Browne&rsquo;s comment that the cost of soft drinks is extremely high. It is ludicrous. One can get bottles of sparkling water of various kinds for anything up to &euro;2.50. That is absolute nonsense; one can buy alcohol for less.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Mortality on the roads as a result of drink driving needs special mention, as does the emergence of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, or MADD. Perhaps there should be a DADD too. As a dad, I too am very much against such drivers. I am thankful that I have not yet lost a child to one. However, it is outrageous when a life is taken as a result of the abuse of alcohol. When we discuss the various problems that emanate from over-indulgence in alcohol, we must also mention the use and abuse of alcohol by pregnant women. It is absolutely unbelievable, and the report draws attention to what is clearly a major worry owing to the damage that can be done to the baby, especially <Col N="607"/>during the early stages of pregnancy when the central nervous system is developing. A recent study of women attending an Irish maternity hospital reported that 85% continued to drink during pregnancy. We should not be proud of that statistic. If men were the child-bearing part of the equation, I would say exactly the same thing. It is a great worry and it will cause problems in future.</P>
      <P>Estimated alcohol-related costs to Irish society in 2003 were &euro;2.65 billion, representing 2.6% of gross national product, a 12% increase on the previous estimate. High consumption combined with binge drinking has especially damaging effects. We all know that, apart from the conditions mentioned by the Minister of State, there is also the danger of brain damage. At a certain stage of alcoholism, when people get boozed up and go to sleep, a quantity of brain cells are killed before they wake up, and a further number damaged. That was very much brought to our notice when we attended that course. While alcohol is a very enjoyable social drug, it is also very dangerous when used in a certain way. One must remember that it is mood-altering. Some people can take a certain number of units without any great adverse effect. I pointed out in the early part of my comments when I referred to the terminology describing alcoholics that the issue is not what or how much people drink but what it does to them.</P>
      <P>We must be responsible. MEAS is trying to achieve that in the manner in which it tackles the problem. Driving the problem underground is not the answer, since there would be an increased incidence of drinking at home. That is not welcome, given the presence of children in most homes. We must put area prevention programmes into operation. As I said, AA, Al-Anon, Alateen, INCA and other such organisations have a pivotal role. Crisis intervention must be introduced into the workplace, the home and society in general. People become alcoholics when they reach the stage of denial and delusion, at which point they do not appreciate their problem. Something must be done to get them to come to terms with it. Crisis intervention is known as the most effective policy in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am particularly glad that it is Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe. When he was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member, we spent a great deal of time on the issue. We both take it very seriously, as does everyone in the House.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has said that she is making it her priority to address the chaos in accident and emergency units and act to free up acute hospital beds. If she takes this report seriously, she will free up approximately 25% of acute hospital beds and make a significant difference regarding what is happening in accident and emergency depart<Col N="608"/>ments. The Minister and many Members have already recounted what is going on in such units and what a serious effect on attendance the over-indulgence in alcohol is having.</P>
      <P>In my juvenile career, I worked in accident and emergency departments. It was decades ago, and, while we had trouble with people who were drunk, it was nothing like what is happening nowadays. I occasionally visit accident and emergency units to see how they are getting on. I do not go as often as I should as the staff recognise me and give out to me in no uncertain manner about their claim that I am doing little or nothing to get the problem addressed. The problem is extremely serious; as stated in the report, 38% of people under 31 admitted to accident and emergency departments were drunk. They were out of their minds, and 25% of all admissions to hospital involve the abuse of alcohol. The number of beds involved is staggering, never mind the cost.</P>
      <P>As Senator Glynn pointed out, it is not simply a matter of the cost to the health service but to the economy. He is of course only too well aware that alcohol is the second most common cause of acute admissions to psychiatric institutions, depression being the only complaint with which patients are more likely to be admitted. I was interested to see the other day that &euro;640 million is spent by the Department of Social and Family Affairs on long-term benefits for people with psychiatric illnesses, including those related to alcohol. At the same time, &euro;500 million is spent on adult psychiatric services, including the upkeep of hospitals. There is something peculiar going on there. We will not even try to achieve a reversal of those figures, which might help to do something in this area.</P>
      <P>We have concentrated a great deal on the problem but have not said too much about solutions. Many fellow members of the medical profession say we are not active enough in trying to deal with people whose main problem is obviously alcohol. We wring our hands about the situation but do little to find a solution. The statistics involved are shocking. The situation has been made clear regarding accidents, unintentional injuries and intentional injuries. The latter are important with regard to parasuicides, those brought to hospital with gastrointestinal upsets and those who proceed to more serious conditions such as cirrhosis and pancreatitis. We have also noted how many women are drinking much more, a most unwelcome development. The Minister of State may recall what Dr. Mary Holohan from the Rotunda&rsquo;s sexual assault unit told the Joint Committee on Health and Children. She stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">The pattern of ingestion of our clients has changed markedly since the middle of the 1990s. Spirits are being consumed at home before people go out. Younger clients are drinking in mixed sex groups, often in parks and abandoned buildings. While boys continue to drink beer, in the main girls are drinking undiluted spirits. Later, in clubs and bars, the <Col N="609"/>concentration of alcohol in the individual drinks being consumed is very high, often three or four units in a single drink, as the youngsters call it. Also worrying is the fact that the alcohol is mixed with stimulants. The median number of units of alcohol remembered by clients coming to us is eight, but 20% of our clients in the past three years remember ingesting 12 to 22 units of drink.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I will not query how any Member of this House might feel after such drinking, but these figures are unbelievable. Dr. Holohan went on to say that the drug Rohypnol is frequently referred to, with young people saying their drink must have been spiked. She said that the sexual assault unit does toxicology testing on all patients and has never had a positive for Rohypnol. She goes on to say, &ldquo;However, the toxicology service has remarked to us that the levels of alcohol in the samples we send are only seen in one other service &mdash; the coroner&rsquo;s office&rdquo;. That is unbelievable and truly shocking. I have seen reports of cases of young girls with blood alcohol levels of 350 mg, a staggering amount when one considers what it must do to people.</P>
      <P>Looking at this report one also sees that in the mortality figures for alcohol poisoning the percentage change from 1992 to 2002 has been nearly 100%. Those figures represent people who have died from drink, from acute poisoning, which is quite shocking. All the figures for alcohol-related mortality have risen enormously. The most important figure is for alcohol poisoning. The numbers suffering from chronic alcoholism have increased by over 60%, those from cirrhosis of the liver are up by nearly 80%, drink-related suicides are up nearly 20% and cancer deaths related to alcohol are up by about 10%.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn raised the issue of drinking by young pregnant women, which has serious effects on the foetus. There are suggestions that foetal alcohol syndrome, when the baby is born affected by alcohol to a serious extent, may be associated with attention deficit disorder later on. There may be long-term effects on the child.</P>
      <P>We must take all this very seriously. The Minister of State will recall that numerous consultants from accident and emergency units around the country spoke to us about how bad the situation was. Dr. Luke from Cork spoke of the very significant increase in the level of domestic violence as a result of alcohol abuse. Dr. Martin from Galway spoke of the fights outside fast food units. Senators Browne and Glynn noted that those drinking too much late at night do not have access to food. Perhaps we should close down the fast food units before such people arrive because it seems that people will not queue when drunk, and get into the most appalling fights, sometimes killing each other. Some 25% of people brought to hospital accident and emergency units by ambulance following accidents are there because of the abuse of alcohol. How can we get a pre-hospital emergency service running if we are <Col N="610"/>going to have such abuse of the emergency services?</P>
      <P>The recommendations made are very important. Moaning and groaning and wringing our hands is no good if we do not implement some of the recommendations. It is suggested on page 40 of the report that we should establish a national screening protocol for early identification of problem alcohol use for all relevant sectors of the health care system. That is very important. We must look at the totality of the situation. I recall people calling to me at 10 a.m. smelling like a Christmas pudding. One would need to talk to such people about what is going on. When it happened a second time I always asked, because while the incident might first have seemed frightening, the people would have got used to me on the second occasion.</P>
      <P>The report recommends the establishment of an early intervention programme in primary care to introduce and establish brief intervention as standard practice to reduce high risk and harmful drinking patterns, in other words to get general practitioners involved in discussing alcohol problems with people whom they think have such a problem.</P>
      <P>The report also recommends that for those presenting with alcohol-related problems in the emergency room and general hospital, someone should be present to address the issue. A specialist nurse is suggested so that people who are comatose on the ground will come round at some stage. One must remember that some of those comatose people will have head injuries. This is why the unfortunate accident and emergency staff must waste so much of their time taking these people&rsquo;s blood pressure, checking their eyes and so on. The time consumption is appalling in such situations, so intervention is needed in the emergency room and general hospital for those presenting with alcohol-related problems. We need to address that issue immediately, not just in acute cases, but also in chronic ones. In health clinics, excess alcohol is noted as a contributory factor in presenting conditions. The report notes the connection in this area with emergency contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, parasuicide and mental illness.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may have seen in the newspapers that the Well Woman Clinic has decided to open at the weekends from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. for emergency contraception when I presume people will have got out of bed and will attend for such contraception. In such cases it is likely that the girl and her partner may have had far more drink than was good for them, so that issue has to be addressed in such clinics and by those dealing with sexually transmitted diseases. The approach must be very broad.</P>
      <P>We also need to intervene in the area of those convicted in court of alcohol-related offences involving public order, drink driving, etc. For those under 18, there is the Garda juvenile diversion programme, the Springboard initiative and other community-based interventions. It is also <Col N="611"/>recommended that all third-level colleges provide support services &mdash; perhaps brief intervention and counselling for students as outlined in the college alcohol policy framework document.</P>
      <P>We should also require that as part of employee health and welfare considerations, there should be procedures in the workplace to address workplace alcohol-related problems. Senator Glynn mentioned absenteeism but there is also the problem of accidents in the workplace, which are frequently alcohol related.</P>
      <P>Any initiatives we introduce should be considered on an EU basis. When alcohol abuse advertising campaigns are running it is important that they do so on an all-island basis, with advertisements perhaps being shown on UTV as well as RTE, since one cannot rely on people to watch only the national channel. We must ensure good value for our advertising.</P>
      <P>The time for moaning and groaning is over. We must ask the Minister to consider what has been recommended. If she wants to resolve the problems with accident and emergency services and acute beds, the people to whom I refer are not elderly and they will not be transferred to nursing homes. They are young people who will leave hospital and who will be in a position to return home. They are occupying beds which are desperately needed for other people. We must not forget that elective operations are frequently postponed. The first thing the Minister could do to solve the problems with accident and emergency services and improve the position as regards acute beds is to address the recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who previously served as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children. I am aware of his great interest in and in-depth knowledge of alcohol and the problems relating thereto.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report, which is a great read. Since I became a Member of the Seanad, the House has discussed alcohol on more occasions than I can remember. When I pointed this out to a colleague who contributed earlier in the debate, the reply I received was that we have spoken on it so often that it would nearly drive one to drink. I do not intend to make light of a serious issue. The more we discuss this matter, the more we will highlight it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the authors of the report, one of whom comes from my health board area, on presenting us with such a detailed and good report. I was particularly impressed by the public health approach taken. It is the first occasion of which I am aware that the authors of a report on alcohol were aware they have the support of the WHO, which recognises the range of health, social and behavioural problems caused by alcohol consumption. The best and most effective alcohol policy must take into account the total amount of alcohol consumed by a community, <Col N="612"/>while bearing in mind the needs of high-risk groups and individual high-risk drinkers.</P>
      <P>My local health board, the North Western Health Board &mdash; I will not use all of my allotted time referring to it &mdash; seems to be well on the road in terms of reports on alcohol. Last week or perhaps the previous week, the health board&rsquo;s CEO, Mr. Pat Harvey, and the independent chair of the North West Alcohol Forum, Mr. Denis Bradley, who is also vice-chair of the PSNI and an alcohol addiction counsellor, visited the Houses of the Oireachtas where he met the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, and presented him with a report from the board. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children which, headed up by the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, issued a report just before the summer recess on young people and drinking. The recommendations of both reports are extremely similar. I do not know if the health board copied us or <i>vice versa</i>. However, our report went to print before the board&rsquo;s.</P>
      <P>The North Western Health Board&rsquo;s forum on alcohol came about following the first report of the Commission on Liquor Licensing. The forum came together with interested groups in the north west such as those involved in education, the Garda, the vintners and, in order to get their message across, the local radio station, and has drawn up a plan for 2005. It wants to move into primary care units and discuss issues such as detoxing in-community as opposed to doing so in hospital settings, away from which people tend to shy. Those involved want help to be given to people with acute problems. If a person has an acute problem on a Friday evening, there is nowhere for him or her to detox other than in a mental hospital. The position must change in this regard because using mental hospitals or institutions involves a particular set of problems.</P>
      <P>The forum also wants brief interventions and wants people to discuss their drinking habits. For example, a GP should be prepared to discuss with patients how much they are drinking, whether their drinking is causing arguments at home and if they are missing half or entire days at work as a result of drinking the previous night. GPs, nurses and counsellors should also be able to talk to younger people about alcohol and pregnancy. I refer here not only to young girls but also to their male counterparts. As everyone is aware, it takes a man to make a woman pregnant. I was intrigued to hear Senator Glynn state that such a high percentage of women drink when they are pregnant. I did not realise the figure was that high. As a woman, I would have thought people, particularly when they are pregnant, would be more responsible. He stated his views would be similar if men were able to carry children.</P>
      <P>The Sligo group also referred to liaison nurses being appointed in acute hospitals. This recommendation is also contained in the national report. It asked the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague to establish the north-west group as a pilot group. <Col N="613"/>The Minister of State is aware that I will push the interests of my local group as much as possible but I must reiterate that the North Western Health Board is ahead of the posse. The group is already in place and has an agreed understanding of the problem and the project on hand. The liaison nurse in accident and emergency is part of its plan for 2005. She will deal with issues surrounding mental health such as self-harm &mdash; which will be followed up on &mdash; and also alcohol problems. She will also deal with the general hospital in terms of how it deals with problems that arise each week.</P>
      <P>The group has a major understanding of what is involved and has identified areas to which reference has already been made during this debate. One of these concerns the difficulties involving early school leavers. There are strong indications that such young people are more likely to become involved not only with alcohol but also drugs. In my opinion we should group the two together because they are both addictive and equally harmful. Female early school leavers are probably more likely to become pregnant than their counterparts who remain in education. The group also identified the fact that early school leavers will become involved in crime, either early or later on in their lives. Major emphasis should be placed on retaining people in education. The group to which I refer has had involvement from educators, parents and other interested bodies.</P>
      <P>Other people referred to the fact that those most at risk &mdash; this message should be driven home to parents &mdash; are the under 15s. We must face the fact that society has changed since we were young. We did not drink before 15 years of age. When one approached the legal age for drinking, one would certainly indulge. However, one would not dare go home afterwards. The position now is different. Parents should consider that perhaps under 15s should not be allowed to work. I do not wish to deny anybody pocket money, babysitting money or whatever. However, the fact that people have too much money is only fuelling the problem. Everyone is aware of the huge risks to the health of those of 15 years of age or younger if they are constantly drinking.</P>
      <P>The task force&rsquo;s report highlights the fact that the main problem is the conflict between Departments, a matter which has often been discussed here. The House has frequently discussed the need to gel Departments for the betterment of society. Regardless of whether the issue is under age drinking or drinking among adults, we must knock our heads together and get on with dealing with it. Given the goodwill among the public in this respect, we must get the show on the road.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member, issued fantastic recommendations on the issue of alcohol consumption. These should be considered alongside those of the report of the national task force on alcohol, some of which overlap. Among our recommendations was the establishment of a central control agency to co-ordinate Departments such as <Col N="614"/>Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      <P>We need to discuss with the new Minister for Finance the possibility of increasing the price of alco-pops by as much as 100%.</P>

	<P>I withdraw my remark. The Cathaoirleach is more than generous and kind to me on all occasions.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate which concentrates on the second alcohol task force report. It is important that the House regularly inform itself about Government policy and the progress being made in this area. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and thank him for attending this important debate. It is easier to have a rational, thought-out debate on matters of this nature in this House than in the other House given the political argy-bargy which takes place in the latter on regular occasions. The Seanad is a particularly useful and adept forum for dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Feeney raised the issue of providing a multi-faceted response to the problem. She is correct that it concerns more than one Department. Given the range of Departments involved, a number of Ministers should sit in on future debates, where possible, because one Department cannot take a lead role in this area.</P>
      <P>It is staggering that Ireland has recorded the highest increase in alcohol consumption among European Union countries and that, as the Minister of State noted, <i>per capita</i> alcohol consumption increased by 41% over the period between 1990 and 2002. We have the second highest <i>per capita</i> consumption of alcohol in the EU. Why are more and more people drinking greater volumes of alcohol? It does not matter how many strategic task forces are in place or how many Departments respond in their functionalist way <Col N="615"/>to the problem, society must address the reasons people are drinking more.</P>
      <P>People are using alcohol to fill gaps in their lives which did not exist in the past. The increase in alcohol consumption is not only fuelled by much greater purchasing power but by real needs, which may be psychiatric, the result of a missing link or the loss of certain characteristics of society. We must address the reasons an increasing number of younger people are drinking large amounts of alcohol. As the Minister of State said, a large proportion of total alcohol consumption occurs as a result of binge drinking.</P>
      <P>The effects of alcohol consumption are well known. As a constituency representative, one of the issues I encounter, which has not been raised but needs to be addressed, is domestic violence. We do not speak loudly enough about domestic violence which is fuelled by drink and is causing untold havoc in many families from various income brackets. On the Order of Business, Senator Terry referred to the considerable increase in the number of women calling the Women&rsquo;s Aid helpline. The reason is the rising incidence of domestic violence, an issue we must place at the top of our priorities.</P>
      <P>Another issue we need to address, one on which many people have a view, is the crisis in the accident and emergency departments of our acute hospitals in Dublin and other cities. The pilot study carried out by the Mater Hospital in 2002, to which the Minister of State also referred, showed that alcohol was a contributory factor in one in four patients attending accident and emergency departments. This matter must be addressed.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State noted, the research in question indicated that 30% of male admissions, 10% of female admissions and almost 25% of accident and emergency attendees met the diagnostic criteria for alcohol misuse or dependency. I hold the old-fashioned and perhaps unattractive view that those who attend accident and emergency wards in acute hospitals because they are drunk should not be given priority when it is necessary to attend to other patients. It is a scandal that frequently those attended to first are raucous patients who continually put pressure on staff and other patients. One need only attend any accident and emergency department in this city at any time on a Friday or Saturday night to see that large numbers of people are in attendance because of a form of self-abuse, namely, getting out of their heads with drink. It is not right or proper that other people attending hospital because they are sick should have to wait in a queue while such people are dealt with first.</P>
      <P>Some form of financial penalty should be imposed on those who regularly attend accident and emergency departments while drunk. It is a disgrace that they put so much pressure on our medical services and security personnel. A large number of people are lying on trolleys in our accident and emergency departments, many of them <Col N="616"/>acutely sick, who must put up with mayhem on the wards on a nightly basis. This is unsustainable and wrong and society must take a firm position on the issue.</P>
      <P>We cannot continue to tell people that such problems can be sorted out by task force reports. They must be sorted out by ensuring people take responsibility for their actions. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, in consultation with his colleagues in the Department of Health and Children, to ensure that patients attending accident and emergency wards because they are sick rather than drunk are prioritised. We have a responsibility to develop measures for those in real need of support.</P>
      <P>I agree with other Senators that it will be necessary to implement the recommendation in the first and second task force reports to raise awareness of the problems associated with drunkenness and drunken behaviour by introducing a targeted marketing campaign. This public health issue needs to be addressed at all levels of society. I support the Government&rsquo;s amendments to the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill to enable much harsher penalties to be imposed on those driving at night while drunk. We must be strong in this area. I strongly support the recommendation that we deal with the issue of alcohol marketing and take a strong stance with sports organisations that seek funding exclusively in this area. The progress made in recent years is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>This is a much wider problem than simply implementing a number of recommendations. People must take responsibility for their actions. It does not matter how many fine reports are produced because unless we can inculcate personal responsibility into people&rsquo;s behaviour, we will not secure a change of attitude to alcohol. I compliment the Government on its work so far in this area but more needs to be done. This House has a pivotal role in terms of surveying that work on a constant basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator White.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and I look forward to working with him over the coming years. We had the opportunity to speak on alcohol-related issues last week during the debate on the intoxicating liquor legislation. I wish to reiterate some of the points that were made.</P>
      <P>I commend the strategic task force on alcohol. It has made great progress in recent years and in this report has made a number of tangible recommendations which we should embrace and seek to implement at the earliest opportunity. This nation and consecutive Administrations, regardless of party composition, have failed miserably in tackling this issue over the years. Successive Administrations might have believed they were doing their best to deal with the issues but they have <Col N="617"/>consistently tried to deal with the symptoms rather than the bigger issue, which is culture. I am glad there are strategic task forces on alcohol to facilitate us examining the issues until we get to the root causes of the culture and seek ways to reverse the desperate things it does to society.</P>
      <P>With regard to dealing with the symptoms, we persist in looking at opening times, closing times and accessibility to alcohol. While the task force recommendations include reducing accessibility to alcohol, I am unsure if this is the correct way to proceed. One tends to want what one cannot have. The report contains comparisons to the Continent where alcohol is consumed more slowly, in smaller quantities and generally with a meal. We aspire to that but I do not believe our culture is ready for it. In our culture drink is to be hidden away and children are not to be let anywhere near it. It should be made less accessible. I am concerned about that because I fear it could increase the mystique associated with alcohol and, therefore, enhance its attraction for young people who will want to try it at an early age. We are aware of the damaging effects in that regard.</P>
      <P>Changes to licensing laws to create a caf&eacute; culture is another instance of looking at the continental model. That model would be fantastic but I do not believe Ireland is ready for it. In fact, we might abuse it. A total of 14,000 licences in the country is more than enough. If we want to tweak the system while keeping accessibility to a reasonable limit, we should encourage those licensees to carry out their business in a different way, perhaps, and try to lead it towards a caf&eacute; type culture.</P>
      <P>With regard to a national identification card, in my maiden speech in the House I called for the introduction of such a card. It should be introduced as soon as possible. There would be many other benefits associated with it, not least in terms of age and identification checks when entering licensed premises. It should be the same as the system in the United States where the checks are random. Whether one is 60 or 16 years of age, one can be asked on a random basis for identification. That reduces any embarrassment or stigma attached to being asked for identification, regardless of one&rsquo;s age.</P>
      <P>An interesting suggestion which should be considered is the introduction of legislation to dictate the potency of alcoholic beverages in this country, whereby they need not necessarily be 4% or 5% pure alcohol. There might be merit in considering a basic maximum. The alcohol content of beers is 5% and 6%, while it is 12% for wine and up to 40% for brandy. Perhaps we have alcoholic beverages on the market that are much too potent. It would be innovative at least to look at this area.</P>
      <P>With regard to dealing with the culture for young people, it must begin with education. There are many beneficial schemes in place to educate young people about the harmful effects of alcohol. However, what is needed is an aggressive advertising campaign which would <Col N="618"/>demonstrate the sheer chaos endemic in society at present. It could show the utter destruction it causes to families, the hopelessness of young people who have been subjected to or fallen into the trap of alcohol abuse and the desolation it brings to families and the tragic consequences. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on this subject and on the hidden Ireland left parents bewildered, young people embarrassed and the drinks industry exposed. It is a sorry saga.</P>
      <P>The highest level of binge drinking in Europe is among young people in Ireland. It was mentioned earlier that one in four people attending accident and emergency departments throughout the country do so as a result of alcohol. I believe the number is higher. The cost of dealing with alcohol related illness is &euro;2.4 billion per annum. What would that money do for the schools building programme, for example, or in providing more sports facilities for young people?</P>
      <P>There is an onus on everybody, particularly parents, to offer alternative night life activities to children, whether that is through sporting organisations or otherwise, and to glamorise them so young people will want to go to them. These should not be about alcohol and getting drunk. Parents need to incentivise children along this route. They need to de-glamorise alcohol while glamorising what is alcohol free. There should be an onus on movie producers, entertainment celebrities, actors and so forth in this regard. In films we watch fictional characters who are healthy, athletic, good looking, courageous and talented, yet they are addicted to alcohol or nicotine. That is not possible in the real world but these are the characters that are displayed. I am grateful for the opportunity to make those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment. I am delighted for him. It is well deserved and a great honour for him and his constituents in north Kildare.</P>
      <P>A recent study showed that adults in Ireland had the highest reported consumption per drinker and the highest level of binge drinking in comparison to adults in other European countries. One of the consequences of this, which I intend to discuss, is alcohol-related mortality. In the past ten years in Ireland, alcohol-related mortality has increased. Over that time, 14,233 people have died from six main alcohol related causes, which included cancers related to alcohol, chronic alcohol conditions, alcohol dependency, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, alcohol poisoning and suicide. The Irish water safety organisation says that 30% of all deaths from drowning were alcohol related.</P>
      <P>Alcohol use during pregnancy is a growing concern because of the damage that can be done to the baby, especially during the early stages of pregnancy when the central nervous system is developing. A recent study of women attending an Irish maternity hospital reported that 85% of the women continued to drink during pregnancy.</P><Col N="619"/>
      <P>The report of the strategic task force on alcohol spells out the recommendations. However, as the Minister stated in his contribution:</P>
      <P LI="1">The task ahead of us as a Government and as a society must not be underestimated. Introducing a climate where a cultural change can take place is a considerable challenge. . .</P>
      <P FLI="0">I would like the Government to do what the former Minister for Health and Children did in regard to smoking. It is a pleasure for me to go into the D&aacute;il bar to have a cup of tea and a sandwich. Previously, I could only get as far as the door due to the wave of smoke. While I gave up smoking 20 years ago, I have sympathy for those who smoke but find it difficult to give up. However, I am glad I can now enjoy the benefit of an extra refreshment area in the Houses. Despite the fact that sales in public houses have dropped, the industry has a chance to develop a nice environment where people can go for coffee or a meal.</P>
      <P>I regularly visit Northern Ireland. It fascinates me that, in the North, one is offered a cup of tea whereas at a meeting or social occasion in the Republic, drink is offered. There is an acceptance of alcohol and the figures from the task force suggest we have a serious problem.</P>
      <P>Last week, a relation of mine attended a football match in Greece involving an English team. Following the match, the Greeks drank cups of coffee but the English drank beer. We must deal with this issue and the need to have drink on every occasion. Given the vision shown by the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the current Minister, Deputy Harney, should tackle this issue and try to change the cultural acceptance of alcohol. As Senator MacSharry noted, drinkers in other countries sip their drinks and enjoy them while those in Ireland drink very quickly. The point is not that we intend to be spoilsports but that alcohol is a dangerous drug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to the House and welcome the enthusiasm I am sure he will show in this portfolio, as he has on other matters. I wholeheartedly endorse the recommendations of the task force and urge the Government to give priority to implementing them. However, I urge this without much hope it will actually happen. My pessimism springs from an examination of the recommendations contained in the task force&rsquo;s first report of over two years ago. The Government increased alcohol prices but many of the other recommendations have still to be implemented. In particular, the three key recommendations in regard to road safety have been completely ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="620"/>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>They were to introduce random breath testing, to reduce the blood alcohol limit to the European norm and to reduce that limit to zero in the case of drivers with a provisional licence. That none of those recommendations have been implemented is a scandal. No doubt, we will hear again in this debate ministerial promises that random breath testing is on the way. My response is that I will believe it when I see it in action. It is almost three years since I devoted my Private Members&rsquo; time on 21 November 2001 to a motion calling on the Government to introduce random breath testing without further delay. I thought I received a positive response but, three years later, we are still in the realm of promises.</P>
      <P>With regard to one of the task force&rsquo;s recommendations, which concerns controlling the promotion of alcohol, the report rightly points out: &ldquo;Alcohol advertising promotes and reinforces positive attitudes about drinking and portrays drinking as fun, glamorous and risk free.&rdquo; In Ireland, research showed that children were strongly attracted to alcohol advertising and that young people believed advertisements were targeted at their age group. The report also stated: &ldquo;More recent research reports that alcohol sports sponsorship has an effect similar to alcohol advertising.&rdquo; While large sums were mentioned by Senator MacSharry, according to the report, in 2002 no less than &euro;43.2 million was spent in Ireland on alcohol advertising and God knows how much more on sponsorship.</P>
      <P>I have a specific proposal in regard to spending on advertising and sponsorship. I suggest that the Government impose a 100% levy on all spending by alcohol producers on advertising and sponsorship and that it ring-fences the yield from that levy for spending on advertising and educational initiatives that highlight the dangers of excessive drinking and the attractions of a lifestyle that avoids it.</P>
      <P>We are engaged in a battle for the hearts and minds of the people in an effort to change what are now deeply ingrained patterns in how we live. How we change attitudes is in our own hands but it cannot all be done by law. We need a focused marketing campaign. I suggest this be undertaken with the money gained if we impose a 100% levy on the advertising of alcohol. We should then ring-fence that money and use it to promote the benefits of healthy, alcohol-free living. The least we can do in this battle is meet the promotional force of the alcohol producers on equal terms. Under my proposal, doing so would cost the State nothing whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Other proposals have been made during the debate. It was suggested that every unit sold from an off-licence should be labelled with the name and address of the off-licence. This should not be considered because it is not possible to prove an off-licence sold the alcohol to a young person. If young people were found with labelled alcohol, it could have been stolen from home or an adult might have bought it. Such a measure would be difficult to prove and would not have much <Col N="621"/>benefit. In saying that, I declare an interest as the owner of a number of off-licences in supermarkets.</P>
      <P>Some matters cannot be solved by legislation, as was mentioned when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in the House last week. In that debate, I referred to a visit to Salt Lake City in Utah, where my wife and I joined another couple for a meal in a restaurant. When I ordered white wine and my wife ordered red wine, my host told me this was awkward because the law in Utah states that one cannot have two bottles of alcohol on a table at one time in a restaurant. I had not known this but, being a gentleman, I switched to red wine. When we finished that, we switched to white wine. I mention this to illustrate my point that we should not try to solve every matter by legislation. Let us find a way to persuade the population of the benefits of being free of drink.</P>
      <P>The report is quite right on the figures. We have the second highest consumption of alcohol in Europe, Luxembourg being the only country with a higher rate. However, an interesting statistic is that we have more teetotallers and Pioneers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 22%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Therefore, when we measure per head of population we are in second place, but, if we measure per amount of alcohol per drinker, we jump into first place with a far higher consumption rate than others. The average rate of consumption per person is approximately nine litres. However, if Pioneers and total abstainers, who represent a sizeable group in Ireland, are removed, the rate of consumption is much higher. The Pioneers among us will understand this point.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>A challenge faces us. While we should not assume all aspects of it will be dealt with by law, some issues can be dealt with by law. The report contains recommendations which can be acted upon, for example, in regard to random testing. We must also work to persuade the nation, particularly the young, of the disadvantages and dangers of using alcohol. My proposal is for a 100% levy on all alcohol advertising, with the funds raised being ring-fenced and invested in promoting the benefits of not using alcohol. This would produce a win-win situation. It would cost the State nothing. It would diminish the amount of money spent on advertising and promoting alcohol and would give us an equal amount of money, one for one, for those who are promoting a better lifestyle.</P>

      <P>When somebody like me says anything about alcohol it is pointed out that I have a Pioneer pin and must therefore be anti this, that and the other <Col N="622"/>and certainly anti-alcohol. I welcome this very detailed and in-depth report.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Power, for attending. This is his second crack at the Seanad in one afternoon.</P>
      <P>Many Senators have taken a great interest in the situations in both Iraq and Palestine and I tabled this motion in the hope that they would have an opportunity to contribute to it. I thank Senator Norris for seconding it. I will speak mainly on Iraq, on which he will also speak, but his knowledge of Palestine is probably greater than any of ours.</P>
      <P>The bank holiday this week gave me a chance to listen to radio programmes which I do not usually get a chance to hear. I heard a man called P. J. O&rsquo;Rourke on the BBC World Service. He is an American, I presume of Irish descent, who has written a book about the great derring-do of President George W. Bush in Iraq. He thinks it is all going fairly well and that we are all being very <Col N="623"/>negative about the whole situation. He used phrases like &ldquo;Iraq is an evil country&rdquo; and &ldquo;Islamists hate us, they are bad people&rdquo;. He was being interviewed by a British person and he gave British people some praise because they gave support to the invasion of Iraq, but he saw the rest of us as being pretty hopeless. However, he said something which I thought was interesting, that because the rest of Europe was not involved, the United States missed the wise counsel it might otherwise have received. I hope the Department of Foreign Affairs could consider some of the wise counsel which might be useful even at this late stage in this appalling war.</P>
      <P>The first thing I want to address is the situation regarding Shannon. I will not ask the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to stop planes carrying military forces from landing in Shannon because it has been made plain that this is business and these flights have been going on for years. The Taoiseach does not think it offends our neutrality although other people believe it does. I am not alone in considering it wrong to send people through one of our major airports to an illegal war.</P>
      <P>The situation I wish to address is the possible transfer of prisoners to Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo Bay has not only been declared illegal by the international community because it operates outside the terms of the Geneva Convention, but it has also been declared illegal by courts in the United States of America. In fact, three members of a military tribunal which is to try people who have been kept there for years without trial, some of whom have been subjected to torture, have been dismissed because they were considered unsuitable.</P>
      <P>On 26 June this year during the concluding Stages of the Transfer of Execution of Sentences Act, I asked the Minister, Deputy McDowell, what was the situation regarding untried and unsentenced people who might be going through Shannon. He said they would be subject to our Constitution if they landed on our soil and that if I had any further information on this situation I should give it to him. I do not have any further information, apart from the fact that in articles by Fintan O&rsquo;Toole on 28 September in <i>The Irish Times</i> and Vincent Browne in the first edition of his magazine, <i>Village</i>, they suggested that an unmarked Gulfstream jet registered as N379P had been seen in Shannon. This plane had already been used to take two Egyptians from Sweden to an unknown destination and had also transported people from other places in Europe to elsewhere. The jet is owned by an unlisted American company and, as the headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> article asked, &ldquo;Are we now party to kidnap?&rdquo; We have to ask if the American authorities are transporting people to Guantanamo Bay through Shannon Airport. They do not give us any manifests but after what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said, there is an obligation on the Government to tell people if <Col N="624"/>this is happening. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to undertake this important task.</P>
      <P>The second matter I wish to address relates to prisoners being held in Iraq. Over 9,000 prisoners have been held for over 18 months without being charged and without trial. I am sure Members of the House will have read <i>A Secret History of the IRA</i> by Ed Moloney. He makes the point in it that internment was the most effective recruitment tool for the IRA and resulted in even more new recruits than the burning of Bombay Street. I suggest that what the Americans are perpetuating in Iraq is a most serious own goal. Saddam Hussein used to intern people without trial and many such people disappeared. Many people in Iraq cannot find out where family members or friends have gone. For them it is very much a return to the good old days when the same thing took place. It is against international law to transfer people out of the country but the Americans have admitted to it. There may be really good strategic and political reasons for keeping people in prison, but I cannot understand why so many are being kept there. They could be described as hostages to fortune because as we have seen in the past their release has sometimes been requested by terrorists in return for hostages.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue recently in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> regarding the imprisonment of two women scientists, Dr. Ammash and Dr. Taha. Dr. Ammash earned her doctorate in microbiology from the University of Missouri in 1983 and she got a Masters degree from Texas Women&rsquo;s University in 1979. Dr. Taha received postgraduate education in the University of East Anglia and she too worked on plant pathogens. They admitted they worked in the biological warfare department of Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s regime.</P>
      <P>They were very well known on the international stage because they bought anthrax from America and equipment and supplies from America and Europe. That was in the good old days when the United States and other Western governments were best friends with Iraq as it was attacking Iran. Are they in fact being kept where they are because of what they might say about their previous work in these two countries if they came out? The United Kingdom has said it no longer has biological weapons but the United States has not said what it is doing about anything. It pulled out of the completion of the verification process of the United Nations convention on bio-terrorism when President Bush was elected. It is the only country where people died of anthrax poisoning in recent years. That came from a military source but has never been properly investigated.</P>
      <P>More hostages are taken from the Iraqi population than from any other country. While it is quite right to appeal for the release of Western hostages, the extraordinarily good woman, Margaret Hassan, who was taken recently, would, I am sure, want us to appeal on behalf of everyone else. Chaos, mayhem and murder occur every <Col N="625"/>day for Iraqi citizens. Madeline Hadi, a nine year old was taken from her father&rsquo;s car the other day, Zinah Hassan was taken on the way back to secondary school, Asma, a young engineer, was taken while out shopping with her mother and a male relative. A total of 250 university professors and scientists have been killed, 12 of the 14 journalists killed were Iraqi and 100 doctors have been killed or kidnapped. We must show more sensitivity, the Americans particularly, because the Iraqis feel people do not matter unless they come from the West. The Iraqi Department of Health has stopped issuing the number of Iraqis killed each day; that should re-start.</P>
      <P>The economic occupation is a disgrace and should end at once. Coalition Provisional Authority Order No. 39, brought in on 19 September 2003 by Paul Bremer, allowed anyone to buy anything in Iraq. Initially, they said mineral rights could not be included but now they are to be included and even Prime Minister Allawi recently suggested that oil assets might be up for sale as well. The building of the enduring bases should also stop. Iraqis see these as a continuing operation that will go on forever and it is terrifying for other countries in the region to see this taking place. The Saudi Arabian bases are closed down. They should stop talking about imposing our values on Iraqis. A Turkish journalist who was kidnapped recently said those who kidnapped her were not fighting for Iraq but for Islam.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State could also ask the Americans to accept help when it is offered. For example, the United Nations nuclear inspectors from Vienna wanted to continue supervising in Iraq. This was refused and now 380 tonnes of highly volatile munitions have been taken. They should also start giving money for reconstruction to Iraqi firms and stop giving it to Haliburton. Congress promised $85 billion for the reconstruction of Iraq, a few billion have been spent and $5 billion taken for security. This is robbing the Iraqi people of things they have been promised and I see no reason the Irish Government cannot point this out to the Americans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I hope he listens in detail to what is said because we are going to give him some advice on this situation. I am very glad that the motion put down by my colleague, Senator Henry, refers to how the Government can help. There are many ways it can help in Iraq and Palestine. I will not rehearse all that I have said before. The war is perfectly illegal. We have debated this on many occasions. It has not even achieved its own objectives. We were told it was to make the world safe and remove al-Qaeda but it has spread this infection all over the place. There was no al-Qaeda in Iraq. The Americans have violated their own constitution. There was a necessity to demonstrate a clear and present danger but that was not done. There were no weapons of mass destruction. These arguments have all been made.</P><Col N="626"/>
      <P>I am very glad that Senator Henry took up the question of the Gulfstream aeroplane. I have raised this on numerous occasions. I would like the Minister to commit to doing something about it because we are complicit in an international war crime. It did not feature only in<i> The Irish Times</i> from which Senator Henry quoted. There was also a very interesting article in <i>Village</i> identifying the plane as one which has been used by the US Government to transport the victims of kidnapping. I have mentioned this before and I want the Minister to investigate it. The articles states: &ldquo;On 18 December, 2001 US operatives kidnapped Ahmed Agiza and Muhammed Al-Zery, Egyptian exiles who had requested asylum in Sweden.&rdquo; They were forced on to this aeroplane in Sweden. This is the aircraft that lands frequently in Shannon Airport. The identifying marks have been read out here this evening. The two prisoners had their clothes removed from their bodies with a scissors, a suppository inserted into their anus and diapers placed on them. Their hands and feet were chained to a specially designed harness and they travelled blindfolded and hooded.</P>
      <P>Once in detention in Eqypt local interrogators fastened electrodes to the prisoner&rsquo;s genitals, breast nipples, tongue, ear lobes and underarms. There were doctors present to judge how much torture the prisoners could withstand. The exposed parts were anointed, so that there would not be marks and scars and cold water was poured to stop blood clots.</P>
      <P>Why has the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not been sent onto that aeroplane? I want that done. This Minister, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government stand indicted because they cannot say they did not know about this. This is happening. The Garda has the right to go on board. Why is that not happening? We are complicit in war crimes and it is not good enough for the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to brush it off and say we received &euro;25 million. That does not excuse the use of Shannon Airport for exporting people not to Guantanamo Bay, but to Jordan and Egypt. I would like this investigated very quickly.</P>
      <P>Almost all the people involved in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2002 were Saudi Arabian. The Wahabi religion is Saudi Arabian. The money trail led there and the Saudis bombed Iraq. How logical is that? That is the context of the war. If the Minister wants to do any good he can advise the Americans not to bomb Falluja. They are getting ready to do that as we speak. It will be another catastrophic mistake.</P>
      <P>I indicated that I would spend most of my time discussing Palestine and I am grateful that Senator Henry suggested I do so. I recommend to the Minister a report by Christian Aid called Facts on the Ground: the end of the two-state solution? There is a parallel abuse of human rights going on in Israel. I am not anti-Semitic. Authority after authority quoted in this docu<Col N="627"/>ment was sourced among Israeli Jewish academics and human rights workers. One could hardly accuse them of being anti-Semitic. There is significant violation of human rights. There are offences against the fourth Geneva Convention, such as collective punishment, the murder of children and indiscriminate bombing.</P>
      <P>There is something we can do. In the European Union there is an external association treaty with the state of Israel which has certain human rights provisions attached. These articles require that the agreement be suspended if there are violations. Why does this Government not use its position to try to ensure that human rights actually mean something in Europe, that they are not just paper, that children cannot be murdered wholesale, civilian populations terrorised, and ghettos created, which I have seen in Jerusalem? This is not just my word. It is used by distinguished Israeli Jewish commentators yet for the sake of money we are not prepared to act as we should and make sure that these international instruments are operated in the human rights dimension. That is my second suggestion.</P>
      <P>My first suggestion is that this plane be investigated. The second is that we operate the human rights protocols of the external association agreement with Israel. My third suggestion is to place information on the record that has been put in my hands by my former partner, Ezra Yitzhak, about what occurred on 30 September 2004 at 6 a.m. in the village of Twane near South Hebron. Schoolchildren and the Christian and Jewish human rights workers that were accompanying them to try to protect them from the attentions of the illegal settlers were viciously attacked. Two of them, Kim in her forties and Chris in his thirties, both from the US, were attacked and seriously injured. This is a situation we should take to heart. I am prepared to give the Minister the document I have, which is a contemporaneous note from my telephone conversation with Ezra on this issue. This is a situation that should go to our hearts because it is directly parallel to the situation that we all got so worked up about in the Holycross convent in Belfast, yet this is much worse. The Minister will remember that case where the school children were attacked by Protestant paramilitaries. Much worse is happening in Israel and we are doing absolutely nothing about it.</P>
      <P>We now have a suggestion that Mr. Sharon will remove some of the settlements. That is a good thing I suppose, but it is a cosmetic exercise. What will be left is a truncated state, surrounded by Israel and completely impotent and ineffective. As Professor Avi Shlaim, a distinguished Israeli commentator, said:</P>
      <P LI="1">What Mr. Sharon envisages is an emasculated and demilitarised Palestinian entity, built on less than half the land of the Occupied Territories, with Israel in control of its borders, air-space and water resources. This is a recipe for a ghetto, not a free country.</P><Col N="628"/>
      <P FLI="0">That quote is from an Israeli professor of international law. The illegal settlements, which began in 1967, now contain up to 400,000 settlers. Unfortunately, this was one of the defects of the Oslo agreement. It was corrupt from the beginning as its initial calculations from the maps drawn accepted the plainly illegal settlements. I again quote Professor Shlaim, who is a professor at St. Anthony&rsquo;s College, Oxford:</P>
      <P LI="1">The subsequent decline of the Oslo peace process was caused more by Israeli territorial expansionism than by Palestinian terrorism. Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Sharon&rsquo;s Government continues to expand, are the root of the problem.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Here again is something that needs to be examined. The whole expropriation is based on a very shaky and corrupt legal process. Professor David Kretzmer, professor of international law at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said:</P>
      <P LI="1">The connection between widening the scope of State land and the settlement policy of the Likud Government is quite explicit; although purporting to preserve the right of the public in State land, such land was regarded as a resource to be used for the resettlement of nationals of the occupying power. This is quite illegal.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I could continue to quote these points, but it would be redundant. I commend this report to the Minister. They do not even count how many children have been killed. There is no investigation of the murder of children. It is just intolerable. Again, no one can say that I am anti-Israeli. The issue of land is something to which we in Ireland can respond. A farmer from Tulkarem, which I have visited, said:</P>
      <P LI="1">From January you need to fertilize olives, but I was not allowed to get to my olive grove for long enough. Olives need continuous care. Neglect cause weeds to take hold, they get dry and settlers burn them and damage the trees. Last year I could see the destruction, but I could not reach the trees to save them.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Some 3,670 acres of land have been confiscated and 102,320 olive trees destroyed to create the notorious wall.</P>
      <P>We must bear in mind those wonderful people who stood up against ethnic cleansing, against apartheid and against the creation of ghettos. We must bear in mind people like Rachel Corrie, who was murdered by the Israeli army, Jamie Miller, an unarmed reporter who was murdered by the Israeli army, and those wonderful Israeli Jewish people who protect human rights. There are people like the Physicians for Human Rights, whose work I have also seen, and my friend Ezra.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise three points with the Minister. First, the use of the aeroplane referred to by both Senator Henry and I is part of an international criminal conspiracy and we are now complicit in international war crimes. It is urgent that the <Col N="629"/>Minister ask the Garda to board this plane when it arrives in Shannon. We must investigate the circumstances on board. Second, we must urge our colleagues in Europe to operate the human rights clauses of the external association agreement. Finally, I ask the Minister to take up with the Israeli authorities, through the Israeli ambassador who is a decent man, the situation in the village of Twane in South Hebron, the facts of which I will hand to him before I leave the Chamber this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It is my first occasion that he has graced us with his presence for an international debate, in which this House has a long and illustrious tradition. I compliment my friends and colleagues on the Independent benches, Senator Henry and Senator Norris, for bringing this debate to the House at this time. I appreciate the non-contentious wording of the motion, which I think all of us can embrace on all sides of the House. It is often said in legal terms that the devil is in the detail.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I could not help but refer to a comment that<?oasys [jy?>Harvey Morris made in the<i> Financial Times </i>on 11 October 2004:</P>
      <P LI="1">Whoever takes over in Washington next week needs to explain to the Israeli leadership, because the Palestinians have already been told, that the world can no longer afford this running sore, this renewed contract for conflict, which is now set to run for at least another generation.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is in that context that this debate and others take place. One can only despair at the amount of rhetoric that has been generated by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, increasingly since the invasion of Iraq last year, with volumes of books, articles, newspapers and political debates about the rights and wrongs of that particular event.</P>
      <P>I repeat what I said last week in the House. I really believe that it is only contributing to a somewhat sterile debate to constantly refer to what happened regarding the consequences and circumstances surrounding the invasion of Iraq. This House has repeatedly made its position clear. I am on the record in this House as being critical of American foreign policy in this area, especially under the Bush Administration, which has adopted a unilateral approach to international relations under the pretext that American interests come first. This is fine and right and proper, but they seem to indicate that they are living in their own world and on their own planet and that the rest of us do not matter. In fact, the key element of the debate between Senator Kerry and President Bush is about America&rsquo;s international relations and the way in which it will try to repair the very real damage that has been done as a result of the unilateral policies of the Bush Administration.</P><Col N="630"/>
      <P>Senator Norris always speaks passionately and eloquently about the horrors of the loss of innocent life. There is nothing more emotive than to refer to women and children as casualties of war. It is an emotive subject. I was horrified, as I am sure the rest of the watching world was, by the massacre of more than 40 young Iraqi police trainees by their own people last week. The massacre encapsulates the unfolding tragedy in that sad country. One cannot blame the Americans or the British for that. I suggested at the outset that we should no longer focus on what happened last year. It is now a matter of history because it has been done. We should now consider how the international community will deal with the reality on the ground in Iraq.</P>
      <P>In proposing this motion, Senators Henry and Norris referred to Shannon Airport in the context of the crisis in Iraq. I understand that the airport is used on a regular basis by over 38 airforces. The Government&rsquo;s decision to allow overflights by other countries and refuelling rights at Shannon Airport was based as much on the need for trust between friendly countries as it was on the legal basis on which the decision was taken by the Oireachtas. I do not doubt for a moment anything Senator Norris said about aeroplane markings, but it would have been useful if he had quoted his sources. He probably received his information from people of a particular political persuasion who are in Shannon. I do not doubt the credibility of such people, but it would have been helpful if Senator Norris had quoted the exact source of his information.</P>
      <P>The trust which exists between friendly nations should be maintained because it is paramount. The international image of Ireland is of a non-aligned country with a proud record of peacekeeping and advancing human rights. It has earned that image because successive Governments have taken a measured and realistic view of Ireland&rsquo;s role in world affairs. In other words, we have cut our cloth according to our measure. Ireland is not a military power, but a small country on the periphery of Europe. We do not do wars &mdash; we do human rights, overseas development and peacekeeping, which we do very well.</P>
      <P>While Ireland needs to protect its image abroad, it also has obligations to its people at home. It would be intolerable for the Government to direct the Garda or the Army to insist on searching every aeroplane which lands at Shannon Airport. One should consider, in the context of the remarks which were made, that all US troops brought through the airport are transported by commercial, rather than military, aircraft. Commercial decisions to refuel at Shannon Airport are taken by companies which have been employed by the US Government to carry troops. Such companies refuel their aircraft at other locations such as Frankfurt, which is in a country which fell out bitterly with the United States because of its attitude to the war in Iraq. That international relationship has yet to be repaired.</P><Col N="631"/>
      <P>If Ireland is complicit in an illegal war, why did its supposed military allies in the US not include it in the coalition of the willing? Ireland was specifically excluded from the list of countries involved in the coalition of the willing when the US was making decisions on tendering for contracts for the restructuring and reconstruction of Iraq. The countries included on the list were those which were considered to have been complicit with, or allied to, the US invasion of Iraq. The question I have asked is a fair one, especially as Ireland is friendly with the United States.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il, in the context of a debate on refuelling and landing rights, that Ireland&rsquo;s two most important bilateral relationships are with Britain and the United States. That is an historical fact, as well as an economic and practical reality. We have to live in the real world, but that does not mean we should compromise our principles. I have explained the context in which Ireland meets its international obligations. Nobody suggests for a moment that we are warmongers, or that we are complicit in any way with what is happening in Iraq. Many other non-aligned and neutral European countries, such as Sweden, have taken a particular line on Iraq. I spoke to Swedish officials about matters of mutual interest in this area when I was in Sweden last week.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss Palestine and Israel, particularly the Israeli defence force&rsquo;s demolition of houses in Rafah which has been the subject of global attention in recent months. A report published by Human Rights Watch states that the Israeli military has demolished over 2,500 Palestinian houses in the occupied Gaza Strip over the last four years. Over two thirds of the demolished houses were in Rafah, which is a densely populated refugee camp and city at the southern end of the Gaza Strip near the border with Egypt. Most of the 16,000 people, or more than 10% of Rafah&rsquo;s population, who have lost their homes are refugees. Many of them have been dispossessed for a second or third time. Major General Yom-Tov Samia, who is a former head of the Israeli defence force&rsquo;s southern command, claims that the houses should have been demolished and evacuated a long time ago. He considers that a strip of 300 m along both sides of the border should be cleared, regardless of the number of houses involved.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s view that it is time for this country, along with its EU neighbours, to consider seriously the possibility of economic sanctions against Israel. I do not doubt that my esteemed colleague, Senator Bradford, who is Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Human Rights of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, will refer to a brief meeting we had last week with an Israeli citizen who proposed such sanctions. When Israeli Jews living in Israel, who know the impact sanctions would have on their community, say that sanctions are the only way of making the Israeli political establishment start <Col N="632"/>to focus on attempting to look for a serious and firm resolution of the problem, then that should be given serious consideration within the EU.</P>
      <P>Some people might think that the Israelis do not care. An internal confidential report about the international image of Israel, which had been prepared by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, was leaked to the press two weeks ago. The report stated that Israel may have some difficulties in the future if it continues its current policy of relying exclusively on the United States because the EU is likely to become one of the major international power blocs. The EU is likely to outstrip the US in terms of economic power and international political influence. The Israelis care about what the future will look like. I suggest that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, should outline the Government&rsquo;s views about the implementation of some form of sanction against Israel if it continues to operate the policy it is pursuing in the Gaza Strip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion, which &ldquo;urges the Government to redouble Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to bring peace to Iraq and Palestine&rdquo;, as I am sure every Member of the House does. Regardless of whether our efforts are being redoubled, trebled or quadrupled, we need to consider the practical steps we can take and the real impact we can make at international level to try to improve the problems in Iraq and Palestine.</P>
      <P>Some Senators attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs earlier today. A motion was agreed by the committee following a constructive and lengthy discussion on Israel and Palestine. It is interesting that similar motions are being considered by a committee and the Seanad in the aftermath of the vote which took place in the Knesset last night. We should not underestimate the political significance of the vote and the success of the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Sharon, in getting his proposal adopted.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>When we have debated the Middle Eastern situation over the past few months, most people have focused on the fact that the road map solution agreed by the Quartet was the only show in town and the political way forward. We then began to doubt whether the road map could or would be implemented. Unfortunately, it has not made the progress for which we hoped. I hope that what happened last night in the Knesset is a very positive step forward. When one talks about the politics of the Middle East, everyone&rsquo;s motives can be questioned and people can wonder what exactly the Israeli Prime Minister is up to and whether he is sincere in his public pronouncements about the withdrawal of the settlements and the removal of some of the enclaves built. Last night, the Israeli Parliament voted to take a major step in that regard. I noted one interesting comment from the Israeli justice Minister, Yosef Lapid, who heads one of the centrist parties. He said that, while there was a great degree of debate on the political intrigue that went on in parlia<Col N="633"/>ment, what was decided that day would be remembered in 100 years, so significant was it. I hope that it proves to be as significant as he said and a major step forward. Unfortunately, many steps must still be taken.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney spoke of the meeting he, Deputy Carey and I had last week with a representative of Israeli public opinion. I expect that it was a minority point of view. The argument was made to us that sanctions should be considered against Israel while human rights violations and the building of the so-called &ldquo;peace wall&rdquo; continue. My personal view of sanctions is that we should tread carefully. One can consider the example of South Africa, where sanctions obviously worked very well. However, in more recent times there were sanctions against Iraq which cannot be deemed to have been successful. When one adopts a policy of sanction and penalty, one may be breaking down the prospect of dialogue. In this country we can sadly claim to be experts on this. A policy of non-dialogue and refusing to engage and negotiate has not worked. The path to peace in the Middle East and turning that road map into a reality involves dialogue, co-operation and debate. I have doubts about the sanctions route, which might simply result in people hardening their positions. The road map is the way forward and if we want to see that solution enacted as agreed by the Quartet, we must encourage people to walk with us &mdash; I hope Members will excuse the pun. Sanctions might not be helpful in that regard.</P>
      <P>I absolutely object to the &ldquo;peace wall&rdquo; project. There is no doubt that rather than bringing peace, it is causing more difficulty and distress and ravaging entire communities. At hearings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and its human rights sub-committee over the past six months, we have had witnesses able to portray in the gravest detail what effect the &ldquo;peace wall&rdquo; project is having on the ground and how it is dividing communities economically, socially and politically. It is bringing great despair. It has been condemned by the entire international community and the message must be sent out from the Oireachtas to the Israeli authorities that the &ldquo;peace wall&rdquo;&mdash; or separation wall &mdash; project must stop and that meaningful, real negotiations must commence.</P>
      <P>This House, the Oireachtas, the Government and its predecessors have always taken a very balanced and open approach to the Middle East, and to Israel and Palestine in particular. We were one of the first countries to recognise the right of the Palestinian people to have their own safe and secure state. Equally, we have always supported the right of Israel to have its people live in security and peace. That has been the policy of the Irish Government and it must continue. We must try to ensure that the European Union, the only forum where the Minister can have a direct impact, drives forward the road map solution.</P>
      <P>I would also like to mention the situation in Iraq and I agree with what Senator Mooney said. <Col N="634"/>We can dwell for ever on what should not have happened and how or why the invasion occurred. We could do the same regarding the atrocities committed by Saddam Hussein. We could dwell for ever on the mass graves now being found in Iraq, the direct result of his regime. However, that will not solve the problems. The people of the country are living in dangerous, depressing and fearful times. The killing goes on daily, and we must ask in this country what we can do to help them. I say to the Minister that we must ensure that the United Nations takes a more direct, hands-on role. In the run-up to the invasion, the cry coming from our Government, most of its European counterparts, and the international community was that nothing should happen without UN sanction or approval. That is not how the game played out. However, the United Nations is the best prospect for progress in Iraq.</P>
      <P>The elections are scheduled to take place in January, and there is, probably with good reason, a great deal of doubt about whether they can go ahead. However, it must be the aspiration of the interim administration in Iraq and the international community that there be free and fair elections. The Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Annan, thinks that the elections can take place, but I understand the level of assistance afforded by the United Nations through election monitoring and preparation is quite minimal. There are obviously very good reasons Mr. Annan and his officials are not very inclined to pour hundreds of people into Iraq to help in the preparation and conduct of the Iraqi election. However, if we want the United Nations to play a major role in the reconstruction of that country, as is proper, we should start with our involvement in the elections. It will be the Iraqi people&rsquo;s first opportunity in generations to have some say in building their own country and conducting their own affairs. That is in everyone&rsquo;s interest. If one is a democrat, whether in Iraq or Europe, it is surely in one&rsquo;s interest to promote democracy and elections. A properly run, free and fair election in January would be a major step forward.</P>
      <P>There are obviously great challenges. A tiny minority in Iraq is hell bent on trying to ensure that chaos continues and that murder, mayhem, kidnapping and looting are the daily diet of the Iraqi people. As I said, and as I believe Senator Mooney expressed more articulately, we can talk for ever about why the invasion should not have happened, but it did. We must now debate where we go from here and the best people to plan the future of Iraq are the Iraqis themselves. Their first opportunity will be by way of a free and fair election. I ask the Minister to try to ensure through international dialogue that the United Nations maximises its role in those elections and adds a veneer of confidence and international repute to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his appointment. <Col N="635"/>I have no doubt he will do an excellent job in his new role.</P>
      <P>This is a peculiar motion before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I was trying to be non-contentious and hoped that all Senators would support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I was hoping to tie up matters at the end.</P>
      <P>Life in Palestine today is life in an open prison. The daily life of any Palestinian is, to quote a phrase, &ldquo;nasty, brutish and short&rdquo;. Palestinians need permits for everything &mdash; to go to school, to work, to shop, even to post letters. There is very little a Palestinian can do without Israeli permission. There is a network of more than 400 checkpoints. Ostensibly they are there to deter suicide bombers but in reality they serve to separate Palestinian from Palestinian and have little impact on suicide bombers.</P>
      <P>The checkpoints have a devastating effect on the daily life of Palestinians. Each Palestinian goes through one checkpoint at least once daily. He or she might wait for hours. It is an old-fashioned technique. It was used by the British in the Six Counties, and I often had to wait for hours, though not every day, or everywhere, as Palestinians must do. From September 2000 to April 2004, 82 sick Palestinians died at Israeli checkpoints, having been forbidden passage. Since the beginning of 2002, 52 Palestinian women have given birth at checkpoints. Two years before that, 19 Palestinian women and 29 newborn Palestinian babies died at checkpoints for lack of medical care. They were not let through.</P>
      <P><?oasys [dc14]?>I have experience of being held up while coming from Bethlehem to Jerusalem and going to Hebron. I was left sitting at the checkpoint. There was nothing on the far side and no reason one could not get through. Israeli soldiers chat and laugh among themselves and there is nothing one can do. They have the guns and one is sitting there.<?oasys [dc0]?></P>
      <P>There has been a policy of destruction and humiliation over the past three and a half years. Israeli armed forces have demolished more than 2,000 homes, leaving tens of thousands of men, women and children homeless and without a livelihood, just like the evictions in the old days in Ireland by our British landlords. It is the same with the Israelis. The evicted victims are mostly the poorest and most disadvantaged. Families are left destitute. The wall encircling Palestinians is a violation of international law.</P>
      <P>Why and how is all this happening? In 1897, the first Zionist congress in Basle introduced the Basle Programme which stated, &ldquo;Zionism seeks to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law.&rdquo; The Palestinians did not want them, but in 1909, Tel Aviv was developed as the first all-Jewish city. From then on there was a gradual encroachment, annexation, expulsion and humiliation of the <Col N="636"/>Palestinian people. That is Al-Naqba, or the catastrophe, as the Palestinians call it. There are now 4 million Palestinian refugees who are not allowed to return. This refusal to allow them return is also against international law or United Nations resolutions.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to many Israelis at conferences and in Israel and asked why they ignore the UN resolutions. The answer is simple. They are surrounded by enemies such as Hizbollah, who they see as wanting to wipe out the state of Israel. Accordingly they retaliate, but their retaliation has always been disproportionate. If it were not for the billions of dollars paid by the Americans to the Israelis, the latter would have made peace long ago because they would not have been able to keep the effort going. It is ironic in a way. I spoke before about the initiation ceremony for the elite corps of the Israeli army, which is the nearest thing to the Nuremberg rally that one could see. Torchlight parades feature the Star of David instead of the swastika. Without realising it, these soldiers have in a way become the new Nazis. The oppressed became the oppressors.</P>
      <P><?oasys [dc14]?>I welcome the stated intention of the Israeli Government to withdraw from the Gaza Strip as part of its implementation of the roadmap process. It is the only way forward. I note with concern the escalation in violent acts emanating from both sides in the conflict. These acts serve only to impede and frustrate peace efforts. I welcome the clear decision of the International Court of Justice on the illegality of the wall separating and encircling the Palestinian population of the West Bank and the subsequent UN General Assembly resolution to the same effect, backed unanimously by all 25 members. The construction of the wall has continued because the Israelis ignore these resolutions. They see themselves as a Jewish nation with no friends. At the UN, all the Arab states vote against them. Others too vote against them, while some vote for them. The Israelis are on their own. Only the Americans back them, so they urge everyone else to hell while they intend to defend themselves at all costs.<?oasys [dc0]?></P>
      <P>The matter has reached the stage where neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis on their own can reach a solution. The violations of human rights have been too great, as is the hatred sown. The problem can be solved but only with the roadmap and continued pressure from the EU, Russia, America and others.</P>
      <P>When the war in Iraq began I was one of those in this House who said it was illegal and immoral. The results now include 30,000 Iraqis dead along with young soldiers from America, Italy, Britain and elsewhere. It is a sad situation. Members will agree that if Iraq grew bananas instead of oil, there would be no war. This has led to torture in the prisons in Iraq, but it produced Guantanamo Bay too, whereby poor people from mountainous regions of Afghanistan were hooded, blindfolded, put in uniform, forced to kneel and tortured. That was America&rsquo;s shame. The mighty democracy of the world is shamed by this event.</P><Col N="637"/>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>I have given two examples of America backing events without much thought for what is going on behind them, or without caring. America is now the policeman of the world and the Iraqi and Palestinian conflicts are intimately connected. The main motivations are greed, power and money, and the Jewish vote in the US helps. However, we cannot abandon Israel at this stage. That is sometimes forgotten. Although Israel&rsquo;s actions are disproportionate to the aggression visited upon it, we cannot abandon Israel. The state of Israel exists whether we like it or not. We must support that state so that it feels secure surrounded by Arab neighbours, rather than threatened by them. We cannot abandon the Palestinians either and we must insist on the return of the 4 million refugees. They cannot return until the Palestinian lands are returned.</P>
      <P>It is amazing to see Mr. Sharon moving in the direction in which he is moving. This is a man who led many raids and killed many people in his earlier days and who precipitated the intifada. Rather than merely consider what is wrong we must ask if we can do anything about the situation. There is always something we can do. Someone suggested today that sanctions be applied to Israel. That will not do much good. The only way we can move forward in both of these conflicts is through dialogue. That is the only way we have been able to move forward on this island. Force does not work. The Americans are now calling for further British armed forces to go to Iraq, and there has been a similar call for Irish armed forces. We have a reputation for peacekeeping rather than for oppression and it is too early for our armed forces to go to Iraq.</P>
      <P>We can however highlight the situation. We are a small Parliament in a small country but if sufficient small parliaments in small countries continue to highlight matters, change takes place gradually yet irrevocably in every conflict throughout the world. This one will not be any different. We must keep fighting and keep trying. We must support Israel&rsquo;s efforts to live in peace and support the Palestinians in gaining the return of their homeland and the return of their refugees. This can be done. It will be a long, slow haul and it might be a case of taking one step backwards for every two taken forward. However, we must take those two steps forward.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister. I did not intend to speak on the motion but I am glad that it was brought forward because it gives us the opportunity to discuss whether peace can be achieved and whether there is any way to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict and the awful mess in <Col N="638"/>Iraq. I have given some thought to the matter and I believe there is a way to achieve these things. Senator Lydon touched on it when he said the only way forward is through political negotiation. We must then consider how to bring together those from Israel and Palestine to discuss matters. During Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, everything possible was done to move matters forward. Unfortunately, however, a backward step has been taken.</P>
      <P>We have witnessed the awful deaths and injuries that have resulted from the upsurge in violence along the Gaza Strip and in southern Israel. Our priority must be for Ireland to find a way to help resolve matters. The Minister will have an important role to play in this regard and I ask him, on behalf of the House, to do everything in his power to find a way to express Ireland&rsquo;s interest in the peace process and for us to formulate a solution for the problems between Israel and Palestine.</P>
      <P>I do not know what to say about Iraq. I am completely against the war there. I have been traumatised by the barbaric murders shown on television. I do not know whether we will find a solution to this problem but I hope the Minister will indicate how best we might move forward. I hope he will also state whether the interim government is capable, perhaps with support from the United Nations or the United State, of resolving matters and whether the member states of the European Union can help to find a way forward. Events in Iraq cannot remain on their current course. No purpose is served by what is happening there at present. What are those involved there trying to solve? Is any country or member state in a position to come forward with a solution that might work?</P>
      <P>I do not have much more to say. I merely wish to state that the current position cannot be allowed to stand. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to do everything possible to promote the Government&rsquo;s position in respect of round table discussions. I do not care whether these relate to Israel, Palestine or Iraq. The only way the problems will be solved is by people negotiating with each other. I ask the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure that Ireland provides assistance in whatever way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ormonde for sharing her time and Senator Henry for tabling this motion. I welcome the Minister who, as with his previous Ministries, has done a good job in a short period.</P>
      <P>I visited Baghdad in January 2003, a number of months before the war began, with an Oireachtas delegation. One of the most vivid memories I have of that trip is that many of our visits to hospitals, schools and public buildings were often interrupted by power blackouts. The situation in hospitals as regards the loss of power was partic<Col N="639"/>ularly dreadful. The first thing that happened in the attacks on Iraq and Baghdad was that the power supply was hit again by the invading forces. A great deal has been written about the fact that we do not know the full extent of the casualties caused by the war and, in that context, innocent Iraqi people would be our main concern.</P>
      <P>If the situation in Iraq as regards health, education and energy supplies was bad previously, it became worse with the advent of this war which has been described by Kofi Annan as illegal. People were obliged to start rebuilding when Saddam Hussein was overthrown. It is only fair to state that there have been some good developments in Iraq in terms of education since the war began.</P>
      <P>The sanctions in place before the war affected hospitals and the health services in general. I recall visiting a children&rsquo;s hospital in which many of the children were suffering from leukaemia. The doctors and consultants informed us that they could not procure supplies. For example, some drugs might be missing from the cocktail of drugs required for someone&rsquo;s treatment and much of the equipment in the hospital was missing parts. The situation improved in the interim but recent violence and atrocities have caused further disruption to the health services, to education and to water supplies and sewerage facilities.</P>
      <P>On my visit I was glad to meet workers from CARE International, the NGO of which Mrs. Margaret Hassan is director. Our sympathies go to Mrs. Hassan&rsquo;s family at this time. CARE International is an excellent organisation. Its staff deal with basic issues such as water treatment and their work in hospitals and health centres is extremely important. They spoke to me about the necessary work of rationing and feeding which must be carried out. Their main achievement relates to dealing with the matter of infant mortality and they were able to demonstrate the improvements that have taken place in that regard. I hope the work of CARE International and other NGOs will be successful. It will be difficult, however, because kidnappings, suicide bombings and other violence have led to the creation of a very unstable situation. For example, the United Nations had to close down its headquarters in Iraq &mdash; which I visited on my trip &mdash; because of bomb and other attacks on it. The Minister has taken a particular interest in Iraq during his short time in the Department. I hope he will be successful in his work in that regard.</P>
      <P>As regards the Middle East and Palestine, a matter with which Senator Lydon dealt very well, efforts must continue to achieve peace there. There have been some positive noises, particularly in respect of what the Israeli Prime Minister said. However, the situation in this region is <Col N="640"/>particularly difficult. I hope the efforts being made by the Government and the Minister in respect of Palestine and Israel will be successful. It is ironic that some time ago we were informed, in the context of the North of Ireland, that we should look at the blueprint for the Middle East as a possible way to solve the difficulties on this island. We are now telling people that they should look at the peace process here, on which we are working hard and in respect of which we hope to make further progress. Some of the people we met in Iraq were interested by the process in Northern Ireland. Perhaps efforts similar to those relating to Northern Ireland can be made in the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and wish him well with his new portfolio. I am confident he will carry on the good work of his predecessor, Deputy Cowen.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate, in particular, on the Palestinian aspect of the motion. I welcome the fact that the motion has been framed in such a way that it can be supported across the House. At this afternoon&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, a motion was tabled by Deputy Mulcahy. It was a good motion and I supported it. However, it was rather unfortunate the Sinn F&eacute;in put down an amendment. There was little significant difference between the motion and the amendment. The main aspect involved the European Union&rsquo;s role in recognising Israel and having it participate at international fora. It is important that Parliament, the Government and the European Union continue to take a unified approach on these issues as it gives authority to the views expressed. A good consensus has been achieved on Palestine over the years. I can recall at least one instance of a motion being signed by the leaders of all groups in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>With regard to Palestine, we all view with horror the events we see daily on our television screens. Irrespective of whether it is violence perpetrated by the more extreme elements of the Palestinian population or state terrorism in the case of Israel, we must continue to be even-handed in our condemnation. I am encouraged by and support the conclusions reached by the General Affairs and External Relations Council at its meeting in Luxembourg on 11 October 2004.</P>
      <P>I am disturbed by the apparent inconsistencies between the attitude of the United States to the Middle East, particularly with regard to Iraq but also on the issue of Palestine, and the war against terrorism. Terrorism from whatever source is unacceptable. To have authority, one must take an even-handed view. While there is no doubt that al-Qaeda and similar groups are worthy of the strongest international condemnation and the intervention of the United States, nevertheless, if the US is to fulfil the role it envisages for itself, <Col N="641"/>it must also condemn terrorism when it emanates from Israel or is state inflicted.</P>
      <P>I realise that for many years it was strategically important for the United States to have influence on the state of Israel but I am not convinced strategic reasons, other than domestic political concerns, still exist. The end of the Cold War and the US presence in Iraq make America&rsquo;s need to be dominant in Israel less evident. I hope that when the new administration is established, whether through a continuation of President Bush&rsquo;s period in office or Senator Kerry assuming the presidency, the United States will take a more even-handed approach.</P>
      <P>If, as has happened, rockets are launched from the Jabalya refugee camp or elsewhere in the Gaza Strip into Israel inflicting terrible carnage, it is reasonable to assume that Israel would respond. The central issue, however, is that its response must be proportionate, rather than indiscriminate as has been the case.</P>
      <P>As I stated at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs today, I have been in the Palestinian territories twice. On the first occasion, several years ago, I visited Jabalya and another refugee camp near Bethlehem in the West Bank. I also had the good fortune to return to monitor the first Palestinian elections. This was an inspiring trip which showed the appetite for democracy among the Palestinian people who came out in enormous numbers &mdash; well over 90% of the population &mdash; to cast their votes. Polling stations had to be kept open much later than envisaged and, as I recalled earlier, we were forced to intervene when ballot boxes became stuffed with ballot papers. Even our traditional system of using a ruler to push papers further into boxes failed and we had to fetch plastic bags in which to put extra ballot papers. We then sealed the bags in front of witnesses using sealing wax to ensure they remained confident that the integrity of the ballot had not been breached.</P>
      <P>During these visits, I was particularly struck by the total disregard of the rights under law of the Palestinian people. Bulldozers arrived to demolish houses in which the occupants were suspected of harbouring terrorists or others who were perhaps more marginal to the conflict. The occupants had no recourse when this occurred or when settlers took land that had been in Palestinian hands for generations, evicted people from their homes and settled on the land on the basis of some presumed biblical legitimacy.</P>
      <P>I was in France over the weekend where CNN, a channel of which I am not an enthusiast and would not choose to watch, appears to be the only English language television channel available. My view was reinforced as I watched an elderly lady who had been born in England, reared in the United States and now lives in the Gaza Strip state she did not accept that she must move home as a result of Prime Minister Sharon&rsquo;s initiative. <Col N="642"/>Her home had been appropriated under false pretence from somebody who had title to the property. If that were to happen here, there would, correctly, be uproar.</P>
      <P>As to the way forward the Council, at its October meeting, reaffirmed the elements laid down by the European Council in March 2004. This is the correct approach. It stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Council reiterated its view that proposals for an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and part of the Northern West Bank could represent a significant step towards the implementation of the Roadmap, provided that it comprises a full and complete withdrawal and is implemented in accordance with the five elements laid down by the European Council in March 2004, i.e:</P>
      <P LI="2">It took place in the context of the Roadmap; it was a step towards a two-state solution it did not involve a transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank; there was an organised and negotiated hand-over of responsibility to the Palestinian Authority; and Israel facilitated the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza.</P>
      <P FLI="0">While these are important conditions, money is also important. When one visits Gaza it becomes evident that the area urgently needs a capital injection. The World Bank and other international agencies must provide support to ensure the Palestinian Authority can operate with a degree of financial security.</P>
      <P>The Council also called for the &ldquo;resumption of security co-operation and direct negotiations between the parties, as called for in the Roadmap.&rdquo; The central issue, reiterated by the Taoiseach when he addressed the matter recently, is that the road map must act as a template, which sets down the actions which must be taken if progress is to be achieved. We cannot start to re-negotiate it in response to violence and I hope the Government will take a determined position in this regard.</P>
      <P>Ireland has an opportunity to act as an honest broker, a capacity we have demonstrated domestically with regard to Northern Ireland and in our conduct in international fora, including the United Nations and the European Union. We have authority beyond our size and position in the world.</P>
      <P>The wall separating the Palestinians from the Israelis has been held to be unlawful. An executive of CRH, when asked about this matter at a recent meeting I attended, replied that the company had invested in the only cement company in Israel, which in turn only provided cement for the wall. He almost gave the impression that CRH had nothing to do with the wall, which is not the case. It can decide to invest in such companies. Ethics come into play in this regard &mdash; I say this <Col N="643"/>as a shareholder in the company &mdash; and CRH has responsibilities which it should fulfil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who tabled the motion which the Government is happy to support. I thank the speakers for their contributions. It is interesting that the Seanad, for the second week in a row, is discussing issues pertaining to that part of the world. That is as it should be. The Government and both Houses of the Oireachtas look forward to a peaceful resolution of the intractable issues in Iraq and in the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. They have complicated roots which long predate the current crisis of violence and instability.</P>
      <P>The spiral of violence which has overtaken many areas of Iraq has inflicted great suffering on many people, including some families that have Irish roots. The D&aacute;il and the Seanad discussed the issues pertaining to the Irish families last week. Senators will understand if I do not go into that aspect further, given its current sensitivity particularly with regard to Mrs. Margaret Hassan. We are still in contact with the family in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Iraqi people are the primary victims of the conflict. It is they who are suffering most, including from the interruption of basic services. This was illustrated by previous speakers, particularly by Senator Kitt who visited Iraq just before the war. The European Union&rsquo;s objective on Iraq is clear. Senator Dardis referred to the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council which I attended and at which I had an opportunity to speak on these issues. The Council was resolved to put forward a strong proposal. We want to see the development of a secure, stable and democratic Iraq, able to play a positive role in the region.</P>
      <P>The immediate problem in Iraq is violence, which exacerbates the challenge of building a democratic political structure in a country which has never known one, and where two of the three communities making up the country have been hitherto systematically excluded from participation in power. The starting point for our actions in Iraq is, and must be, UN Security Council Resolution 1546 of 8 June, which provides for the transfer of power to the interim Iraqi Government on 28 June. The multinational force, MNF, in Iraq now operates under the authority of Resolution 1546 and at the invitation of the interim Iraqi Government.</P>
      <P>The EU will have an opportunity to review the situation when the members of the European Council meet with Prime Minister Allawi on 4 November. That will give us a chance to hear from him what his Government&rsquo;s needs are and to discuss how best we can help. The multinational force in Iraq has prime responsibility to assist the Iraqi Government in the security area. <Col N="644"/>The MNF includes a number of EU member states but the EU, as a Union, is not involved. Ireland does not, at this stage, envisage becoming involved in the provision of any form of security assistance in Iraq.</P>
      <P>The treatment of prisoners in Iraq is and has been a matter of serious concern. The Government voiced its concern and displeasure at the revelations earlier this year about abuse of Iraqi prisoners in coalition custody. We did so together with our EU and Arab partners in the EuroMediterranean ministerial meeting in Dublin and in our bilateral contacts with the occupying powers.</P>
      <P>One important area where the EU can be helpful is in the preparation for the Iraqi elections, scheduled for January 2005. Senator Bradford referred to this aspect. Only elections can give the Iraqi Government the enhanced authority and legitimacy it needs to pull its country together and rebuild its future. However, we need to be frank &mdash; the holding of elections against the background of the current security situation will not be an easy task. The Iraqi Government also faces a daunting task in trying to create a functioning civil society and political system. This will be a long-term task and much of it cannot even begin until security has been restored. One of the issues I discussed with Kofi Annan when he visited Ireland recently was the prospect of UN personnel returning to Iraq in substantial numbers, given what happened to some of them there some time ago.</P>
      <P>The EU has sent two exploratory missions to Iraq to examine how we can best assist. One critical area identified is supporting the establishment of a responsible criminal justice system in Iraq. This could help convey to the Iraqi people that the justice system now belongs to them. The specific aim will be to help Iraqis to re-establish and reform their own system, not to impose an alien one from outside. In this regard, the field of policing and the rule of law was identified as an area in which possible EU assistance could be most effective in the first instance. The Presidency has now put forward a proposal for a package of measures in support of the interim Iraqi Government and Iraqi reconstruction. The proposal has just been received and, quite frankly, it is too early to give a considered response.</P>
      <P>However, I will give Senators a flavour of what is in the proposal. It has only just been received and we are currently examining it, as are our partners. The measures include elements relating to political support for the Iraqi Government, such as EU backing for the proposed regional conference on Iraq to be held in Egypt in late November. They include EU support for the role of the UN in Iraq, something we discussed at our meeting with Kofi Annan, including financial support for the proposed UN protection force. Again, I refer to the discussions I had with Kofi Annan in that respect. As we spoke, the attacks <Col N="645"/>on the green zone made it even more difficult for the implementation of the UN protection force. Ireland intends to make a financial contribution to the EU financial support for the proposed UN protection force. The Presidency package would include EU assistance both from the Community budget and from individual member states for the preparation of Iraqi elections. Finally, the Presidency has put forward possible elements for an EU action in the field of policing and the rule of law to help the development of the Iraqi criminal justice system.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.6]?>
      <P>Turning to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the only way a peaceful solution can only be attained is through negotiation. We know that from our experience on this island. Any such solution must satisfy the legitimate aspirations of both sides. We have availed of every opportunity, both as a member of the UN Security Council and during our recent Presidency of the EU, to advance international efforts to achieve a two state solution, with each country living at peace within secure and recognised borders. Previous speakers, particularly Senator Lydon, referred to the difficulty for ordinary Palestinians going about their business as a result of the type of security measures that are being put in place. We got a flavour of these from the Palestinian Foreign Minister, Mr. Shaath, whom I met earlier this week.</P>
      <P>The road map provides the opportunity and the framework within which to achieve a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Regrettably, it is clear that neither side has to date acted to fulfil its commitments under the road map. We discussed this with Mr. Shaath when he was here. Our priority must be to get the peace process back on track. The essentials are an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and a return to the negotiating table. There is, and can be, no military solution, just as there is no substitute for political negotiations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly expressed the Government&rsquo;s great concern about the deaths and injuries caused by the violence in Gaza and southern Israel. As Ireland nationally has done, the EU has also strongly condemned the disproportionate nature of the Israeli military engagement. We have repeatedly called on the Israeli authorities to take every precaution to avoid causing civilian casualties and to conduct operations in full conformity with their obligations under international humanitarian law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention. Above all, I am disturbed and concerned by the civilian casualties on the Palestinian side, including the many children killed or wounded. I also unequivocally condemn the terrorist attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian groups which have resulted in the deaths of Israelis, including children. Suicide bombings and other acts of terrorism advance no <Col N="646"/>legitimate agenda and can only damage the interests of the Palestinian people.</P>
      <P>We in Ireland know only too well that violence is pointless. We see again and again in the Middle East that violence achieves nothing. As a result, Israel is no closer to the goal of real security and Palestine is no closer to its long-cherished goal of independence. I took the opportunity to emphasise all of these points when I met last week with Dr. Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian Foreign Minister.</P>
      <P>The road map provides the way forward and addresses the issues of concern to both sides. It calls, for example, on the Palestinian side to embrace internal reform and to take firm action against terrorism. It also calls upon Israel to freeze settlement activity and to take steps to ease the humanitarian and economic plight of the Palestinian people.</P>
      <P>This week, the Israeli Parliament voted in favour of its Government&rsquo;s proposal for disengagement from Gaza and from a small number of settlements in the West Bank. There is, nonetheless, strong resistance within Israel. The European Union, for its part, has set out five elements which it considers essential if it is to endorse the withdrawal process. In particular, in our strongly held view, withdrawal must take place in the context of the road map and must be a step towards a two-state solution.</P>
      <P>I refer finally to the separation barrier in the West Bank, to which previous speakers referred. I acknowledge and uphold the right and responsibility of any government, in this case, the Israeli Government, to protect its people, including, if it so wishes, by a security fence. However, the fence must not be on occupied territory and must not create facts on the ground. This, I emphasise, is also the position of the European Union and the International Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>The motion before the Seanad has provided me with a welcome opportunity to inform Senators of the Government&rsquo;s position in regard to two areas of great concern to all of us: Iraq and the Arab-Israeli conflict. While they are two quite different issues, each has the capacity, especially the Palestinian conflict, to impact negatively on the other. This is why, in the case of Palestine, all of us need to seize every opportunity to drive forward the solution to this distressing and destabilising situation, namely, the road map. Following the presidential election in the US, a renewed and critical opportunity may well exist for us to do so. We must seize it quickly and effectively. Accordingly, I am happy to support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and thank all the Senators who spoke, most of whom are far more knowledgeable than me on the situation in both areas. Senator Dardis made the important point that because Ireland had its own problems, we have domestic experience <Col N="647"/>which enables us to give advice. I find it extremely distressing that the situation in both areas has become a religious war. We witnessed two denominations of the Christian religion fighting each other in Northern Ireland and violence was no solution.</P>
      <P>Many speakers referred to the American intervention in Iraq. However, when the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, states this war will define relations between the Muslim world and the West, I wonder what he means. The Muslim tradition is also valuable and Muslims may see our values as less important than some of their own.</P>
      <P>There is huge chaos in both areas and, as all speakers noted, civilians are suffering most. It is the duty of the occupying powers in Iraq to maintain the security situation. Senator Mooney pointed out that the appalling massacre of trainee soldiers, which must have been due to inside information, was carried out by other Iraqis. While that may be so, it was interesting that Prime Minister Allawi blamed the occupying forces. It is difficult for progress to be made in Iraq.</P>
      <P>One area not addressed in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution, which I would like to be addressed, concerns the economic occupation and the fact the reconstruction funds are not being invested in Iraqi firms to get them going. There are millions of unemployed Iraqi men who, if the funding was made available to Iraqi firms, could work on the reconstruction effort. An Arab television network made a programme on the rebuilding of houses bombed by the Americans. If a television programme could be made on this, surely funds could be distributed so that some Iraqi firms could begin repairing damage caused to houses and to infrastructure such as sewerage systems.</P>
      <P>A colleague of mine works as an obstetrician in Iraq. She recently told me that she still carries out caesarean sections by candlelight and washes her hands with filthy water. Such conditions should not prevail a year and a half after the invasion. In the same way that we encourage negotiations between Palestine and Israel, we should encourage the United States and United Kingdom to become involved in the practical problems of Iraq and to repeal the appalling order No. 39 made by the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, Mr. Paul Bremer, which robbed the Iraqi people of every last thing they have. I would object if such a measure applied here. To take the property of a state and sell it to outsiders was wrong when even Iraqis outside the country at the time the order was invoked asked for time to buy the property themselves. It would be useful to encourage the US and UK to revisit the issue.</P>
      <P>When the Minister meets with British Government Ministers, who obviously support Mr. Blair because they did not resign, he should point out <Col N="648"/>to them that if internment had continued for years in Ireland, the situation here would not be as it is. The Minister should ask that some prisoners be released. I cannot see why those of no political or strategic significance are being held. It is a continuation of Saddam&rsquo;s policies and the people of Iraq must feel that their plight has not been improved by this imposition of a so-called democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter concerns the deer production sector of the agricultural industry. There is concern among deer producers that they are a forgotten group. It is fair to say that during the late 1980s and early 1990s considerable emphasis was put on diversification and on farmers moving from traditional farming into areas such as deer production and other alternative farming practices. Grants were available to deer farmers for fencing and handling facilities, and a considerable number of farmers got involved in deer production. With the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy these farmers feel they are unrepresented and that their voice is not being heard. I appeal to the Minister, given that under the CAP reform proposals a certain percentage will be creamed off the top, particularly in the area of modulation, to ensure that some of that money is directed towards ensuring not just the survival of the deer industry but its growth and improvement. Deer meat has many advantages as a food source and we should be promoting it more than we seem to be doing at present.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The main point that deer producers make is that they were encouraged by the Government in the late 1980s and early 1990s to change their method of farming and then lost their entitlements. Under the CAP reform and the Fischler proposals they have no or considerably reduced entitlements because they have not been involved in the farming practices that gained those entitlements during the reference years. As a result they are disadvantaged. They feel they are being neglected. I agree with them. I hope the Government will use the money available under modulation to ensure this sector continues to prosper.</P>

	<P>I support what Senator John Paul Phelan has said. Given his background, the <Col N="649"/>Cathaoirleach will know that five or six years ago quite a number of people in the north Cork and west Limerick area invested heavily in deer farming, seeing it as an opportunity to stabilise their farming incomes and involve family members in the enterprise. Unfortunately most of them eventually suffered financial losses and departed from the enterprise. A significant number of people in the Border counties, in particular Cavan and Monaghan, also invested in deer farming. There too, matters did not work out tremendously well.</P>
      <P>I take on board what the Senator said. We should try to encourage deer farming as a form of alternative farming enterprise from the health perspective of venison as a food and from the point of view of the surplus of other foodstuffs in the European Union. If a significant minority of farmers got involved in enterprises such as deer farming it could become a valuable way of life and a valuable economic contributor to rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>To date, the industry has been unplanned and unregulated and has lacked the leadership which was required. At the time that people in the north Cork area became involved in deer farming the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, took an interest in the industry, as did the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey. Unfortunately it did not get off the ground and many people lost money. However, that is no reason not to re-examine the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Phelan has made a positive suggestion and there is an onus on us, from an agricultural perspective, to try to encourage as many people as possible to invest in alternative enterprises. The numbers of people flocking from the land and from full-time farming is alarming. We need to put in place new solutions, be it deer farming or rabbit farming. They are not the answer to everybody&rsquo;s problems, but all of the alternatives have their place in the spectrum and we should encourage them wherever possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator John Paul Phelan, ably supported by Senator Bradford, for raising this issue.</P>
      <P>The reform of the CAP, which was concluded in Luxembourg last year, was the most fundamental reform since the inception of the policy. It offered a new framework within which the agriculture and food sector could face up to new global challenges. The effect of the reform has yet to be felt across the community, though here in Ireland we are well advanced in the process of changing from the traditional system of farm supports to the single farm payment.</P>
      <P>Beginning next year, farmers who were previously constrained by the premium system to retain animals in order to maximise premium uptake will be free to alter their production pat<Col N="650"/>terns. The single payment will continue to be available irrespective of the level of production. That results in farmers having the new freedom to alter production. They will make that decision based on the market returns available across all sectors of agriculture production and from within their own general resources of investment and skills. Many of the 300 farmers engaged in deer production in Ireland will have the cushion of the single farm payment and will have the range of choices available to all farmers in how best to invest this decoupled payment.</P>
      <P>The deer population in Ireland currently stands at 48,500 animals. This has increased by 10% since 1994. Almost 800 tonnes of venison are produced annually in Ireland for both the domestic and export markets in Denmark, the UK and the US. Fallow deer is exported to Denmark while red deer is supplied to the supermarket chains in Ireland and the UK and also to hotels and restaurants at home and in the US.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware that the industry, in common with other sectors, must continuously face up to the pressure of severe competition from larger lower cost producers from abroad. New Zealand-farmed deer and wild deer from Scotland represent the main competition on the export market. Such competitive forces are factors of international trade and their implications are felt across the production chain where costs of production must be constantly scrutinised and kept under control. This is no different from any other form of agricultural production where the returns in the market are critical to future levels of overall investment.</P>
      <P>Irish venison is a specialised high-quality product that has established good quality markets at home and abroad. Clearly there are constraints on the industry in terms of productive capacity. However, deer farming is stronger structurally now than it was ten years ago and the average deer enterprise has increased in scale from six to ten hectares while the average breeding herd has risen almost two-fold, from 48 to 88. Over the years Teagasc has provided an advisory service to deer farmers and also supports the Venison Industry Board, which is the main representative body in matters relating to deer farming and the development of markets for venison.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department makes grant aid available to farmers for investment in housing and handling facilities for deer under the alternative enterprises scheme established pursuant to the national development plan. The type of investment eligible for grant aid under this scheme includes housing, feed storage facilities and waste storage facilities. Support is also available for handling facilities as well as water supply.</P>
      <P>The Department is currently conducting a review of the alternative enterprises scheme with a view to making proposals as to how the scheme might be made more effective. My officials met <Col N="651"/>with representatives of the Venison Industry Board last August and their views will be taken into account in the completion of the review.</P>
      <P>I am strongly of the view that deer farming as an alternative enterprise to the more traditional and established farm enterprise will provide a valuable new outlet for a greater number of farmers who will assess the future direction of their farm enterprise. They will look to future returns from the marketplace and take these into account in assessing the investment needs of their farm and the opportunity and costs that may lie elsewhere. It is clear that not only is the deer sector more structurally sound now than it was ten years ago but the same is true of its financial base. While there may be fewer enterprises today they are larger, more specialised and moving towards quality-assured, high-value product outlets.</P>
      <P>I will bring the views of both Senators to the review committee which is currently working on alternatives and strongly present the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been approached by a number of individuals who are happy with the final deal on top-up grants and incentives allowing them to sell off bog plots and turbary rights. The deal amounts to &euro;3,500 for the first acre and &euro;3,000 for each subsequent acre. The only difficulty to arise is that others who had bogs designated in 1998 received £1,000. I understand they will now receive an extra &euro;4,730 to bring them to a total of &euro;6,000. However, one can see that those who received a maximum of &euro;6,000 in 1998 are not as satisfied as those who benefited from the deal in July 2004 and feel hard done by. I can provide the Minister with their details. Some individuals were also told in writing that if the deal improved after 1998, they would receive the more favourable terms of &euro;3,500 for the first acre and &euro;3,000 for each subsequent one. I ask the Minister to review the situation as only a few people did not do as well in 1998 when the land was first designated. It should also be remembered they were the first to co-operate fully with D&uacute;chas to sell off the bog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The agriculture chapter of Sustaining Progress includes a range of commitments from the Government encouraging nature conservation requirements. Constructive discussions on these issues took place between my Department and representatives of the farming pillar, resulting in an agreement in July 2004. Part of this agreement was for an increase in the rates of compensation where cessation of turfcutting is necessary in bogs designated for conservation. The new rates reflect the increase in the value of bogs since the original scheme commenced in March 1999.</P><Col N="652"/>
      <P>The revised rates of compensation for cessation of turfcutting in special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas are as follows. In raised bogs, which are mostly in the midlands, purchase of freehold is &euro;3,500 for the first acre, or part thereof, and &euro;3,000 per acre thereafter, and purchase of turbary rights is at 85% of the freehold price. The rates will apply to all purchases from the date of the new agreement. In addition, they will be applied retrospectively by means of an additional <i>ex gratia</i> payment in respect of any earlier purchases of raised bogs included in the December 2002 designation proposals. In general, the purchase of blanket bogs is not envisaged because it is not necessary to discontinue domestic turfcutting. In exceptional circumstances, where it is necessary to prohibit turfcutting, &euro;1,000 per acre will apply. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will also make a contribution toward an applicant&rsquo;s legal costs in connection with transferring rights in bogs.</P>
      <P>An additional incentive payment of a maximum of &euro;6,000 will also be paid to those who sell bog or turbary rights before the end of 2005. This payment will decline by &euro;600 per annum for those selling in later years. This payment will only apply to a vendor supplying satisfactory evidence of ownership of the plot as at 1 July 2004. Alternatively, a landowner who does not wish to sell bog or turbary rights but who commits to cease cutting and to allow drain-blocking will also be entitled to a payment of &euro;600 per annum. This rate of payment will be reviewed annually. For people whose bogs were designated in 1999 or before and have already sold their bogs to the Department, an increase in the incentive payment, which was &pound;1,000, &euro;1,270, and is now &euro;6,000, is available, based on the timing of their agreement to cease turfcutting. For example, if turfcutting ceased from 1999, the incentive would be &euro;6,000 less the &euro;1,270 which was already paid. The amount payable decreases by &euro;600 for each subsequent year.</P>
      <P>As Senator Kitt will appreciate, the enhanced incentive payments are available to people who have already sold their bogs or turbary rights to the Department since the original rates were announced in March 1999. The revised rates per acre are available retrospectively to people whose bogs were designated at the end of 2002 and had already sold, under the old rates, to the Department. It is not intended to carry out any further review of the scheme, which has benefited from detailed and constructive discussions between the farming organisations and Department officials. The scheme has been well publicised in newspapers and on radio. The Department and farming organisations have had numerous inquiries, both written and oral, since the announcement of the agreement. I am confident that every effort has been made to ensure that details of the <Col N="653"/>scheme are available to those affected by the scheme. Bog or turbary owners who feel that the revised rates do not fully compensate them have the option of going to arbitration for a decision. Both parties are bound by the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision. Senator Kitt referred to those who received letters that assured them of better rates. If he can forward details of these to me, I will look into the matter.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. For the last several years Cavan and Monaghan general hospitals have been constantly in the national media spotlight and the subject of continuous unwarranted negative publicity. On Wednesday, 29 September, counties Cavan and Monaghan received welcome news from the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, when he announced that 24 hour, seven days a week medical cover was to be restored to Monaghan General Hospital with the recruitment of five new junior doctors. A larger emergency room will be opened on a 24 hour, seven days a week basis in Monaghan from the beginning of February 2005. Up to 19 additional beds are to be provided at Cavan General Hospital and ten additional beds immediately at Monaghan General Hospital. Three new surgical posts for the joint departments of surgery between the two hospitals will be recruited.</P>
      <P>Cavan General Hospital was officially opened in 1989 at a cost of £16.3 million. Since then it has served County Cavan and parts of the surrounding counties of Leitrim, Monaghan, Meath, Longford and Westmeath. However, both hospitals have received negative and unfair publicity. I am anxious that the former Minister&rsquo;s proposals are implemented as soon as possible to help strengthen public confidence in both hospitals. Staff of both hospitals are some of the finest and I want to see them fully resourced to use their skills and experience to the best of their abilities. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that these changes are introduced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I know he will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the people of counties Cavan and Monaghan and the wider catchment area have the range and availability of health services to which they are entitled. The provision of adequate health services for counties Cavan and Monaghan has been continually raised by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and Senator O&rsquo;Brien. I know they support the implementation of the September proposals.</P>
      <P>This afternoon, with the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, I attended a meeting with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. We had a very positive meeting <Col N="654"/>with her. I am convinced she and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, are fully committed to delivering on the proposals set out on 29 September this year with the former Minister. I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the issues raised by Senator Wilson. A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting a delegation of local authority members drawn from the same political interest as Senator Wilson on this very issue in Monaghan town. I agree that it is of the utmost importance that we ensure all necessary services can be provided at Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
      <P>On 28 September this year, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, met with the North Eastern Health Board. The Minister was briefed on the progress made by the steering group which was established by the board to oversee the reconfiguration of hospital services across the Cavan and Monaghan group. I am pleased to say the report of the steering group was published last Friday, 22 October 2004, so Senator Wilson has raised this issue at an opportune time.</P>
      <P>Arising from the meeting with the then Minister, Deputy Martin, the position in regard to the reconfiguration of services at the two hospitals is as follows: the board proposes to recruit five additional non-consultant hospital doctors to facilitate the early restoration of 24 hour, seven-day medical cover to Monaghan General Hospital at an estimated additional revenue cost of £500,000 in a full year. My Department is advised that the recruitment process is under way and it is anticipated by the board that these staff will be in place in early 2005.</P>
      <P>Work has commenced on the development of an expanded treatment room at Monaghan General Hospital. The Department has approved capital funding of &euro;750,000 for this purpose. It is estimated by the board that the project will be completed in a timeframe of 16 weeks. The board has advised the Department that the additional full-year revenue funding required to commission this expanded facility is in the region of &euro;830,000. This submission is under consideration within my Department. I am aware Senator Wilson raised this issue with the Minister today.</P>
      <P>The Department has approved revenue funding of &euro;500,000 to commission ten additional day beds at Monaghan General Hospital. These beds are designed to facilitate the development of surgical services across the Cavan and Monaghan hospital group. The commissioning of these beds is to be progressed by the board.</P>
      <P>The Department has given financial clearance for the recruitment of three replacement consultant surgical posts to facilitate the development of surgical services across the Cavan and Monaghan <Col N="655"/>hospital group. Detailed applications in respect of these posts have been submitted by the board to Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al for approval.</P>
      <P>In recent days, the board has submitted details of the revenue funding and staffing required to commission an additional 19 beds at Cavan General Hospital as part of the reconfiguration of services across the group. This submission is now being examined by the Department. The development consists of the provision of an additional 15 <Col N="656"/>medical beds, four high dependency unit beds and the conversion of two existing high dependency unit beds to ICU beds.</P>
      <P>The Department is advised that the report of the Cavan-Monaghan hospital steering group was published on the 22 October 2004. The board now proposes to establish a formal implementation group to progress the various recommendations contained in the report.</P>
