	<P>I have received notice from Senator Browne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <?_ah?><P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to <?ch?>ensure that the people of Carlow and Kilkenny continue to have local radio until the new radio licensees are in a position to start broadcasting.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Browne out of order, as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P><?_xh?>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to today's Order of Business, I have a few notices to bring to the attention of Senators, with your permission, a Chathaoirligh. The Taoiseach will attend the House from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. for statements on the European Presidency. That may not have been clear from the Order Paper so that is why I am mentioning it now, in addition to which, it was announced on the radio that the Taoiseach would be meeting Dr. Paisley this morning, but that is happening this evening.</P>
    <P>The House will sit tomorrow despite the fact that the Immigration Bill will not be dealt with today in the D&aacute;il. The legislation is being introduced in this House first, so we will sit tomorrow. There will be no sitting next Thursday.</P>
    <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a motion to enable the introduction of electronic voting with effect from next Tuesday, 3 February 2004, to be taken without debate; No. 2, statements on the strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 12.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes, the contributions of other Senator not to exceed six minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 3, statements in relation to <Col N="286"/>the European Presidency, to be taken at 12.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m. I understand the Taoiseach will speak for 20 minutes, which will leave 40 minutes, or eight minutes for each of the five groupings in the Chamber. It will be up to the leaders of each group to sort out the time allocation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, Senator O'Toole raised the issue of the murder in Mountjoy Prison. It is the second murder in the history of the prison service, the first having been committed in 2000. I want to raise an issue of concern, which is beginning to get out of control. While I am aware of the ongoing debacle between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Prison Officers' Association concerning overtime, at the end of the day we will end up with a defective system with very little rehabilitation in the prison service.</P>
    <P>Spike Island prison was opened at a time when a joy-riding epidemic was rife in Dublin. Offenders were taken to Spike Island, which at one time had 102 prisoners but now that number has fallen to 40. The prisoners, many of whom are from rural locations, have been taken from Spike Island to St. Patrick's Institution in Dublin, which is a closed prison and is already congested. Prisons were originally designed to hold one prisoner per cell, which would be the proper procedure but, as a result of lack of capacity, cells are being used to hold two prisoners. Senators will have read newspaper reports of a sexual assault on a prisoner from Spike Island in one of those cells at St. Patrick's Institution. This is leading to a very difficult situation. In the past, Ministers were very loud in heralding extra prison places but those are now being scaled down. Prisoners in St. Patrick's Institution are aged from 16 to 21 and there is no rehabilitative system in place for them after they leave the closed prison system. Shanganagh Castle in Shankill, County Dublin, has been closed. It acted as a halfway house in the rehabilitation process for young offenders.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the serious situation we have had in the past in Limerick. I understand it is possible that weaponry has been smuggled into Limerick Prison where building work is being carried out. It appears that a worker in builder's uniform, not necessarily from the site, was seen on CCTV smuggling items into a workshop in the prison. An investigation is now taking place to investigate the strong suspicion that weaponry has been smuggled in to the prison. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, must come to this House to discuss the prison system which is beginning to creak. If there is a row over a system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dardis may feel it is all right to laugh, but I regard this as a serious matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not laughing about that matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what the joke is about.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the Senator has no knowledge with regard to the reason I was laughing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Minister is a colleague of the Senator's, and I would like him to come to the House to answer questions rather than to make statements. We should be concerned with what is happening in the system.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will revisit that subject when we get some response as to the reason the particular prisoner who was murdered was in B wing. The Leader said she would contact the Minister on this crucial issue and I look forward to hearing his response. I agree with the point made that where people must live in crowded conditions it creates congestion and difficulties.</P>
    <P>When the matter of taking the Immigration Bill on Friday was put to the Whips, it was put on the basis that it would go through the D&aacute;il on Thursday and that it had to be passed before the weekend. I am sick and tired of being misled by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am really tired of it. We make changes to accommodate the Department, but suddenly the matter is no longer urgent. I am not happy to complete our debate of the Bill on Friday although I do not mind if we deal with Second Stage because we have already committed to dealing with it. I am opposed to rushing the Bill through on Friday because there is no longer any urgency. The urgency pressed on us by the Leader in all honesty was that the Bill had to passed by us before the weekend. This is no longer the case and the Department should be told to take a running jump. It always carries on in this manner. It makes its business urgent for everybody, yet it always gets it wrong. This is about the third time in two years we have had to revisit legislation on which the Department refused to accept changes when it was first brought through these Houses. It is the worst Department to deal with in this House. It never accepts amendments. No matter which Minister is present, they sit blank-faced and stonewall through all Stages. We never make progress with them and the result is that legislation has to be revisited and all sorts of difficulties arise such as the reappointment of judges who have been in office for years. This happens with the Department time and again. I am not prepared, <Col N="288"/>and neither should the House be, to rush through this legislation on Friday morning. The legislation is crucial because it gives additional powers to people and we must give it time.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the implications of the European Commission decision in relation to Ryanair. Members of the Houses must be made aware of the difference between subventions and doing business with airports. Ryanair has been fleecing small airports around Europe. If the Commission gets it right on Tuesday, there will be no further difficulty. However, if it comes up with a solution which prevents an airport such as Shannon from doing the sort of deal it does at present, where it does not apply a charge to those opening new routes for some years, it will be a disaster. There is nothing wrong with it stopping unscrupulous airlines such as Ryanair from forcing small communities to pay money they do not have for the provision of a service but if it prevents airports from doing deals to provide incentives to open new routes, it will create a huge problem. We need openness and understanding on this issue. We do not all need to rush behind Ryanair, but we do need to support openness and be aware of the needs of small airports such as Shannon, Charleroi and others.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Our spokesman, Senator Ross, will deal with that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O'Toole on the issue of the Immigration Bill. It is recognised that this House does its best to co-operate with Departments, but we do not like to be misused. We appreciate that the Leader takes this same view and does not allow the House to be misused. We need to revisit the situation with regard to the Bill. We agreed to debate it tomorrow in order to facilitate what we were told was an urgent situation. However, it no longer appears to be urgent. Media reports have led me to understand that the Minister has listened to and heard the difficulties of the Opposition with the speed the Bill was being rushed through the Houses. Does this not apply equally to the Seanad?</P>
    <P>I suggest we just take Second Stage tomorrow. We propose to bring forward a number of amendments. As a minimum, I ask the Department to indicate through the Leader whether it is open to amendments. In particular, if amendments are taken on board in the D&aacute;il, the legislation should return to the Seanad. The Department should not take the view that any amendments made by the second Chamber should not be entertained because this would delay the progress of the Bill. I ask the Leader to transmit this message to the Department. If the urgency has gone, there is no need to take all Stages of the Bill tomorrow. As we have put the matter in our diary, we could start the process tomorrow with Second Stage and complete it next week.</P>
    <P>Committees were particularly busy yesterday. It was a hectic day as recorded by RTE. A <Col N="289"/>particularly useful debate took place at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the issue of phone charges, particularly the increase in fixed telephone line rental charges which are causing difficulty for consumers and all players in the market. Will the Leader consider allowing the House to debate the issue? Extensive and useful information, much of it new, was brought before the committee yesterday. It would be useful to Members of this House to examine and debate that information and to hear the Minister's plans on the matter with regard to consumers and their protection.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate on the mobile telephone industry in this country. Currently, we have a duopoly which makes fine profits. The Eircell wing of Eircom was sold to Vodafone at a discounted price. The successful creation of a duopoly has resulted in keeping other players out of the market. Vodafone and O2 together have 95% of the market. Meteor has no opportunity to grow because of the refusal of both players to allow Meteor to use its licence and coverage. They have also succeeded in keeping out NVNO operators. Vodafone is making significant profits of &euro;400 million a year. Last week a request issued from this House with regard to blocking pornography coming through on telephones which would be quite easy to do as there are only a few telephone suppliers such as Nokia. However, I saw a reply in the newspaper saying that people have a right to send and transmit these images. Many pay-as-you-go mobile telephones are bought by adults for children. I ask for a debate on this serious issue. No action will be taken unless we request it and the Leader writes to ComReg.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to confirm or deny whether it is the State's contention that people with diabetes are unfit to drive? We have all got diabetic friends, family members or neighbours and following a recent ban on a diabetic, this decision will have serious implications for up to 115,000 diabetics here. It was irresponsible of the DPP to bring this case. I ask that the Minister comes to the House as there will be serious implications for diabetics if they cannot drive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the points made by Senator O'Meara on the debate at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and with what was said by Senator Hanafin. Competition and the duopoly which was mentioned are matters on which we could usefully have a serious debate. We should acknowledge the very constructive manner in which the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has dealt with the issues. He has displayed great interest and flair in the manner in which he has tackled what are fairly complex issues. Most <Col N="290"/>objective commentators and observers agree that the initiatives the Minister has taken have proven to be quite effective.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to have a debate on the recently announced programme of the National Roads Authority in the not too distant future. I am concerned about the lack of investment in projects in the south east where there is a real need for road improvement. Much of the south east would have qualified for Objective One status if it had been contiguous with the BMW region. We also need to examine the value for money we are getting in some instances. I acknowledge that the M1 is a tremendous success. It represents the standard for which we should be aiming. On the other hand, the N11, which is the route to Wexford along the coast, has 40 mph speed limits despite the investment of considerable amounts of money in a dual-carriageway. It begs the question of why we are investing in roads. The answer is obviously to facilitate improvements in the operating costs of business and industry by providing them with roads commensurate with that objective. Obviously, someone in the NRA does not appreciate that which is why a debate would be useful.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business, the Leader outlined that the time limit on the debate later will be eight minutes per grouping. While I will accept that in this instance, in future the time allocated should reflect the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il represents 50% of the Members of the House. Time should not be allocated on a group basis as there is a huge disparity in numbers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is at it again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In all fairness, I ask the Leaders of each group and the Whips to examine this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did not Fianna F&aacute;il try to burn the Reichstag yesterday?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Members around the House will join me in expressing sadness and horror at the bombing in Jerusalem this morning. It is an appalling thing to happen and I feel it particularly because it exploded five minutes from where I lived for many years from time to time. I know the area well. During the recent visit a number of us made, all Palestinian leaders condemned this sort of activity on moral grounds and said it was counterproductive, as it has proved to be in this case. Instantly, the Israeli spokesman, Mr. Raanan Gissin, said the bomb demonstrated that the rest of the world should stand back and let Israel do what it needed to in the interests of its security. I, for one, will not stand back because serious human rights issues are involved. This outrage cannot be used to mask them.</P>
    <P>I went through the usual routine in these circumstances of ringing Jerusalem this morning <Col N="291"/>to find out if friends, loved ones and neighbours were fine. They are, thank God. I was told something I did not know. Yesterday, nine Palestinians, most of whom were unarmed civilians, were shot dead in Gaza. We heard nothing about it here. As far as I am concerned, a life is a life and each should be cherished.</P>
    <P>It did not come as a surprise to many of us that the BBC has been &ldquo;Widgeryed&rdquo; by Lord Hutton. From the wireless this morning, I understand that he was associated with that tainted process. I am astonished. When a list of 25 names is provided, the correspondent is told to guess which one is relevant, he hits gold at No. 25 and the matter is confirmed, what has happened to the policy of neither confirming nor denying in security matters? Dr. Kelly was outed by the British Government and although he said he had nothing to do with it, Mr. Blair chaired the meeting at which the decision was taken. That makes him a confirmed liar in my opinion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not proper. It is unfair to say that about a neighbouring Prime Minister or any parliamentarian. Will the Senator amend his comment?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If I must find some more emollient phrase for the record to cover his deceit, I will certainly attempt to do so though it will take me a little while. In the meantime, I withdraw the specific word.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased the Cathaoirleach asked our colleague to withdraw that particular word.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that. I had intended to support Senator Norris in his earlier impassioned plea which was somewhat diluted by his subsequent sad comments about the friendly Prime Minister of a neighbouring country. Having said that, I praise the Senator. Many Members will agree with his exchange of views with the Israeli ambassador on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; recently. I compliment Senator Norris on the manner in which he conducted that debate.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader consider asking the relevant Minister, whom I believe is the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, if he will come to the House to make a statement on the decision by the European Commission recently to fine Ryanair? It would also be appropriate to raise with the Minister the question of subsidies to State-owned airports throughout Europe. As far as I can interpret, the Minister in Brussels yesterday criticised the Commission's decision. If he did, I share his views. It is a matter of grave concern. I am not an apologist for Ryanair, but the company opened the entire aviation market <Col N="292"/>and provided access to air travel to hundreds of thousands if not millions of people who would not otherwise have had it. The Commission is now to question whether or not this development should be allowed to continue unfettered. If the decision of the Commission continues to be implemented, it will have very serious consequences. I am sure the Leader will have a comment on that as a former Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not anticipate what the Leader will say.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader be able to address the issue in light of her expertise in this area as distinct from her role in the House? If the Commission's decision stands, it will have very serious consequences for low cost air travel within the European Union.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what Senator Mooney has just said and what Senator O'Toole said earlier. The decision in question will be made public on Tuesday. We are speaking here of a leaked document. If Senator Mooney is correct and the decision goes against Ryanair, there are very serious implications for the airline industry in Ireland. Whereas many of us are on different sides on the Ryanair issue, this is a wider matter. It concerns not only competition in an intangible sense among airlines, but every citizen on this island. The great achievement of Ryanair has been to open airports and airlines to people who could not normally afford to travel abroad. It has created a huge market for Irish people to travel to places to which they might never have been before. If that is to come to an end, it is a matter of Government policy. It is a matter on which the Minister for Transport has already expressed an opinion. It would be very useful for us to seize the initiative by having a debate on the matter next week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the change in UK legislation last week which means that from 2005 there will no longer be anonymity in respect of sperm donations, it is timely to open the debate here and, perhaps, to change our law. A change in the legislation would not only be humane, it would be ethically and morally right.</P>

   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o'clock</TimeSt>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane, the acting Leader of the Opposition, raised the issue of the closing or mothballing of some prisons. He asked for clarification of the situation, particularly regarding St. Patrick's Institution, to where many prisoners have been transferred, and the scaling down of Shanganagh Castle and other places, including Limerick Prison. The Senator is in effect asking for a debate on the policy regarding prison accommodation arising from the recent industrial relations matter. I have spoken at length this morning to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. He is agreeable to come to the House for a debate on the issues <Col N="293"/>of juvenile crime and prison places. I will inform the House in that regard.</P>
  <P>Senator O'Toole concurred with that request and raised the issue of Friday's sitting. I wish to make it clear to the House that I was very alarmed and upset that I heard on the radio before my office was informed that this Bill was not now going through the other House because of other matters which had arisen in the Bill and which heretofore were unnoticed. I conveyed my opinion to the Minister, Deputy McDowell, this morning. He gave me a very good hearing for 15 minutes on the telephone. I have no beef with him because he listened to me. However, I heard about it on the radio before my office was informed. I am not acting in a grand manner when I refer to &ldquo;my office&rdquo;; it consists of myself and one other person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The House supports the Leader in speaking out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who is constantly on the telephone. The news was not conveyed to us by his Department so it was not his fault. I agree with Senator O'Toole. The House had arranged to sit on Friday in any case. It was put to me that the sitting was already arranged, but that was on the basis that the Bill was being dealt with first in the other House today. I am not happy about it and I have conveyed the dissatisfaction of the House to the Minister. If the House does not stand up for itself, and that is something that will be done more frequently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I will deal with the Minister on that issue. I sent three messages and three messages came back referring to a full hearing on Friday. I will propose to the Minister that the House deal with Second Stage only tomorrow and that is something I will deal with personally. It has proved difficult to work through third parties, although I thank those who helped. I do not know if the situation will be resolved.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>

   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is a tough man if he stands up to the Leader.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O' Toole raised the issue of Ryanair. I am referring to the company and not to any individual in particular. I fully agree with the Senator that there is a particular issue. Aer Rianta operates a three year system for new airlines and new routes. However, that is <Col N="294"/>different from a plain subsidy which is what small towns were bullied into giving to get these routes. This is the very matter on which I fell out with a particular gentleman who wanted me to engage in incorrect behaviour by extending the subvention period for many years. Not only did I fall out with a particular person, but I was upbraided by all and sundry, including particular Members of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader should name and shame.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a clear difference between the temporary subvention which is permitted under law and the continuation of that subvention which is not permitted. That is the matter at issue, not anything else. I have always been very clear in my mind about it, but others were not. The wheel always turns and it comes to everyone.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara will indulge my smirk. She stated that the House cannot be misused and I fully agree with her. This House cannot and will not be misused. If a Bill is urgently required for a particular purpose, the House is very generous with its agreement. I will return to the House on the question of tomorrow's business. I agree with the Senator that the schedule of the House for Friday is already arranged. However, I will be absent from the House tomorrow for personal reasons; it is my husband's anniversary. I wish to explain the reason in case it was thought that I would not attend a Friday sitting.</P>
    <P>We would all benefit from a debate on communications. I agree with Senator Jim Walsh in admiring the speed and dexterity with which the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, responded to the issues. Senator Hanafin also requested a debate on communications issues. I will ask the Minister today. Pornography is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, not the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Senator Jim Walsh also asked for a debate on the NRA programme and the varying degrees of competency on various road matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris spoke about the bombs in Jerusalem. There has been a complacency shown in the non-reporting of this event. I believe there are nine dead and 11 seriously injured. The Cathaoirleach dealt with the matter of the Hutton report.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked that the Minister for Transport come to the House to clarify the issue regarding the three year allowable subventions and the non-allowable subventions for a longer period. I suggest we await the Commission's ruling on Monday and then seek a debate.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ross that Ryanair brought air travel within the reach of most Irish people and other airlines followed. Credit should always <Col N="295"/>be given for the opening of that door and the spirit of adventure which it imbued in everybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>And to the workers in small airports whom he exploited along the way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I could write a book on that subject. In fact, I am writing a book and it will be a very important part of it.</P>
    <P>I note the change in UK legislation regarding the anonymity of sperm donors. I thank Senator Feeney for raising the matter. I will ask the Minister for Health and Children to address the issue as it has been raised with some Members by other people.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Feighan, I am not sure what was said about diabetics and who made the ruling on their fitness to drive. I presume this would be a matter for the Department of Health and Children rather than the Department of Transport. It would be a suitable subject for the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh spoke about the disparity of time allocated in debates. The time for this debate is compressed into 40 minutes. We took the easy option and divided 40 minutes by five, which gave eight minutes to each group. This is a matter that could be raised with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in order to have a clear guideline. The time is short, but I am sure the leaders will use it well.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State should move on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy that there is general agreement in society that we should make every effort to tackle the problem of crisis pregnancy. This view is shared by all persons, regardless of their views on the substantive issue of abortion. Over 6,000 women from this country have abortions abroad every year. In fact, a figure of approximately 10,000 is often quoted in this regard.</P>
    <P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution published a report on the issue of abortion in November 2000. The report stated that various Departments, State bodies and voluntary organisations have responsibilities for the issues which impact on this problem. The committee decided that a single planning focus was required to address the complexity of the programmes needed and to provide the cohesion necessary for their success. The establishment of an agency to be responsible for drawing up a strategy to combat crisis pregnancies was proposed to this end. The agency was to be responsible for promoting options other than abortion when a crisis pregnancy occurs and for providing for post-crisis pregnancy services. Having considered the committee's recommendation, the Government announced in October 2001, with all-party agreement, that the Crisis Pregnancy Agency was to be established. The Government's intention in establishing the agency was to ensure that women who encounter crisis situations will have available to them the widest possible range of assistance to help them to cope.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that, since its establishment, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has given new impetus to and has begun to play a major role in the development of co-ordinated, responsive and appropriate services for crisis pregnancy. The major &ldquo;Positive Options&rdquo; information campaign, which was developed by the agency in 2002, has been promoting support services in crisis pregnancy. The focus of the campaign is on helping women to be more aware of their options if they have a crisis pregnancy and on improving the supports and assistance available to them in such circumstances. Initiatives undertaken as part of the campaign have included a text message service, an information leaflet, posters, a web page and, in recent weeks, television advertisements. A tremendous 2,760 text messages were received on the first night that the television advertisement was screened. The campaign has received over 40,000 text requests for information as a result of hearing or seeing the &ldquo;Positive Options&rdquo; television advertisement or reading the available material. I understand that women may experience an overwhelming sense of isolation and confusion in crisis pregnancy situations. I am confident, however, that the information campaign has provided and will continue to provide invaluable support to many such women.</P><Col N="298"/>
    <P>A strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy was launched in November 2003. The comprehensive and ambitious strategy document encompasses all aspects of crisis pregnancy, from prevention to post-crisis pregnancy support. It provides a blueprint to guide policy makers and service providers in the delivery of co-ordinated programmes to prevent crisis pregnancy and to provide a comprehensive and caring response to the needs of women with crisis pregnancies. Some of the actions can be taken in the short to medium term but others, such as influencing cultural change, will require longer and more sustained approaches. The objectives of the strategy will be underpinned by a programme of research and policy advice. The agency has invested &euro;900,000 in a comprehensive research programme which will deepen our understanding of the issues surrounding crisis pregnancy and enable the agency to target its actions accurately.</P>
    <P>The strategy also deals with crisis pregnancy prevention. It emphasises that the number of crisis pregnancies, and hence abortions, could be reduced by the constant and correct use of effective methods of contraception. In conjunction with health promotion initiatives surrounding the use of contraception, the agency has called for measures to ensure that emergency contraception is more widely available on a national basis. Protocols for the prescription of contraception will be developed with the ICGP and the role and use of emergency contraception will be the subject of a promotion campaign. Other prevention initiatives include a programme of relationships and sexuality education for adolescent boys and girls and young men and women and a programme of skills-building for teachers, health care workers and parents, so that people can be supported and educated by the professionals they come into contact with regularly.</P>
    <P>The agency's remit also relates to supports during crisis pregnancy. The agency found that a decision to have an abortion can be made very quickly, which is quite sad. It reasoned that by slowing the decision-making process, women have more time to make informed choices. They need to be sure that they will receive professional and quality counselling, regardless of the option they are considering. Accordingly, while the agency acknowledges the sterling work done in this area by the main crisis pregnancy agencies, it has addressed the issue of quality assurance in respect of pregnancy counselling agencies. The strategy provides for the development of a training module for crisis pregnancy counsellors, so that in the shortest time possible all such counsellors will receive additional training to standardise the delivery of counselling. I particularly welcome this initiative.</P>
    <P>The needs of a woman who has had an abortion have been considered. Research suggests that while no woman chooses abortion lightly, the conviction of some women that it is the right choice for them is very strong. They may <Col N="299"/>choose abortion because they not want to have children at this time, or perhaps ever, or because they feel their circumstances are not conducive to parenting. Such a decision may be based on their relationship experiences, living arrangements, levels of support, goals and aspirations, financial and emotional states or many other variables. The agency has commissioned research to investigate these influences and how supports and services can be developed. The main objectives in this area are setting standards for post-abortion medical check-ups and counselling, as well as ensuring that services are available and accessible. Even in countries where abortion is freely available, however, only about 12% of women seek a post-abortion check-up.</P>
    <P>The strategy recognises that not everyone will need post-crisis pregnancy services. It aims to ensure that quality services are available and accessible when required by those who recognise that they might need help. This involves, for example, the provision of further training for health professionals and consultations with agencies in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In the most ambitious section of the strategy, it is reasoned that cultural change is an important aspect in reducing the number of crisis pregnancies. The agency has envisioned a society in which crisis pregnancy is not glamorised or sensationalised; women are supported rather than being judged or having their actions condoned; responsibility for one's actions is promoted; and negative, damaging or misleading messages about sexual health and crisis pregnancy are challenged. It is clear that we can only reduce the number of crisis pregnancies by facing the reality of sexual health in Ireland and reacting in a mature and reflective manner. Although realistically the agency cannot hope to achieve a major cultural shift in society, I hope it will be able to plant the seeds for this change.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the statements and comments of Members and I assure them that their views will be fully evaluated by my Department.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to the House. This is the 20th anniversary of the death of Anne Lovett, the 15 year old schoolgirl who died of severe haemorrhaging and exposure after giving birth alone and outdoors. This child was so frightened about her circumstances that she managed, in a small town, to hide her pregnancy from her family and friends, none of whom knew her condition until it was too late. Thankfully, Ireland has come a long way since then and there are now more supports for people like Anne Lovett. For some, however, the supports available are still not <Col N="300"/>enough. The mother of the baby girl who was abandoned last year has still not come forward to claim her. Cases such as this highlight the need for better sex education and public information campaigns to ensure people are aware of organisations such as the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and know they are not alone in their crises. Some mothers do not receive enough support when they have a child. This is certainly a factor in the decisions of more than 6,000 women every year who travel abroad to have abortions.</P>
    <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has run a number of advertising campaigns which, I am glad to report, appear to have been successful. I wish the agency every success in future campaigns. This is a positive step and is welcome. I also welcome many of the strategy's recommendations to reduce the number of pregnancies, particularly the recommendation of working in partnership with the Department of Education and Science to strengthen the delivery of relationship and sexuality education. I was disappointed to hear that only half the schools in the State are fully implementing the Department's sex education programme. Although the RSE programme is mandatory, some parents are keeping their children at home on days on which it is taught. Education can be a major factor in the reduction not only of crisis pregnancies but also of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. It is vital that we get this message to parents, teachers and, most importantly, children.</P>
    <P>Last year <i>The Irish Times</i> published a survey the results of which showed the shocking attitude of many young people towards sex. I will not go into the figures, but the findings shocked many of us. We must face up to the reality that Ireland has changed and we must change with it as legislators. We must also ensure that those who are engaging in sexual activity are aware of matters such as safe sex. The survey proved the need for sex education programmes in schools. There must be improvements in this area. In The Netherlands there has been a coherent sexual health policy since the 1970s and there has been a reduction in the number of teenage pregnancies and abortions there.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the strategy's recommendation that contraceptive services be more widely and easily accessible, as this will reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. However, where the Government offers these services I hope it will back them up with funding. Last year the Irish Family Planning Association was forced to suspend its services to women with medical cards for a number of months due to a lack of funding from the health boards. A total of 56% of those attending its clinics were in the 18 to 25 age group, which is the group most at risk of crisis pregnancy. This cannot be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>There is a need for more support services for women with children, as this could ease the pressure on women who find themselves <Col N="301"/>pregnant. There is a dearth of affordable child care in Ireland. CSO figures for the last quarter of 2002 reveal the crippling cost of child care for many families and, more importantly, lone parents. The average cost ranged from &euro;79.42 per week in the Border region to a staggering &euro;118.96 in Dublin. For families and lone parents with pre-school children only, the average cost was &euro;105.36 per week outside Dublin and &euro;131 in Dublin. The figures also show that the number of lone parents availing of child care facilities is well below the average for two-parent families. The Government is not doing enough in the area of affordable child care. If any efforts are being made in this area, they are not obvious.</P>
    <P>The strategy makes a number of sound recommendations for addressing the issue of crisis pregnancies, which I welcome. It considers education, access to contraceptive services and the need for supports for women who find themselves in crisis pregnancy and for women who choose to go ahead with their pregnancies. I am particularly supportive of the research the agency intends to carry out in the area of crisis pregnancies and I look forward to reading the findings and further recommendations. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency must compete with many others for public funding. I call on the Minister to ensure this strategy does not sit on the shelf and to commit to providing annual funding for the agency, whose work and services are so vital to the strategy's success.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. We appreciate the time he spends with us. I am pleased to have the opportunity of debating the excellent report we received towards the end of last year from the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.</P>
    <P>The agency was set up two years ago and was born out of the decades of debate surrounding crisis pregnancy. The purpose of the agency is to underpin and develop the work of existing voluntary groups and establish a process of information, education, research and advice. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency is viewed as a support for the voluntary agencies but it does not duplicate their work, which is evident from the report. I also note from the report that it is a policy-maker, educator, researcher and an opinion-former. It will establish facts and put them into the public domain in a manner that is non-judgmental, kind, considerate and sensitive. The mandate of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is to reduce the number of women choosing abortion.</P>
    <P>On reading the report, I was impressed by the methodology of the agency in bringing together three Departments. As politicians, we know how difficult it is to bring together the strands of one Department. To bring three Departments together is a huge advantage and the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, and Social and Family Affairs appear to be working well together. I support <Col N="302"/>other Senators who call for the ongoing funding of the agency because it is doing great work. Funding to date has been up to &euro;5.9 million, from which the agency funds six voluntary agencies of which Cura and the Well Woman Centre are two. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency carries out a strong monitoring role with a staff of 14. Ms Olive Braiden, as chairperson, is familiar to everybody through her work with the Rape Crisis Centre. The director, Ms Sharon Foley, is a former member of the Department of Health and Children and a formidable woman in her own right.</P>
    <P>The agency is engaged in several areas, as has been pointed out by Senator Feighan and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely. In research, the agency assesses where the gaps are in services for women. It has taken on the job of mapping the country, county by county, to see what areas are missing out on services. When those areas are identified, they are immediately resourced and worked upon. The area of counselling has improved twofold in that there are now very few waiting lists. It is now 50% easier to get an appointment for counselling than it was before the agency was set up. Other Senators referred to the advertising campaign, Positive Options, and the website listing the six agencies and the services provided. I was impressed by how the six agencies came together and did not compete for different slots in the limelight, evidence of how well this is working. They came together for the common good, producing an impressive leaflet under the umbrella of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. There was reference to the texting service - &ldquo;INFO 5444&rdquo; - and the number of hits it has received. This is chic and &ldquo;in&rdquo;. As the mother of two young teenage daughters, I scream when I am at home as they continually text. Ireland has become the texting nation of the world and it is apt to provide a service young people in difficulty can easily tap into. It is private and allows them to access information wherever they are. They are given a menu and the information they need. The advertising programme is ongoing and developing all the time. This spells out to us that there is a need to assess the funding and keep it at a level as much as we can.</P>
    <P>As a mother of four, I consider pregnancy to be the most wonderful experience in the world. It is wonderful when it is planned. However, when it is not, it is a nightmare and a terrible tragedy for most women who see no light at the end of the tunnel and wonder what will happen to them. The Minister of State rightly pointed out that abortion seems the most likely choice for those women, whether they are young teenage mothers or 30 year old career women. It is wonderful that voluntary agencies and the directly-funded Crisis Pregnancy Agency can give comfort and solace to those women. Crisis pregnancies do not just happen to single women but also to married women in good and healthy marriages. They do not come about simply <Col N="303"/>because a woman wants to hold down her job. If a woman is given the devastating news that the foetus she is carrying is so badly deformed that it is not compatible with life outside uterus, it can be a terrible devastation.</P>
    <P>Senators spoke about the importance of education and it would be remiss of us not to mention the terrible tragedy of Anne Lovett in Granard 20 years ago. If only there was more sex education in our schools, how different our world would be. The report contains a survey from 1998 to 2000 that found the percentage of sexually active women using contraception rose from 26.3% to a whacking 42.9%. Sadly, in the same period the same survey found that contraceptive use for sexually active males dropped from 35.6% to 26.3%. There is a pressing need to educate young males in their attitudes to contraception.</P>
    <P>The agency is doing a wonderful job and we must support its efforts. We must talk openly with it on the need for our society to change culturally. It is the first time that we have an agency like it and one into which everybody has bought. As a mother of four young children, I know I am scared of crisis pregnancy. Crisis pregnancies know no socio-economic boundaries and no barriers. It can happen to any woman. It is not just a woman's issue but also a community and male one. We all need to wake up to the need for cultural change. Let us get rid of the stigma of crisis pregnancy and become a more caring and welcoming society.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely. Crisis pregnancies have been with us since the dawn of time. It is splendid that we are addressing this issue in the House as ten years ago it would not have been addressed. When I was a young doctor in the Rotunda Hospital, there was no such thing as a crisis pregnancy. We chose to ignore the issue for as long as we could, which has caused incredible distress to people. I warmly commend all those who brought forward this very useful strategy document.</P>
    <P>I have had considerable experience of dealing with people with crisis pregnancies because I am the president of Cherish, which was a single mothers' organisation but is now a single parents' organisation. Some 30 years ago I felt brave merely trying to give support to this organisation, which is incredible because now if any right thinking person did not give it support, he or she would be considered quite dreadful. That reflects a major and welcome change in our society.</P>
    <P>We are particularly considering this matter from the point of view of abortions and how to ensure the number of women who go England for abortions is reduced. We never had a problem with illegal abortion but we had one with infanticide, which should be remembered. All too sadly, incidents of infanticide have occurred in the recent past in cases of concealed pregnancies in particular. I am delighted the strategy <Col N="304"/>document suggests we must address the situation regarding concealed pregnancies because it is also important in this context.</P>
    <P>Abortion can never be considered a suitable method of family planning, as was said at the Cairo conference which I attended, but we must recognise that it happens. I was interested to read in the report that women who went to England had a deep conviction that it was best thing for them to do and that they made the decision quickly. One of the problems is that many women go to England without consulting anyone here. A friend of mine who worked for the Irish Family Planning Association and is sadly now dead, Dr. Anne Legge, used to tell girls who came to her looking for information in this area to go home and think about it as they would be very little more pregnant the following day. I thought it was great advice in that at least people would give themselves time and space before they made such an extremely important decision.</P>
    <P>The Positive Options campaign appears to be very good. The cards and leaflets given out with telephone numbers on the back should encourage people, if not to contact their general practitioners who, in the main, are sympathetic in these circumstances, to contact some of the agencies such as Cherish, CURA and Life to get advice to avoid making a rushed decision. I commend, as I am sure do other Members, the way the report has been brought forward.</P>
    <P>The report points out that a crisis pregnancy can occur in a stable marriage. A teenager may not consider pregnancy a crisis or too untoward an event in her life. We have an enormous amount to do in the field of education with teenagers. Senator O'Toole will not forgive me for mentioning teachers again, but the relationships and sex programmes in the schools must be promoted more. The popular culture regarding sexual activity which teenagers observe is not productive towards a healthy sexual lifestyle. If they were to carry on in the way suggested in some popular television programmes, the risk of catching sexually transmitted diseases would be incredibly high. Sadly, we must recognise that this area should be addressed as well as the fact that a person might become pregnant because clinics report an increase in sexually transmitted diseases. It is sad to think of girls getting chlamydia, which does not have many symptoms, and subsequently becoming infertile as a result of such infection.</P>
    <P>We are not making sufficient facilities available for teenagers to get support on the decisions they make regarding sexuality. If they decide on sexual activity, it would be a good idea if they were in a position to go to clinics such as the Irish Family Planning Association. I was depressed to receive a letter last autumn from the Minister of State's area indicating that the Northern Area Health Board, which subsidises medical card services at the IFPA can no longer afford to do so, and that it is understood it would not be in position to do so for the remainder of 2003. However, these <Col N="305"/>young people are unfortunately the people we need to be in a position to support. Perhaps the Minister of State could ask health boards to ensure this type of situation does not arise. How can we introduce preventative measures if we do not ensure that those who are the most needy and may have the most socio-economic problems regarding a pregnancy can get advice?</P>
    <P>As Senator Feeney said, the increase in the use of contraception by women was welcome, but the decrease in its use by men is terribly worrying, particularly regarding sexually transmitted diseases. Something must be done regarding the education of boys. I spoke to a teacher who depressingly told me that when he was giving sex education classes, he sent the boys out to play football. That is not what was intended by the Department of Education and Science when it brought forward those programmes. Officials in the Department should read the booklets issued by the Department of Education in Uganda, the African country that has had the highest rate of decrease in the incidence of HIV infection. Its booklets are explicit and encourage teenagers to delay what is described as their sexual debut until they are further on in their education. They ask why would one get involved in sex in P5 rather than wait until P7. That may sound simplistic but apparently it is working and the children who are in the education system there are doing much better.</P>
    <P>The report points out how frequently socio-economic factors feature in a decision by a young woman to have an abortion. While single motherhood is recognised here now, not all families accept it. The claim they do is a myth. Therefore, a young woman may get little support from her family or the father of the child. That is the reason I and others expressed our concern about the removal of the rent subsidy in the private sector. As the Minister of State is aware, a tenant must be in private rented accommodation for six months before a rent supplement is given. That is not possible in the case of a woman experiencing a crisis pregnancy as she did not plan it. Therefore, how could she be in such accommodation for six months to meet the requirement to avail of the recent supplement? I understand the view of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in this regard because this is an expensive way of dealing with this issue. The cr&egrave;che allowance was not introduced for single mothers, but again it was availed of by them and was useful. We need to do more regarding housing and other accommodation.</P>
    <P>Cherish has recommended that the local authority waiting list should be used to determine the type of houses that need to be built and this practice should be standardised across local authority regions to ensure equality of access to appropriate housing types regardless of location. When the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, last spoke on housing in this Chamber, he did not give us good news about the type of local <Col N="306"/>authority housing we could hope to see being made available fairly shortly. Cherish also recommends the reintroduction of legislative protection for tenants' rights in the private sector. It also recommends the introduction of incentives to provide equal access to affordable housing for low and single income families. It requests the provision of specialist accommodation for single pregnant women and women experiencing crisis pregnancies, who are at risk of homelessness due to pregnancy, in conjunction with the support of a specialist agency. It recommends the provision of support services, in collaboration with specialist agencies and services working with specifically vulnerable and socially excluded groups, to provide additional supports for those in transit from and at risk of homelessness. We must particularly address the needs of refugees, asylum seekers and other displaced persons in this regard. We had a brief discussion in the House about a girl who was 13 when she became pregnant and 14 when a health board brought her to England for an abortion. I hope the case was followed up closely to find out who impregnated her, as she was in the charge of the State.</P>
    <P>Child care costs are another issue, as people take socio-economic factors into account when making decisions on crisis pregnancies and we do not have anything like affordable child care. I welcome the fact that women cannot be dismissed for becoming pregnant under our equality legislation, and the equal status for children whether born within or outside marriage. Those welcome developments in my lifetime have made a difference but we need to take the strategy put forward by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency very seriously. Many of its recommendations are of socio-economic import and I hope the Government will make funding available to support the report's findings.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I am interested in this debate because of the genesis of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. It was one of the exceptional success stories to emerge from the debate and analysis of the abortion issue. The objective of reducing the number of pregnancies and hence abortions, as one follows the other, is a fine one, and the agency's other objectives, as laid out in its strategy, are very important. However, we must understand the impact of unplanned or crisis pregnancies as we tend to forget about that. Understanding that impact helps to inform the programmes we put in place, as it affects all age groups.</P>
    <P>I will focus on younger girls who become pregnant. As Senator Henry said, for some teenagers pregnancy is not a crisis. They are thinking of nine months and then a tiny smiling baby, but they do not see the next 18 to 24 years of responsibility for that child. They do not think of the possible life of poverty and the lack of opportunities to get out of that poverty. What is really sad is that the person, boy or man, who gets them pregnant has run off and gone. He is not <Col N="307"/>paying for the child, nor is he caring for the child 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We must look at those areas and realise there is a responsibility on all sides.</P>
    <P>We must educate society on the responsibilities of men in particular. Every time they have unprotected sex they are putting themselves in a situation where they are creating children, and that is not good enough. We must get that responsibility across to people so that those aged 14 to 16 are thinking about the consequences of their actions when in discos late at night.</P>
    <P>Crisis pregnancies probably do not result from reported rapes because the girl can be brought to a hospital or doctor for emergency contraception, which hopefully works. However, we must look at the subject of rape. I know of a recent case in which a girl of 15 was raped at 10 p.m. in a small country town. She did not report the rape until it was too late because she could neither talk about being raped nor deal with the stigma. What is going on in our society? That is not good enough. We need to give the message that rape is not acceptable. Five young men abused a lady in Limerick, if one could call them men; I could use another word beginning with &ldquo;b&rdquo;. Those young men should be castrated. It is as simple as that. The abuse involved in that situation was absolutely disgraceful. Reports referred to it as a gang rape but it was not a gang rape. The woman was subjected to rape five times, one after the other. As Senator Feeney said to me earlier, if she had been murdered her life would have been taken away from her. She was not murdered but her life has still been taken away from her. What punishment will those men receive? Those issues also need to be considered in addressing crisis pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The strategy also outlines the need to educate people about contraception, particularly its availability and cost. Those factors affect whether people use contraception or not. As chairman of the Western Health Board I am proud that in coming weeks the board will publish a guide on contraception which I hope will become widely available in the region. The guide needs to be simple. I have some facts about pregnancy here but to spare my listeners' blushes I will not read them all out. Some people still believe that women will not get pregnant if they are having sex for the first time or if they are breastfeeding. There are clear guides available from some health boards but they should be available throughout the country. Those guides should state the times women can get pregnant or when one needs contraception. They should be in understandable English, not in the medical speak sometimes used by doctors and nurses.</P>
    <P>A submission on abstinence was made to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution's hearings on abortion and we need to talk more about that. I have daughters and I do not want to think of them or my son having sex at 14, 15 or 16 years of age. It is not right <Col N="308"/>because they are not old enough and we must educate them with programmes for young people. We must educate parents to tell them it is acceptable to talk about this matter because if we are not talking about it we are not addressing the issue. If we do not give young people the confidence to discuss the issue it will not be okay for them to stand up to peer pressure by saying they do not want to have sex at 14, 15 or 16 years. We need to get rid of that peer pressure for males and females. Senator Henry is correct. We must not be afraid to point out to people that it is acceptable to wait until they are ready and that the older they are before having sex the better they can deal with it. There will also be fewer consequences in terms of crisis pregnancies. That is not a matter of having sex before or after marriage.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o'clock</TimeSt>
	 <P>Cultural change has been mentioned and that is a very ambitious part of the strategy. I compliment the agency on addressing this as a key issue and while it is an ambitious, long-term objective, we need to talk about it. There were approximately 80 adoptions last year of Irish children born in this country. It is very sad that that is the number that was available for adoption. We should do something about adoption. People should find it easier to consider adoption as an option when they become pregnant, particularly if it is an unplanned pregnancy or one they particularly do not want.</P>
  
    <P>Another submission to the all-party committee referred to the image of motherhood. How can we attach value to being a mother? How can we make it seem like one of the most important roles in society? That is part of the cultural change we must undertake.</P>
    <P>Let us please try to make sure that we do not always treat an unplanned pregnancy as a crisis. This is not always the case; it may be an opportunity. We need to work on promoting the value of motherhood and to instigate a long-term campaign on this matter. We can examine models for this in the United States where it has already taken place.</P>
    <P>Staff from the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which is doing a great job, are in the Visitors Gallery. A set of objectives was given to them and a budget within which to work. Every organisation can do with more money and the Government is committed to continue funding in a three year programme. We have a great blueprint and a guide for policy makers. The challenge for us as a society, as a Government and, as legislators, is to implement the blueprint, review it and ensure that change will be implemented if required.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this timely debate. Senator Feighan referred to the anniversary of the Anne Lovett case, which I also intended to raise. This case shocked the nation to its foundations. We were confronted with a teenager who considered herself so isolated in her pregnancy that she died giving birth in a field. <Col N="309"/>Her baby also died. That event took place following a traumatic time for the nation, the abortion referendum of 1983. Since then we have had 20 years of sometimes difficult debate on the issue, but we have finally arrived at a position where we can talk about issues around female sexuality, pregnancy and abortion.</P>
    <?_ah?><P>I welcome the members of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to the House. I was a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which recommended the establishment of this agency. Its setting-up was a landmark in our history of coming to terms with this issue as a nation. I <?_ch?>compliment the work of the agency to date, in particular its advertisement campaign which is non-judgmental, straightforward, honest and <?_ch?>extremely informative. I imagine that it effectively targets the intended audience.</P><?_xh?>
    <P>The true measure of the effectiveness of the agency will be the reduction in the number of women travelling for abortions. As a nation we have to ask ourselves what we want to achieve. I hope it is our ambition to reduce the number of abortions. In doing so, we must ask ourselves what issues we need to address, as a number of people have done.</P>
    <P>Following the X case and, more pertinently, the more recent C case, a legal situation is in place arising from court judgments on the 1983 referendum and the amendments since then. If a woman presents with a crisis pregnancy and wants a termination, it is legal for a GP to give this information or to direct her to where she can get it, such as to a clinic in Dublin. Such a clinic can then refer the woman further and even organise an appointment, travel and so on to Britain where an abortion can be carried out. This is what the people voted for. However, it is not legal for an abortion to take place here and we accept the decision of the wider community. This gives rise to a situation where health board staff accompany young teenagers to Britain for abortions. It is legally permissible for them to do so.</P>
    <P>Is it not time for us to face up to the fundamental hypocrisy inherent in our approach to this issue? We find it acceptable that abortions take place in Britain and that Irish women travel there for abortions, but we do not want abortions to take place here. It is not a pleasant truth to face. Where do we stand on this matter? What message are we sending to women and the wider community? We clearly have a considerable road to travel in this regard. As a nation we are not ready to face up to this unpalatable contradiction.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox raised the issue of our attitude to motherhood, parenting, pregnancy and adoption as well as to our sexual values. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, referred to the issue of the sexual health of the nation. Last year a debate took place in the House about the implications of the abuse of alcohol. Concern was expressed at the behaviour of teenagers and young women, in particular, in regard to over-drinking and the related conduct which appears to be highly <Col N="310"/>sexually irresponsible. We have to face up to this in the educational process. As Senator Cox said, we need to encourage an atmosphere in which it is all right to choose not to have sex with someone relatively unknown. We also need to encourage a level of responsibility around sexual behaviour and health not only among young women, but among young men also.</P>
    <P>Parents need to be open with their children. I am the parent of a teenager and I also have a younger daughter. We have to be able to talk about these issues with children at home and in school. Great progress has been made. I commend the excellent relationships and sexuality education programme which starts in primary schools. Many people take the attitude that the school is taking care of this issue and are relieved that they do not have to think about it. However, they have to be involved in this matter as well because it is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox also raised the important issue of adoption. She rightly pointed out how few children are available for adoption. This matter also came up at the deliberations of the all-party committee. Adoption is a difficult area. Some women choose abortion over adoption because the latter is seen as a much more painful process. One has to go through the full pregnancy and then face the trauma of giving up one's child.</P>
    <P>We need to look at how the issues that arise for all women can be resolved and how we can encourage a positive and supportive attitude around adoption. To give the gift of parenthood to a couple who are unable to have their own children is one of the greatest possible gifts. Anyone that would choose to do this should not only be supported, but also commended and given every resource necessary.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that we have finally come around to judge this issue in the context of choice. Choices are available for women faced with crisis pregnancy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I also welcome members of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency in the Gallery. While there may be crises and even unwanted pregnancies, there is no such thing as an unwanted baby and I would like the members of the agency to take this message from the debate. Many families in this country would love to adopt a child. Irish families are travelling all over the world, including to Guatemala, Russia and China, to bring back children for adoption. Part of the agency's remit should be to make it plain to young girls or women in crisis pregnancy that adoption is what they should seek for their children who will be loved, cherished and treasured. This is an important message as we are concerned with reducing the number of abortions, which are the worst possible option.</P>
    <P>We need to find a coherent strategy to address the disturbing rise in the numbers of women seeking abortions in Britain. The establishment of the agency gives the opportunity to address this. We must develop a range of social measures <Col N="311"/>to meet the needs of women in crisis pregnancy in tandem with the fullest possible protection for the unborn child. Young girls and boys are under huge pressure from the media, specifically British magazines. While they cannot vote until they are 18, the images presented to young people, and the pressures they are under, would be difficult for even adults to handle.</P>
    <P>We can do something about crisis pregnancies and the rising trend in abortion - this rising trend is not inevitable. Statistics from Poland and parts of the United States show that when the conditions that pressurise women to opt for abortion are addressed, the abortion rate can be reduced. I instance the Vitae Caring Foundation in the State of Missouri. It has aired advertisements for a number of years and, because of this, Missouri has the fastest dropping abortion rate in the United States. This should be part of the remit of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.</P>
    <P>The abortion statistics for Poland show a dramatic decline. The fall in the rate pre-dated the tightening of Poland's abortion laws. While this may have been due in part to social changes that accompanied the fall of communism, it seems likely that targeted education campaigns had the dominant effect.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that we are in some way complicit in agreeing that abortion is okay in Britain, or that the health boards would send a girl to have an abortion there. It is not the preferred option. We are not the Mujahidin and do not prevent people from leaving the country. Surely the health boards should comply with our laws. The pure intent of our legislation is that the preferred option is life.</P>
    <P>I suggest a more holistic approach. There should be respect for the dignity of the individual. Taking full account of the damage caused to emotions as well as the physical consequences of early sexual activity, there should be a campaign - as Senator Henry suggested - encouraging people to abstain from sex until they are better able to handle it emotionally. There is no contraception against getting hurt.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I had not intended to speak on this motion. However, having listened to the contributions, I feel we are having a valuable debate that should be reflected upon by Members and the public. Since 1983, when the first constitutional amendment on the issue of abortion was put to referendum, we have had a long debate on abortion, its alternatives and where society should go. During the course of the most recent abortion referendum, the Minister decided to establish the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which was supported by the Fine Gael Party. If my memory serves me well, the agency may have been a suggestion proposed by the then Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Gay Mitchell. The agency has a huge role to play in offering people a real alternative, and as Senator Hanafin said, the alternative of life.</P><Col N="312"/>
    <P>This debate is often emotive and we must be careful about the language we use. However, we must realise that in today's complex Ireland, this subject requires serious attention. We must put in place a series of aspirations for the country of what is the right and best way to proceed. We must encourage the maximum number of girls who find they have a crisis pregnancy to take the option of continuing with the pregnancy. Senator Hanafin's comments on adoption are worth reflecting on. We are all aware of many people who would love to adopt a child but for whom that option is not available. Ironically, many abortions are carried out in Europe each year while a large number of people want to adopt children yet are unable to do so. Many people would be in a position to provide a home and family for a child yet cannot get children from the adoption agencies.</P>
    <P>We must put the necessary mechanisms in place to promote the concept of adoption so that girls who find they have a crisis pregnancy see that adoption is an available option. However, we must also realise that adoption does not solve the problem for everyone. That many single women now rear their child is to be welcomed. While the level of social support available in this State is reasonable, it could be expanded. A cutback in allowances for single parents going back to work was announced in the budget. This is regrettable. We should try to keep supports in place for single parents looking after their children and I am disappointed with the measures contained in the budget.</P>
    <P>I support the work of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. I have seen its television advertisements which certainly convey a clear message. Much more advertising is necessary. Perhaps the promotion has to start at school level because at a later stage people may have preconceived ideas. The Minister is taking a very welcome step in the right direction, which is fully supported by all reasonable people. However, the Minister must ensure all young people are aware of the options open to them in a crisis pregnancy. A strong message must be sent out that the State is willing to provide the maximum social and financial support to those with a crisis pregnancy. As we describe ourselves as pro-life, we must put our money where our mouth is.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The most important aspect of the debate is to recognise the times in which it is rooted. The most significant change is attitudinal. As a society, we no longer rush to pass judgment on those who are pregnant outside marriage, but are prepared to support them. As public representatives and legislators the main message to get across is that although State support is crucial, it cannot compare with the support of family and community, especially the extended family of both parents. It is important to recognise there are two parents; even if the young man is in his teens it is crucial that he is involved during the course of the pregnancy. Let me <Col N="313"/>restate that all possible options should be made available and people should be aware of these. I regret the exodus to Britain, not necessarily on moral or ethical grounds but because people go in many cases as they feel they will not be supported. There are cases where families do not stand by a young woman who is pregnant outside marriage.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, we discussed domestic violence and Women's Aid but in many ways blackmail and pressure is much worse than physical violence. As a society, we must ensure there is full non-judgmental support. We always go wrong in making a judgment as to the rights and the wrongs of a situation. In this situation a new life must be protected and the two parents and the child should be supported. No support the State can give is greater than the power of love. The child and his or her mother and father need to be loved. I have seen two cases in which teenagers had unplanned children where both parents subsequently went their separate ways and formed new relationships, but are still parenting the child. This proves the point of the importance of love and support. Those children could not ask for greater love than they are getting from their parents, even though the parents are in different relationships. Society may not like this, but children can be loved, respected and developed outside of marriage. It may be more difficult or pressurised but if people are committed they can do it. I believe that today's young parents are better and more responsible than former generations.</P>
    <P>We have discussed an important issue and the work of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is to be lauded.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the discussion and welcome the broad support for the strategy.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox referred to the alleged violent rape in Cratloe outside Limerick, but obviously I do not wish to comment on the alleged case against the five youngsters. Several constituents have expressed their horror at that event. I wonder whether society consider mandatory sentencing for rape. Unfortunately, rape is prevalent and every few days we hear of women being raped. As a Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, I wonder at the attitude of those who commit these vile deeds.</P>
    <P>From the Senators' contributions it is clear they are very positively disposed to the initiatives underpinned by the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. While it has only been in existence for two years, the agency has made its presence felt. The Positive Options campaign is a major information programme and the number of text messages received since its inception attest to the impact it is having and the very positive contribution it is making in providing useful information. It is also clear that the most effective way to reduce the number of women opting for <Col N="314"/>abortion when faced with a crisis pregnancy is to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies in the first instance. We can only reduce the number of crisis pregnancies by facing the reality of sexual health in Ireland and reacting in a mature and reflective manner. I commend the Senators who have spoken because in the past the debate was too emotive, with insufficient reflection on facing up to the reality. I believe the strategy makes a major contribution to addressing the issue of crisis pregnancy. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and I are looking forward to working with the agency in implementing the strategy.</P>
    <P>The various points raised by the Senators will be taken into consideration in evolving further policies.</P>

	<P>I was just coming to that. The Senator thinks like me. I did not get on very well, I have to say. I spent 45 minutes of the past hour in communication with the Minister's private secretary and, finally, with the Minister himself again. All Stages of the Immigration Bill are scheduled to be taken here tomorrow. I have informed the Cathaoirleach and he is not happy about it. I am distinctly unhappy about it too because the Bill will not be taken in the D&aacute;il until next Wednesday and, therefore, I cannot understand why we should be pushed around, which is what is happening. I agreed in the end but I have dictated a strong letter to the Minister about this. I do not blame the Minister personally but I genuinely think he is being pushed around by people in his Department. I am being frank about it because I know from the conversation I have had that that is what is happening. Following comments made recently in a judge's report about officials in that particular Department, we are all aware of the situation, which does not seem to have altered.</P>
    <P>In any case, the House will take all Stages of the Immigration Bill tomorrow. It has nothing to do with the Taoiseach, in case Senators thought it had. It concerns a particular Department.

   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for holding up the business of the House but my colleague, the Polish Prime Minister, was running a little behind schedule.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the Seanad on Ireland's Presidency of the European Union and developments in Northern Ireland. Last September, I had the privilege of appearing before the Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform. At that time, and in my submission to the Committee on European Affairs in June, I highlighted the European Union and Northern Ireland as areas where this House has played a significant role. It is a particular pleasure, <Col N="316"/>therefore, to have this opportunity to update Senators on developments in both these areas.</P>
    <P>First, I will address the European Union and Ireland's Presidency. Last year, before the sub-committee, I underlined the importance of ensuring that the Seanad, and the Houses of the Oireachtas as a whole, are in the best position to respond to the challenges that face Ireland now and into the future. A critical issue for us, as public representatives, is how we can use our democratic institutions to engage more people in a full understanding of the processes that fundamentally affect our lives.</P>
    <P>The introduction in 2002 of the system of Oireachtas scrutiny of European Union measures has gone a significant part of the way towards responding to this challenge. That system, which is overseen by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs, is established now and is working well. I congratulate Senators for their important work in this area.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the European Union is being expanded to 25 members in May. Negotiations for further membership are ongoing and more applications are expected. This expansion and the ongoing process of European integration, coupled with an ever changing global environment will, inevitably, make the European Union more complex and challenging for all of us. It will also provide new opportunities and possibilities and we must be prepared to grasp them.</P>
    <P>In this new context, the Seanad could provide even greater added value to the identification and elaboration of Ireland's vital national interests in the European Union. It could also make an even more effective contribution to ensuring that Ireland, in the European Union, continues to engage positively and constructively. I look forward to the publication of the final report of the Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform in the near future. I pay tribute to the chairperson of the group, Senator O'Rourke, and all its members for carrying this vital work forward. They can rest assured that the Government will give careful consideration to the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>Our sixth Presidency comes at a challenging time for the European Union. There is the ongoing work of the Intergovernmental Conference to progress. In addition, we must continue the drive to create a Union of greater competitiveness with more jobs in an enlarged context. The justice and external relations agendas must also be managed and advanced.</P>
    <P>Prior to our Presidency we prepared an annual programme with the future Netherlands Presidency. We also prepared a multiannual programme with the five future Presidencies to the end of 2006. These programmes, and our own Presidency programme, provide the framework for the work of the European Union for the coming period. The three programmes have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the <Col N="317"/>Presidency programme has been circulated to each Member of the House.</P>
    <P>We have chosen a theme for our Presidency which is practical and, at the same time, visionary. Our theme, Europeans Working Together, reflects our desire to work with our partners to build on the success that the people of Europe have already created. We have made a good start. We have had meetings with the Commission and with the European Parliament. We have also held a number of successful informal Council meetings here in Ireland. In recent days, Ministers have been briefing the Parliament's committees on our Presidency priorities and our first formal Council meetings have begun. In addition, members of the Government, myself included, have maintained close contact with our counterparts on the full range of important issues with a view to moving ahead on our work programme.</P>
    <?_ah?><P>Building on the European Convention, the Intergovernmental Conference made considerable progress on a constitution for Europe last year. It was, therefore, disappointing that it was not possible to reach agreement on the outstanding issues at the European Council in Brussels last month. There is no doubt in my mind that the very significant progress that was made in the IGC was due in no small part to the efficiency and <?_xh?>determination with which the Italian Presidency approached the negotiations. We are grateful to it for this excellent work. It now falls to Ireland, as holder of the Presidency, to try to make further progress. We are determined to do whatever we can to encourage and facilitate the earliest possible agreement. Our work will be based on the report of the European Convention and the progress made so far in the IGC. This progress is reflected in particular in the papers submitted to the European Council by the Italian Presidency following the conclave of Foreign Ministers in Naples.</P><?_xh?>
    <P>At the December European Council, I undertook to consult with my European partners and to make a report to the European Council in March. This series of consultations is well underway. I have had initial contact with almost all of my colleagues on the European Council. I met Prime Minister Aznar in Madrid on Monday and this morning I had a very useful meeting with Prime Minister Miller of Poland. The Swedish and Belgian Prime Ministers visited Dublin earlier this month. Further visits and contacts are planned as I continue to explore the possibilities for progress with my partners.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, are also engaged in bilateral consultations. Foreign Ministers had a fruitful informal discussion on the IGC in the margins of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels last Monday. In all our contacts, we have found that all are committed to helping us find a way forward. During February, we will begin to make an assessment of how and when we can progress matters further. I propose to <Col N="318"/>make the fullest possible report to the European Council in March.</P>
    <P>A new European Union constitution would help the Union respond to the demands and expectations of its citizens. It would help the Union play a more coherent and effective role in the world. What is required to achieve our common objective is sufficient political will to enable agreement to emerge. Over the coming months, if there is, at any stage, a real prospect of agreement, we will immediately seize the opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is too early to say whether we can reach agreement during the Irish Presidency or whether more time will be required. Nonetheless, there is a greater awareness now about the danger of delay. The European Union moves on. During 2004, we will have elections to the European Parliament, we will appoint a new Commission, a range of national elections will be held and we will begin the first stages of the negotiations on the financial perspectives of the Union post 2007. New circumstances inevitably risk opening up progress already made. I sense that there is a growing realisation of this danger now. It is in everyone's interest to complete the IGC negotiations as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Ten new members will join the Union in its largest single expansion in three months time. We are delighted that the honour will fall to us, as holders of the Presidency, to welcome the new members on 1 May. A Day of Welcomes is planned. This day will consist of a major event in Dublin. The historic event will be marked too in towns around Ireland. A series of cultural events, including concerts in Belfast and Dublin, are proposed. Irish arts and culture groups will travel to participate in similar events across Europe. The historic enlargement of the European Union should be celebrated at community level.</P>
    <P>We will aim to ensure a smooth transition from a Union of 15 to a Union of 25 by successfully integrating the new member states into the full workings of the Union. The effective and efficient management of the Union's agenda in this new enlarged context is a key priority for our Presidency. We will also progress the future enlargement agenda, with Bulgaria and Romania. I will also support Turkey in its efforts to meet the criteria for accession.</P>
    <P>Another of our key priorities is to give renewed focus to the reform goals set out at Lisbon in 2000. Although progress has been made over the past number of years, it is clear that we must increase momentum if we are to achieve the goal of making Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010. This was confirmed in the Commission report prepared for the spring European Council and published last week. Each member state has a critical role to play if our collective goal is to be achieved. We intend to use the spring European Council to re-inject momentum into the process. We need to seize the opportunity to make the most of the positive <Col N="319"/>signs of economic progress that are emerging in Europe and internationally.</P>
    <P>Last November, I wrote to my colleagues in the European Council setting out my proposed approach and the key elements of the Lisbon agenda on which I intend to focus at the spring European Council. Our objective is to have a focused strategic discussion on the most pressing economic and social challenges facing Europe. We have identified a number of priority target areas where we aim to achieve real progress. These include promoting economic growth and structural reform, fostering competitiveness, delivering more and better quality employment and ensuring sustainable growth. Our objective is to set out a clear path for achieving goals in these key areas.</P>
    <P>The Union has provided an area of peace and prosperity for its citizens for almost 50 years. We have also created a single market where our people can trade and do business without barriers. We must ensure that the freedoms we enjoy are not exploited by criminal elements for criminal gains. The ambitious agenda aimed at developing the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice will help to equip the Union to respond to these challenges.</P>
    <P>As holders of the Presidency, we will have an important role to play over the coming months. We will work hard to ensure the delivery of the outstanding requirements under the Amsterdam Treaty and the broader Tampere programme. This will involve advancing a wide-ranging agenda including measures on asylum, immigration, police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters and civil law co-operation.</P>
    <P>We will take the opportunity at the justice European Council meeting to initiate an assessment of the achievements of the Tampere programme, with a view to launching a further development of the Union's justice and home affairs policies. We have identified the fight against drugs and organised crime and combating illegal immigration and trafficking in humans as areas where we will seek to build on the existing arrangements for co-operation at European Union level. Ensuring greater security and safety for the people of the European Union will be at the heart of our approach in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through the full list of the external relations engagements that we will have during our Presidency. Nonetheless, they are extensive and reflect the increasingly significant role the European Union plays on the world stage. A sense of the depth and breadth of these commitments and engagements can be found in the Presidency programme. Our approach will be based on the common values of the European Union - democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. The European Union can make a major contribution to the promotion of a fairer, peaceful and more secure world.</P><Col N="320"/>
    <P>Our Presidency will promote, in particular, EU-UN co-operation in the areas of crisis management, the fight against the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the promotion of human rights, UN reform and effective multilateralism. We will work with our partners in all regions of the world to achieve our shared goals.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o'clock</TimeSt>
	<P>There is an extensive range of commitments at Foreign Minister level and, indeed, a growing number of commitments in sectoral areas. I, together with President Prodi and High Representative Javier Solana, will represent the Union at summit meetings with Canada, Japan, the Latin American and Caribbean countries, Russia and the US.</P>
   
    <P>The fight against HIV and AIDS is one of our key Presidency priorities. The rate of HIV and AIDS is increasing at its fastest in Europe and Central Asia. We will host a major international conference in Dublin towards the end of February to promote co-operation among the countries of these regions to fight the disease. We hope the outcome of this meeting will be an action plan to ensure the disease is tackled effectively through prevention, treatment and care. The conference will be a real example of effective multilateralism. The European Commission, observers and associated states of the European Union and the full range of United Nation organisations will be involved. I hope this brief overview of our work programme for the next six months gives the House some flavour of the challenges which lie ahead.</P>
    <P>This may be the last Presidency in this form which Ireland will have the honour to conduct. I assure the House that we will continue to work hard to ensure this Presidency is remembered for having made a real and lasting contribution. It is our aim to help move forward its agenda to enable the European Union to better equip itself to meet the challenges of the future. We will do this to the best of our ability in a fair and even-handed manner. We will look to all member states, the institutions of the EU and this House for support in this important task.</P>
    <P>There can be no going back on the process of change in Northern Ireland. It is now some two months since the Assembly elections provided the parties with mandates which we respect. With these mandates comes a responsibility to make political progress. I regret that the elections did not provide an immediate basis on which the devolved administration could be restored. I genuinely believe that the people of Northern Ireland want their own administration run by their own politicians. For most, direct rule is not the answer.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland is at its best when the devolved institutions of government function as intended in the Agreement. The two Governments will do everything in their power to encourage all parties to engage and address, once and for all, the issues which stand in the way of <Col N="321"/>devolution. In the interests of the people of Northern Ireland, the parties must allow everyone to move forward. As Governments, we are committed to the full implementation of the Agreement and are determined to pursue this course. There should be no doubt about that issue. While we acknowledge that some time is necessary to address the current impasse, our joint determination and commitment to the Agreement is strong and undiminished.</P>
    <?_ah?><P>If there had been a better way to proceed, we would have found it. There was no other way. We are satisfied that the Agreement which emerged after protracted negotiations under the chairmanship of Senator George Mitchell includes the <?_ch?>elements essential in the context of a divided <?_ch?>society to building relations on and between these islands. Our two Governments are determined to protect the Agreement and last week saw intensive engagement between us on Northern Ireland. Earlier in the week, I met with the Prime Minister to follow up on our meeting of 17 <?_ch?>December and to assess the prospects for progress over the coming period. We are engaged in the practical work of taking the process forward. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the <?_ch?>Northern Ireland Secretary of State subsequently met in Dublin at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to address the many issues on which progress can and must be made. These include human rights and criminal justice. Full delivery in these and other important areas is not affected by the absence of devolution.</P><?_xh?>
    <P>In early February, we will begin the review which was negotiated as part of the Agreement. The review will focus on the operation of the Agreement rather than on its fundamentals. It will provide an opportunity for the parties to reflect together on how the existing arrangements have functioned and to consider their future operation. We want the review to take place in an atmosphere of constructive engagement and we will work with all parties to achieve a positive outcome. All parties must reassure each other that they are engaged with the process and will do what is necessary to bring back real, active, inclusive and democratic institutions. There are responsibilities on all sides for parties and Governments.</P>
    <P>The Government's goals are open and transparent. We do not have any hidden agenda. We want to implement the Agreement and end paramilitarism. We want to see devolved government restored and we want full and open dialogue with all strands of unionism as well as nationalism. This afternoon, I will meet in London with the Democratic Unionist Party which is led by the Reverend Ian Paisley. I approach this meeting mindful of the past, but with the future uppermost in my thoughts. We may continue to disagree on many things, but I welcome genuinely and sincerely the opening of this dialogue with the DUP. I have said that we have no hidden agenda as I believe we have <Col N="322"/>demonstrated consistently in our efforts to advance peace and reconciliation on this island.</P>
    <P>Last Monday, I met with representatives of the Ulster Political Research Group. I have long held the view that opening dialogue with representatives of the loyalist community is important. This meeting was a logical follow up to my meeting with the Loyalist Commission last June. I recognise the very real concerns loyalists have about issues which affect their communities, particularly jobs, housing and educational opportunities. I am encouraged by some of the positive work being done to address the problems in these communities. We want to be constructive and to assist in any way we can.</P>
    <P>My views on paramilitarism and sectarianism are well known. I have made it clear to republicans and loyalists that all such activities must cease. Violence and the threat of violence are not in the interests of anyone, including their own communities. I deplore recent sectarian and racist attacks and attacks on prison officers. Such illegality must be dealt with by the police and those responsible must be brought to justice.</P>
    <P>Last year was difficult and frustrating in terms of our efforts to make political progress in Northern Ireland. We made some real progress but suffered some real disappointments. The engagement of the Government was intensive and sustained and that will no less be the case this year. We will continue to work at all levels and in every way possible to consolidate and build on this indispensable process. I thank the Members for providing me with opportunity to brief the House on these issues.</P>

	<P>I wish the Taoiseach a very sincere welcome to the House. We very much respect the fact that he is briefing us. I have studied the documentation provided. It outlines a very comprehensive programme for the six months of the Presidency. With ten accession countries joining on 1 May, this is an historic time for this country and for the European Union. We will celebrate that nationally on the Day of Welcomes.</P>
    <P>The points I wish to elaborate on regarding the basis of the document I have read will be constructive. They have been raised in the House before. Agriculture and food safety are issues the Taoiseach should address during the six months of the Presidency. They have come sharply into focus recently with concerns about the avian flu among chickens in Thailand which has spread throughout Asia. The issue percolates to Europe in the extremely important issue of food safety. While countries have the right to export product <Col N="323"/>to this country, consumers also have rights. The consumer is entitled to know if a poultry product comes from Thailand or if a beef product comes from Brazil. The consumer should have freedom of choice.</P>
    <P>We have very strict hygiene and quality standards for processors involved in poultry production and other areas. In light of those high standards, it is not acceptable for an Asian country to export product to this country which with further packaging is described as originating in the Netherlands or France. That is an exercise in the deception of the consumer. In the context of food safety, I would like to see the introduction of proper labelling of all European products. It should be considered and I encourage the Taoiseach to speak to the Minister for Agriculture and Food about the matter.</P>
    <P>We have focused in our minds on immigration and asylum seekers to a great extent in recent times. I wish to speak about an element of immigration which is very important to this country. On 1 May, citizens of the ten accession countries will have the right to come here and work. That is important. Obviously, they will bring certain skills with them. Equally important is an issue of which the Leader of the House is very aware as I have raised it many times. A barrier has existed for nurses from the Philippines and other countries outside the European zone whose husbands have not had the right to work here. The matter is being examined by the T&aacute;naiste. It is an economic disadvantage to many of those who come here to provide skills of which we have shortages like those which exist in the medical profession and nursing. We should provide every incentive possible when issuing work permits to avoid seeing these people travel instead to the North of Ireland to receive a permit there. While the issue is being addressed in respect of nurses, I would extend consideration of it to other areas in which skills shortages exist. We should be sympathetic to the rights of the partner of a work permit holder.</P>
    <P>I hope the constitutional treaty issue is resolved during Ireland's Presidency. I acknowledge those who participated in the Praesidium, particularly former Taoiseach Deputy John Bruton for his tremendous work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House. While I am aware of the grave responsibility of the Taoiseach's European duties, we all envy him for the fact that he holds the Presidency of Europe at the most exciting time in the political history of the Continent.</P>
    <P>I first spoke in this House in 1987 and at that time the Continent of Europe was divided by the Berlin wall and the Cold War. The changes since then are beyond description. Some 14 or 15 years ago it could not have been imagined that we would be now dealing with and ready to welcome into the family of Europe countries that for so long suffered under the cosh of the Cold War and <Col N="324"/>the Soviet Union. Yesterday afternoon, some of my colleagues met with a delegation from Bulgaria. That country is not in the first accession stage but the enthusiasm and expectation of the delegation shows how far the Continent has come in the past ten years. The final part of the jigsaw is being moved into position. I wish the Taoiseach well in the next IGC meeting.</P>
    <P>It is important to finalise the European constitution and it would be desirable to see it finalised in Dublin. The concept of a treaty of Dublin is one which would be a source of some degree of political satisfaction for the Taoiseach and all of us. It is important to put in place a treaty that will work. I support the Taoiseach's view on the comments attributed to Mr. Prodi concerning the two-speed Europe. There must be an end to that type of attitude and speech. This House gave a commitment to the Irish people as a result of our acceptance of the Nice treaty that every elector in the new Europe would be equal. This House must state that there will not be a two-speed Europe, that the family of Europe will be a family of equal nations. I admire the manner in which the Taoiseach is ensuring this will come to pass and that one or two of the larger European countries will not be dominant.</P>
    <P>There have been difficulties in the past year in the relationship of Europe with the United States. There is right and wrong on both sides when it comes to difficulties between countries just as in families. We should not ignore what is happening as regards the accession countries and countries such as Bulgaria and Romania. Regardless of whether we like it, these countries have taken a decision as to how closely they wish to be linked to the United States. I would not wish to see the United States in a close relationship with the countries of central and eastern Europe and Ireland in the middle and somewhat aloof. We need to repair our relationship with the United States and ensure that the United States will have a good relationship with all of Europe and not just the accession states.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's comments about UN reform are also very pertinent and important, but they have been ignored for too long. We must concede that, over the past ten years, the United Nations as an entity has not worked. It is a pity that it took the Iraqi war to demonstrate that fact. There is wrong on all sides but we must endeavour to make the United Nations work.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach well in his talks with Dr. Paisley today. It shows how far we have come as a country that those talks will take place in a civilised and constructive fashion. Like the politics of Europe since the Second World War, compromise is required on all sides; nobody has all the answers and right and wrong do not belong exclusively to one side. There is nobody in the towns and townlands of Northern Ireland who does not wish to live in a country where there is peace, justice and security. Whether it is Dr. Paisley or Mr. Adams, the Taoiseach or Mr. Blair, <Col N="325"/>they all aspire to seeing a country at peace. I wish the Taoiseach well today. He will not solve the problem today as he knows well but this is a significant step. There will be many more steps to take and I sincerely wish him well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with the Leader, Senator O'Rourke. I welcome the Taoiseach and thank him for taking time from his busy schedule to address the House. The Taoiseach has described the operational programme for the next year. The theme of the Irish Presidency is Europeans working together. The Taoiseach's goal will be to finalise the draft constitutional treaty, EU enlargement and the Lisbon Agenda.</P>
    <P>The European Convention was established in 2001. It was asked to examine ways of bringing the Union and its institutions closer to its citizens, to ensure that it plays an important role on the international stage and to strengthen the workings of the institutions of the Union so that they operate effectively on our behalf. I acknowledge the contribution of the Irish delegation to the Convention. The delegation did tremendous work and prepared the groundwork for the draft treaty. The Government's approach was hands-on. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and other members of the Irish delegation made themselves available to this House, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and also to the National Forum on the Future of Europe under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes. The delegation provided updates to the House on the developments of the Convention's work.</P>
    <P>One of the challenges facing the European Union today is to keep citizens fully informed and engaged regarding developments which affect their daily lives in so many ways. The constitutional treaty must be more readable, understandable and accessible to the public. Scrutiny proposals are now a function of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. If we are unhappy with the proposals from Brussels we can ask that they be reviewed and different proposals brought forward. In other words, the State can produce the yellow card and we can identify the implied warning signals.</P>
    <P>The final stages of the draft constitutional treaty have been reached and consensus has been reached on most issues. It had been hoped to conclude negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference last December and it was a disappointment that it was not possible to do so. The stand-off on voting strength will not be easily resolved and the fear of a two tier Europe remains a concern and a great challenge for the Union at this time.</P>
    <P>Ireland comes to the Presidency with a reputation for patience and perseverance. It is an opportunity to portray our country in a very positive light. The challenge for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs is to find agreement on a new constitutional treaty for <Col N="326"/>Europe. The Taoiseach is strongly committed to making progress on the draft treaty and has attached the highest priority to this issue. He will spare no effort to build a consensus and facilitate an agreement so that the citizens of Europe will have a constitutional treaty that responds to their needs and expectations. The intensive process of consultation with his counterparts is already underway. If anyone can achieve this agreement it will be our Taoiseach. I wish him and the Minister for Foreign Affairs every success in the consultation and negotiations to achieve this end.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach stated, enlargement will be a major part of the Irish Presidency. The new member states will join the Union on 1 May 2004. This will be an historic occasion. The enlargement will create a population of 450 million in the EU. Europeans can leave behind the divisions of the past and build a better Europe. I am delighted to hear that there will be a Day of Welcomes with major events and concerts in Dublin and elsewhere to celebrate the inclusion of these countries in the EU. The accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the EU on 1 May 2004 provides an historic opportunity for the Irish Presidency to encourage all parties to engage in talks for a united Cyprus. The enlargement process does not end on 1 May. The Irish Presidency will pursue accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania with a target date for 2007 and continue to monitor the situation in Turkey.</P>
    <P>Now that Ireland is at the heart of Europe, the twin priorities of growth and employment will be part of the Taoiseach's ambitious agenda. I noted last week that the Taoiseach warned of a big gulf between the European Union's ambition, which is to be the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, and the reality. This gulf is very wide, despite the EU's ambition, stated in the Lisbon strategy, of catching up by 2010. We are still behind the United States and other global economies. I know the Taoiseach is determined to use the Irish Presidency to speed up reforms to achieve the targets set out in the Lisbon agenda. My time is running out, a Chathaoirligh, so I will end by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House and thank him for coming so readily when we approached him and his office. He spoke about two themes. I appreciate that this debate is primarily about European matters, but the Taoiseach also referred to the challenges he faces in Northern Ireland, which have often been discussed in this House. We have asked the Taoiseach to come to the House to speak about such issues and are glad he is doing so today.</P><Col N="327"/>
    <P>Before I deal with three specific aspects of the Taoiseach's statement, I would like to thank the Members of the Seanad who are members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. Senators from all parties are doing very valiant work at that forum. The Taoiseach mentioned the importance of the committee's scrutiny of EU legislation. We will produce proposals in this regard when we bring forward the Seanad reform programme, to which the Taoiseach kindly alluded.</P>
    <P>The accession of ten new member states is particularly uplifting and historic for Ireland, which is a very small country. With two exceptions, the accession states are as small, if not smaller than Ireland. It falls on our shoulders to bear the responsibility of welcoming and giving proper and due recognition to the new member states. Some of the countries in question have ancient civilisations and historic backgrounds and have contributed a great deal to Europe over the centuries. This is also true of Ireland, a small island on the periphery of Europe.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach not to entertain the notion of a two-speed Europe. Such an idea is anathema to the people of Europe. The European Union was established in order to give a voice to all countries, regardless of whether they are large, small or in-between. I hope we can erase the words &ldquo;two-speed Europe&rdquo;. If this means we have to quieten a particular gentleman, I am sure the Taoiseach will be well able to do so during his talks. We do not want to hear about this idea.</P>
    <P>Many people have outlined their thoughts on the deliberations on the convention. It is better that the convention be properly constructed and regarded, rather than rushed. I know the Taoiseach's talents and mind will lend him to that point of view.</P>
    <P>I thank the Taoiseach for coming to the House and wish him good luck in all his endeavours.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to send my best wishes to the Taoiseach. I am sure he will give us another distinguished Presidency, which will do honour to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss the conflict in the Middle East, particularly Palestine. In the absence of any reference to the Middle East in President Bush's state of the union speech, it is particularly important for the European Union to take a role in this regard. I warmly support the Government's balanced position on this very difficult matter. The recent visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, was particularly important and was very much appreciated on all sides. I hope he will have an opportunity to return to that region during the <Col N="328"/>Irish Presidency, particularly to visit Gaza and the West Bank, which I visited last week with representatives of other parties. As a long-time friend of Israel, I was quite horrified by what I saw.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak about the wall, in particular. I understand that 23 February is the deadline for making submissions to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. As holders of the Presidency of the European Union, we have an opportunity to try to negotiate a collective position. I am aware that the Taoiseach is using his considerable talents in this regard. I emphasise that the possibility exists of making a separate submission and urge that we do so. We should not use the existence of protracted negotiations as an excuse for not doing this. We should not say &ldquo;We tried to negotiate and now we have passed the deadline.&rdquo; Everybody on the ground, including our own representatives, has said it is essential for Ireland to make a submission to the court on this basis. I understand that an Irish company, Cement Roadstone Holdings, may be involved in the construction of the wall. I ask the Taoiseach to investigate this matter, to determine whether it is true and to stop it, if possible.</P>
    <P>The bomb in Jerusalem this morning was very tragic. Such behaviour is counter-productive, as well as morally reprehensible. I ask the Taoiseach not to take the advice of Mr. Raanan Gissin, who said today on behalf of the Israeli Government that the world should stand aside to allow Israel to deal with the matter in security terms. This is the Sharon policy and this is what happened in Sabra and Chatila. We must not let it happen again and must be there as witnesses. I urge the Taoiseach to take action in respect of this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is very welcome to the House. I was delighted to hear his words and I was very impressed with his vision of Europe. I would like to ask him about the challenge he will face when the EU constitution - it may be the present version or a similar document - comes to be passed by the Irish people in a referendum. I would like the Taoiseach to put this great task high on his agenda during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>I would like to give one example of the need to sell the benefits of the European Union to the people if we are to pass the constitution. A colleague recently said to me that he was planning to go to Barcelona for the weekend with his wife. He said that Peter Sutherland and the EU should be thanked for giving us such a benefit. We should remind people of the benefits, such as cheaper air travel, we have gained as a consequence of a united Europe. We should consider what happened in Brussels yesterday, however. The European Union decided that it does not like what Ryanair is doing in Charleroi. We should be aware that this sort of thing could turn the people of Ireland against the benefits we are getting from Europe if we are not careful.</P><Col N="329"/>
    <P>Some time ago I met Mr. V&aacute;clav Klaus, who is now the President of the Czech Republic. When I spoke to him about Europe, he said he is somewhat concerned about the Czech Republic swapping a big brother in Moscow for a big brother in Brussels. We do not want the image of a big brother in Brussels, who is telling us what to do without reminding us of the benefits, to take root in Ireland. We should ensure that rather than having a big brother, we have a loveable uncle instead.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Taoiseach to the House. In the little time available to me, I would like to relate a small anecdote. In the first week of the Irish Presidency, I was reading through the Sunday newspapers in preparation for a review on a television programme. It struck me that it would be appropriate to review a piece on Europe, which was a topical subject at the time. I should add that I contribute to the Sunday newspapers. It was difficult to find anything about the European Union in the newspapers at the end of the first week of the Irish Presidency. What does that tell us? It tells us that the EU is very distant from the perceived interests of the people. That people do not relate to Europe and the EU community is a real problem. When the Taoiseach participates in the European election campaign this year, it would be useful if he, along with the other political parties and everyone else involved, fights the elections on European issues. The European elections have been fought on local issues for a long time and continue to be fought on such issues. As a result, people vote on local issues without relating to European issues. The Taoiseach would make a great contribution by bringing European issues to a European election. It would mean that the people would identify with such issues and with Europe as a whole.</P>
    <?_cl11.3-?><P>As Senator Quinn so rightly said, the Taoiseach has an ideal and immediate opportunity to intervene in an area and a controversy which means so much to many Irish people. I refer to the Ryanair controversy at Charleroi. It is obvious that the controversy is seen - rightly or wrongly and we can discuss that at another time - as a European intervention in a local issue. I suspect it is seen as an intervention which is not to the benefit of Ireland - as a negative. It is seen as anti-consumer, anti-competitive and an opportunity for Europe to elbow in on low fares, to increase fares and to make travel more difficult and expensive. It would be useful if the Taoiseach could support the Minister for Transport in this intervention, so that we are seen to be relevant on a topical and immediate issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the viewpoint that Ryanair should be forced to operate under the same conditions as every other airline in Europe.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not my viewpoint.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="330"/>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I rely on the Taoiseach to ensure this is the case. It is a long road that has no turning. It is amazing how people come crawling to Government after abusing politicians and Governments for the past number of years. However, there is an issue to be dealt with and I look forward to its being dealt with properly. There is a difference between subsidies and doing deals.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on Ireland's Presidency of the European Union and wish him well in the responsible position he is to occupy for the next six months. We should be guided by the ideal of a Europe that listens to the views of its people and whose power is used in a way that people understand. Senator Quinn has just made the same point. Senator Bradford and others mentioned the importance of advancing the treaty. One of the ways in which we can do that is to have a debate on neutrality. If we did nothing else in this country except to force individual Irish people to say what they mean by neutrality it would be helpful. Nobody should be allowed to use clich&eacute;s and everybody must say what they mean before they start talking about it. I do not agree with the position Fine Gael has taken on this but I admire its courage in putting it out there for debate. It is important that this is discussed. There are two extreme points of view on this issue. We need to know our responsibilities as good Europeans, even if that means defending Europe and ensuring we do not become the playthings of superpowers on the other side of the Atlantic. We need to find a balance so that ordinary people can understand what we mean by neutrality and how it can work. I ask that the Taoiseach raise this issue in a way that ordinary people understand. I wish him and the Government well in their role for the next six months.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a one-man show. I wish to express to the Taoiseach our appreciation of his coming here this afternoon despite a schedule that must be onerous, as he is meeting the leadership of the DUP this afternoon in London. We are indebted to him for his presence. I am encouraged by the Taoiseach's comment that the Good Friday Agreement is the basis on which everything rests and that while it will be up for review, it is not up for renegotiation. I cannot imagine a situation in which democratic politicians would not want to run their own country and their own parliament. If people had that firmly in the front of their minds all the time, much progress could be made.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on Ireland's Presidency of the European Union and wish him and all members of the Government well. It is not readily appreciated how much effort is <Col N="331"/>required on his part and that of the Government and how much commitment and energy must go into it. This morning the Taoiseach met the Prime Minister of Poland and after appearing in the House he will be going to London. He is looking remarkably well, so it is obviously agreeing with him. I am impressed by the document produced by the Government explaining the programme for the Irish Presidency. It is a wide-ranging document. The scope of activity required is not readily appreciated. I was taken with the speech given by the Taoiseach to the Institute of European Affairs and TEPSA in Dublin Castle in early December, in which he laid out in clear terms the priorities for the Irish Presidency. It was an important illustration of the vision of Europe and where it is going. I am sure the Taoiseach will continue in that direction.</P>
    <P>It is important to note, as the Taoiseach has pointed out, that the Presidency coincides with enlargement of the EU. The Union will expand by ten members on 1 May. We will have a day of welcomes and I hope that will work well. This is the culmination of the work of Spaak, Monnet and Adenauer. It is extraordinary how far we have come. Europe has never had a period of peace like this. That is the enduring monument of the Union. It is important to state this repeatedly in debates about Europe, because it is frequently lost sight of during referendum campaigns. Instead, we dwell on economic matters. Perhaps this is because we were removed from much of the carnage that took place in Europe.</P>
    <P>I hope the thrust of enlargement does not stop here. I note what has been said about Bulgaria and Romania and the efforts to get Turkey into a condition in which it is ready to join, with the reunification of Cyprus and so on. I cannot understand the mentality of the president of the Irish Farmers' Association on enlargement. Having gained so much from our membership of the European Community and the EU, particularly in farming circles, it is incomprehensible that we would not want those gains to accrue to other people, losing sight of the fact that the enlarged Europe will be one of the biggest markets in the world for Irish food.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the issue of the constitutional treaty and the Intergovernmental Conference has dominated reporting, although that is not to say it is not important. The Taoiseach himself said in December it was a critical step in the Union's development. It is worth restating the priorities of the Government. The programme states: &ldquo;The Irish Presidency will do all it can to take forward the work on the new constitutional treaty.&rdquo; That is not to diminish the differences that exist. Ireland and the Netherlands are particularly well placed to deal with this issue, given our history and the fact that neither is one of the larger countries. The <Col N="332"/>Taoiseach said in Dublin Castle: &ldquo;Ireland has always had to rely more on the strength of our argument than on the weight of our vote.&rdquo; This is part of our success. We have only had to use our veto once, on the issue of milk, so these votes are not common for us. I am concerned that if we go past 1 May on the basis of the formula in the Nice treaty, it will be difficult when that is put in place to row back and implement a different formula. However, the combination of qualified majority voting based on population and votes is reasonable. The Taoiseach said he was not worried about whether it was based on the Nice treaty or the draft constitution, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As for Mr. Prodi's remarks about a two-speed Europe, I do not think this can happen irrespective of whether he thinks it can. Every member state would have to be in favour of it, which will not happen, so I do not see the two-speed Europe as a reality. There are important issues for us, such as the questions of voting on taxation, our legal tradition and defence, which we must take into account.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the Government's programme is the question of multilateralism and the need to support the United Nations in its work. The programme states that the Irish Presidency will ensure that the EU &ldquo;engages actively with the wider world on the international agenda, in accordance with its values and principles.&rdquo; The Taoiseach enunciated those values and principles for us this afternoon and they are important. However, it is also important that we return authority to the United Nations. That is for its members to do. The UN was seriously damaged by the war in Iraq and I hope the Taoiseach can help to restore some of its authority during the Presidency. This is not inconsistent with the desire expressed in the programme to foster better relations with the United States and Russia. The emphasis on Africa is important, as there are several important issues to be considered, including the AIDS epidemic.</P>
    <P>The Lisbon agenda is another priority. We are aiming to achieve a competitive economy by 2010. The issues of sustainable growth and increased employment are important and should be dominant within our Presidency. We should aim to improve competitiveness and ensure better research and telecommunications. By 2010, 3% of GDP should be devoted to research and development. Our experience with partnership is valuable in this respect. It is something we can bring to the table. The Union must be brought closer to its citizens. I applaud the work being done by Senator Maurice Hayes and the Forum on Europe, which is just part of the picture. It is important that our citizens understand how the Union works. I wish the Taoiseach well in his efforts during the Presidency.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="333"/>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Senators in welcoming the Taoiseach to the House. It is good of him to take time out from his busy schedule to attend the House and share his thoughts on these important issues.</P>
    <P>Like others, I appreciate the importance of the next six months particularly in the context of enlargement. It is remarkable that only ten years ago many of the accession states to the Union did not exist. The constitution for Europe is an issue that has been discussed in the House on a number of occasions. The Taoiseach hit the right note when he said that if the opportunity is there, we should take it. However, it is important not to engender a false sense of crisis. There will be no crisis if it is not agreed in the next six months. It is more important to get a good deal rather than just a deal. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the arrangements made in Nice are not satisfactory; they are something of a mess. It is important that these are revised at the earliest opportunity. However, it is equally important that they are not replaced by another mess. Whatever is put in place must be sustainable for the next ten or 15 years. It is a matter of <i>festina lente</i> - if the opportunity is there, take it. Let us not suggest now that it is a crisis if we do not deliver an agreement in the next six months.</P>
    <P>I am not in sympathy with what is being said about a two-speed Europe. Somebody must speak up on behalf of the President of the European Commission, Mr. Prodi. There is already a two-speed Europe to all intents and purposes. Several important countries, including the United Kingdom, are not members of the euro zone. Ireland is not part of the Schengen Agreement and, therefore, does not share the common immigration rules that are in place in those agreement states. Ireland is also not part of NATO, whereas most EU member states are and have obligations that go with membership. On common foreign and security policy and the single currency, there are already different speeds.</P>
    <P>It is important that we maintain some sense of vision and progress within the European project. States that want to share particular competencies, pool sovereignty for particular projects and go further than others are willing should not be obliged to proceed at the speed of the slowest and most laggardly member state. It is wrong to allow several states that are not willing to share sovereignty and progress to slow every other member state to the extent that all momentum is lost in a project where momentum is important. For the foreseeable future, with 25 member states, it is inevitable and right that member states that wish to further projects quickly should be allowed to do so. This right should be recognised rather than treated as an issue to be feared.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, have referred to the <Col N="334"/>Lisbon agenda as one of the priorities of the Presidency, to which no one can take particular exception. I have read the conclusions of the agenda and they have a motherhood and apple pie element to them. No one can object to improved e-commerce, information technology and more support for research and so forth. Ultimately, these matters need to be progressed by individual member states' governments. The European Commission and the Council can only play a limited role in progressing those issues. I wish the Government well in highlighting those important issues. However, I am sceptical of the process because it requires political will on the ground from member states' governments to progress matters in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, as well as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, referred to relations with the United States. There is a suggestion that because Ireland is somewhere between Berlin and Boston, we can use our good offices to improve relations between the EU and the Bush White House. I am sceptical about this suggestion because I believe that the Bush White House is wrong on many issues and I hope President Bush is not around this time next year. While it is well for us to say that we will look to smoothing the way across the Atlantic, we should do so from a perspective which still puts our own viewpoints to the fore. We still support the UN, multilateralism and international co-operation on issues such as environmental protection. We should not dilute those principles to make the last year of President Bush's reign in the White House any easier. By all means, use our good relations with the US, but do not compromise our principles which we share with other EU member states.</P>
    <P>The Cyprus issue falls clean in the middle of the Irish Presidency and it is one on which we could achieve progress. There has been progress in the last four weeks with the positive development of the appointment of Mr. Talat as chief negotiator on the Turkish-Cypriot side. The appointment will test the Greek-Cypriot and Mr. Papadopoulos's commitment to the process. I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, was involved with Kofi Annan yesterday in Brussels in trying to get the talks on Cyprus going again. I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give priority to this issue as it will stand or fall in the next six to eight weeks. It deserves a political commitment from the Irish Presidency and the EU. It would be a significant achievement if 30 years of division on Cyprus could be brought to an end during the period of the Irish Presidency. It will not fail for lack of energy or commitment on our part.</P>
    <P>Ireland is uniquely situated in dealing with African issues. When it comes to political engagement, the involvement of the EU is always associated with the former colonial powers. This does not apply to Ireland, which allows us to be better positioned to engage politically in Africa, <Col N="335"/>particularly in Zimbabwe, in a way that would be difficult for other member states with a colonial past. The Minister for Foreign Affairs visited southern Africa before Christmas. Ireland should bring its influence to bear during the Presidency to work with President Mbeki in South Africa, neighbouring states and Robert Mugabe to ensure that there is a move to genuine democracy in Zimbabwe. We should engage politically, as we have militarily in Liberia, in countries such as Kenya that are making efforts to move away from autocracy and single party government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach hit the right note on Northern Ireland issues. It is important to say that we are satisfied with the Agreement. It is also important to say that one party cannot cherry pick the parts of the Agreement it wants. It is clear that some parties would be happy if the devolved institutions were not resurrected. Some parties would be happy if the North-South institutions were to continue and other agendas were progressed with or without devolution. The Agreement has various parts and was put together in the knowledge that they will all hang together. It is important that they are all implemented. I wish the Taoiseach well in his talks with Dr. Paisley in London later this afternoon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all speakers from all parties and groups for their comments. Food safety is a key issue for our Presidency. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, answered questions on it recently in the European Parliament. I take the Senator's point on the labelling issue. I have spoken before about the standards of food safety in Asian countries. While I am not glad to see the outbreak of avian flu, I am glad there is a focus on the issue. The matter falls under the Commissioner Byrne's brief. However, given the veterinary research and work carried out in Ireland, along with the Food Safety Authority, as Senator Finucane said, we can make progress on the issue.</P>
    <P>Senators Bradford, O'Rourke and McDowell made reference to the two-speed Europe. However, with regard to Senator McDowell's comments, the issue is not that member states will move at different paces to each other. Under treaty law, one can have a group of states coming together under enhanced co-operation and making a decision to move on a project. I have no difficulty with that as it has already happened with the Schengen Agreement and the euro. I have no problem so long as it is a collective decision of every member state to allow those states to do so. My difficulties with Mr. Prodi and others are that this is not what they are referring to when they speak of a two-speed Europe. There have been only one or two examples of enhanced co-operation moving forward and, even though the provision is there, the difficulty is that Mr. <Col N="336"/>Prodi and others want to go in a different direction. My argument is not just with Romano Prodi, but also with those who support the integrationist approach to the EU. It seems extraordinary that when we get a Union of 25 member states, those who claim that they want more integration see the only way of achieving it as going outside the Union. It does not make sense if one's solution to making progress is to break away from the group. If one studies, as I have done for many months in preparation for the Presidency, which country blocks what - Senator Quinn referred to the advantage of Europe's competitiveness on which he is correct - one is more likely to find that France or Germany block proposals because they are not in their interests. When we are integrating, it is important to note what is being integrated and the reason for it. If everyone was honest, he or she would admit that people like to integrate those things they like and to block the things they do not like. There is an enormous contradiction in that regard. If representatives of all the members states are here and they agree to let four or five member states go ahead on an issue and other member states can join such an initiative now or at some time in the future on the same terms, that is different from the other concept, which is not new.</P>
    <P>Romano Prodi, the President of Commission, is not the first one to propose its use, but accession countries - I have talked to representatives of all the accession countries about various aspects of accession this month - worry about this concept. They are in the process of joining the Union following referenda held last year. They hear people say that some countries want a two-speed Europe and their countries will be left behind. It is difficult enough for us, who have been a member of the Union for 30 years, to try to explain that concept.</P>
    <P>I note what Senator Ross said about Ryanair and low cost fares. The only point I would make about it is that rather than talk about one issue, enforcing a fair and equitable state aid regime, which is what this is all about and I do not want to go into the detail of particular decisions, and having effective controls on state aid are hugely beneficial to small countries. If one was to remove from the equation the argument on the Ryanair issue, and I am sure Senator O'Toole would quickly remind me if I did not say this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Say it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This decision will affect Aer Lingus as much as Ryanair because Aer Lingus has successfully managed itself as a State company to become a low cost operator. Therefore, yesterday's decision might not have the same knock-on effect around the world because Ryanair is fast becoming the largest airline in the world, and fair play to it. That <Col N="337"/>decision will also affect Aer Lingus in a significant way. It is for that reason that we will take up this matter and carry it through. The state aid issue is important to this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross also raised the matter of support for the EU. The difficulty in this respect lies with the member states and what is said in the media. I was aware of this last year when preparing for the Presidency. Every time there is a meeting, people, on leaving it, say they fought for their position and objected to other people's positions. We do that all the time. However, people should point out what the Union has achieved for the Continent, including for this country. Sometimes it worries me that people here - we are only talking about this country - believe we moved from being a country with below 60% of the average wealth of a European country to a well-educated, high-tech and sophisticated country on our own. An analysis of such growth would involve whether it was due to the Internal Market, free trade, etc.</P>
    <P>How did this country become of one of the great exporters in the world? Is it because we stayed an isolationist state with a slightly open free market? It would be interesting to carry out an analysis of the number of jobs there would be in this economy today and what products we would be exporting if we had decided to take the Icelandic view, although that comparison is unfair to Iceland because it had many trade agreements. If we had not engaged, I would say the answer to the question I posed would be very little and we would not have been able to sustain those employed in our excellent public services. Our success, whether on equality issues, the social agenda, how we have advanced laws or how we managed to develop our successful sectors, is inherently because we are part of the European Union.</P>
    <?_cl11.5-?><P>A somewhat academic exercise is engaged in by Euro sceptics here who probably would not have the education they have, not to mind anything else, if we were not part of the European model. I increasingly see this in debates in colleges and I continually remind people of the European project and what has been achieved. I am always conscious that given that we joined Union 30 years ago, one must be aged 45 plus to remember the pre-period. We seem to have perhaps only one student, from what I read in the newspapers, in that age category. This is an issue we need to keep to forefront of our minds.</P>
    <P>All Senator McDowell said about Cyprus is true. We will meet the Cypriot Foreign Minister in Dublin Castle on Monday. I have talked at length to Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey. I have had consultations indirectly with Mr. Denktash. We totally support the Annan plan. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has spoken about that also. I talked to Mr. Papadopoulos several times since Christmas. There is opportunity to <Col N="338"/>secure a united Cyprus. I have told Prime Minister Erdogan bluntly that in my view it would be difficult for him to sustain his case to get Turkish membership brought forward to any conclusive position next December if we do not get to the position of having a united Cyprus. That is not the only issue people hold against Turkish membership; there are others. However, that argument would be used against Turkey. I have told him that face to face recently as well as his Foreign Minister. I do not want in six months' time to have to tell him something else. I thought it best to be honest with our Turkish colleagues. There is an opportunity to secure that and it will put pressure on Mr. Denktash and Mr. Papadopoulos.</P>
    <P>This country has been engaged in dealing with Cypriot problems from the start in terms of the successful role we have played under the UN. I hope we can succeed, but it will be on the basis of the Annan plan, as there is no other plan. It is like the Good Friday Agreement; there is no other basis. We will have to see if people are serious. It is a question of making progress in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of the wall in Jerusalem. The Palestinian Prime Minister is coming to see me next week and we will engage further in this regard. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has met all the people on the Israeli side. It will be difficult to make progress. I had a long telephone conversation last Sunday with President Arafat. It is a sorry scene. I am not sure how we will make progress on it, but we have to keep trying. This being an election year in the United States does not make the situation easy for obvious reasons, but we will have opportunities to raise this matter with President Bush and put pressure on to try to continue to follow the roadmap and make some meaningful progress on it because it is a sad situation.</P>
    <P>We condemn all the bombs and the activities, but if every time there was violence in Northern Ireland we had made the decision to stop, do nothing and row back, we never would have had the Good Friday Agreement. That is not condoning violence in any form, but we have to make progress and make a leap of faith because if every time there was a violent act and one went back, one would end up with nothing very quickly. The best way is to try with those who are engaged genuinely in peace to move forward, but that will be difficult.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator O'Rourke and Senator Dardis for what they said. Senator Dardis is correct that the European Union has transformed the political situation in Europe. It has given it prosperity but, more importantly, peace for the past 50 years. Enlargement gives us a new opportunity to go forward. I was thinking of the economy and I note what was said about enlargement and about farmers or business <Col N="339"/>people. However, one should read the Official Report of the debate on free trade when this country, with a population of 3.1 million, had an opportunity to have a free trade agreement, which was restricted, to move our goods into the United Kingdom. People saw this as a huge opportunity which could transform and develop the country and which would give us a chance we never had before to reverse the terrible economic plight of the 1930s and the depression of the 1950s. Many Senators will remember the late 1950s, when we had our highest unemployment levels and huge deprivation in society.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o'clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Now we are part of an Internal Market and the next generation will have equal rules and opportunities to trade successfully with 500 million people. Those who were here then arguing the pro side of the Internal Market would wonder what people are talking about when they raise <Col N="340"/>concerns. This is a huge opportunity for us which, as a small country, we should not fear. We have the capacity to be as innovative as anyone in the world, but our internal difficulties on the island held us back for decades and we did not have a market for which to produce goods. Now we are second to nobody in the Internal Market. The single currency, a market of 500 million people and modern technology which overcomes many of the impediments of past generations all mean we are in a very good position. The European model is not only important for this generation, but for generations to come.</P>
