	<P>I have received notice from Senator Kitt that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to sanction funding to complete the drainage of the River Nanny, Tuam; the cost of completing this work; and if he will discuss the issue with Galway County Council which is currently carrying out repairs to bridges on this river.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the measures to be taken and the funding he intends to make available to resurface the school yard at Brosna national school, Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, in the interests of health and safety.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion concerning the referral to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights of the report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The joint committee was to report back to Seanad &Eacute;ireann within three months from the date of referral but will now report back not later than 1 April 2004. This item will be taken without debate because the committee is still in session; No. 2, the Air Navigation and Transport (International Conventions) Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 12.30 p.m.; No. 3, statements on the draft guidelines on rural housing, to be taken at 2 p.m. until 5 p.m., with the contributions of Members not to exceed 15 minutes and Members may share time; and <Col N="1654"/>No. 18, motion No. 22, to be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. There will be a sos from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. We hope to leave No. 3, statements on the draft guidelines on rural housing, on the Order Paper, to be resumed at a later date. That will depend on the number of speakers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 18, motion No. 23, in the name of my colleagues, be taken in conjunction with No. 3 this afternoon. We need an opportunity to pass judgment on one of the greatest strokes of all time pulled in recent weeks by &ldquo;the stroke Cullen&rdquo;.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Next Thursday, the day after what is traditionally regarded as the official launch of the tourism season, the SIPTU group of unions will hold a 24 hour stoppage affecting Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. Does the Leader agree this is an outrageous position in which to put the travelling public and tourists coming into the country? We all know the Minister has handled the negotiations with the group of unions in an appalling way &mdash; I am sure the Leader agrees &mdash; but this is not the way to proceed. If the group of unions wants to win over converts to its argument, it should not affect the very people who every day pay bus fares in this and every other city throughout the country. Negotiations are ongoing and the unions should not be engaged in this activity at this stage. It is unfair to members of the travelling public. They are not responsible for the current mess as responsibility for that lies with the Minister and the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before calling Senator O&rsquo;Toole I wish to correct a mistake made in the motion referred to by Deputy Brian Hayes. The Labour Party members&rsquo; names should not appear in the motion. It occurred as a result of a computer error and I understand the names will be deleted tonight.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we will get with electronic voting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a problem with taking No. 1, the motion regarding the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, without debate. The House should note the extraordinarily diligent work that has been done by the joint committee in dealing with the Barron report. I am not a member of that committee but its request for an extension of time to enable it continue its deliberations is a great tribute to the members, who are ahead in their work. They have been working at weekends and so on. They deserve our thanks and I look forward to discussing the outcome of their deliberations. It is a sign of great efficiency that <Col N="1655"/>they are now seeking only a fortnight&rsquo;s extension and I am led to believe they will finish their work well within that time.</P>
    <P>When industrial action is taken it is always the case that those who have to take the action &mdash; the workers or the trade union &mdash; are the first to be criticised. I do not get involved in industrial relations issues here in the Oireachtas, but I know from speaking to Jack O&rsquo;Connor, the president of SIPTU, over the past couple of weeks that he is trying to do everything possible to avoid disruption and that any time there was disruption it was because they felt they were left without a choice. I also spoke to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, about it and I know he is working hard at his end to get things resolved. I just hope it will be resolved. I am sure we will have to discuss it if it gets to that point, but I hope that does not happen. The trade union movement is also a service industry looking after the needs and services of its members. Everybody should recognise this. SIPTU has been particularly open, more so than any union in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Rubbish.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to ideas and to proposals to move things forward and takes a political view on how the semi-State company should be run. I am sure Senator Ross will have his opportunity tonight to talk about why&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>At the end of all that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;his buddies should be running semi-State companies rather than decent people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will confine himself to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a different matter, legislation we passed many years ago was activated by the Minister for Transport some months ago, namely the requirement that drivers had to carry their driving licences with them. At that time it was raised by myself and many others that some thought should be given as to the size of the driving licence. The general consensus was that it should be the size of a credit card and I think the Government is moving in that direction. However, I would like the Minister for Transport to explain his thinking on that to the House. More importantly, I would like to examine what additional information could be carried on the driving licence. For instance, the driving licence should recognise the number of organ donor cards in this country and should include organ donor information, with a clause to enable people who wish to opt out. Such a facility should be included on the electronic information contained on the driving licence. I would like a discussion <Col N="1656"/>on that and believe it would be supported on all sides. I look forward to hearing the Leader&rsquo;s view on this proposal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully accept an error that involved our names appearing on the Fine Gael motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I think I explained that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be quite happy to have our names on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want to leave the names on it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I do. I did not want to abuse the procedures of the House. There is a way to do it. I am well aware of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must call to my office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but since it arose it would be foolish of me to stand up and not mention it.</P>
    <P>I would like to second Senator Hayes&rsquo;s proposal to amend the Order of Business. I am tired of controversial issues reaching the House by way of statements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator asked for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain to the Leader, if she wants to listen to me, that we need discussions in this House in which people take positions and have to stand over them, not waffly speeches where nobody has to take a position and which enable various people to tell their constituents, in effect, that they never voted for certain things. We want some degree of accountability on the part of those who claim credit for everything.</P>
    <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s compliments to the Oireachtas committee mentioned in motion No. 1. I will say no more on that, but I would like to point out that another committee, the DIRT inquiry, was more successful on its own at recovering revenue that had been taken from the State than the entire activities of the Revenue Commissioners for ten years before that or indeed the efforts made by the Department of Finance. That was a committee comprising seven people whose combined salaries would not equate with that of one of the bankers they grilled so effectively. Politicians can do a good job when they are given the power, authority and resources. There are forces in some large Departments determined to ensure the Houses of the Oireachtas are never properly resourced so that we operate on a shoe-string. We will see when the Minister of Finance comes into this House with the Finance Bill, there will be 15 to 20 civil servants with him, including up to three in the Chamber, to make sure he does not put a foot wrong. If one goes to an Oireachtas committee to quiz senior bankers one is lucky to have half a civil servant concentrating on it. The Oireachtas is the most under-resourced part of <Col N="1657"/>the whole apparatus of parliamentary democracy in this State.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on education, given the figures published today with regard to CAO applications. The drop in numbers is significant and this is likely to continue until 2007. The points commission reported in 1999 and recommended changes to the access system, which have not been implemented. That sluggishness in implementing those changes has contributed directly to these figures, a trend that will continue. The Leader should ask the Minister for Education and Science, Mr. Dempsey, to come to the House to address the issues of the 1999 points commission report and indicate what progress has been made in implementing the recommended changes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment calling for motion No. 23 to be taken today if at all possible. I am glad the Leader has not tabled an amendment to the motion. It looks as if she is in favour of its contents.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It has yet to be agreed on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Like myself she must be listening to senior planners throughout the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a question for the Leader.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Bannon running for Europe?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>On another issue, I ask for a debate on the future of EU cohesion policy in Ireland post-2006. I understand submissions are being made by a number of bodies as regards funding post-2006. It is important we have a debate on this issue in terms of the country&rsquo;s competitiveness, growth etc. We want to see real balanced regional development. There has been much talk about this by Government, but it has not happened to date, as indicated by the infrastructure in parts of the midlands and west. I would welcome a debate on this.</P>
    <P>On another issue, there has been an enormous growth in the unemployment figures. In the past five months more than 10,000 people have become unemployed in this country. It is important to have a debate on this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to address the House on the new designer-type card and perhaps to indicate what information should be put on it. I would like the Leader to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, to update the House on EU Presidency activities and as regards the spring summit that will take place here shortly.</P><Col N="1658"/>
    <P>I would also like a discussion on the points issue raised by Senator Minihan. However, I know the Minister for Education and Science is aware of the issues involved because that discussion is ongoing. It would be timely to re-examine the question of access to third level education. There is a golden opportunity now that the numbers are dropping.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat my recent calls for a debate on foreign policy issues, particularly with regard to Haiti. The president of the University of Haiti has said every day that passes makes it clearer that the country is being occupied. This is a serious matter that we should look at in Ireland, as a friend of the United States.</P>
    <P>I ask for a debate on public health, particularly in our cities. There has been a considerable increase recently in the noxious habit of public spitting. Some of it comes from new arrivals, but much of it is done by our own people. They appear to have forgotten the lesson that I recall from childhood of not spitting, because of the risk of spreading diseases such as TB. It is often accompanied by the filthy habit of spitting out chewing gum all over the pavements. Also, there is dog dirt all over the place. It is a real public health issue, since it spreads disease. The authorities should provide that, on production of a dog licence, they furnish dog owners with poop scoops as they do in D&uacute;n Laoghaire. It is really necessary and a serious issue for health.</P>
    <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole &mdash; I accept completely what he says &mdash; I never comment on issues of industrial controversy or strife. I could not help noting that the trade union leader interviewed this morning admitted quite openly that the reason the strike is on Thursday, 18 March is that it is intended to disrupt a significant European Union meeting and embarrass the Government. However, they will also embarrass the people of Ireland, and that is a pity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have great regard for those who work in the public transport services, we should not take the path of political strikes. It might perhaps be useful to have a debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We are still a democracy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on social partnership, since Ministers and trade unions have an equal responsibility to operate within that spirit.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys _ic20-?><Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Recently we have been hearing a great deal about the growing problem of obesity in the population, particularly in young children. That will lead to a great many difficulties in their later lives which will result in a cost to this State in managing their health problems. For many years, we should have had PE teachers in primary schools. Today children are leading very sedentary lifestyles, sitting in front of their TVs. They are not able to go out to play because it may not be safe in the area <Col N="1659"/>or because their parents are working. It is therefore even more important today that children receive proper PE instruction in primary school. While it is a cost, it will save in the long run. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, must come here to discuss how we are to deal with this growing problem.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo Senator Ryan&rsquo;s plea for more support for committees in the House. The National Forum on Europe was very strong last year when it recommended scrutiny of European instruments and that the committee that does so should be adequately supported. A commission is now examining such matters and I hope its first priority will be to beef up the research capacity of the Library and that of all committees in the House to do their very important job. Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I got a letter from a lady in Dingle. It always amazes me that in those letters from Dingle, every now and then there is a nugget of good sense.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We take a broad view.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Lives could be saved by making people&rsquo;s willingness to have their organs used apparent at the moment of an accident. That is of great importance.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Mansergh and many others, I still bear the scars of a politically motivated strike in Northern Ireland, and I hope all those who have influence on the matter can bend their efforts over the next few days to ensure the country is not exposed to this over St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt><Miles com="ah"/>
	<P>Regarding the INO debate which has been taken over the last few days, I ask the Leader for a debate with the Minister for Health and Children regarding the very serious shortfall in nurses. We now have more non-European nationals working for us in the nursing professions than we have Irish people. The vast <Miles com="ch"/>majority of graduates leave the profession after two or three years. The report of the Commission on Nursing made several sweeping recommendations, and many of those have been implemented, for example, the degree programmes in nursing. It was also recommended that the Nurses Act 1985 be amended to include the term &ldquo;midwives&rdquo;. That has still not been done, though the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, received that <Miles com="ch"/>report five or six years ago. I would appreciate a response from the Leader on those issues.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Health and Children has made regulations on the smoking ban. It has notified most businesses throughout the country that they must take away ashtrays and provide something outside the door of their premises. They must appoint a person to be in <Col N="1660"/>charge of implementing the smoking ban and someone to whom complaints can be made. Will the Leader be the person in charge of implementing the policy in the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said full medical cover will be provided at all hospitals on a 24-hour basis. What did he mean in that regard? Did he mean consultants, nurses or doctors? What kind of medical cover will be provided at all those hospitals under the Hanly report?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on competition. In light of what we have seen in the airlines industry, telecommunications and the energy market in recent years, there seems increasing evidence that competition is good. Whereas we all have a constitutional right to strike, I question whether there will be public support for a strike that seems to be politically motivated more than anything else.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I seem to be the only person who has not had a letter from anyone in Dingle this week, and I never heard much sense come out of Dingle yet.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Ross have a question for the Leader?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a Dublin 4, anti-rural attitude, and we have to listen to it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is time consuming, and other Senators are offering to speak on matters relevant to the Order of Business. Does Senator Ross have a question for the Leader?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Miles com="ah"/><Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I might follow the spokesman for SIPTU, Commissioner O&rsquo;Toole.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I said &ldquo;a question for the Leader&rdquo;, Senator Ross.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what most sensible people in the House have said today, namely, that there is a real danger of a political strike next week. I ask that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, come to the House at an early stage, presumably today or tomorrow, to explain the situation to us and what stance he is taking under the threat, which is very serious. It is a political strike whose objective is that SIPTU take over and control CIE, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the airports. That is the danger we face. This is a struggle for power, and the Government must stand up to the threat. It is not an ordinary industrial strike. The unions, owing to an inter-union squabble and power struggle, are themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>Perhaps I might finish without interruption, a Chathaoirligh. I ask that the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not interrupting the Senator, but explaining matters.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;come into this House, be given a fair hearing by the representatives of SIPTU and the rest of the Senators and explain what Government policy is and that we will not yield to such threats.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will be aware of the continuing speculation regarding the fall in the cash reserves of Aer Rianta threatening the Minister&rsquo;s plans for its break-up. Is it true that Aer Rianta&rsquo;s international subsidiary posted losses for a second year running? Is the fall such that it is interfering with the plans of the Government? Perhaps the Leader might persuade the Minister to come to this House. In that regard, I would like an update on the original intention, which may now have fallen by the wayside, regarding that hotel group which we know so well. There are two glorious hotels in my constituency in south Kerry, in Killarney and Parknasilla. There is great concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is of the opinion that the Senator has elaborated sufficiently.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I always respect the Chair. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House and give us an update on what is proposed for the hotel group in that regard? I support what Senator Maurice Hayes said with regard to the letter from Dingle. That lady made eminent sense.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader request the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House before he moves on to a new area? In view of this morning&rsquo;s report from the CAO regarding the declining number of applicants for places in third level institutions, we face a crisis in certain areas, particularly science. For the third consecutive year the number of applicants for science has declined, despite the efforts of the Minister and the Government to promote science as an important area. Declining numbers will <Col N="1662"/>have serious consequences for business and IT, our priority areas in industry.</P>
    <P>Three years ago, a White Paper on education indicated that by 2006 there would be a 15% increase in the adult participation rate at third level education. However, at present, the participation rate stands at less than 5%. It is important that the Minister comes to the House to explain why he has failed in this area also, particularly with regard to access for the disadvantaged.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Following recent events it would be appropriate to ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to come into the House to explain his actions and his lectures to a sporting organisation with regard to it undertaking a patriotic gesture by opening its doors to other sports. Why did the Government buy out that association two years ago with a bribe, thereby preventing it from opening its doors?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I also ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House in view of his recent statement about the onus on local authorities to zone land for schools. While he was correct to do so, there is an onus on the Department to work with the local authorities and guarantee that if land is zoned for schools, they will be built.</P>
    <P>I would also like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comment on the recent decision of a school in Mountmellick to build two classrooms instead of erecting prefabs and to do it more cheaply. Prefabs are a disaster. There is much reference to decentralisation, but it is amazing our school building system is so centralised. Should we not follow the Mountmellick example, which has worked very well?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I point out to the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, that we have always been careful in this House to use a person&rsquo;s title when speaking of them. This is a matter of Members of a House of Parliament giving the proper respect to a person who has a title. I do not mean to lecture anybody but state this as a matter of fact. It is something of which I have always been conscious since I entered public life.</P><Col N="1663"/>
    <P>The Senator proposes that the Fine Gael motion &mdash; No. 18, motion No. 23 &mdash; should be taken in conjunction with No. 3, the proposal to hold a three hour debate on rural housing. He also asked that Deputy Brennan attend the House. He is away&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is inappropriate, Senator Hayes, to refer to a Minister in that manner.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Titles are hard earned. Senator Hayes asked for the Minister for Transport to come to the House to discuss the proposed public transport strike. In anticipation of such a request, I made an inquiry this morning. The Minister is in Brussels and is expected to return tonight or tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole praised the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for its work on the Barron report. We join in that. The sub-committee is looking for extra time which means it is hard at work. Senator Jim Walsh is a member of the sub-committee and we know from him how hard it is working.</P>
    <P>The Senator also made the point that workers in strike situations are always accused. He asked about the inclusion of extra information on driving licences, such as organ donor information. Senator Dardis showed me his organ donor card, which is the size of a credit card. Senator O&rsquo;Toole would like all the information to be on one card.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan does not want Senators to make waffly statements. Anybody who speaks in the House is entitled to say what they want. We would all agree with that and say they should be listened to.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 4 March, Senators Bannon, McCarthy, Tuffy, O&rsquo;Meara, Coghlan and Browne asked for a debate on rural housing to be held this week. They all asked for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to come to the House to participate in such a debate. I do not know which Minister will be here but I arranged for a debate on the new guidelines for rural housing in response to an unprecedented consensus in the House that one should be held. At my request, Senator Moylan furnished me with the names of those, including I am glad to say, three of Senator Ryan&rsquo;s colleagues, who called for this debate. In view of this, I do not know what is wrong.</P>

	<P>I want to make this clear. I come here on a Monday and go home on a Friday and spend the week at my business as Leader. Some of those who speak here are better than others and fair dues to them, they have the gift or they learned it. On behalf of all Senators, we cannot call anybody who contributes to a debate a waffler. They may not be as good as Senator Ryan at talking but they are entitled to speak.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I need guidelines when there is a call for a debate. I keep a list in the office which I tick off when we get a Minister to come to the House. Should I scrap that, or what do Members want? I am annoyed at the statement about waffle.</P>
    <P>The Senator made a good point about Oireachtas committees. I believe they are under-resourced because &ldquo;authority&rdquo; &mdash; I do not mean political authority &mdash; never wanted them. Deputy John Bruton was Leader of the House when I first entered the D&aacute;il in 1982 and he set up the committee system. I recall we had a good women&rsquo;s rights committee. However, for some reason the committees were never adequately resourced. I believe civil servants do not like them but like matters to proceed in their own way. The committees began to get inquisitive and to find out information. I agree they are inadequately resourced and I hope the new Houses of the Oireachtas Commission will take up the issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan asked for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to discuss the falling numbers entering third level education. He also requested a debate on the recommendations of the points committee, which reported in 1999. I will endeavour to arrange that. I have asked the Minister to come to the House and I think he is willing to do so as part of his tour around the country on education.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon seconded Senator Brian Hayes, which is his right. He asked that we be permitted to make submissions on cohesion funding, which should re-ignite in 2006.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde requested an update on progress in Europe, particularly in view of the impending EU summit. She requested the attendance in the House of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche. She also called for a debate on education. In that context she is keen to have a review of the points system.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on foreign policy. I thought it would be possible to have it this week. However, I now expect we can have it in the week following our week off. Senator Norris also referred to the issue of public health and what could be done with regard to what he called the increasingly common but filthy habit of <Col N="1665"/>public spitting. He also raised the manner in which people handle their dogs.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh said there should not be political strikes, which found an echo around the House. Senator Terry referred to obesity in children and PE teaching in primary schools. I was reminded that training for primary school teachers includes the rudiments of PE, but she is referring to a professional teacher trained in PE.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Education and Science is actively engaged in the obesity debate. He is giving great leadership on smoking, obesity and all the things which will make us healthier.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes made the point that committees should be well resourced. He also referred to a letter from a woman in Dingle. I think we all received one, except for Senator Ross who said he did not get one.</P>

    <P>Senator Feighan referred to the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI. He alleged that all of these bodies were being bribed by grants. I think that was the gist of what he said.</P>

	<P>I do not agree with the Senator. We are all in favour of all those wonderful sports. The Senator has tabled a motion on the IRFU.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne referred to a school in Mountmellick, which is building two classrooms rather than erecting prefabs. Between 1987 and 1990, the then Government sanctioned work of that kind at 300 schools. It was a policy which some Members will remember. I travelled around the country to open them. There is nothing new in this in terms of the approach to education. It is the same policy as was pursued by the then Government. The then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, fully endorsed it. The first deputation that came to me said that its school required an <Col N="1667"/>extension which would cost £500,000. I said I did not have that amount of money, but I could offer £100,000 to build four classrooms. The offer was refused, so I then offered it to the next group upon which the first group came back to me. It was an approach that was increasingly taken up and it made a great impact. It would be a good idea to have it explained because it is a worthwhile policy.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">Let me put these three amendments in context and state why they are before the House. They are all similar because they are based on the 1996 Act. Section 7 of this Bill is based on section 18 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936 which has been amended several times, most recently by the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 1996. Due to an oversight the text of this Bill as initiated did not include the changes made in 1996 and in section 7(4)(<i>g</i>) set a lower limit for damages for mental distress than is named in the Civil Liability Act. Three amendments are now proposed to section 7 to ensure it fully reflects the current position. Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 insert the changes introduced by the 1996 Act for the definition of dependants and takes account of marriages that are dissolved. Amendment No. 2 creates a link to the Civil Liability Act on the limit on damages for mental distress. This will ensure the limit of £20,000, or just over &euro;25,000 in the Civil Liability Act, will apply and that any adjustments to that amount by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will also automatically apply without the need for future amendments to the Air Navigation and Transport (International Conventions) Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 includes in the Bill provisions inserted into section 18 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936 by section 4(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 1996 and I place this before the House for its acceptance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Government amendments. I noticed a problem with that point yesterday and asked my colleagues to look at it. We then received the Government amendment which I could not have matched but I am glad to have spotted the difficulty there.</P><Col N="1670"/>
    <P>In the case of annulment of a marriage if, for example, a man who had obtained a State annulment was killed in a car accident would his former wife receive nothing? Divorce is mentioned in this amendment but some people whose marriages break down very quickly do not go through divorce proceedings and instead have their marriages annulled by the Church and the State. Does this amendment cover them?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Browne for raising that issue. Could the Minister of State please clarify this point? Section 3 refers only to &ldquo;mental distress&rdquo; whereas section 7(1) refers to a person &ldquo;who has suffered injury or mental distress&rdquo;. Is that discrepancy a typographical error or does it allow a person to claim for an injury other than mental distress, associated with those who are divorced? It does seem to provide for someone who had an association with the deceased, either in a common law relationship or another association involving some level of financial maintenance. It is not uncommon for that to be the case for couples who have divorced but why is there a difference for those whose divorce has been granted whereas for a cohabiting couple the overriding point seems to be the existence of a financial maintenance arrangement? If such an arrangement was in place for a divorce could that be overcome or made part of the Act?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank both Senators for their questions. In response to Senator Browne, the question of annulments is a matter for the Civil Liability Acts which fall within the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Technically, annulments may not be recognised but depending on the documentation, it may be the case that a person has an annulled marriage and may be remarried. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would have to adjudicate on that situation and the Department of Transport or the courts would accept that interpretation of the documentation, or a decision made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is somewhat complicated and can be vague because individual situations are very complex and while they may have much in common there may also be great differences between them so that finally each case must be judged on its individual merits.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Dooley, liability exists for normal damages such as loss of income. The only upper limit applies to mental distress. One can have a claim and liability accepted for normal damages such as loss of income and injury on which there is no limit, depending on the situation. There is a<i> de facto </i>upper limit for mental distress beyond which one cannot go. That is why this provision is included in the Bill. We <Col N="1671"/>want to ensure this legislation is compatible with existing legislation in this area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. It is important to look at this from the perspective of a marriage that has been annulled. Probably neither party would wish to see an ex-spouse benefiting in the future through the other&rsquo;s death or injury. Some specify in their wills that they do not want the previous spouse to receive any benefit. One&rsquo;s spouse can be entitled to one&rsquo;s pension and it can happen that a spouse who has been divorced, or whose marriage has been annulled for several years, may claim this, unless there is a very clear direction to the contrary in one&rsquo;s will. Perhaps the Minister of State can reflect on this point and speak to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before the Bill goes before the D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Minister of State clarify what happens to a divorcee whose husband, for example, is killed in an air accident? Does she still receive compensation based on an existing financial maintenance agreement between her and the deceased? Amendment No. 1 to section 7(1)(<i>c</i>) seems to cover the case of a deceased who is in a second relationship but it is not clear whether, if there was an obligation on the deceased to discharge duties determined by a financial arrangement with the divorced wife, she would be covered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions of changes to the arrangements about annulments, divorces or similar situations are not appropriate to this Act. Those matters must be settled in the Civil Liability Acts. A former wife&rsquo;s compensation entitlement is a matter for the courts. It is likely that the person who is entitled to maintenance would have a claim and unless a person specifies in his or her will that somebody is exempt that person may not be exempt. In a situation pertaining particularly to pension entitlements whereby a person originally married to another took out a pension, whether in both names or in his or her name, and did not specify later at divorce or annulment proceedings that the spouse was not entitled to benefit from that pension on the death of the contributor, or of the main partner, if there was such a thing, the second partner could claim but this is not relevant to this Act. The Civil Liability Acts would have to use this for a conclusive adjudication. However, given that the Senator has raised the matter, about which we would all have questions, I will bring it to the attention of our officials and I hope we can clarify the issue during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il.</P>

    <Miles com="cl" par="110"/><Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Special drawing rights represent a unit of currency drawn up by the International Monetary Fund for use whenever currency amounts need to be referred to internationally, including in international conventions. Nearly all countries are members of the International Monetary Fund, which has 184 member states. The SDR unit was drawn up so that it would not be necessary to refer to the value of gold or major currencies such as the US dollar or the euro. One SDR is worth &euro;1.18 at the moment. The value of SDRs is based on a basket of currencies of all IMF member states, including the euro. Ireland has been a member of the International Monetary Fund since 1957. For any countries which ratify the Montreal Convention but are not members of the International Monetary Fund, provision is made in the convention at Article 23(2) for using a currency unit based on gold and that definition is included in the Bill.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everybody involved in the Bill. This time last week, I knew nothing about international conventions on air navigation and transport. I know considerably more now. I thank the departmental officials for the briefing they gave me. I also thank my researchers and the Minister who gave a very comprehensive speech yesterday. The Bill gives people the option of taking legal action in their own state, which is of major benefit. The trial resulting from the Lockerbie crash took place outside Scotland and caused considerable distress to the families involved. We should not see a recurrence of that.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and I wish it a speedy passage. I am glad that it should be passed before 1 May thus allowing the ten accession countries to be covered. I congratulate all those involved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his assistance in guiding us through this very technical legislation relating to a number of conventions. I congratulate the Minister for Transport and his officials on consolidating all legislation in this area into this Bill. I join Senator Browne in thanking the Minister of State and his officials for coming back to us with the information on the amendments. However, as some concerns have been raised, I hope these will be addressed during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il and that we will receive an update.</P><Col N="1674"/>
    <P>I recognise the importance of the speedy passage of the Bill, particularly in light of the Irish Presidency of the European Union. By doing our own parliamentary housekeeping, we can ensure that we do not place further encumbrance on the ten accession states. The legislation should be enacted before 1 May to allow for the automatic reference to this legislation by the ten accession countries.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, and their officials, I thank the Senators for their positive contributions to the debate on this important Bill. From those contributions it was clear there is universal support for this important measure. As discussed yesterday, the Warsaw Convention was established in 1929. The new Montreal Convention will update the Warsaw Convention and the Bill will give it the force of law in Ireland. We are updating, modernising and ensuring there is equity in value for the compensation to be paid taking account of various circumstances, including injuries, accidents, deaths, mental distress or otherwise. Senator Browne made a very relevant point in that this legislation will accommodate people in allowing claims to be made in the simplest way, thus reducing the cost and ensuring fairness for all involved including the airlines. As an island nation this legislation is important to our economic growth as international aviation is critical to our future.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their positive attitude. I thank Senator Dooley, as spokesperson on the Government side, Senators Wilson and McDowell, and the others who spoke. I particularly thank the officials from the Department of Transport for the excellent work they have done in ensuring the law is modernised to take account of domestic and international circumstances.</P>

   <Title>Draft Guidelines on Rural Housing: Statements.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Seanad for arranging to take statements today on this issue and welcome the opportunity to outline for the Members of this House the provisions of the new guidelines on sustainable rural housing which I published last week. People have lived in rural areas in Ireland for a long time. About one third of our people overall live in the countryside. In some parts of the country, a much higher proportion of people than that live in the countryside, especially in parts of the midlands and in the west. People will continue to live in <Col N="1675"/>rural areas for the foreseeable future. We owe it to rural communities to support the future viability of all rural areas.</P>
    <P>The guidelines have two main objectives. First, their implementation through the planning system will facilitate people who have roots or links to the rural community and are part of or contribute to that community in getting planning permission for their housing proposals, subject to normal planning requirements. Second, in the interests of sustaining population levels in the future, planning authorities are required under the guidelines to ensure that any demand for housing in rural areas suffering from population decline is, subject to good planning practice, accommodated.</P>
    <?oasys _ic20-?><P>Recognising that the circumstances in different rural areas vary depending on whether they are, for example, near a large urban area or are very remote, the guidelines outline the planning policies which planning authorities need to incorporate in their development plans to respond to these different circumstances. In rural areas close to larger urban areas, such as the gateways and hubs identified in the national spatial strategy, policies need to be directed towards achieving well-planned residential development which avoids urban sprawl. In remoter rural areas where there are relatively few towns and villages the emphasis is on respecting and consolidating the traditional forms and patterns of housing development. In stronger rural areas development plan policies must strike a balance between accommodating proposals for individual houses and stimulating housing development in smaller towns and villages. This is necessary to ensure a balanced range of choices in new housing development. I want to emphasise again, however, that the guidelines are based on a presumption that people who have roots in or links to rural areas and are part of and contribute to the rural community will get planning permission for houses, provided that they meet the normal planning requirements.</P>
    <P>The draft guidelines are far-reaching. For the first time they provide a policy framework setting out in detail how Government policy on rural housing as set out in the national spatial strategy is to be taken forward by local authorities in planning more effectively for rural areas. The guidelines deal with how development plans can support the development needed to sustain rural communities, how development can be guided and facilitated at the right locations and how planning policies should be tailored to respond to the different circumstances in different areas.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>
    <P>I want planning authorities to adopt a much more positive and pro-active approach in dealing with rural housing. They should act as facilitators in bringing together the elected members, officials, farming and community organisations, organisations representing rural dwellers, <Col N="1676"/>environmental organisations and the wider public to create a shared view of how rural housing is to be addressed. The development plan is adopted in a democratic manner and public ownership of it is paramount.</P>
    <P>For the individual applicant for planning permission the guidelines provide extensive guidance to help them through the process of obtaining permission without delay. The information which planning authorities require is outlined, as are the sources of that information. The guidelines call for applicants to be treated sensitively and courteously by planning authorities. Today when there is much emphasis on the quality of service which public authorities provide I want planning authorities to take as constructive an approach as possible in helping applicants through the process of obtaining permission. In this regard, I am examining the possibility of publishing a leaflet or brochure to complement the guidelines I have already published and to provide further assistance to applicants in taking their proposals through the planning process.</P>
    <P>I have heard and read views to the effect that the guidelines will open the floodgates by abandoning any sense of a planned approach to rural housing. My response to those views is that it is more than reasonable that persons who are an intrinsic part of and contribute to the rural community should be accommodated by our planning system. The guidelines make it clear, however, that housing development in rural areas should complement rather than dominate its natural surroundings. I have seen very good examples in many parts of the country of this being achieved. The site for a new house in a rural area should allow it to &ldquo;settle into and integrate with its surroundings&rdquo; to quote from an excellent rural design guide recently published by Cork County Council.</P>
    <P>The guidelines also make it clear that protecting water quality must be a leading consideration in determining whether sites are suitable for development. Where sites are to be developed, waste water systems must be designed, installed and monitored to ensure that they operate and continue to operate to the required standards. I am considering whether additional measures to ensure that septic tanks and other waste water systems are monitored and maintained regularly are necessary.</P>

	<P>I have not come into this House to listen to the pathetic ramblings of a party in disarray.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>Allow the Minister to continue without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should listen to the one sensible voice in his party at the moment, Deputy Tom Hayes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>This is good news.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are taking statements on rural housing. Senators are drifting. Let the Minister continue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The necessary environmental safeguards will continue to be implemented. As I have said publicly, I welcome the fact that the Irish Rural Dwellers Association which very much represented those concerned about one-off rural housing made all of these points in an up-front way in its submission. I would advise those who have not read it to do so. They will find that the Irish Rural Dwellers Association, An Taisce and others brought these points to the fore. I compliment them because it was extremely helpful in bringing balanced order to this debate.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the 1997 document, Sustainable Development &mdash; A Strategy for Ireland on Rural Housing have sometimes been operated over-rigidly in a way that has not always been in the best interests of the rural community. Sustainable development captures the important ideas that development has economic, social and environmental dimensions which together can contribute to a better quality of life; must strike a balance between these three dimensions to be sustainable; should allow future generations to enjoy a quality of life at least as high as our own; and should respect our responsibilities to the wider international community.</P>
    <P>Regarding rural housing, sustainable development is, therefore, much more than an environmental concept, although it includes that important element. It requires an explicit acknowledgement of the role that people living in rural areas must play in supporting a dynamic rural economy and social structure. For example, rural areas experiencing substantial and persistent population decline may lose the viability needed to sustain essential public services such as schools, local shops and sporting clubs leading to difficulties in supporting the economic and social fabric. Reversing population decline by accommodating new development may require some modest increase in the demand for private transport and energy use but would be sustainable in a broader sense because the additional development delivers strong social and economic benefits to rural areas.</P>
    <P>The guidelines make it clear that the new Government policies on rural housing outlined in <Col N="1678"/>the national spatial strategy, and now set out in greater detail in the guidelines, supersede the provisions on rural housing contained in the sustainable development strategy. We have had an extensive public debate on this issue and I have met and carefully listened to the views of many of the parties, including members of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and others, to that debate. I am particularly grateful to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government for its careful and detailed consideration of the issue and for its recommendations, which have been taken on board in finalising the guidelines.</P>
    <P>As is the normal practice under the Planning and Development Act, I have issued the guidelines in draft form to give all those interested a further opportunity to comment before they are finalised in statutory form under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Comments are to be submitted to my Department by 30 April next. I will carefully consider any suggestions for improving the guidelines before they are finalised.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>However, in view of the importance of the rural housing issue and the fact that there has already been extensive opportunity for public debate, I have urged planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to take them on board immediately, even though they are still in draft form. The guidelines will be put into effect both in development plans and in the processing of planning applications. They have the capacity to and will deliver a new era of fairness and transparency in planning for rural dwellers.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It goes without saying that any opportunity to discuss rural development or the lack of it must be welcomed. It would be impossible to consider rural development without giving due regard to the people who live and work in rural areas and giving priority to ensuring their economic and social well-being. That is what the guidelines do not do.</P>
    <P>The guidelines do not consider the good of the people of rural Ireland, they are rather another attempt by the Government to manipulate the people in a pre-local and European election fanfare that is not worth the paper on which it is written.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

	<P>I ask the Senator to speak to the motion or I will adjourn the debate completely.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>One-off housing currently accounts for more than one third of our annual housing output. Some 85% of applicants for this kind of housing are accepted by local authorities. The local authorities have this matter under control. Some 90% of the applications appealed by An Taisce are turned down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for sound planning reasons. Nobody wants to deprive the sons and daughters of our farmers and rural dwellers the opportunity to build on their homeland, where they have grown up and where they have family and friends. I have always been a strong supporter of rural housing and I want the Leader to check the records of Longford County Council on that matter. It is essential that these houses fit in with the local landscape and are properly sited.</P>
    <P>The rash of unsuitable holiday homes is a blight on our landscape. What about the Minister&rsquo;s guidelines which will allow anyone to build a house in an area of declining population merely because they want to? His response is that these guidelines will encourage balanced regional development in line with the national spatial strategy. In addition to rural housing, we need regional and local services. The Minister referred to schools, local shops, sporting clubs and other facilities closing down in rural areas. However, it is up to the Minister and the Government to ensure that those services are in place for rural communities. Perhaps the Minister could explain his idea of the national spatial strategy, bearing in mind that it has been lying dormant for the past two years. Building more houses in the countryside will leave the areas identified by the national spatial strategy without the necessary building programmes.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy initially appeared to be a lifeline for rural development, but the reality is that it is nothing more than another headline grabbing exercise and another under-resourced white elephant.</P>

	<P>However, changes made by councillors to the previous county development plan have helped in terms of planning in rural Ireland. I will provide an example. Under the previous system, only one child of a farmer with four or five children was entitled to permission to build. That situation has now changed in County Galway. Councillors have done a good job in tackling that issue.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke of proper planning and sustainable development. This is important whether it relates to the building of one or more houses in the countryside. Galway has encountered difficulties as regards heritage towns, an important status for many towns such as Athenry and Gort.</P>

	<P>And Tipperary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking about County Galway. One cannot refuse permission to people because they live in or near a heritage town. The Minister touched on these issues earlier. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, spoke of the environs of protected structures, aspects of heritage, natural habitats and SACs. They are important issues which need to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs also spoke of people having links to rural areas. This issue has also caused some difficulty in the past. People living outside an area, even though they were working there, had difficulty obtaining planning. That situation has been improved by county development plans. The Minister pointed out that people with links other than being natives will be dealt with under new guidelines. Many of the comments about people being blow-ins are totally unfair. There must be discussions at an early stage between applicants and planners to tease out any difficulties that may arise. There is enormous interest in this matter and we need more planners. Galway, the second largest county, is receiving more applications than other counties.</P>
    <P>Councils state they are granting permission in more than 80% of the applications they receive. Many applications, withdrawn and resubmitted six or seven times with different proposals, are often refused. It is important discussions take place at an early stage. We should also look seriously at the refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of many applications, an issue to which Senator Bannon referred. The real problem arises in the context of refusals at An Bord Plean&aacute;la level.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to the draft guidelines in the context of the national spatial strategy. Many of the problems arise in structurally weak <Col N="1689"/>and predominantly dispersed settlements in Galway and, indeed, in Longford. I am delighted the Minister is attempting to deal with this issue. Athenry is a heritage town. Many people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that no longer will rural Ireland be preserved as the weekend retreat for urban dwellers or people <Col N="1690"/>who misrepresent the great work An Taisce does from time to time.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

	<P>They are not clear. That is the problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank God the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and his officials had the vision to come up with a set of guidelines that will improve this situation no end. People from farming backgrounds with limited means can now look forward with confidence in the knowledge that they will be able to acquire a site on the family land at a reasonable price on which they can develop their homes and live and work in their own area. I cannot understand why anybody would be against that.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>It represents the kind of objectionism we were giving out about earlier, and Senator Bannon mentioned An Taisce. That objectionism has prevented planning throughout this country, and now we have to listen to it from the Opposition benches.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I took time to speak to a number of planners about the guidelines. They are being broadly welcomed by people with common sense.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Kitt&rsquo;s point about the need for more planners. There should be more centres where planning qualifications can be obtained.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We want more action, not planning.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>That would help speed up the process in terms of interpretation of the guidelines. There should be a broad interpretation of the guidelines, not just one which is coming out of UCD.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister once again and wish him luck. I would like to think these guidelines do not represent an end in themselves but rather a <Col N="1691"/>beginning through which we can develop rural Ireland proactively and constructively.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I requested this debate last Thursday, although that should not be construed to mean I support Government policy in any way.</P>
    <P>Like some people in this House I was elected to a local authority five years ago and one of the overriding issues at that time was the difficulties people were facing in terms of the planning system. It appeared to me that the typical cases ran into difficulty for a number of reasons, some of which concerned bad planning agents, the people between the applicant and the planning authority. There was not sufficiently strong regulation in terms of who was allowed to lodge applications to local authorities on behalf of applicants. That in turn led to a very broad system where sloppy applications arrived in local authorities which only added to the woes of those applicants. As soon as these applications run into difficulty, either for planning or engineering reasons, more often than not the response they get from their planning agencies is to go to their local councillors, Deputy or Senator. These people were happy to take &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 from a young applicant, not put in the effort to which they are morally entitled in terms of pursuing their application and then expect somebody else to pick up the pieces. That was one issue.</P>
    <P>The second issue is the rigid application of the interpretation of development plans by a new generation of young planners in particular, including those who came out of UCD. They regarded the development plans as their bible and decided to work to them but once they took that attitude and adopted that policy, difficulties immediately arose for the applicants.</P>
    <P>I have had cases where the sons or daughters of landowners applied for planning permission. I am not necessarily talking about farmers but a broader term of landowner where people who lived and worked in an area felt entitled to get planning permission and live in that area for obvious reasons. People are entitled to live within reasonable parameters of their home area. There is also the cost issue. Some of these young couples would not survive long in the housing market, given the way prices have gone in recent years and the most cost effective solution was to get a site from a relative and build a house. Many of them took the route of building through direct labour, which again reduced costs.</P>
    <P>Up to three years ago Cork County Council only had approximately 40 planners. There was a huge shortage of planners in the system despite <Col N="1692"/>the fact that it was the largest local authority outside Dublin. That speaks volumes about the difficulties applications in that area ran into because the planners were working to the optimum but were still unable to cope with applications which in turn led in some areas to a deferral of applications just to allow the people dealing with them time to do that work.</P>
    <P>I never had any sympathy with anybody who wanted to build a South Fork-type house or mansion in a rural area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Or a house with ten balconies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>In the south, and other Members may articulate on this aspect later, we have special areas of conservation and areas zoned for particular usage in terms of the inhabitants of the area, which poses difficulties for the people outside of those zones. There are also the coastal areas which are extremely sensitive and undergo rigid procedures in terms of planning. That is understandable in some cases because of their proximity to tourist areas.</P>
    <P>In one instance, for example, somebody from the United Kingdom built a type of mansion and the genuine young applicants in the area who had been refused planning permission were naturally aggrieved by this decision. They investigated it and discovered that planning permission had not been sought or obtained in that case. The roads committee in this area had a meeting at which we were lectured by a planner about how this decision was wrong and the person who had erected the mansion would be told to reduce the height of the building by approximately four or five feet. That is not the way to administer any system. That case rightly aggrieved the people in the area who had been refused planning permission because this guy breezed in, with all due respect to anyone who is a blow-in, and put up a building as he saw fit. That is not good enough and it is an inconsistency in the system in terms of how it is administered in different local authorities.</P>
    <P>The people for whom I always felt sorry were the genuine applicants, young couples with a housing need. I have seen a great sense of reasoning with these people when their plight becomes known to the managers and assistant managers. We must not forget that the executive function in terms of granting permission is the sole responsibility of the managers. As we were dealing with a generation of planners who were applying the letter of the law rigidly, planning and engineering issues, for example, had to be considered in coming to a decision on an application.</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>I have always had recourse to the management of the council and I do not necessarily believe that should be the case. We also have recourse to management to say as regards an application, for example, that the landowner who has applied for planning permission is heavily in debt, for whatever reason. This person may have an asset and <Col N="1693"/>wish to dispose of 2% or 3% to get himself or herself out of financial difficulty. That is not <Miles com="ch"/>being unreasonable. Situations arise where there are a number of children in the family who may be going on to third level education, which is expensive. There have been cases where people have <Miles com="ch"/>applied for planning permission in order to be able to raise the revenue to fund their children&rsquo;s third level education. In these cases the planning permissions when granted were structured so that while no large-scale development was allowed, a halfway solution was found which catered for the needs of applicants and the requisite housing needs within proper guidelines.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
    <P>One section deals with guidelines and I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response on the compilation of development plans. I raised this last Thursday with the Leader during the Order of Business. My interpretation is that the compilation of the development plan is the responsibility of the members of the planning authority, working with the officials. I am interested in particular in how the guidelines will affect that particular system. Do they supersede the development plans? In Cork we are in the first year of the current five-year development plan. There are four more years to go.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If I may assist the Senator on this point, all county and city development plans will now have to be reviewed and the guidelines taken on board. They will now go back to the councillors so that the guidelines are incorporated in the development plans. They must take account of the way the plans are done, so the members in all the planning authorities around the country, working with the managers, will now decide. The will go back for a full review to take on board the guidelines. All the local planning authorities have been written to in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reply. Another point of interest concerns conditions attached to a planning permission as issued by a local authority. Time and again, if a planning application was for the benefit of a family member with a housing need, in the majority of cases I have dealt with a residency clause was attached to the permission, preventing the sale or use of the dwelling by anyone other than a family member for five years. A good way of getting planning permission, in some cases, is to ensure that conditions as regards a stipulated beneficiary are strictly adhered to.</P>
    <P>It must be possible to make another case as regards councillors. We as public representatives will get the &ldquo;no hoper&rdquo; cases, that is people who have no hope of getting planning permission. There may be good or bad reasons involved, but they are generally no-hopers. One discovers in such cases that one may be the eighth or ninth public representative to have been approached.</P>
    <P>It should never be forgotten that it is the members of the local authority who compile the <Col N="1694"/>development plans. It was not the managers or State Departments that compiled them but the members of the local authority, as appointed by the people. This is something people quite conveniently forget at times. As regards the role of outside bodies, we have had a debate on the role of An Taisce in particular at the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Representatives from that organisation appeared before the committee and underwent a fair degree of questioning and debate on this issue. I accept that the organisation was set up for good reasons. In recent years, however, there has been a proliferation of cases where many people believe its influence is more than it should be. In some cases this resulted in just making life more difficult for applicants.</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>We are all aware of the role of An Bord <Miles com="ch"/>Plean&aacute;la. In Cork there is a particular issue involving the toxic waste incinerator which has been granted planning permission. I know it is national policy in terms of the issues associated with incineration and so on. However, in this particular case, the planning application was refused on a number of occasions by Cork County Council. There was unanimous agreement in the council chamber on a number of occasions with that particular line. The decision ended up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for review. ABP&rsquo;s inspector came out and cited reasons in double figures as to why the plant should not be sited at Ringaskiddy and why the decision of the local authority should be upheld. After all of that the board, in its wisdom, decided not to take into consideration the advice of its own planning inspector and granted permission anyway. That is a sore point. It is undemocratic and I do not believe it serves the <Miles com="ch"/>greater good at all. If one ignores the reason for the application, it is not fair that this decision was taken by a board which went completely against the advice of its own inspectorate.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Senator the House is considering draft guidelines on rural housing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course. I am referring to the current planning system as regards the role of outside bodies, which has a direct impact on rural housing. I have qualified my remarks by saying there are implications in terms of the roles of outside bodies. As regards the guidelines, the public consultation process will close on 30 April. That is close to 11 June and we are all aware-&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a statutory matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that. It is 12 weeks from Friday next to the local and European elections. This issue has been around for much longer than the last six or 12 months. I want to put forward a reasonable argument and debate in terms of my own experience of the planning system. I believe it smacks of political <Col N="1695"/>opportunism. I have always pursued the case for genuine applicants who have a housing need. The current system is hard on young couples in particular, in terms of how it is applied. When Cork Country Council began a recruitment drive for planners to deal with the backlog of applications, it had to go to career seminars in London and Paris. It had to go abroad and actively seek planners from other countries to come over here. That in itself has helped to deal logistically with the thousands of applications a local authority this size has had to deal with. I have always found the recourse to management to be good.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that the local and European elections are 12 weeks away. The guidelines have no legislative footing. I would appreciate if they had and I could see a stronger role for them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If I may again be helpful to the Senator, the guidelines are issued on that basis, but then they become statutory.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that with immediate effect?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a question and answer interval on Second Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope on behalf of the many thousands of young people around the country that this is not another cynical attempt to assuage the electorate before an election. We have seen enough of that. This is an issue that is too close to people&rsquo;s hearts. Nobody in this room can say, with hand on heart, that he or she has not witnessed the difficulties such people go through when they apply for planning permission. I hope this is not an attempt to buy votes. I hope these guidelines will be in place post 11 June and that they will do what they set out to do. If not, we will be here to remind the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on recognising the strong and continuing tradition of people living in rural areas. Those who are born in an area can live there and people who contribute to the local community will be entitled to build their family home in the area. The guidelines bring clarity to applicants and planners and are clear, consistent and readily understood. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, will now ensure that all the county development plans are re-visited and take into account the new policy on one-off housing.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This also applies to regional development plans at the draft stage and has a role to play towards ensuring that the relevant counties fully endorse, on an equitable basis, what is laid down in the guidelines. More importantly, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is now obliged to implement the guidelines with immediate effect. It is important the guidelines make it possible at the pre-planning stage for <Col N="1696"/>applicants and planners to tease out difficulties. Everyone has the right to build in rural Ireland, but not on a particular site. That is important.</P>

	<P>It is very important that the Government recognises the need to protect the environment. I also pay tribute to councillors throughout the country who have attended general council meetings, and I am sure that Senator Bannon&rsquo;s LAMA meetings have the same people in attendance and the same representation from political parties which have endorsed, to a man and woman, the protection and the right of a person to live in rural Ireland.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Planning authorities should now adopt a more positive and proactive approach to dealing with rural housing, working together with the applicants as facilitators in bringing together all interested parties to create a shared view on how the question of rural housing is to be addressed. We should protect the environment &mdash; waste water has been mentioned &mdash; and monitor and maintain water quality. The guidelines also take that into consideration. The controls on occupancy of housing have been mentioned by a previous speaker, and I also ask the Minister to tease out that issue in the context of sustaining the population of rural areas to ensure that we do not have unsustainable developments.</P>
    <P>For the first time we have a national framework setting out in detail Government policy as laid down in the national spatial strategy. It is to be prepared for implementation by all local authorities. I thank the Minister for taking into consideration the submissions by the General Council of County Councils, the Rural Dwellers Association and An Taisce. At a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government attended by Senator Bannon, all the submissions were made by architects and taken into consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister once again for moving forward. This is above politics. The future of rural Ireland is in the hands of politicians, and local authorities throughout the country have acted on cross-party lines. I am surprised to see the issue become so divisive here today. Charges have been mentioned. Counties have adopted those, and members of Senator Bannon&rsquo;s party have voted for them because they see the merit of waste water treatment and sewerage plants being built in rural areas. That is very important.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>They are a Fianna F&aacute;il stealth tax.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the environmental issue, the number of houses per square kilometre is 19.4 in rural Ireland, one of the lowest figures in Europe, since it is 100 in foreign parts. It is very important that Fianna F&aacute;il recognises the development of rural Ireland and allows it to continue to grow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I hope that, before he leaves it, despite his earlier address, he might clearly indicate how he sees the guidelines making a difference. Regarding what Senator Brennan said, I was a member of Galway County Council until very recently. On a cross-party basis, we had to engage <Col N="1698"/>a consultant to provide global professional guidance to us, at our own expense, to make such adjustments as we wanted, fairly and legally, to bring about a proper county development plan. We were the first county under the new legislation to draw up such a plan.</P>
    <P>The issues the Minister is now including in future guidelines for change and improvement have already been incorporated into our plan. I am not being political when I say that the guidelines that he has now introduced to bring about massive change to improve the situation of someone from rural Ireland applying to build a house are already in existence. I say this with the greatest respect to him and regardless of whatever political reason was behind his raising this issue now in the current climate of the run-up to the local and European elections. Be that as it may; let that be his political outlook, if such it is.</P>
    <P>These guidelines will not make any change whatever. I have consulted the planners in the council and it is clear that the local authorities which devise the county development plans and the officers who implement them, including the county manager, are bound by the legislation that has been in force from 2000. We must work within those restrictions. Nothing in these guidelines shows any variation or change from that.</P>
    <P>I was surprised and disappointed that the Leader of the House was trying to say that we are against rural housing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear from party&rsquo;s motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The important thing is that we succeed in bringing about change now by allowing people to build in rural Ireland. Will the Minister clarify the documentation published last weekend by his Department which stated: &ldquo;However, the Minister is requesting planning authorities in each county and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to take the guidelines on board and put in place the measures necessary to implement them with immediate effect.&rdquo; Any applicant who has been disappointed by a refusal over the last few days should re-apply. Under the new guidelines, the Minister, understanding that there are difficulties in certain situations, has given power to the planners and the managers of local authorities throughout the country immediately to implement these new guidelines where they apply and improve the situation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>All the councils must now review their own county development plans. That is the first thing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that is not the answer that I want. The Department document states that the guidelines are to be implemented with immediate effect. It is on page 2, paragraph 3, in the last line.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The whole purpose is the empowerment of councillors. Councillors have been told that they are responsible for their own development plans. They must now review those plans and take on board the guidelines. I will not override the councillors&rsquo; role in the matter. I was happy to listen to all the bodies, including the General Council of County Councils, LAMA, the Rural Dwellers Association, An Taisce and everyone who has spoken over the past 18 months on this. As the Senator well knows, I had intended to publish these guidelines before Christmas, but the General Council of County Councils asked me to delay that so that it could make a submission, and I gracefully acceded to its wish. It was not my timing that brought them out; I acted on that basis. I have now moved ahead on the basis that all the discussions have taken place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can make that statement later, but not in my time. I would believe him had we not had the experience of the Taoiseach saying in Sligo that it was a major issue. Before the General Council of County Councils made the decision requesting that the Minister delay publication, a Minister and Minister of State in County Galway &mdash; Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Fahey &mdash; were vying with each other, demanding to meet the local authorities so that they could have input &mdash; in other words, so that their arrogance could be imposed on us. The Minister is not aware of it, but it is the reality.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister does not want to hear it, that is his problem, but that is the reality of what we must endure regarding the planning situation in our local authority in County Galway and the pressure that has been brought to bear. I was present at a meeting with the manager, the Minister and Minister of State and the members of the local authority, as well as Oireachtas Members, when they clearly demanded change from the manager, knowing that they could not have any input. Either one is a member of a local authority and has responsibility, or certain Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers have something special to offer. Perhaps they do, but there is a place for that at the Cabinet table, and not in this instance.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they to be implemented now? The Minister cannot have it both ways. If we are to have improved possibilities for people in rural Ireland to live in areas where they have connections, it is important for the people to have ownership of the planning process and that ownership is not on a political basis as has been adopted by some people. The Minister has taken on this issue as if it involved ownership of the planning process.</P>

	<P>One third of the population lives in rural Ireland and the greater proportion of them are on the western seaboard. It is in these areas that we have our greatest problems with regard to planning. Can the Minister stand over what he has presented as other than a pre-<Col N="1702"/>election gimmick and say that these guidelines will make a change and make it easier for people in rural Ireland to get planning permission? That is the problem in a nutshell. Can the Minister tell us if there is anything in what he said which is not already in our county plans?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator said the guidelines will make no difference but is now saying they will make a huge difference. He should make up his mind.</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister can tell us there is something in the guidelines which is not already in the county plans, we will say it is a job well done. The Minister has failed. This reminds me of what has happened with regard to the smoking ban. Last Thursday the Minister said his guidelines would have immediate effect but now it has changed to 30 April. We will then have the final draft and implementation post the 11 June elections. This comes as no surprise to anybody. We see the same cynicism in connection with all legislation. If it is topical, it is postponed until the day comes when it can be eased through, perhaps during the holidays or silly season. It is all these proposed guidelines would deserve.</P>

	<P>I appreciate that. I am pleased the Minister has come to the House and listened to what we have to put up with day in and day out. Whenever we have good news to present, this is the kind of reaction we get from the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>This is great news. The Minister is bringing life and vibrancy back to rural Ireland. It is good news for those who live and work in rural Ireland and who want to return to their roots. I am from a rural background. I love rural Ireland but it was slowly going down the tube.</P>

	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il has now done a U-turn.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a member of South Dublin County Council and have been a member of the General Council of County Councils for the past ten years. Like the Senator, I attended many conferences where debate took place. I remember being in Ennis 12 months ago when a member of Fine Gael sat beside me and a Labour Party member on my other side. They came out strongly and attacked An Taisce and I was delighted because I felt it was a non-political issue and that we could work together on it.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the Fine Gael motion, especially when it states: &ldquo;considers that there is an urgent need for the Government to make a statement on the position of local authorities in readjusting their County Development Plans to facilitate the Government&rsquo;s U-turn on this matter.&rdquo;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister not say earlier that we will have to go back to our county development plans? I asked the question and the Minister answered it. The Senator is contradicting herself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ormonde without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned that I would get confused if I kept listening to the Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is confused, one way or the other.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>That is one thing that cannot be said about me; I am as clear as a bell. Let us look at the benefits we will get from the implementation of these guidelines. We will identify again with a parish, our grassroots and our schools. Many rural schools are unviable because of the declining rural population.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We want clarity on the matter. That is all we seek.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>If the situation continued as it is, we would only have older people in rural Ireland, which would be an enormous burden on the health service. The benefits are enormous. This is great news and long may the Minister last to deliver on it.</P>
    <P>What I liked about these guidelines is that the Minister said there would be a shared view. He received submissions from the General Council of County Councils, LAMA, the Rural Dwellers&rsquo; Association and An Taisce. It is great to have them all involved. I do not have any difficulty with these people. They were all of the one <Col N="1704"/>opinion except for An Taisce, which kicks with a different foot according to whom it is talking. I agree that this is the way we should proceed.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that planners will have to facilitate people in order that applicants will not feel daunted. We have been put in that position because planners have not shared the ethos of rural Ireland. They come from other areas and countries and have no feeling for what rural Ireland is all about. I welcome that planners will have to be facilitators. They will also have to listen to key players such as the General Council of County Councils, the wider community, local residents&rsquo; associations and so on.</P>
    <P>There is no question of opening the floodgates to the development of South Fork-style buildings. I would hate if that were the case as that is what put everybody off development in rural areas in the past. Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and everybody else, including planners, are guilty of taking that approach. As a result we had awful monstrosities of buildings, which were not properly integrated into the landscape, stuck up in the mountains. The Minister has recognised this and I applaud him for it.</P>
    <P>It is important that we develop a style of building that is properly integrated into the landscape. Such an approach would facilitate a population move from urban areas to rural areas, which would allow for the development of rural pursuits. Hill walking, fishing and parish sports days are nearly things of the past. It almost appears as if nobody is living in rural Ireland at the moment. All Senators undertake election campaigns. The countryside is beautiful but nobody appears to be living there. Parts of the country are dead and it is time to revitalise them. I am delighted that these guidelines have been introduced and I congratulate the Minister on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the situation would be monitored to prevent the proliferation of septic tanks. I was a member of South Dublin County Council where this subject was discussed in regard to the Dublin mountains. I encountered many people who cannot get planning permission to build houses in the mountains. I agree that developments must be in keeping with the local area, which the Minister has recognised. The General Council of County Councils and LAMA will be thrilled with these regulations, as will county councillors who will be delighted to pass on this good news to their constituents.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, although I have mixed views about his proposal. Like everybody else, I would like to believe what he said, but the reality may be different. The majority of Senators come from local authority backgrounds and have great experience of studying county development plans. The more one studies them, the more frustrating they become. One has to ask how it all went wrong in the first place.</P><Col N="1705"/>
    <P>The problem originated with the Planning and Development Act 2000. I am delighted the Minister is making a U-turn on that Act. Will the Minister explain what the term &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; means in the context of that legislation? Planners give several different interpretations of sustainable development.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an interesting point. I recently placed my view on this matter on the record, which is that there is no sustainable development without people. However, the legislation was being interpreted in a way that almost excluded people. People are at the heart of sustainable development. I cannot be clearer than this. The interpretation was the reverse of how it was intended.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is helpful and I hope the Minister will go to the trouble of notifying county managers and planning officials of this interpretation of sustainable development. Interpretation is what gave rise to problems in the first instance. Planners were of the opinion that sustainable development implied cluster developments, that is, the building of villages and small towns. There was little scope for those who wished to get planning permission for a development outside this parameter. This is a crucial aspect of the strategy and guidelines that are being introduced.</P>
    <P>From my perspective as a member of a local authority for nearly 25 years, in the past, the interpretation of the term &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; resulted in many applicants for housing in rural Ireland being refused planning permission. No matter what case local authority members made, even with the agreement of the council, they could not get around the planner&rsquo;s interpretation of sustainable development.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister shed some light on this matter, but it will not be sufficient unless his view is notified to planners. Planning permission is not rocket science. It ultimately depends on the subjective view of one person. While certain matters such as sewerage and water services, road access and so on come into play, ultimately the type of house to be built depends on somebody&rsquo;s view. People hold different views. Clear written guidelines would, in part, help to clarify the matter as the 2000 Act is open to wide interpretation. In the context of this discussion, the Minister stated that developments must be sustainable. If planners take the wrong interpretation of this, then the old system will prevail and there will not be any change. This is a cause of great frustration to many people.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and their members go to great lengths to compile county development plans that best suit their areas. However, a planner&rsquo;s interpretation of this can be completely at odds with the original intention. When we drew up the county development plan in Mayo County Council I requested that a register of interpretations be kept. I wanted a record of <Col N="1706"/>councillors&rsquo; interpretations of their proposals but the county manager ruled this out. He alleged that it would give rise to two plans, the actual plan and a separate version of how it should be interpreted. However, there was considerable merit in my proposal. The 2000 Act has specified that there must be a new plan every five years. Some of the previous plans covered periods of seven and eight years. A plan put in place today could be interpreted differently in seven years. A new planner or county manager would have a different interpretation of it than the councillor who proposed it on day one. I hope the Minister of State will take this on board.</P>
    <P>Every councillor or public representative is in favour of rural housing. Over the past 25 years I have not met anyone who is against it and I know of no Senator who is against it. I agree that monstrosities should not be built although there are many of them in existence. Everybody can associate with what is bad planning but, for some reason, there are huge inconsistencies in the planning process. The views of one planner seem to be completely different from those of another. Regulation is required in this respect.</P>
    <P>What is good planning? To some, it involves getting a house wherever they want it, but this is not necessarily desirable. The majority are in favour of sustainable rural development. If the Minister&rsquo;s interpretation of sustainable development is such that the local GAA club, soccer club and community can be regenerated, I believe it. However, under the previous Act, sustainable development was interpreted in a different way by planners and county managers than the way outlined by the Minister of State this evening.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde made an interesting point about rural decline. Mayo County Council analysed the number of applications for planning permission for houses over a five year period. It is interesting that, towards the end of the 1990s, 17,500 people applied for planning permission. About 1,500 applications were refused and roughly 16,000 were granted. This is a very high grant rate. However, interestingly, 10,000 new houses were built although the population outside the urban areas of Castlebar, Westport and Ballina declined by 2,500 between the publication of the 1996 statistics and those pertaining to 2002. In light of these figures, we must ask what is really happening. Are we building the wrong types of houses? Are they holiday homes? Many genuine applicants were refused, including those trying to build on the home farm or on a site obtained from a relation, father or mother. Therefore, good planning should be coupled with common sense. Several Senators and I know that common sense seems to go out the door in many cases. While it would have no standing regarding a planning Act or planning guidelines, we should do whatever is necessary to have it adhered to.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1707"/>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. I declare an interest in that my brother is a member of the planning profession, although he operates in a different county from that in which I live. Therefore, I hear the views of both sides, namely those of constituents and colleagues and those of planners.</P>
    <P>I am glad the heat of this debate has lessened considerably, thanks to contributions from Senators McCarthy and Paddy Burke, among others. There is a fairly strong consensus in the House regarding the draft regulations. They are as much a clarification and codification as something radically new or different. Some county developments plans will reflect or anticipate fairly closely what is in the guidelines. In other counties modification may be required, which may not just be in the plan but in its implementation and the way it is supplied.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Paddy Burke&rsquo;s point that one of the biggest complaints has concerned the lack of consistency in the application of planning guidelines. Some years ago, there may have been a view that planning was too lax, to the point of being non-existent. Now there is a view that it has gone to the opposite extreme in some instances and that there is too much rigidity. Applications for sensible developments in respect of which there would have been no problem a few years ago are now being stopped.</P>
    <P>There was a certain amount of crossfire across the floor of the House regarding development levies. Some development levy is needed to reflect the social cost of housing, wherever it may be situated. It is a question of determining the appropriate level. The guidelines will also be very useful not just to councils but also to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in dealing with appeals.</P>
    <P>Senator Paddy Burke referred to the well-known fact that rural depopulation has been particularly strong in the north west. I cannot get it out of my head that this island had a population of 8.2 million people 160 years ago. Many, if not all, of these people lived in the countryside. They lived along peninsulas and in what were called &ldquo;congested districts&rdquo; in the late union period. Such districts were in the west and north west. The notion that barren and empty landscapes represent a more aesthetic ideal than that of having life in an area is questionable. I have relatives in Scotland and I find depressing the amount of barren landscape in that country. Obviously, I am not talking about high mountain tops, but certain areas of the country are completed depopulated. This is not exactly replicated anywhere in Ireland. It is nice to see a few twinkling lights at night in the countryside for example when one looks across to islands such as Inishboffin. I do not accept the idea that even a coastal landscape is more interesting if it has no population whatsoever. However, there should not be too many holiday homes which are occupied for only a few weeks of the year, particularly in an area of high amenity. A policy is needed for that. The type of holiday home <Col N="1708"/>which is let for nine months of the year is a very different proposition. Planners should maybe find out what is the planned letting period.</P>
    <P>There is a genuine debate behind all this, namely, to what degree there should be development into the country in the vicinity of towns and villages on the edge of some of which there is attractive housing. It would be very hard to forbid people to build or live in a place at the edge of the countryside although it is necessary to avoid too much ribbon development in large towns. There is also a great deal of snobbery about bungalows. A few thousand years ago most people lived in huts, which became cabins and later cottages, and now the modern cottages are bungalows. It is not true that a two or three storey house is necessarily or intrinsically more attractive. Some people in this debate have referred to South Fork and so on. Any new house will initially intrude on the landscape, no matter how it is situated. If one allows time for plants and trees to grow around it most settle very nicely into the landscape within five or ten years. Some environmentalists have an ideological and passionate hatred for the motorised society. That is understandable in one who lives amidst the congestion of the centre of Dublin but we are talking about the countryside here, not the cities. They feel that houses in the countryside generate traffic whereas if everyone is concentrated in close proximity preferably in the type of apartment blocks familiar in some continental European cities, of which we are seeing more here too, everyone would walk, cycle, or take a bus or train. That vision, however, cannot dictate our planning or our approach to developing the country.</P>
    <P>We will face great development pressures in the next few years. By the end of this century, although none of us will live to see it, we will return to a population of 8 million, many of whom will be people whom today we call immigrants. We have become a prosperous country and there is no reason that we should not remain so, in a temperate climate which will remain even in conditions of global warming. I can see the population rising considerably. The result will be bigger cities and towns and more people living in the countryside. There is no harm in vitalising rural communities, within reason. My father who was born in 1910 on a country road two miles outside Tipperary said there were far more people living on that road in his youth than in his old age even though a few single houses were built there in his latter years.</P>
    <P>There are many ruined houses, cottages or two storey houses which I would like to see being restored. Once as I walked in an overgrown area on Gorumna Island, with which the Leas-Chathaoirleach is probably familiar, I saw a German family restoring a ruined cottage and thought &ldquo;good luck to them&rdquo;. There ought to be more encouragement for that sort of work. I do not refer to someone who buys a cottage alleging that he or she will restore it but who knocks it <Col N="1709"/>and builds something completely different. Maybe there should be some public assistance to encourage the use and restoration of derelict houses which are one-off houses, albeit not occupied, in the countryside already. The planning profession in some of the big counties is under a heavy pressure as development increases and people must work way beyond their normal hours, very often without any overtime payment. We should expand those offices.</P>
    <P>These guidelines are a necessary clarification which should not be caricatured as they have been in some of our national newspapers which describe them as covering the country in concrete or a bungalow blitz. They are very well balanced and not a free for all anything goes and should not be misrepresented as such. It is one thing to lay down guidelines, and quite another to see them implemented. People will want to watch carefully to see if there is some modulation of policy which takes account of people who have a legitimate wish, as defined in the circumstances given in the guidelines. Is that going to be granted rather than refused? We must recall that we live in a democracy and this is relevant to other debates scheduled for today. This is not a bureaucracy or a technocracy of experts, planning or otherwise. One must have some regard to what people want and to direct that into constructive channels. Good quality design is very important as building increases in the countryside. Allowing the principle of a house does not mean to say that it is allowed anywhere and the Minister of State is not suggesting this.</P>
    <P>The guidelines and the Minister&rsquo;s contribution should be accepted as a serious, responsible, forward-looking, enlightened and well-balanced statement of where we should be. Some people have tried to make an issue of the timing. Government cannot be suspended because elections are scheduled in a few months&rsquo; time. If we were to end all government and politics in an election year the country could not make progress. These guidelines should be judged on their merits and not simply denigrated as some kind of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I have read both the guidelines and the Minister&rsquo;s speech with interest. I do not believe they will make a great deal of difference as most applications for planning permission are granted anyway. I am somewhat bemused as to how this will address the problem of rural depopulation. I had understood that the main reason people were not living at every crossroads, as was the case when I was a child, was that there was a lack of jobs in the countryside. Now that fewer people are employed in agriculture and as <Col N="1710"/>many people cannot find jobs in the nearest town, they have to seek jobs further away.</P>
    <P>If they feel it is appropriate, farmers should be allowed to let all their children build houses on their land. Such children with their spouses and their own children will all need to commute some distance to work and school. I have no obsession with cars except that it is better to walk and get some exercise.</P>
    <P>However, there is no public transport in rural Ireland. This document makes no mention of the cost of supplying services to all these people. I presume they will need to be paid for by the rest of us taxpayers. Waste services need to be provided. While I know they will pay electricity and water services, will school busses need to go to more remote places simply because a person, who had some connection with the area, can now build there? There is a real difficulty with older people living in isolated places. What thought has been given to providing services for them?</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about transport, which is very difficult for those in rural Ireland already. I see nothing in the guidelines indicating that this will improve. I presume the people will be allowed sell the houses, which could result in them becoming holiday houses that are only occupied for a small proportion of the year. I have great doubts about the vibrant, thriving crossroads we will get with such development. However, as I have said, I do not believe it will make much difference.</P>
    <P>Apart from the cost of the services, for which we will all have to pay, I am deeply concerned about water pollution. Since I was first elected to this House, I have heard about improvements to address water pollution. I am sure the Minister of State reads the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s reports with even more vigour than I do. Some 45% of private water schemes are polluted with faeces coming from septic tanks that are not maintained. In some areas where there is limestone with little topsoil for drainage the problem is serious and one person&rsquo;s septic tank is leaking into the next person&rsquo;s water supply.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister piously stated: &ldquo;Where sites are to be developed, wastewater systems must be designed, installed and monitored to ensure that they operate and continue to operate to the required standards.&rdquo; However, as this is not happening at present, why is it likely to happen in the future? Septic tanks are frequently never cleared out. While I had heard the Minister was to introduce regulations requiring them to be cleared by a registered professional capable of doing so, this has not happened. If we will not enforce existing regulations, there is no point believing this will happen. This problem causes serious illness. The major problem we have regarding rural housing and water supply is being completely disregarded. It is clear from the Minister&rsquo;s speech that the same old practices will continue.</P><Col N="1711"/>
    <P>I doubt that these guidelines will make much difference given that most houses already get planning permission. If a farmer has six children, I presume all of them would be entitled to build houses. It would be regrettable if most of them ended up being sold as holiday homes, which would result in empty houses for most of the year as happens in parts of Ireland already, which is pretty depressing.</P>
    <P>I shall finish on a cheerful note. There is much discussion about a bungalow blitz. I believe this is because for a while we built houses resembling Spanish haciendas. They were so un-Irish looking that it made people pretty depressed. While some people may not think it attractive, we have managed to develop a style of our own. However, some houses are being built which are much better. I applaud that we have reverted to painting our houses brightly, a sight we used to see in our youth. Clonakilty and all around it is a joy to behold. In many other places new houses have individual character without being a copy of something the owner saw while on holidays in Santa Ponsa or Marbella. I applaud those planners who have shown such initiatives.</P>
    <P>I regret we have no data on the cost of these developments. I wish someone in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would take the pollution of the water supply more seriously.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire. I welcome the guidelines and I commend the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, on introducing them. It is important to understand why they have been introduced. I was a member of a local authority for 24 years up to my resignation five or six months ago. I have been involved in the compilation of a number of county development plans. Difficulties with the interpretation of this matter have resulted in the need for these guidelines. When my local authority made a very clear statement as to what we would like in the context of rural one-off housing, it was the interpretation of our plan that resulted in the Minister speaking here today on the guidelines he recently published.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The local authority also had a number of meetings to address the matter such was the frustration and the indignity of the relevant members. While I cannot speak for other local authorities, I can speak for Westmeath County Council. A number of measures were introduced and, to be fair to the management, things improved. However, while a step was taken in the right direction, there is still a considerable way to go.</P>
  
    <P>As somebody who lives in a town but who was born, bred and reared in a country area I can go back to the townland and parish just outside Kinnegad where my mother was born and reared, where 25 farming families lived in a very remote area. However, one would need the Time Team <Col N="1712"/>in that area and others around the country to find evidence of habitation. We must ask ourselves what is rural planning and who drives it? The answer is that people drive rural planning.<Miles com="jy"/>I am sick and tired of the pious platitudes<Miles com="jy"/>and the craw-thumping of certain self-styled environmentalists who tell people who were born in a rural area that they cannot live there. The message to them from the Minister and this Seanad group is that they can. Someone mentioned common sense and courtesy which is so pertinent, but when certain planners consider certain issues neither common sense nor courtesy obtains. However, that is the exception, not the rule.</P>
    <P>Rural areas are in decline. One has only to count the number of GAA clubs that have had to amalgamate in order bring out one team and the number of hurling clubs, soccer clubs and community games areas that have amalgamated just to remain in existence. It is an indication of what is happening in rural Ireland. The cause is lack of planning. Churches, post offices and schools are closing. Need I go on?</P>
    <P>I appreciate constructive criticism. There is no doubt that it is pertinent to good governance. However, destructive criticism only demonstrates a bankruptcy of alternative proposals. In this case the Government is damned if it does and damned if it does not. There were calls <i>ad nauseam</i> from both sides of the House for the Minister to come here to address the issue of planning. That has been done.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>I did not think the Senator would take the bait so soon. Senator Henry made a comment, which I partly support. It pertained to the elderly in the community. When I was a gossoon, which was a while ago, great attention was given to the care of the elderly. People looked after their elderly father or mother, their uncle or aunt at home. Now the principle of honouring father and mother, that well learned commandment of olden times, is no longer pertinent to everyday life. The moment ill-health presents, elderly people are put into the local geriatric hospital so that the health board can look after them. I am honoured to know many elderly people, the founding fathers and mothers of this State who built it up. If they want to live in rural communities they are entitled to do so and to be supported and provided with services.</P>

	<P>On water pollution, the Minister&rsquo;s guidelines are clear and concise in stating that <Col N="1713"/>everything should be subject to good planning practice. One would not expect the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to oversee the installation of a septic tank. In most cases of septic tank installation where there is what is known as impervious soil, a hydrological survey will indicate that the soil can take only so much rainfall which will then make its way to the lowest water source, most commonly a stream or a drain. That is a fair point. However, Puraflow treatment is available. One does not have to be a rocket scientist, an environmentalist or an engineer to work out the implications. We also have planning enforcement officers. We have all been members of local authorities. It is up to them to drive that situation.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>He is welcome. He is a good friend of mine when he says what should be said, but that does not happen often.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on rural planning when he stated: &ldquo;I want to emphasise again, however, that the guidelines are based on a presumption that people who have roots in or links to rural areas and are part of and contribute to the rural community, will get planning permission for houses, provided that they meet the normal planning requirements.&rdquo; That is fair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>That already covers almost every county development.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>That will not change. If we are to be practical about it, what else can be said. There must be a multi-faceted approach to this whole problem.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are specific on the issue of protecting water quality. The Minister also stated: &ldquo;Where sites are to be developed, waste water systems must be designed, installed and monitored to ensure that they operate and continue to operate to the required standards.&rdquo; That is clear and unambiguous.</P>
    <P>I could go on, but most of what I would like to say has already been said. Lack of jobs was put forward as one of the reasons for rural decline. However, we are now a very car-orientated society and many people from mine and other towns as far away as Mullingar are driving to Dublin to work. Lack of jobs, therefore, is not a <Col N="1714"/>reason in itself. The new focus that has been brought to the improvement of public transport will contribute to the regeneration of rural populations.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what begrudgers might say, in bringing forward these guidelines the Minister has responded to a clear request from local authorities and from Oireachtas Members. They are a step in the right direction. The county development plan is a reserved function of the members of local authorities. Now is the time for every local authority that is a planning authority &mdash; not all local authorities are planning authorities &mdash; to review their county development plans and stitch into them the clear message that is being given here by the Minister in these recent guidelines.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister consult. If he did not, the Opposition would say he is a dictator.</P>

	<P>We are all singing from the same hymn sheet regarding planning guidelines and trying to accommodate and facilitate people in rural communities. That is what we all want to do. Without people, there can be no communities. We have been requesting a debate on planning, rural housing and once-off housing for <Miles com="ch"/>approximately 18 months.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
    <P>The Minister and members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party stated that Fine Gael is not in favour of rural housing. That is not the truth. We are in favour of rural housing and we are trying to engage in a debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>Planning is not an exact science. We have all served on local authorities and we know about the difficulties involved in obtaining planning permission, the fights with planners, etc. We are trying to engage in a debate in order that people in rural areas will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the process which led to Fianna F&aacute;il using its recent Ard-Fheis as a local election launch pad in terms of the announcement of once-off housing. When did the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting in Sligo take place?</P>

	<P>The information provided by the Minister of State will be useful to my contribution. Preparations started in September and the outcome of the meeting to which I refer was that rural housing would be the focus.</P><Col N="1715"/>
    <P>RTE facilitated the process by placing a good spin on the issue of once-off housing in September. A few weeks later, Brian Dobson travelled to Galway to interview the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, in respect of such housing. This created momentum, expectations were heightened and people thought that there would be a relaxation of rural housing laws. Between late December and early January, a quiet time for the media, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and rural housing were the subject of a full front page report in one of the tabloids. I do not know whether it was <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i>.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a major build up and people&rsquo;s expectations were high. Everything was waiting for the Ard-Fheis to be used as the launching pad. Everyone on this side of the House was aware of what was going on.</P>
    <P>We have now been presented with the guidelines and they are only that. There is a consultative process and the guidelines are not set in stone and no legal mechanism has been created. They are only guidelines.</P>
    <P>I am a local representative and I still serve on the council. I am glad that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is not present because he would admonish me in that regard. After I was elected to the council in 1999, we formulated a county development plan which recognised the need to facilitate people in rural areas. Every item included in the guidelines announced by the Minister is already contained in that county development plan. I do not understand how the situation has been improved or matters progressed. Even though my local council has its own county development plan which facilitates people in local rural areas, these people are still being turned down for planning permission. There are various reasons for that. The guidelines will not have an impact in terms of environmental issues or matters relating to location and settlement patterns. The specifications in the guidelines will not address problems of this nature in Donegal.</P>
    <P>What is the position regarding the regional planning guidelines which will be enacted on 30 March? Do they contain a legal mechanism? As far as I understand it, under the regional planning guidelines we will not be able to tell individual local authorities how to formulate their plans. As matters stand, local authorities have the autonomy to make their own decisions within the regional framework. How can we put in place a <Col N="1716"/>blanket guideline for the entire country at central government level when the regional planning guidelines indicate that there are too many settlement criteria and pressures involved? There is a view that this matter must go back to local authorities, which will argue that it must go further to a decentralised level. The system cannot work on a centralised basis. For example, the pressures and settlement patterns which exist in the east of the country do not match those in Galway or Donegal. Each local authority has autonomy and I find it difficult to accept that the guidelines will change the pressures that exist.</P>
    <P>Under Better Local Government, we were promised additional staff and resources in respect of planning. My local authority&rsquo;s planning office is under-funded and under-resourced. A senior planner indicated last week that the staff there work until midnight. How can we relax the planning laws if the resources are not in place? I want planning restrictions to be relaxed and, as already stated, Fine Gael is in favour of one off housing. However, the Government cannot state that it is in favour of such housing if it is not prepared to provide the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>In the past year in Donegal, the most difficult thing for a local representative to do was to organise or hold a site meeting. I intend no disrespect to the planners in the county who have been snowed under by paperwork, administrative work and bureaucracy. That is the fundamental difficulty with the guidelines. We must be sensible and we must be in a position to say to local authorities that we will relax the guidelines and make it easier for people to build houses in rural areas. However, that will not happen until we provide the resources. Senator Glynn referred to this matter when he referred to the checking of plans etc.</P>
    <P>People&rsquo;s expectations have been heightened. I have received telephone calls on a daily basis since last weekend from people who were turned down for planning permission on numerous occasions and who are now determined to resubmit their applications.</P>

Senators Paddy Burke, Bannon and others from my party have been calling for this debate for a long period and it would have been good if the Minister could have remained in the House for the duration of it. I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister that we do not have the resources to implement these guidelines.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I recognise that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is obviously busy and is not in a position to be in the House. We are very fortunate to have the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy, in the House, as he comes from the very heart of rural Ireland. He is well aware of the difficulties that have surrounded planning in rural areas, especially in the west.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication of these guidelines. They are a vital element of the redevelopment and the substantial work associated with the population regeneration of rural Ireland. This is the second piece of critical work done by the Oireachtas in the past 18 months. The first piece was done on the Nice treaty soon after the elections. Anyone who lives in, comes from or has a regard for rural Ireland will agree. There is a level of consensus developing between both sides of the House. I was somewhat disappointed with the earlier contributions from the Opposition because it was an attempt to play politics while the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was here. It does nothing for those of us who have great regard for rural Ireland and the difficulties it has faced.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry understands some of the problems clearly. I do not share her view on how to answer these problems. She talked about the lack of jobs in rural areas. We are well aware of the difficulty associated with the move away from the agricultural sector and a consequent loss of jobs, something with which the Minister will be familiar. Those of us involved in the agricultural sector will be familiar with the difficulties in that regard due to the latest proposals from Brussels which will have implications for those who work on farms. We will see less people involved in farming over the next number of years. Larger farms will develop and less people will work in that environment. It is incumbent on this Government and future governments to develop a strategy for job creation in rural areas. We will soon debate the work of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in terms of job creation.</P><Col N="1718"/>
    <P>It is a chicken and egg scenario. Business people and industrialists interested in investing in Ireland tend to go where the labour market is situated, which is significantly based around large urban areas, generally on the east coast. Unless we can assure people that it will be possible to get planning permission in rural areas, it is unlikely that industrialists will want to base themselves in an area where it is virtually impossible for their workers to live.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of the urban-rural bias. Certain people in urban areas are concerned that it is their tax euro that are subventing those of us based outside the pale. Who has paid for the infrastructure projects on the east coast, such as Luas, the port tunnel and other large-scale multi-million pound projects? Senator Henry spoke about the cost associated with providing transport networks to assist people. Senator Glynn spoke about adequate levels of public transport for the elderly. The costs associated with this transport are negligible in comparison to the investment that has been made in the east coast. If we are serious as a society, as the Government is, about balanced regional development and if people on the east coast are prepared to see investment in the west, creating a counter-base on the west coast, there is a benefit to people in the cities. The more people who decide to live outside the large urban areas, the greater the capacity there is to alleviate congestion. Balanced regional development works for everyone, including the west and small communities. Senator McHugh addressed that necessity to build and develop strong communities. The only way to do this is to let people live and work in their own area. These guidelines have clearly focused on this issue.</P>
    <P>There were comments that the guidelines are an election ploy. I will not discuss it as it was addressed, but the bottom line is there will be an election every second year anyway. Should the Government do nothing for the year or should it run the country? Senator McHugh spoke about the period from September to the present, when the Minister announced these guidelines. That is five months and much work was done. The Senator will be aware of the detailed documentation surrounding these guidelines as he has an interest in this area. It was a marvellous achievement to get that amount of work done. The Minister and his officials should be complimented on the immense amount of work they have done to develop the details behind the policy statement made. What is wrong with Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers meeting in Sligo, identifying a problem and doing something about it? It shows that parliamentary democracy works and that democracy within Fianna F&aacute;il works. It shows that when we represent views to the leadership and the Cabinet they listen. I am delighted that the Cabinet and the Minister in particular have listened on this occasion and have delivered a set of guidelines which will see significant changes. In my county of Clare there <Col N="1719"/>are changes which will make it easier for people to live in the more depopulated areas, especially on the west coast. That is important as large tracts of County Clare fall within the CL&Aacute;R area because it has suffered depopulation between the two censuses. It is vitally important that areas like those in Clare are assisted to allow housing development to anyone who has a credible site, has safety measures built in and has the capacity to have acceptable percolation tests done. That is the only way people will return to rural areas.</P>
    <P>I compliment our councillors and officials in Clare who have done tremendous work in developing conditions to permit a reduction in planning refusals over the past number of years. Clare has been to the forefront in addressing many of these issues. There has not been the same level in other counties. A great difficulty for Clare County Council was the concerns expressed by An Taisce which appealed decisions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. I am delighted that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be required to observe the guidelines for its decisions. That is critical. Many councils were concerned their work would be overturned by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that created a type of big brother situation. Obviously that provision remains, as it should. It will be useful in terms of adherence to the guidelines.</P>
    <P>An Taisce has been a hobby horse of many in this House for some time, myself included. The issue of people in ivory towers dictating to those of us who live and deal with people in rural Ireland who fail to obtain planning permission is of grave concern. Such people have a genuine contribution to make to such areas. Often people in An Taisce and other organisations fortunate to buy land and obtain planning permission seek to build five mile walls around their land to ensure no one else can build in the area. That type of mentality must stop and will stop as a result of these guidelines. They will cause a seismic shift in terms of assumptions associated with the delivery of planning. The assumption now will be that one is entitled to planning permission rather than that one is not entitled to it. Many issues such as safety and so on remain to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;bungalow blitz&rdquo; coined by <i>The Irish Times</i> resurfaced at the weekend. On the one hand, the Opposition, for its own reasons, is saying the guidelines will have no real effect and will not improve the lot of people seeking planning. On the other hand, <i>The Irish Times</i> tells us there will be a bungalow blitz, with little bungalows mushrooming all over the country. There is obviously a gap somewhere in the middle.</P>
    <P>The Minister has included in the guidelines a reference to the use of natural products and materials in local areas. Local authorities have made some sensible decisions over the past number of years in terms of the quality of design and insistence on design in particular areas blending in with the natural background. Another issue not mentioned in the guidelines is the safety <Col N="1720"/>aspect of site specific issues. This matter needs to be addressed. Many people are refused planning because their proposed house would be too close to a turn in the road or because the site is unsuitable. There is a need to put pressure on the professionals who draw up plans for houses and undertake site surveys. We must pressurise such professionals to recognise a difficulty in advance rather than submitting an application which is in breach of certain guidelines, thereby leaving local representatives to deal with the problem. Perhaps the Minister would consider establishing a code of practice or guidelines for professionals involved in this area.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of holiday home developments in County Clare given the nature of its tourism. Such developments, some along the west coast, which are tax designated probably do no good for the area in terms of aesthetics. They are utilised for a short time during the summer months which provides some positive impact. I welcome the provisions relating to the development of such holiday homes in a cluster rather than a fragmented formation. That would help to overcome some of the concerns raised by Senator Henry as regards one-off holiday homes which do nothing for a community. Many Senators have expressed concerns on this issue. However, the Minister has dealt with the matter sensibly.</P>
    <P>The guidelines form part of the overall approach to the national spatial strategy and that is to be welcomed. It shows a type of cohesive approach to regional development. Previously, a site located in an SAC or NHA was automatically excluded from planning. That provision created many difficulties for farmers throughout the country. Farmers were unable to go ahead with planning as a result of that designation. In many cases, such areas were so designated against the will of the farmer concerned and often rendered his or her land useless. Under the new guidelines, such planning will be permitted and that is helpful.</P>
    <P>Another hobby horse is the idea that the only time a farmer should be allowed to build on his land is when the dwelling is for his son or daughter. I have a fundamental objection in this regard. Many small farmers with sites that have a little road frontage might wish to sell off a site to obtain money to educate their children. There is nothing wrong with that. I am against locking people into situations where they can build a house on their land for only one child. They should be permitted to build whether they have five, ten or 15 children. However, a farmer with 15 children would end up with a pretty big village and would probably have to seek some other type of designation. That is an important issue. We all know people in rural Ireland who have sold a site to educate their family or to get out of a financial crisis.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;they say that this document contains little that is new. I have just had a telephone call regarding two planning permissions in County Carlow.</P>

	<P>Did the Senator succeed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>No. The reality is that this document will make no difference in such cases. Were it not for the Famine and ensuing emigration, our population would be approximately 21 million. We are unable to plan for a population of less than five million people. Senator McHugh raised some very valid points. Planning departments throughout the country are completely stretched. Why are they not receiving extra resources? Will the Government, at this late stage, provide them with extra resources?</P>
    <P>Carlow has a massive turnover of planners, so much so that one genuinely would not know who deals with planning because every time one telephones, one planner is leaving and another is arriving. That problem is duplicated throughout the country. Unfortunately, the side effect of that is that advice obtained from one planner is contradicted by another and an application is often refused for a completely different reason. That is happening all the time and it is totally unfair. We need consistency. We must examine the terms and conditions under which our planners work. They are under tremendous pressure. Most of them are leaving for the private sector where they can earn more money for far less hours. I am not surprised to hear Senator McHugh&rsquo;s comments about planners in Donegal working until midnight.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator McHugh about the one glove not fitting all mentality is true. Carlow is a small county, the northern area of which from Hackettstown to Tullow is under enormous pressure from Dublin. Many people from Dublin not wishing to live full time in Carlow would build houses there if its housing policy were more relaxed. However, that would not be appropriate in my view. Areas such as Bagnelstown and Borris would welcome such housing developments because their population is decreasing.</P>
    <P>I am wary of this measure. We take a common sense approach to planning in Carlow but, if anything, these guidelines might restrict us even more. That view has been expressed to me by independent sources in Carlow.</P><Col N="1722"/>
    <P>This Government&rsquo;s record on housing is atrocious. It was the same Minister who abolished the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant without any warning but the Fianna F&aacute;il Members have conveniently forgotten that. That measure had a huge impact on young couples. The Government also increased VAT on building products by 1%, which had a huge impact on building, and it has now increased development levies which will have a major impact on people building their own homes. On the Government&rsquo;s record on affordable housing, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, admitted in a reply to a D&aacute;il question from Deputy Allen that not one foundation for affordable housing has been laid so far this year, out of 10,000 houses promised.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh referred to 60,000 units having been built so far this year but he failed to mention that half of those are for investors. Even the Minister for Finance has grave difficulty with that area and had planned to cut back on the tax reliefs on housing but did not do it in the budget. The Government&rsquo;s record is atrocious in this area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State clarify with the Minister whether Fianna F&aacute;il is now recommending that those who were refused planning permission in the past two or three years should now reapply? That is a straightforward question and it will be the proof of the pudding as to whether this measure will work. Is Fianna F&aacute;il recommending that those people should reapply for planning permission? If so, we will see where we are in eight or nine weeks time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be the test.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It depends on what they will get&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brennan is introducing new factors now. I am asking a straightforward question. Fianna F&aacute;il is promoting this measure as if it will allow everyone to live in rural Ireland when it knows in reality that the same problems will exist. We all know we will get many telephone calls, as Senator McHugh and everyone else is getting, from people who have been refused in the past and who will be extremely disappointed. I suspect, however, that they will be disappointed after the local and European elections when they have given their vote to Fianna F&aacute;il and cannot reverse their decision. Unfortunately, they will not realise they were conned until then. The story of the emperor with no clothes comes to mind when I hear people speak here.</P>
    <P>Carlow has one of the lowest development levies in the country. That is because we have a Fine Gael-led council since 1985. We have worked very well with Labour but if Fianna F&aacute;il had the chair, the charges would be much higher, like those in Kilkenny. Is the Minister of State aware of a recent case involving a constituent of mine from Carlow who is building in Kildare? <Col N="1723"/>Kildare brought in new development levies on 24 February and a decision was due in this gentleman&rsquo;s case on 18 February under the old development levy system. On the week his planning decision was due, however, he got a letter seeking further information from the council and he is now liable for the higher development levy &mdash; in this case an additional &euro;13,000. That is wrong and unfair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the council to decide.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reality of the issue. I ask the Minister of State to investigate that case because if someone makes a planning application before the deadline but the council has a difficulty about which it informs the person at the last minute, it is unfair to push him into the new development levy period where he has to pay extra charges. That is totally unfair and in fairness to those on the Fianna F&aacute;il side, they could not stand over that. I ask the Minister of State to investigate that.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fail&rsquo;s record in this area is atrocious, going back to 1977 and the abolition of rates, which has starved local government of funding and has led to the various development levies being brought in. In years to come, people will be very bitter. They are currently paying development levies but are being told not to worry about it. I understand that under the local amenities heading the provision of footpaths, lights, benches etc. is being considered but in a few years time when the people involved are settled in their new houses and there is no sign of these amenities coming into the area, they will question where the money went and will suddenly realise they have been conned.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I read this document. I have been in a council for 18 years and of all the issues raised the most vexatious for any public representative is that of planning. If anybody analyses the various requests they get during a week they will find the largest number of requests relate to planning. In many cases we give advice and try to expedite and facilitate the planning process but I would like to compliment the planning department in my own county, and Senator Brennan would be aware of this, which is over-stretched but whose staff are very tolerant and understanding.</P>
    <P>We take up issues but we may disagree on occasions with the advice from the professional planners. In many cases in the past people who became planners were civil engineers who probably took a more realistic approach and understood the councillors better with regard to planning and design. When people become planners directly after leaving university, obviously they have a good deal of theory which they then try to translate into rural thinking. That often initiates a clash with the person applying for <Col N="1724"/>planning permission and leads us to get advice from people at a senior level within the office with a view to teasing out the various roadblocks.</P>
    <P>If we want to analyse the reason for planning application refusals in many cases we must recognise that they revolve around one aspect. If the health board advises that the percolation quality and the site is not suitable, no change in sustainable rural housing will amend that situation. We cannot be threatened by the European Union with regard to the contamination of ground water and in a situation where professional advice goes against this, the Minister would be putting his head on the block if he felt we should give contrary advice to put in a biocycle or septic tank system which could lead to contamination of water.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where refusals occur. In large urban areas like Limerick county there is a pressure area, of which Senator Brennan would be aware, and in that case severe restrictions are imposed by the council officials. In many cases those restrictions have to be imposed because that pressure zone would be regarded as suburbia in Limerick city, where in every small cul-de-sac there is an extension of houses. There is reference in the guidelines to the fact that the Minister is not encouraging ribbon development. What, therefore, are the planners doing wrong in refusing people in those situations? Not a lot if they are conforming to the new regulations.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the planners in Limerick County Council and I will give the House a classic example of where I argued on behalf of a person whose site is regarded in planning terms as being 300 metres from a junction. There is a bend on the junction. The farmer owns all the hedgerow on one side and is prepared to take away as much of that as possible but it was pointed out to me that if the planners are to interpret the new guidelines correctly, and the officials might take notice of this, many issues will arise in regard to hedgerow landscaping and retaining the rural profile. Where a degree of flexibility existed in the past, that flexibility could be constrained if the planners implement these guidelines. Often the practice was to ask the next-door neighbour to help by removing part of their hedgerow in order to make it possible for the person to get planning permission for the site. I now understand from the officials that such flexibility will no longer exist. One could say a constraint is being put on that person.</P>
    <P>Another constraint is that in the pressure zone area it is stipulated that one has to live in the house for five years but the Minister&rsquo;s guidelines refer to seven years. Where would the flexibility be in such cases? In his contribution the Minister made an issue of the fact that schools and shops were closing down. That is happening in small rural communities and in villages because during the Celtic tiger period, about which I have spoken a number of times, a functional sewerage scheme was not put into operation in particular locations. The planners will say that the only way to revive <Col N="1725"/>and sustain those villages is by putting in place proper sewerage schemes. It does not matter if there is ribbon development alongside it because if the soakage does not suit, the houses will not be built, regardless of the willingness or flexibility of the planners.</P>
    <P>I am sure Limerick County Council mirrors every local authority at this stage where the biggest months of the year for planning applications are January and February because on 5 April next, the increased planning and development fee comes into operation. People are aware of that. In our county they pay a development fee of &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,800. From 1 April it will be &euro;2,700 and from 1 September it will be &euro;3,500. They are already paying the charge, but they want to avoid paying the excess amount involved and want to have applications approved before April. Meanwhile, planners are stretched to the limit. They are currently deliberating and pondering over the new guidelines to see whether they will change the whole process.</P>
    <P>I listened to the debate from which we should remove raw emotion. We can all get emotional on this issue. I would be conscious of the arguments and would want people to build, as much as possible, in rural Ireland. Will house building expand dramatically? This might solve a situation for Senator Dooley in Clare or on the coastline where applications have been rejected because the view of the Shannon would have been impeded. People may now get permission in areas where planners were not amenable in the past. That will happen as changes are modified from county to county in line with the interpretation of planners.</P>
    <P>I cannot see a dramatic change, however, as regards the counties I am involved in. I would agree entirely with Senator Dooley&rsquo;s assertion that a farmer should not be confined in his or her application to obtaining permission for a son or a daughter to build on his land. I encountered a farmer recently who wanted to sell a site because two members of his family were at third level. He found it impossible to educate them. He wanted to obtain permission for just one site to sustain his children in third level. That would have taken much of the financial burden off him and was a reasonable point. He was not successful, but he may be considered for another site on that land, which could rectify the situation for him.</P>
    <P>I could go on for much longer but I hope this initiative improves the situation although I am somewhat sceptical as to whether it will.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy. Having listened to the excellent debate this evening and heard the views of people from all parties in my own county, it is clear there is a general welcome for the decision to allow more proper development to occur in rural areas. At present, approximately one third of the population lives in the countryside. People want <Col N="1726"/>to continue to live in rural areas. Steps must be taken to support the future development of such communities.</P>
    <P>Houses can be built in back gardens on small areas of land throughout Dublin and in urban areas, but families with a substantial acreage have not been allowed to build a home for a son or daughter. That had to be addressed. Only people with roots and links to rural areas will get planning permission in certain regions. This will prevent an influx of people seeking to build holiday homes in more scenic parts of the country, without depriving local people of the opportunity to continue to live in an area. It is each local authority&rsquo;s responsibility to define those who will be entitled to build houses because they are part of the rural community, including farmers, their sons and daughters and persons taking over the ownership and running of farms, as well as people who have lived most of their lives in a particular area. Other people to qualify will include those who work full-time or part-time in rural areas such as teachers, forestry and marine workers and those involved in other rural-based occupations. The case for all people who want to work and live in rural areas must be examined on its merits. Those who receive planning permission to build homes will contribute to the local community and will help to revive rural life. That must be considered as a positive development.</P>
    <P>New houses will continue to be designed to integrate well into the physical surroundings and be compatible with the conservation of the sensitive areas such as natural habitats. That is important and has been covered today in the Minister&rsquo;s speech. However, special areas of conservation, SACs, special protected areas, SPAs, and natural heritage areas, NHAs, will not, <i>per se</i>, justify blanket refusals for one-off housing applications. This is welcome. There are parts of the country with substantial areas designated as NHAs, SACs etc. that are merely proposed as being suitable for this purpose, without having been formally approved as such by Brussels. Local authorities have been refusing planning permissions in such areas and this needs to be examined. Even farmers have been unable to build on their own land because of such proposed NHAs or SPAs.</P>
    <P>This initiative will help to revive areas and communities that suffer persistent and substantial population decline. In such areas people without roots in the locality will be accommodated in order to provide a social and economic boost and help rebuild the rural community. Everyone is in favour of preserving our ground water, which is the envy of most countries in the world. The new guidelines will help to protect our water and to ensure it is of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities now need to examine their development plans to ensure they are in line with the Government&rsquo;s proposals. Some speakers have argued that their county&rsquo;s development plan is in line with them. Nonetheless, in many parts of the <Col N="1727"/>country such plans inhibit development in rural areas and the public representatives who introduced them have a responsibility in this<?oasys _jy?>area.</P>
    <P>I support An Taisce in certain ways, but it has shown a blatant disregard for Government policy on rural housing. Public representatives of all political persuasions who have sought planning permission for deserving families have simply been opposed without An Taisce, in many instances, even inspecting the sites. Its representatives even went into the local authorities to see the site maps and house plans and successfully appealed against them to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. In my opinion city dwellers in An Taisce should not be able to dictate how rural communities live. Guidelines should be about making the best use of the available natural resources and should guide people in the planning decisions they make, not rule out development and create a rural wilderness. An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s rejection of 75% of planning applications previously approved by local authorities leaves much to be desired. All public representatives are aware of inspectors going to sites and recommending planning permission; yet for some strange reason An Bord Plean&aacute;la refuses them. One wonders why and for what reason, given the expertise involved in such recommendations.</P>
    <P>There have been situations where An Bord Plean&aacute;la has had to take the decisions it did because the application was for an inappropriate type of house at an inappropriate location. It was probably right in this.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The Government is working to retain as many rural families on the land as is sustainable. The national spatial strategy lists sustaining and renewing established rural communities as one of the four broad objectives of the sustainable rural settlement policy. It also states as a general principle that rural-generated housing needs should be accommodated in the areas where they arise. The national spatial strategy also distinguishes between rural housing needs for rural communities and rural housing sought by urban dwellers and second-home owners. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has proposed taking into account that the majority of rural dwellers are either farmers or directly dependent on farming. Less than 8% of the population is engaged in farming.</P>

   <Title>Appointments to Semi-State Bodies: Motion.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
    <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Government to reform the practice of making political appointments to semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This motion addresses the issue of political appointments to semi-State bodies. The Minister has had responsibility for certain such bodies in <Col N="1728"/>the past and will know they are very peculiar creatures. For the purposes of this debate, they have two relevant characteristics which I would like to point out. The first is that, although they are on the whole called commercial semi-State bodies, they are not exclusively commercially driven. The second is that the majority of board members are appointed by the Minister in charge of the relevant Department. This evening I ask whether those people are appointed on merit or because of loyalty to a political party. I am glad that the Minister is here as he has some experience of this. I recall going through a Bill with him in this House some years ago and him assuring us that the relevant body would not, when set up, provide an appointment for someone associated with a political party. Subsequently, a Mr. Jim Lacey was appointed chairman of the board, a man not unknown to Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Anyone watching the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on television will have seen, to his great credit, Mr. Hugh Byrne, an ex-Minister for Fianna F&aacute;il in the last Government. He turned up as chairmen of Bord Iascaigh Mhara on a very nice salary and with very nice perks. It was quite obviously a consolation prize for loss of office. However, Mr. Byrne let the cat out of the bag. He let it be known on that programme that there was of course cronyism in Irish politics, that positions on semi-State companies were used as rewards for political loyalty and that many of those on the boards were not qualified. I know that it was ungrateful of him to say such things to his employers and political masters, but it was true. No doubt Mr. <Col N="1729"/>Byrne can say goodbye to his political career, but he no doubt had that sussed by the time he made his comments.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Leyden for his interruption. He is absolutely right that all parties have practised that. The abuse of semi-State bodies and State agencies has existed since the State began. It is the oldest game in town.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It happened before the State began.</P>

   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mansergh will no doubt also get such a position when he loses his seat. He should not worry, for he will be well looked after. The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, has looked after lesser people than the Senator. He would even secure such an appointment on the basis of some talent.</P>

	<P>The Senator should not presume that I will be losing anything.</P>

   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>All parties have engaged in this practice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>And Independent Newspapers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator Ross to continue without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>One need only look at VHI. One could hardly wander down its corridors without bumping into a Fine Gael trustee, because they were on the board. The system is abused by Labour, the Progressive Democrats and everyone, but it is time it ended because semi-State bodies and the political process suffer. There is deep public cynicism about the practice, and that is proper. Under the last coalition Government, as the Minister, Deputy Ahern, said in the D&aacute;il the other day, there was the three-two-one rule, where three seats went to Fine Gael on a semi-State board, two to Labour, and one to the Democratic Left. Piety from this side will be difficult to take.</P>
    <P>However, we had a motion here about a year ago from Fine Gael, whose members are now converts to the cause I espouse tonight. That was greatly to their credit, as it was difficult for them. They came out against the prison visitors abuse. They came out and said that it must end as it was given only on the basis of mileage. No doubt, when Fine Gael and Labour get into Government, that abuse will end. It will be difficult as it has been ruthlessly used by all parties to promote their friends and relations and give them a small income as a consolation for loss of office or as a reward for work they did for the party.</P>
    <P>This is not a practice of which we should be proud. I will not go into the excesses of the Labour Party in 1993 in any great detail.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1730"/>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have sufficient time, but I may touch on the matter in my summing up. The Labour Party was as culpable as the Fianna F&aacute;il Party at that time, promoting their friends and relations to jobs, and also creating jobs for them which are now a constant embarrassment and which cost the party the 1997 general election. That was a high price to pay, but ultimately people were waiting for the Labour Party and took it out on this point. Such behaviour may bring short-term political gain but creates long-term political loss.</P>
    <P>Some of the boards are worse than others, and some of the practices on some of the boards are worse than others. Aer Lingus has traditionally been given as a perk to people who have shown immense loyalty to a party. It is of course not coincidental that they receive free first-class travel around the world for themselves and their spouses. That is one of the perks of office and it is well known that friends of the Taoiseach have appeared on the Aer Lingus board. For a long time Aer Rianta looked to some extent like a meeting of a Fianna F&aacute;il national executive, with Mr. Noel Hanlon and Mr. Dermot O&rsquo;Leary, who both have very strong Fianna F&aacute;il credentials, Mr. Tadhg O&rsquo;Donoghue and others sitting there and no doubt deciding the future of Aer Rianta on the basis not only of their great skills, which were in doubt, but their loyalty to the Government.</P>
    <P>We must ask whether taxpayers&rsquo; money is being used for the reward of political loyalty or the good of taxpayers and the companies about which we are talking. There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that it is being used as a reward for political loyalty. The evidence for that is very clear. Let us examine what happens to those companies when they come from the semi-State sector into the IPOs as with Eircom. As the Leader is well aware, in that case several members of that board were removed very skilfully. One rather stubbornly and stupidly refused to go and made something of a fool of himself by doing so. It was necessary to remove a large number of those board members from the semi-State body because no investors from the commercial sector would have confidence in them. Where that happened, they appointed people in whom it was perceived the commercial sector would have more confidence. The Leader did the same when she was Minister, when she appointed Mr. Tom Mulcahy, which was a fine appointment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He was independent. I appointed him to get Aer Lingus out of a hole.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>He was a fine appointment as chairman of Aer Lingus. However, the reason for these changes in the Aer Lingus board is not unrelated to the fact that boards must have a commercial ethos when they are to be sold. One cannot afford to appoint patently political people if the company is to be sold off. In order to get a company into the private sector, board members <Col N="1731"/>must be appointed on pure merit, not on political-merit grounds.</P>
    <P>The universities are a subject dear to my heart. As a result of the Universities Bill, political appointments are now made to their boards. One political appointment is made to the University of Dublin board and that appointment was made by the previous Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. However, despite incredible promises made here during the passage of the Universities Bill and despite the Bill stating that there must be consultation with the provost, that appointment was made without any consultation with Trinity College Dublin or the University of Dublin. The appointment was made by the Minister willy-nilly and the university was informed of it. Apart from anything else, that was a breach of the law. It was also a blatant political appointment of someone who was not unlinked with the political party of the then Minister Deputy Woods, and indeed his constituency.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I come to the issue of signing out information about these people. It is extraordinarily difficult to elicit information from the relevant Department and annual reports about them. If I, or any Member asks for documentation about them, we will get some fig-leaf type documents listing their qualifications. One piece of information not given out is that they are members of a political party to which they have given great service throughout their lives. For example, if we went through the list of the Aer Rianta board members, we would think none of them had ever been in politics, yet some of them have spent their lives therein. If we went through An Post annual reports we would see the same. The one thing these board members are ashamed of is that they have been involved in political activity. Why should they be ashamed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1732"/>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>They never tell anybody about it. Why are they so ashamed? Why do they not say outright that they are Fianna F&aacute;il activists, as happens in the case of An Post for instance? This information is hidden from the public because these people are primarily appointed because of their loyalty to the party. However, they do not want people to think that. These people keep popping up on different types of boards.</P>
    <P>Some people say the payment for being a member of a board is too little. They ask why anybody would do the work for such pay and say that people only do it as a public service. What is wrong with &euro;10,000 per year? I know &euro;380 million was a pittance, Senator Mansergh, but &euro;10,000 a year is not a pittance to many people. It is a lot of money and well worth picking up. If it is worth picking up expenses as a prison visitor, it is worth picking up &euro;10,000 a year. Some people pick up several &euro;10,000 sums a year, all of whom were, coincidentally, appointed by Ministers. The same people cannot get a job or appointment in the private sector but they keep popping up on semi-State bodies. Why is this?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is untrue and very unfair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an abuse to which we must put an end. I hope Fine Gael and the Labour Party will pledge this evening that if they return to power&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not hold his breath.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;they will set up a commission, accept a verdict of the Civil Service Commission or agree to set up a system whereby public hearings will be held to examine what qualifications these people have. Everybody who is selected for a semi-State body, and I do not suggest that being a member of a political party should bar a person from membership of a board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is actually what the Senator suggests.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at all. This is the sort of misrepresentation I expect to hear from the other side of the House. That is not what I suggest. I suggest board members should come before hearings of, perhaps, this House and the D&aacute;il, or of suitable independent bodies and answer questions so that we have transparency in these appointments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be in favour of that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has some neck in proposing its amendment. It has some neck to congratulate itself on corporate governance. This Government is as bad as any other although there have been one or two changes recently in preparation for possible IPOs. The Government is as bad or worse as any other in promoting its <Col N="1733"/>friends and relations to positions of influence on semi-State bodies. To come in this evening and say how wonderfully it has done in terms of corporate governance is brass-neck hypocrisy. We must see people of talent appointed to semi-State bodies, not political hacks and cronies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and compliment Senator Ross on proposing it a second time. I also seconded the first proposal but on that occasion it did not come to a full discussion in the House.</P>
    <P>I lament the Government amendment. I remind the Government side that Senator Ross&rsquo;s earlier motion, which I was happy and proud to sign, was far stronger. Now he is calling for reform but, apparently, the Government sees no case at all for reform. That is worrying. The Government side goes into this paean of praise for the current defective situation. I will prove the current situation is defective and that the Leader knows this and acted to remedy it during the Eircom flotation. That is clear from the record and no question about it.</P>
    <P>When we prate about openness, transparency and accountability, and then move in a manner which obfuscates the situation and removes these from public life, we have cause to worry. There is no doubt that some good appointments are made. However, there is a question of perception. I will place the perception of a fine columnist before the House. On 19 January 2002 he wrote in an article:</P>
    <P LI="1">Wanted: Someone to attend a working lunch once every five weeks. Remuneration &euro;13,000 a year, plus expenses. Free personal use of company services available. No experience required. Party activists, preferably male, need only apply. (In fact, don&rsquo;t ask us; we&rsquo;ll ask you.)</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What newspaper was that in?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was in <i>The Irish Times</i>. This perception of cronyism is clearly true in certain circumstances. I will give an example but will remove the name, although it has been supplied to me. A member of the Fianna F&aacute;il ruling executive, whose expertise was in cranes rather than planes, is a perfect example of a political appointee whose fortunes as regards State directorships swing with those of his party. He was appointed to the board of Aer Lingus in October 1992, under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, and was later made chairman of CIE by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Cowen, in 1994. A year later he was controversially dropped from the post when the rainbow coalition came into power. However, in November 1997 when Fianna F&aacute;il returned to power he was reappointed. That is what happens. It is swings and roundabouts.</P>
    <P>There is also a suspicion that the planting of these people on boards creates a kind of Trojan horse situation which leaves behind a permanent Government &mdash; a spy in the cab syndrome. In the <Col N="1734"/>case of Aer Lingus, six non-executive directors on the board were prominent Fianna F&aacute;il activists. One person whom I will not name was appointed to the Seanad for three weeks so that he could avail of car parking privileges for life.</P>
    <P>There is a problem which has been recognised in the neighbouring island where, unlike us, they have moved to address the situation. They instituted the office of a commissioner for public appointments in order to ensure the most appropriate people with the best skill mix are appointed and that the public does not suspect them of being appointed merely on the basis of their political background. In a recent report of the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee entitled, Governing By Appointment; Opening Up The Patronage State, it was stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">The creation of the post of Commissioner for Public Appointments, combined with independent assessment in every department, has brought greater integrity to these processes. Overall, there has been both considerable improvement in public appointments system in recent years.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It goes on to make further recommendations. That is the parliamentary system on which we model ourselves. It has seen fit to take action precisely because of the kind of thing Senator Ross has so clearly laid before the House; the fundraisers, party activists, party advisers, former Ministers, failed candidates and friends of these people who are all stuffed on to these boards.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to Trinity College, or Dublin University, to give it its correct title.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what he called it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the justification for having an externally appointed member of the college board because of the large amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money involved. The taxpayer is entitled to have somebody there to report back. That is a principle I can support, but it must be done in an open, transparent and clear way. If universities become independent then such appointments should no longer be made.</P>
    <P>As a former academic I have experience of the views of the other universities about the persons and qualifications of those persons who are stuck onto their boards. They do not greatly care for the way in which it is done, nor do they greatly respect the people involved.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address another issue, which I am sure my colleague, Senator Henry, will also look at, and which must be put on the record of the House. It concerns the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and the problems in regard to it, about which we had many debates in the House. Let us look at what happened in terms of political appointees in that case. It was exposed <Col N="1735"/>in a series of articles, most notably by Fintan O&rsquo;Toole, within the past week. A learned and excellent professor whom I will not name but who, unusually in these circumstances, was a woman, was appointed head of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board. In this most critical and sensitive area she rapidly came up against the difficulty of appointments of a political nature by the Government. She contacted the Minister and pointed out the serious skills deficiencies in the board which were not being made up by those who were being appointed politically. She identified gaps in skills and competencies and she made attempts to meet the Minister to discuss the matter. A couple of meetings were arranged but were cancelled at the last minute. She never got to meet him. I quote from one of the letters written by her to the Minister. It states:</P>
    <P LI="1">We were informed of the appointments you made which gave the board a competency profile as follows: seven medical consultants; one employee of your Department; one building society marketing executive; one retired hotelier; one university registrar; one hospital manager. You will observe that, <i>inter alia</i>, we have no audit, finance, HR, legal, pensions, transfusion medicine, pharmaceutical grade manufacturing, blood user or strategy expertise. I am concerned at these gaps.</P>
    <P FLI="0">They were never made up. We dealt with the consequences of the incompetence of that board in the House and its dereliction of duty. What did we then do? We stuffed it with all these dummies. That is a serious thing to have done. It is unconscionable that this should happen. Senator Ross is 100% right in terms of the motion he tabled.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a Member of the House, a good friend of mine and somebody whose <Miles com="jy"/>career I respect, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke. The public perception, as exemplified in a newspaper article, was that a flurry of appointments was made by her prior to her leaving the Department. It is not just the Leader, it is part of the system. I would prefer if her reputation was protected from it, but let us face the truth.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris should wait to hear what I have to say.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Governments of every hue engage in this last minute practice. When an election is lost, its prime objective is to place its own people onto boards before it goes out of office. It is a scandal and it brings government into disrepute.</P>

	<P>One sometimes hears reservations expressed about democracy in this State. There is a feeling that people ought to have a stake in the country or that the best people, however defined, have to be appointed. I am glad to say we have an egalitarian democracy and people from all walks of life and different levels of expertise can represent us on these bodies. I am very proud, as I believe most of us are, of the semi-State sector. It played a crucial part in the economic development of the country at a time when the private sector was deeply conservative and quite unable to carry forward the development of the country. Many of those involved came from the old order. If one considers companies such as the ESB, Aer Lingus and the Great Southern chain, which was mentioned this morning, RTE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Train.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, some of the train services are very good also, although I accept that not all of them are. The vast majority of the organisations I mentioned made a major contribution to the economic life of the country and still do. One should judge governance by its results.</P>
    <P>Prisons were mentioned. There is a great prison reform programme in place, which will involve the building of new prisons. I dare say that the <Col N="1738"/>prison visiting committees have something to do with that.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Ministers make nominations from many different sources. Some appointments they make are on the recommendation of particular bodies or sectors. Therefore, all appointments are not at Ministers&rsquo; discretion.</P>
    <P>It is important that appointees to boards broadly share the objectives of the Government and are of like mind with it. The Leader, when she was a Minister, had some difficulties with one semi-State company, whose staff had a very different political philosophy and wanted to run a particular public enterprise in a very different way from her, which would have led to constant confrontation with unions, etc.</P>
    <P>In some cases, Ministers appoint a civil<Miles com="jy"/>servant. One can have excellent professional qualifications and nonetheless be a supporter of a political party. Equally, one will find examples of people of merit from other parties who are kept on even though their party is not in power. I noticed recently that the Minister for Agriculture and Food appointed Alan Dukes, a very distinguished person, to head a body looking into the future of agriculture. I am sure he receives some remuneration for this and I am all in favour of that. The idea that one cannot have independence of mind because one has a party affiliation is open to question. The reward in question is very small. Consider the way directors of private companies reward themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address the Chair. These people do not belong to any golden circle. In many cases, public sector governance compares remarkably well to private sector governance and, to be fair to Senator Ross, he sometimes makes this point in his <i>Sunday Independent</i> column. He is not uncritical of the private sector in that regard.</P>
    <P>Of course political affiliation should not be the sole or the main criterion.</P>

	<P>We all know many people who are constantly lobbying for State appointments and who are unsuccessful. One must have and should have qualifications. If there are examples in which this is not the case, attention should be drawn to them.</P>
    <P>On higher education, I had a meeting with some heads of universities recently and they told me the problem was not with the political appointees, because they actually made a good contribution, but with some of the vested interests within the university. This motion is extraordinarily simplistic. We should thank most of those who give good public service. They work for bodies for remarkably little reward and, in nine cases out of ten, do so out of a sense of public service.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that political patronage flourishes in Fianna F&aacute;il, as it has always done. The Progressive Democrats are not too far behind in this regard. As Senator Ross has stated, Fine Gael and Labour indulged in this practice when in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>And Democratic Left.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but not in such a blatant manner as this Government and its predecessor. Regardless of whether appointments to port authorities, semi-State bodies, prison visiting committees or other bodies are in question, the <Col N="1740"/>age of dishing out jobs for the boys and girls is alive and well. On a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on RTE a former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister of State said the bottom line was whether a person was &ldquo;one of theirs&rdquo; before he or she could be appointed to any political board. So much for ability, knowledge and job experience. So much for accountability and transparency. There is nothing but blatant cronyism and political patronage for party hacks who toe the line for the Minister. Senator Mansergh has just said that one must have people who will do this.</P>
    <P>A token independent-minded person may be appointed from time to time but the party grip on many of these bodies will be maintained, as has been stated. Surely it is time to take stock and call a halt to these practices. Picking the best and most qualified person should surely be the prerequisite for any appointment rather than ascertaining whether the appointee is a member of Fianna F&aacute;il or the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I was looking at letters recently and when I saw a letter from the Taoiseach asking the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider the wife of a Fianna F&aacute;il public representative when making an appointment to a committee, I noted that the practice is being condoned and encouraged from the very top in Fianna F&aacute;il. My party obtained copies of further letters under the Freedom of Information Act indicating that the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs, and other Ministers and Ministers of State, are not slow in making representations on behalf of party activists who wish to be appointed to State bodies and committees.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are also quick off the mark in this respect. Letters on file from the programme manager for the T&aacute;naiste indicate the same amount of representations are made on behalf of members of that party.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Cummins for sharing time. This Government has made over 600 appointments to State boards since its re-election. Fianna F&aacute;il and PD supporters are very conspicuous on prison visiting committees, harbour boards, semi-State companies, regulatory agencies and national advisory boards. I was shocked when it first came to my notice within the last fortnight that in some parts of the country the Progressive Democrats is offering the carrot of appointment to boards to attract candidates into that party.</P>

This is followed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform whose numerous appointments have been primarily to prison visiting committees. I have concrete evidence that a prominent Fianna F&aacute;il county councillor made representations to the Taoiseach on behalf of his wife with regard to her re-appointment to a visiting committee of a Dublin training unit. Another prominent politician, a Member of this House, having lost her seat in the last general election appointed new members to the boards of major semi-State bodies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Be it in business or appointing directors to companies, there is a system whereby people apply according to their knowledge, <Col N="1746"/>experience and suitability.

That is how it should be <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> an executive authority, that is the Government, making the same types of approaches, and that is how it must be.

	<P>Why is the Senator doing so?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The real issue is the appointment of incompetent and poorly qualified people to many boards. While many good people serve on boards, there is no way to evaluate people&rsquo;s capacity to contribute to any board. The fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform <Col N="1748"/>has finally reformed that most appalling of systems, the appointments to prison visiting committees, is not worthy of congratulation. It should have been done 40 years ago. There are all kinds of bodies to which people seek appointment.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding my reservations, this is the most innocuous of motions, which is why I cannot understand why it has not been signed by all the Independent Senators. It calls for Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;to reform the practice&rdquo;. Does anybody really believe it could not be done better with a degree of transparency, openness and evaluation? Even if the credentials of prospective members had to be looked at and they were required to outline their knowledge and expertise to some body of the Houses of the Oireachtas, they would not have to do so. I know of cases of appointments to State bodies that are in the gift of a Minister, where the first that people heard was on receipt of a letter asking them to serve. In one instance, because of place of residence, the person concerned could accumulate at least &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 a year in travel expenses alone. If I were to mention the name, Members would wonder what expertise the individual had.</P>
    <P>Not only should a person&rsquo;s political affiliations not inhibit his or her membership, but in the case of my party and given its world view, many State bodies should make it a requirement that people with sympathies with my party are appointed to their boards to ensure that some of the daftness of the so-called private enterprise ethos in this country was dealt with. It follows, therefore, that boards need to contain members who have a view of the world that conforms with the Government&rsquo;s. I have no problem with this, provided they can do the job properly, their perks are not excessive, their roles are clear and they are governed by the proper rules of corporate governance. All of this could be done under the motion.</P>
    <P>However this Government, dominated by Fianna F&aacute;il, has a brass neck asking us to accept an amendment which &ldquo;acknowledges and endorses a commitment to good governance in semi-State bodies&rdquo; even as in the other House it is dismantling the Local Appointments Commission to ensure its cronies can be appointed on a town by town, locality by locality basis bypassing the well established objective system of the Local Appointments Commission. It cannot explain why it is taking apart this system that worked. However, we know why. It will allow it to do even more.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats show great naivety in believing it could reform a party whose only <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> is patronage. If Fianna F&aacute;il were ever out of Government for successive terms of office, the party would fall apart as it has no <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> other than the provision and dispensing of patronage on a grand scale.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>About 40 years ago that party forgot why it had been established. It spent the next ten years reminiscing about why it had been founded and 30 years ago it decided it had only one objective, which was to get into power. It determined that the best way to get into and stay in power was to provide patronage. It decided not to establish an agency to look after emigrants, as there is no point in providing patronage abroad. They do not have votes and, if they had, they would not vote for Fianna F&aacute;il. Why would Fianna F&aacute;il bother with an agency to look after emigrants? Why would it be interested in an agency whose work would be abroad? What is significant here is not a perfectly harmless motion, which I support and will vote for, but an amendment which pretends that the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;ttre</i> of the biggest political party in this State is obtaining and maintaining the levers of patronage.</P>

	<P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support the counter motion before the House this evening that Seanad &Eacute;ireann acknowledges and endorses the commitment of the Government to good corporate governance in State-sponsored bodies, including its approach to the appointment of board members to such bodies. It allows me the opportunity to clarify a number of apparent misconceptions and to set the record straight about the Government&rsquo;s commitment to best practice in the area of corporate governance. While I have enjoyed a number of the contributions, which have been entertaining, they have been wide of the mark in terms of accuracy.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>First, I would like to tackle what appears to be a sub-text of the motion submitted by Senators Ross, Norris and Henry, namely that the appointments made by Government to positions of director of our various State-sponsored bodies have been, somehow or other, less than fully suitable for the job. I vigorously contest any such assertion. When members of the Government consider the options for the filling of vacancies to the boards of State-sponsored bodies, they have as their first concern the need to ensure that these positions are filled by people of proven ability who have something positive and relevant to contribute.</P>

	<P>Like money to the party.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Any fair and balanced examination of the appointments which have been made to the various bodies within the semi-State sector over recent years will bear out what I say. In terms of <Col N="1750"/>quality and suitability, the board membership of the State-sponsored sector will stand comparison with its private sector counterpart any day.</P>
    <P>Board members receive a fair and reasonable fee for their work. Consideration of financial gain is not a motivation for the people who allow their names to go forward for nomination. While cynics may seek out other agendas, I am satisfied that participation on the boards of our State bodies is generally actuated by a significant public service ethic. Generally speaking, those who become members of State boards wish to put their talents and experience at the disposal of their community.</P>
    <P>Corporate governance comprises the systems and procedures by which enterprises are directed and controlled. The issue of corporate governance internationally, and here in Ireland, is something which has dominated the business pages for a number of years and has occasionally spilled over onto the front pages, generally for all the wrong reasons. The strong and effective corporate governance of our State-sponsored bodies is something to which this Government is fully committed. Our State bodies are very important and immensely valuable national assets. As proxy for the taxpayer, the Government has a duty to ensure that the very highest standards prevail in the management and development of these assets.</P>
    <P>The overall context for the Government&rsquo;s policy in the issue of corporate governance in State bodies should be formally put on the record. While such bodies are very much part of the public sector and are publicly accountable, they have been established at one remove from Government control so that they may have the freedom and the room to manoeuvre that is necessary to carry out their functions effectively. The Government&rsquo;s approach to the issue of corporate governance strikes the right balance between the public accountability inherent in the public ownership of State bodies and the need to allow them the appropriate level of freedom, commercial and otherwise, to realise their full potential.</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>Looking first at commercial State-sponsored bodies, we expect such entities to contribute <Miles com="ch"/>meaningfully to the broad national strategy in the sectors within which they operate. While so <Miles com="ch"/>doing, the Government also expects them to add shareholder value. The environment within which commercial State bodies operate has seen some very significant developments in recent years. It is not so long ago that these bodies operated in relatively comfortable, protected environments where domestic competition simply was not an issue. Thankfully, those days are fast disappearing. Among the factors driving change have been the following.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
    <P>First, the national and European competition policy which has resulted in market liberalisation. In this area, Ireland has been at the vanguard of change, as witnessed by our decision to move <Col N="1751"/>ahead of the posse on the opening up of the electricity and gas markets.</P>
    <P>Second, market liberalisation which has resulted in the need for new independent regulatory regimes in the main business sectors involved. Regulators play a crucial role in levelling the playing field in sectors where a dominant player &mdash; generally a commercial State-sponsored body or an enterprise which once held that status &mdash; has acquired an entrenched position. The Government has a taken a determined line in ensuring that these regulators are given the necessary powers to carry out this function effectively.</P>
    <P>Third, there has been a growing awareness of the impact, both actual and potential, which the commercial State-sponsored bodies have on the economy generally in terms of the prices they charge and the quality of the services they provide. In an open economy such as ours, which is heavily reliant on direct inward investment, the economic impact of our State bodies should not be underestimated.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the Government has made it increasingly clear that enhanced shareholder value is expected from each of our commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>While their functions are rather different from those of their commercial counterparts, non-commercial State bodies have a key role to play in implementing Government policy in a wide variety of areas &mdash; regulatory, administrative, research, promotional, advisory and so on. The necessity for good governance is no less important in the non-commercial sector than in the larger commercial area.</P>
    <P>The Government sees it as the responsibility of the boards of State bodies, whether in the commercial or non-commercial sectors, to give leadership and strategic direction; to define control mechanisms to safeguard public resources; to supervise the overall management of the bodies&rsquo; activities; and to report on stewardship and performance.</P>
    <P>The Government expects the boards of State-sponsored bodies to take their responsibilities seriously and realise they are carrying out an important public duty on behalf of the Irish people. These words have been supported by actions. I would like now to put on the record of the House some of the developments which have been initiated by the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>In October 2001, the Minister for Finance issued the code of practice for the governance of State bodies to his colleague Ministers for promulgation within the various State-sponsored bodies under their aegis. The purpose of the code is to provide a governance framework within which the internal management and internal and external reporting relationships of State bodies is to occur. This code was formally approved by the Government which had decided that it should be binding on all State-sponsored bodies. The code of practice replaced the earlier guidelines issued <Col N="1752"/>in 1992, adherence to which had not been obligatory, and reflected the greatly changed environment that had emerged during the intervening years. The code consolidates the various initiatives, both within the Irish public sector and more generally, which had been taken between 1992 and 2001 to enhance corporate governance.</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>The framework within which boards must <Miles com="ch"/>operate is effectively set by the code. It sets out <Miles com="ch"/>clearly the Government&rsquo;s expectations in this <Miles com="ch"/>regard. It also provides board members with an invaluable instrument against which to measure their actions. Anyone who would like to see this document in full can do so by logging onto the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website where all of the Department&rsquo;s publications are available to the general public. The code of practice is far-reaching in its scope. It deals with the following <Miles com="ch"/>matters: the need for appropriate codes of <Miles com="ch"/>conduct; internal audit; procurement; disposal of assets; establishment of subsidiaries and acquisitions; diversification of activities; investment <Miles com="ch"/>appraisal; remuneration and directors&rsquo; fees;  <Miles com="ch"/>reporting arrangements; strategic and corporate planning; tax compliance; a framework code for best practice for corporate governance in State bodies; and quality customer service.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
    <P>Extensive though this list may seem, it cannot deal with all situations which may arise. Directors and employees of State-sponsored bodies and their subsidiaries are advised in the code that it is primarily their responsibility to ensure that all of their activities, whether covered specifically or otherwise in the code, are governed by the ethical and other considerations implicit in the code.</P>
    <P>An accusation which has sometimes been levelled against Government reports and publications is that they may be very good in their own terms and say all the right things but, once published, are left on the shelf to gather dust. I can guarantee the House that the State-sponsored bodies code is, and will remain, 100% dust-free. Ever since its initial roll-out, concerted efforts have been made to ensure that it was fully understood and applied.</P>
    <P>Early on, the Minister for Finance gave his full support to the on-board initiative of the Institute of Public Administration which also had a significant input from the Belfast-based Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. The on-board guide, which is available to all State-sponsored bodies provides detailed practical guidance on the application of the code of practice. Subsequently, conferences and half-day briefing sessions for the boards of a number of individual State bodies have been organised by the institute to explore with directors the full implications of the code of practice. Training in corporate governance remains the responsibility of the various bodies, and it is their decision as to whether they avail of the facilities of the IPA or some other body or provide any necessary training themselves.</P><Col N="1753"/>
    <P>In addition to the on-board initiative, the Department of Finance has given priority to making officials available to address the boards of a variety of State-sponsored bodies as well as various representative groupings. This process has proved to be greatly beneficial as it not alone clarifies fully the Government&rsquo;s intentions on the working through of its policies on good corporate governance, it also opens up a two-way dialogue on issues of shared concern in that area. In addition, the Department deals with ongoing queries from other Departments and State bodies on aspects of the code of practice.</P>
    <P>As part of its policy of ensuring the code continues to address key issues in the area of corporate governance in the best possible way, the Department of Finance is seeking feedback from boards and parent Departments on experience to date. Should any necessary revisions or updating emerge, these will be addressed. To ensure that boards do not lose sight of the Government&rsquo;s requirements, each chairperson is obliged to include a confirmation in the context of the report to his or her parent Minister on the annual report and accounts that the code of practice has been adopted by the body and is being complied with.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the reforms to the Companies Acts that the Government has promoted in order to enhance corporate governance in Ireland overall. Company law applies across the board to the private sector and to those of our State-sponsored bodies which have company status. In recent years there have been a number of well documented cases where the precepts of company law were not adhered to and where those responsible had not been called to account. The cost of this misbehaviour has been borne by consumers, other businesses and the State. As a result of its concern with these disclosures, the Government decided to enhance the resources and legal instruments available to the State to supervise and enforce adherence to the requirements of company law. Accordingly, the Government brought forward the Company Law Enforcement Bill which was enacted in 2001 and in November of that year it established the office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Largely as a result of this initiative and the tremendous work done by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the fiduciary duties and obligations of company directors under common law and statute law are now better understood than ever before.</P>
    <P>The Companies Acts provide for two types of criminal offence, namely, summary and indictable offences. The maximum penalty on conviction of an indictable offence under the Companies Acts is &euro;12,700 and/or five years imprisonment. Considerably higher sanctions are provided for in respect of certain offences, such as insider dealing. Under the provisions of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, the Director of Corporate Enforcement also has discretion to impose an administrative fine rather than <Col N="1754"/>initiating a summary prosecution. The director may also apply to the courts seeking the disqualification of any person guilty of two or more offences of failing to keep proper books of accounts or guilty of three or more defaults under the Companies Acts. I reiterate that this regime applies as much to public sector companies it does to their private sector counterparts.</P>
    <P>Membership of the board of a State body is not a sinecure, it is a demanding role. The developments in the area of company law to which I have referred and which bring with them significant new responsibilities for all directors, together with the stringent requirements imposed by the Government under the code of practice, mean that there is a high degree of accountability associated with board membership. This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>The Government has a commendable track record of commitment to the strengthening of the corporate governance of our State bodies. The evidence is there for all to see. I am pleased to recommend the amendment to the motion to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am the last of the terrible trio from Trinity. Senator Ryan may think we are precious but most people think we are very valuable.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the Minister of State who said the Government sees it as the responsibility of the boards of State bodies whether in the commercial or non-commercial sectors to give leadership and strategic direction, define control mechanisms to safeguard public resources, supervise the overall management of the bodies&rsquo; activities and report on stewardship and performance. That does not really mean toeing the line. A Senator on the opposite side of the House stated that board members are expected to toe the line and that is why there is an element of political appointment involved.</P>
    <P>Huge responsibilities are placed on people who agree to serve on semi-State boards or public bodies. I referred to a matter on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business and stated that I would return to it when the occasion arose. I refer to the revelations in an article by Fintan O&rsquo;Toole in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday about the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. There have been terrible difficulties with that service for over ten years and, as the Minister of State is aware, the IBTS is still not out of trouble. There continues to be problems between the unit in Cork and the central unit in Dublin. In late 1999, despite having good staff, the board still had grave problems in encouraging the public to believe that it was doing a good job. It was a great stroke of luck that Professor Patricia Barker from Dublin City University agreed to take up the chair of the IBTS. She resigned in August 2001 and has never spoken about the matter. No one knew, therefore, why she had done so. However, it emerged in the article to which I refer that she had not been supported by the Minister for <Col N="1755"/>Health and Children in respect of the expertise required among members of the board. She wrote to the Minister &mdash; she received no reply &mdash; to the effect that there were serious gaps in the board regarding skills and competencies.</P>
    <P>Professor Barker asked to meet the Minister in March 2000 but this meeting never took place. Instead, in September of that year the Minister appointed people to the board none of whom, while I am sure they are honourable and excellent, possessed the skills Professor Barker felt were required. For example, she sought people with competency in the areas of audit, finance, human resources, legal, pensions, transfusion medicine, pharmaceutical grade manufacturing and blood user or strategy expertise. She stated she was extremely concerned about the gaps she had identified. The Minister appointed to the board seven medical consultants. As a medical consultant, I can confirm to the House that I would not have expertise in any of the other areas outlined by the professor. Medical consultants are always being upbraided for their lack of broad knowledge.</P>
    <P>The Minister also appointed to the board one building society marketing executive, a retired hotelier, a university registrar, a hospital manager and a person from the Department of Health and Children. I am sure these are all excellent people but in view of the fact that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service was in such a mess, one would have thought it would have been advisable for the Minister to be guided by the professor. I am sure there are plenty of members of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats who possess the type of expertise required. The situation was not helped by the fact that many of those appointed were from Munster. I cannot understand how, from the entire country, the Minister could not find people with the competencies sought by the chairperson of the IBTS.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan made a good point when he stated that we cannot question appointments in terms of the knowledge and suitability of those involved. It is particularly awkward to do so when such people have already been appointed. Perhaps it would be better if a list was drawn up and people with adequate knowledge could be asked who on it would be suitable to fill appointments to particular boards. It is extremely awkward to object to people on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>This is a good example of where competency exists &mdash; I am sure it can be found in Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; in terms of getting suitable people. At the time in question the board was in dire trouble and people were appointed to it whom the chairperson felt could not do the job. The Minister was correct in what he said about what is required from members of boards who must shoulder huge responsibilities. How many other boards have experienced difficulties similar to those I have outlined about <Col N="1756"/>which the relevant chairperson did not object strongly enough? The answer is that we do not know. Changes must be made.</P>
    <P>I was appointed to Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour Ministers and I received no payment or even expenses. People who serve on that board are heavily out of pocket because they give up work all the time. I am sure the same is true of those who serve on other boards. We must move away from the idea of toeing the line because these boards have major responsibilities. I would place the Irish Blood Transfusion Service ahead of commercially sensitive boards in terms of importance because it has the lives on people in its hands.</P>
    <P>I recently read a report from the 1950s on the treatment of mentally handicapped people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A member of that commission, Mrs. Kingsville Moore, produced a minority report which two other board members supported. In it she said that she felt single sex institutions should not be in charge of such people. It would have done a great deal of good if someone had taken notice of her, when we see the sad cases of sexual and physical abuse arising from these institutions. Far from being put there to toe the line, we need people on boards with some independence of spirit and with the required expertise, knowledge and competence. I have given a very serious example of a board where this has not happened and we owe Fintan O&rsquo; Toole a debt for having published that article.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his excellent contribution outlining the exact position on appointments to State boards. I would like to point out that Senator Henry was appointed to Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government and a Fine Gael coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I second the amendment to the motion. There is a great case to be made for suitable persons to be appointed to boards. I strongly support gender balance in appointments to boards. The same may not apply to the private sector with which Senator Ross would be more familiar.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should address his remarks through the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I mentioned that Senator Ross would have some involvement in the private sector. Quite a number of private sector companies have appointed people to their boards, but there is a golden circle as far as that is concerned.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross has not mentioned that when AIB lost $700 million in the US not one of its appointees had the grace to resign.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Precisely. I have been saying it for two years.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1757"/>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I note with interest that not all the Independent Senators have contributed to the motion. Senator O&rsquo;Toole is obviously not supporting the motion in the name of the other Senators.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There is time yet.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>That is absolute nonsense. There is no indication of that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am worried about that. I also note that Senator Quinn was appointed chairman of An Post by a Fianna F&aacute;il single party Government in 1980 or thereabouts.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Those were the days.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt><Miles com="ah"/>
	<P>He served with great distinction. This was a political appointment of a non-<Miles com="ch"/>political person. I was Minister of State in the <Miles com="ch"/>Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1982 and Senator Quinn was the acting chairman of An Post. He waited patiently until the telecommunications Bill passed through this House in the 1983-84 period. He has placed his name on this motion as he has been converted on the road to Damascus. He was an excellent chairman but then we appointed a wonderful businessman in Michael Smurfit. He took time out to become chairman of Telecom &Eacute;ireann as it then was. He served with great distinction and brought great progress in that area of telecommunications because of his expertise.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn was head of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s day committee.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We in Fianna F&aacute;il have a great record in this area. For example, we appointed former Senator Maurice Manning as President of the Human Rights Commission. This is an indication of the standards we adopt when we are making appointments. We also appointed Richard Burke as Commissioner in Brussels in 1982.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I must point out to Senator Leyden that that was not a State sponsored body. He must confine his remarks to the motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It was even bigger and better paid than any semi-State body appointment. On recent appointments, Alan Dukes, a decent man, was one of the best leaders Fine Gael ever had and was wrongly kicked out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>He was not appointed to a State sponsored body either.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Not yet, but we are working on it. He has a wonderful view of agriculture and was a well chosen appointment. Senator Ross may also make himself available for appointment in due course. I might send a letter of recommendation to some Minister because I think he would be a <Col N="1758"/>wonderful appointment and I hope he would serve.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not anticipating departing from the House and Members of the House are not actually allowed to serve on such boards.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no barrier to appointing the Senator to a visitors&rsquo; committee in a jail.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Leyden well knows.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I served with distinction and did not seek reappointment. It is very sobering for politicians to spend time visiting jails. An interesting appointment was also made by a Fine Gael Government when former Taoiseach Dr. Garret FitzGerald was appointed to serve in RTE. This was a wonderful appointment and he had no hesitations in taking the job.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has one minute remaining.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry to hear that as I could outline a litany of such appointments.</P>
    <P>The people we appoint are people of quality and ability. That they may have some distant connection with the longest ruling party in Ireland, the most successful in Europe and one of the most successful in the world, should be no barrier to appointment. I was a former Minister but I did not get many appointments between 1992 to 2003.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator had the prison visiting committee.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>Senator Leyden&rsquo;s time is up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a lot of information here about Senator Ross who has been appointed to a number of boards on which he served with great distinction. I congratulate him on all of these good appointments.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Michael Noonan was Minister for Health in 1997 he appointed members to all the health boards and Deputy Brian Cowen later sacked them all and reappointed people like me to the Western Health Board. He made a very good decision. When he gets his hand on the tiller, the poacher becomes the gamekeeper.</P>
    <P>There should be a website listing all the people who are prepared to serve on semi-State bodies and this process should be out in the open.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always a joy to follow the former Minister who was responsible for laying rat poison at the Department of Health for the 16 months he was there. Senator Leyden did a good job and caught many rats.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not catch enough rats.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion but I do so not as an angel coming down from on high <Col N="1759"/>suggesting none of this happened during Fine Gael&rsquo;s time in office, because it did. Such appointments are made regardless of who is in government. The difference is that Fianna F&aacute;il is in government more often than Fine Gael. Self-deprecation is always a good thing when commencing one&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good for the soul.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important we move this debate to a higher plain than that of cat calling on each side. We can all provide examples of where this has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>What I find reprehensible is the notion that appointments made by a Minister are in some way connected to a person&rsquo;s affiliation to a party. Fine Gael raised the issue of prison visiting committees last year. Despite Senator Minihan&rsquo;s suggestion, there has not been wholesale reform in this area. The view remains that appointments to prison visiting committees are based on party political affiliation. I have in my possession three letters from former Ministers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>All the letters were sent to former Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, suggesting appointments on the basis of the person&rsquo;s support for Fianna F&aacute;il at the time. One letter from Minister of State, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, referred to one of &ldquo;our prison visiting committees&rdquo;, not the State&rsquo;s visiting committees. He suggested the appointment of a particular person based on his having spent a considerable period in prison. That is fair enough. Another letter from Minister of State Deputy O&rsquo;Dea seeks the appointment of two colleagues from his party, both of whom he states were unsuccessful candidates in the recent local election and whom he is anxious to keep actively involved in the party.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>

	<P>We must address the notion that appointments to the semi-State sector are not totally above board. A broadcaster, not far from here, has a very good record in terms of appointing those whose mother or father were prominent broadcasters. The son or daughter turns up as a novice reporter.

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>

	<P>What about a woman?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of lifting people into jobs is much broader than political appointments. It is prevalent in the semi-State sector and is particularly prevalent in private companies in this State.</P>
    <P>We all know how the current system works. If there are five appointments to be made, Fianna F&aacute;il will get four and the Progressive Democrats will get one. Backbench Deputies and Senators will then be asked to suggest a suitable person for appointment by the Minister to a particular semi-State company. Such appointees may be eminent people, with vast experience in industry or the public sector and so on. I have no problem in that regard. However, I have a problem with the clandestine manner in which these appointments are made. I believe we should move to a new system, which I will briefly outline.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary committees should scrutinise appointments to particular semi-State bodies. I passionately believe that the Government has the right to make such appointments. The Government and Minister with responsibility in that area should make the appointment proposal to a relevant committee of the House and that committee should then put the person through his or her paces. Most people would prefer to answer questions from colleagues in public on a cross-party basis in the committee system because it would show their real worth. People are afraid to be associated with one party or the other and are afraid to serve because they may be tarnished. The advantage of having appointments endorsed by committees of the Houses is that it would ensure appointees, in terms of their expertise and <Col N="1761"/>knowledge, are publicly vetted. We should move towards such a system. I am not suggesting all appointments should follow such procedure but it should apply to appointments in the semi-State sector. There is much merit in the proposal.</P>
    <P>Whenever one government leaves office and another is elected there is a flood of appointments. We should apply a moratorium so that Ministers do not have the power to make appointments until a new D&aacute;il is formed. Frequently, many such appointments are made for the wrong reasons. I support the motion because we need reform. However, we not only need reform in politics, we need reform in the semi-State sector and in private companies. We should be more honest about that. Unfortunately the culture in this country of lifting people into jobs is endemic.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross&rsquo;s motion is interesting, as is the Government&rsquo;s amendment, in that it calls for good governance, something for which Members on all sides are striving. I accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling that we not mention people by name in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>I am unique in this House in that during my term of office as Minister a number of appointments in the semi-State sector came within my remit. Interestingly, I re-appointed a Labour Party appointed chairman of a particular semi-State company. He was an excellent chairman and I faced a little ire when I re-appointed him.</P>

	<P>I also re-appointed two other Labour Party appointees having made inquiries as to their suitability. I was satisfied they were familiar with their duties and performed them excellently. I had no difficulty re-appointing them. I appointed a well known person for his strong political activities in Fine Gael to the board of our transport company. I made that appointment in my own home town. One can imagine the comments made in that regard.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, one is not allowed to criticise a person in this House. I do not think there is any rule regarding mentioning a person&rsquo;s name.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach has ruled on that matter.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1762"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already accepted the naming of persons earlier.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Cathaoirleach had ruled that we could not mention people by name. I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for his intervention.</P>
    <P>As regards the appointment of Tom Mulcahy as Chairman of Aer Lingus, I never asked him what were his politics or if he ever voted. I never knew that. He has turned out to be a marvellous chairman of a company which was in great difficulty and which needed a strong hand and a good mind. He has made a great success of it.</P>
    <P>We are all groping towards changes but I strongly refute the notion that because one is a member of any political party, one cannot serve on a State board. That knocks the bottom out of everything. We are trying to encourage people to get involved in politics and have a stake in life but to exclude someone who is a member of a political party is wrong.</P>
    <P>Equally, I would say the chairman of the ESB, Tadhg O&rsquo;Donoghue, is the best chairman of any semi-state company in Europe. If he were still in his job&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Cathaoirleach said I could mention them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can mention them but cannot refer to their performance, if she knows what I mean.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Well he is very good. If he were doing the same job for PricewaterhouseCoopers he could earn &euro;1,000 an hour. He is the chairman of the board of ESB and is the best that could be got in the entire country but is he to hide all that under a bushel because he is in Fianna F&aacute;il?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be extraordinary.</P>
    <P>I saw the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last week, which was delightful and in which Senator Ross had a hand in progressing. I noticed that the gentleman of whom I spoke, the chairman of the ESB, was more than able for the interviewer, Donogh Diamond.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to explain that to be a member of a political party is not a sin. I regard it rather as a badge of honour and people in any party should be prepared to indicate their affiliation. There is some merit in eventually looking at a committee system, be it of this House or the other House, which would review this area but would anyone come forward who would wish to be stripped down verbally?</P>

	<P>I am delighted to contribute to the debate on the motion. I do not support the motion, but not because the system should not be reformed. It can and should be reformed, but it is too narrow and it is having a go at decent people who do an extraordinarily good job for little thanks.</P>

	<P>I am not prepared to add to the abuse that is heaped on the directors of semi-State companies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am well aware that the proposer of the motion has an equal view of worker-directors on semi-State companies in that they have no business coping with the major decisions on the running of a company. At least Senator Ross is consistent in that view, although I do not support it. That is an important point to be made.</P>
    <P>I would like to see this area reformed along the lines outlined by Senator Hayes, and I considered tabling an amendment to the motion during the week to that effect. However, I do not like what happens in the United States. The way in which this should be done is that a name should be put forward &mdash; it need not necessarily be put in the public ether &mdash; and there should be a committee system, not of decision making but of affirmation that this person has the appropriate level of suitability, experience, expertise, knowledge or whatever to do the job. A person&rsquo;s membership of a political party, and I am not a member of any political party, should not be a reason that person might not be considered.</P>
    <P>I agree that those of us in this House, and I have done it every time I got the opportunity, should put forward the names of suitable people in political life to get involved in a wider area. I would like to see movement in that direction.</P>
    <P>I have seen various appointments being made over the years, some good and some bad. They were not good or bad because they were political appointments. Colm McCarthy, who was nominated by Governments from both sides of the House over the years, was a person who could do the job. A former leader of Fine Gael was nominated by the current Government to an important position in agriculture. I see nothing wrong with that. Another former leader of Fine Gael has been nominated to a position by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>And to Europe.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is healthy. It is an indication of grown-up politics, which is important and something we should applaud. When they discharge those responsibilities with distinction it <Col N="1764"/>reflects well on political life and public representation.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes touched on a very valid point which has been abused by all parties, namely the interregnum appointments. No party is clean on that one. I remember the appointments made in 1977 by the outgoing coalition Government, and I have seen it done by other Governments. Decisions that are made in those areas are always problematic and should not be allowed. We should have a very clear view on that because it is not appropriate.</P>
    <P>We should make a distinction between chairpersons and other members of boards. Where a person has been appointed chairperson of a major semi-State company, as listed on Schedule A, he or she should speak to the appropriate committee of these Houses. I trust the committees of these Houses to take a clear view of what is best for the national interest and it should not be followed along political lines.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross is correct. The problem is the lack of process. We discussed during the week the proposal in the Garda Bill that the Government will have the power to appoint people from the rank of superintendent upwards. There is nothing wrong with that in itself but it is wrong if there is no process by which we can examine these appointments and have confidence in them. What is happening here is just too loose.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to Ministers. I know Ministers who have delayed the appointment of people to boards because they cannot find suitable persons and it has nothing to do with their political colour. That is a problem. I do not welcome what is happening in the United Kingdom where they advertise for board members and people apply for the jobs. The people who apply for those jobs are those I would tend not to want on the boards in the first place. That is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>Between the two positions where appointments are made privately by a Minister to one where it is done publicly and transparently, people of real merit with a certain sense of humility or modesty may not be prepared to put their names forward. The balance is somewhere in between but there should be a process. That is the real issue. Somebody should question the reason a person was appointed and the reason should be that he or she fulfilled the necessary criteria and that is the basis on which they were nominated.</P>
    <P>I do not support the motion but Senator Ross has touched on an issue of some importance. It is time Governments took this matter in hand. I do not believe what I or the proposer have said is the answer. Nor do I believe what Senator Hayes said is the answer but a process is required which should be used in all cases and on which the Minister would have the final decision. We should not just have political people or people with no political views. We elect the Government to govern. It has a policy and it is important that its views are reflected in the appointments it makes. I do not have a difficulty with that but it <Col N="1765"/>should have a process. I congratulate the proposer on putting down the motion.</P>

I was asked by President McAleese to try to get Gaisce, the President&rsquo;s Award, into Northern Ireland. I achieved this, not on my own, but shoulder to shoulder with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Education and Science and Foreign Affairs trusting me and letting me get on with it, while giving me full support. I got my train fare to Belfast, but that was it.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a pleasure to do so. I apologise for saying that as I do not like to boast. I was brought up to be humble. As we know the workforce currently comprises nearly 49% of women. In the early 1990s, the Government decided there should be a 40-60 ratio of women to men on State boards. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, is vigilant as regards ensuring this is happening. Currently women make up 35% of State boards. This is being driven by the Government. Every six months the Cabinet assesses whether the State boards are delivering on this 40-60 target. So we are getting there.</P>
    <P>The crunch of what I have to say concerns &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;, rather than the political <Col N="1766"/>appointments as highlighted by the three Senators who proposed the motion. A study commissioned by the Irish chapter of the International Women&rsquo;s Forum, supported by AIB, entitled &ldquo;Women in Corporate Governance in Ireland&rdquo;, did quantitative and qualitative research into women in Irish private companies. The report, published only a month ago, finds that men hold 96% of the board seats in Ireland&rsquo;s top private companies. Only 5% of women sit on the boards of private companies; in the semi-State area it is 35%. The reasons given by the private sector boards include lack of business experience by women, exclusion from networks and male unease about having women on board.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the divergence of views between male CEOs and women directors is remarkable. Some 42% of the male bosses believe too few women are qualified to sit on boards while only 21% of the women directors agree with them.</P>
    <P>We have to face facts. The private sector was pretty wobbly on its feet for many years. As Senator Ross has inferred, one of the main drivers of the Celtic tiger was the inward investment. Our own private sector is only now getting to be robust. It was not strong. It did not alleviate our massive unemployment and we had to look abroad for inward investment. Private industry in Ireland is no great shakes, but it is now shaping up well. Senator Leyden mentioned Michael Smurfit. I am a great supporter of his. Senator Norris referred to qualifications. As far as I am aware, Michael Smurfit has just got his leaving certificate.</P>

I am somewhat puzzled by Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s lack of support, but he is a law unto himself. This is particularly true as regards this motion, because last year I had a motion on the Order Paper, which stated: &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Government to end the practice of making political appointments to semi-State bodies.&rdquo; There were four signatures on that, Senators Ross, Norris, Henry and O&rsquo;Toole.</P>

I apologise to no one for my criticism of the private sector &mdash; it is disgraceful in its appointments of directorships. What Senator White said is correct. Positions of power, particularly in the banks, CRH and other public companies are held by a small club of people in the best-paid positions. They swap them around among one another in a way that is completely unfair, to the small shareholders at least. No one will disagree with that, but it is dishonest to come out with that argument on this side of the House as though it were relevant to this debate, which is about appointments to semi-State bodies and agencies. No one has answered the question I asked about Dublin City University, which was the only one to which I wanted a reply from the Minister. How come the one political appointment that was made there was in breach of the legislation, which said that the provost should have been consulted? He was not, and a political person attached to the Minister for Education and Science, whom I know I am not allowed to name, was shoved down the throat of Dublin City University in the absence of the consultation specified in the Bill.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. I have discussed this issue previously with him and also with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I ask that the work which was started over 40 years ago on the River Nanny would be completed. One of the reasons for stopping the work is that the river was involved in providing a water supply for the town of Tuam. However, the water supply in north Galway is now supplied by the River Corrib.</P>
    <P>A localised flood relief scheme was considered some years ago under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act 1995 and the work begun on a drainage catchment area should be completed. There is no excuse for this not to happen as the water supply for Tuam now comes from a different source. It would be of great benefit if this were to be done, especially to the farmers in the area, as periodic flooding is a problem. Farm buildings have been affected over the years. I have brought Ministers to see this flooding on many occasions. The project would not involve a great deal of money, although I was unable to get an estimate.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government refer in recent days to a western basin management project. While this does not come under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, it refers to the Corrib and Clare rivers. I hope the Minister of State can give me some indication of an intention to complete this work <Col N="1770"/>and an indication of the cost involved in tackling the periodic flooding in this area. This would be of great benefit to farmers and the wider community in the north Galway area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlon"><TitleTxt>Minister of  State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Drainage works on the River Nanny formed part of the Corrib-Clare catchment drainage scheme carried out by OPW in the 1960s. However, as the water supply for Tuam was taken from the River Nanny it was not possible to carry out that part of the scheme. Approximately 17 km. of the river and its tributaries were affected.</P>
    <P>In 1998, a new water supply was provided in Tuam and the question of completing the work on the River Nanny was proposed by local landowners and public representatives. Clearly, this proposal has to be considered in the current context and not as the final part of a scheme designed and carried out in the 1960s. As the Senator is aware, a policy decision was taken in the 1980s to discontinue arterial drainage schemes. The emphasis is now focused more on the local rather than the catchment level.</P>
    <P>Any proposal for flood relief or drainage works must now meet certain criteria. The proposed works must be technically feasible, must have a positive benefit to cost ratio and must be acceptable on environmental grounds. If all these criteria are met, the overriding consideration of financial resources and the obligation to prioritise these in the areas of greatest need must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>In response to requests for works on the River Nanny, the OPW reviewed the designs, environmental impact and the benefit to cost ratio of the works in the period 2000 to 2001. The estimated cost in that period was &euro;1.3 million. This was based on an outline design only and would be likely to increase as the detailed design developed. The work would extend along a 17 km. stretch and include the widening, deepening and cleaning of the channel as well as replacement of stone arch and stone culvert bridges. The cost benefit analysis concluded that the work would not yield significant benefits because the benefits arising are limited to agricultural lands. Buildings and roads are not significantly affected by the flooding and <Col N="1771"/>consequently do not contribute to the benefit calculation.</P>
    <P>On the basis of this information, the proposed works for the River Nanny in Tuam are not cost-beneficial and therefore cannot be undertaken by the OPW. I fully appreciate the problems caused for landowners by recurrent flooding. Having said that, I cannot approve the progression of any project that does not represent value for money and unfortunately this is the position I find myself in regarding the proposed works for the River Nanny.</P>
    <P>The Senator has referred to repairs to bridges on the River Nanny that are being carried out by Galway County Council. The OPW has had no communication from the county council about these and therefore I presume that the county council considers that such works are a local authority matter.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very pleasant to have the Minister of State in the House once again. What funding does he intend to make available to resurface the school yard at Brusna national school, Ballaghadereen, in the interests of health and safety? The school&rsquo;s playground is in a very bad state of repair and becomes a serious health hazard when it rains. There have been many accidents in the playground. I appeal to the Minister of State to make funding available to repair it in the interest of the children who use it. I know he will do everything in his power to secure this funding.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline, on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, the position on the application for funding from Brusna national school, Ballaghadereen, County Roscommon, and to outline the outcome of the summer works scheme.</P>
    <P>Brusna national school has a staffing level of one principal plus two mainstream class teachers, and one shared resource teacher, based at the school. The school had an enrolment of 74 pupils on 30 September last. An application for grant aid for the resurfacing of the school yard was received and processed under the summer works scheme recently. The summer works scheme was announced in December 2003 and replaced all existing small scale building project schemes with <Col N="1772"/>the exception of the grant scheme for minor works &mdash; commonly known as the devolved grant scheme &mdash; at primary school level.</P>
    <P>The specific aim of the scheme is to ensure the precise targeting of funding for small scale capital works at schools that are most in need of resources in accordance with the highest priority as set by the schools themselves. A dedicated fund of &euro;31 million is allocated to the scheme, of which &euro;15 million is being set aside for projects at primary level and &euro;16 million for projects at post-primary level. In all, 442 projects will be carried out under the scheme this year, 292 of which will be in primary schools and 150 in post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>Applications were assessed and categorised by reference to the criteria detailed in the circular letter governing the scheme. In brief, these categories were: Category A &mdash; urgently required structural improvements; category B &mdash; projects required to comply with fire officer and insurers&rsquo; requirements; category C &mdash; access for all; category D &mdash; curricular requirements; category E &mdash; improvement works; and category F &mdash; works required for the external environment. Based on the information supplied on the application form, Brusna national school was assigned a category F rating.</P>
    <P>To ensure maximum spread of available funding among applicant schools, attention was focused on the top priority application for each school categorised under the published criteria. The available funding was then distributed in accordance with the criteria hierarchy as detailed in the circular letter governing the scheme.</P>
    <P>Not all applicants, including Brusna national school, were successful this year. Each unsuccessful applicant under the scheme will receive a letter from the Department of Education and Science outlining the reason works were not approved. The letters will be issued to the schools as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Another summer works scheme will be advertised later this year and it will be open to any unsuccessful applicants to apply under the new scheme. In the meantime, given that the primary responsibility for health and safety issues relating to school buildings rests with the school managerial authorities, the grant scheme for minor works &mdash; the devolved scheme &mdash; should be utilised as necessary to address basic maintenance issues. The level of grant paid amounts to &euro;3,809 per school plus &euro;12.70 per pupil, and it was paid last December for the current school year.</P>
    <P>Emergency works that may arise in the course of the year will be considered as they arise in the context of available contingency funding.</P></Speaker>
