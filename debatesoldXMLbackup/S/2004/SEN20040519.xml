	<P>Before calling on the Leader, I will make a statement for the information of the House on the proceedings of the motion moved by Senator Mansergh last Wednesday. I will not allow the statement to be the subject of comment or debate.</P>
      <P>The Chair is the sole judge of order in the House and, where necessary, must rule on matters not covered by Standing Orders. This was the position on Wednesday last. Standing Orders make no provision for confusion of Members about procedures. The Chair must be sure that when the House makes a decision, Senators know what is being decided. Where there is confusion or ambiguity, the Chair will do his best to clarify the situation. On Wednesday last, as soon as Senator Mansergh raised a point of order, it was clear to me that there was a misunderstanding about the questions that had been put and the decision declared as a consequence. In these circumstances the Chair had both the right and the duty to put the question formally in order to clarify the position. This I did as the debate closed. Senator Brian Hayes has written to me on these matters and I will be replying to the Senator later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I respect the rulings of the Chair and have always done so. Given that the Opposition has put the proposition to the Chair that Standing Orders were violently overturned last Wednesday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, Senator, I am sorry. This must be the end of the matter. I will not allow my ruling to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, Sir, this is not the end of the matter. My group cannot agree to the formulation that the Chair has put to the House this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>To be respectful, Senator Hayes must accept my ruling.</P>

	<P>The Chair&rsquo;s ruling overturns a decision of the House.</P>

	<P>No, I do not agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very serious matter.</P>

	<P>I have explained my ruling of last week and that is it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>While I understand the ruling of the Chair, I must say publicly that I disagree fundamentally with the statement the Chair has made to the House because I believe it overturns a decision of this House. Not even the Chair can overturn a decision of this House.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a referral motion whereby the subject matter of motion No. 12 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is being referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for discussion. There is an explanation on the Order Paper and it will be taken without debate, as it is being referred to a joint committee; No. 2 is a referral motion whereby the subject matter of motion No. 13 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is being referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for discussion. There is an explanation on the Order Paper and it will be taken without debate, as it is being referred to a joint committee; No. 3, statements on autism (resumed) to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 12.30 p.m.; No. 4, statements on the regulation of the financial services industry to be taken at 1.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 3.30 p.m. with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; No. 5, Interpretation Bill 2000, Second Stage, to be <Col N="1131"/>taken at 3.30 p.m. and to conclude at 5 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; and No. 20, motion 20, to be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. There is a Government amendment to motion 20 which did not make the Order Paper but which has been circulated separately. There will be a sos from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised the Leader has not provided time this morning for statements on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement yesterday in the D&aacute;il on his proposal to establish a committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to look into the Judge Curtin matter. My understanding is that to date, no Senator or group of Senators has been directly informed by the Government on this matter. I am aware a meeting between the Attorney General and a group of Deputies is taking place this morning. I am not aware of any Senator being at that meeting.</P>
      <P>How does the Government propose to advance this issue because if one reads Article 35.4 of the Constitution, it is clear that the impeachment of a judge requires a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas? Will the Leader consider looking at Article 8 of the Constitution which provides that this or the other House could meet in private session to discuss this issue? If this matter comes before both Houses of the Oireachtas, it is vitally important that Senators are equally informed of the proceedings, know exactly what is going on and that this is wrestled away from the leaders of the political parties. I make that point about the leaders of all our parties because in our Constitution no special privileged position is given to political parties. As the Leader is aware, we are only groups in this House. If, under Article 35.4, this matter comes to the attention of the House, we must act as individual Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important for the dignity of this House and its constitutional position that clarity is brought to this matter. To date, we have seen comments made by Deputies but no comments made by Senators on how to proceed. If a committee is to be established, will Senators be on it? I make these remarks only to ensure that the constitutional obligations of this House will be met if such a resolution is put. I ask the Leader to make a statement today on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be inadvisable for sound reasons, in view of the sensitivity of the role the House may be required to undertake, to be drawn into discussion on the record of the House about procedures at this stage. I encourage Members not to do so. Those issues can be dealt with in another forum.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1132"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s earlier ruling on the matter which we should not discuss, it was a very bad motion and an equally bad amendment. We should call it a draw. The record of the House will show that it was won twice; both sides won and they were as bad as each other. Perhaps we should leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I ask the Cathaoirleach to reconsider the issue just raised. It is absolutely crucial that we discuss the procedures for impeachment. I cannot think of anything more important. We can do so without discussing the issue, the person or the case. It is extremely important.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to consider this very carefully because we are to be provided with a motion next Tuesday. We are taking the same path as with e-voting and the constitutional referendum. Instead of getting everyone&rsquo;s views at an early stage and trying to get everyone on board on this issue, the Government will present us with something and tell us to pass it. That is another lemon, making it five lemons in a row from the Government if it acts in this manner again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no party issue involved here. No one on this side is more concerned about this question than anybody on the Government side. I concede that point, since everyone has the same view on the matter.</P>
      <P>Whereas the Cathaoirleach is absolutely right that it would be inappropriate to discuss the issue and the person, it is crucial that we discuss the procedure. I want to know what is a fair procedure. I firmly believe that, if a joint committee investigated, came to a conclusion and presented it to the House, its members would not be entitled to vote again in the discussion in the House. That is only one simple point. On the issue of party or group Whips, I agree with the point made by Senator Brian Hayes.</P>
      <P>I am not saying this to test the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s judgment in any way. I respect it because he is well motivated, but I must raise this point with the Leader. We are now walking, with our eyes open, into a situation where we will be involved in a procedure of this House on which we have never had a discussion. I have been a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House for 17 years and we have never looked at this issue. No one has any input. We do not know the right or wrong way, what a fair procedure is or how it should be operated. Everyone&rsquo;s views in this are important. I would like to hear people on both sides of the House say how they feel a fair procedure might be put in place.</P>
      <P>I would like to correct one matter. The Taoiseach said yesterday that there were only two precedents for this in previous centuries. He is incorrect because there is a precedent from the 20th century. That paragraph from our Constitution was lifted by the Indian Parliament, which had an impeachment process against a <Col N="1133"/>judge ten years ago based on precisely the same words, except that they had &ldquo;proven misbehaviour&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo;. They went through all sorts of hoops and ultimately the motion was lost after two challenges to the Supreme Court. This is an absolute mess. Why can we not trust ourselves to say how we think we should go about it and present our views to the Taoiseach and Government before they draft their motion? I cannot think of anything more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should bear with me for a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In deference to the Cathaoirleach, I feel that it is the only way in which I can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator well knows, procedures are ultimately a matter for this House and if a motion to impeach is tabled, procedures will be drawn up, presumably by the CPP, in the same way as any change requiring an amendment to Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>How would that happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If something more is required, it can be considered. Does the Senator know what I mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I absolutely agree with that, but the point is that the procedure must be drawn up, I presume by the CPP, which is the group that always does it. As the longest serving member of CPP, I do not want to participate in designing a procedure for impeachment without having the views of all colleagues on all sides. It would be wrong to do so. We are making a mistake here. Let us not make a Government issue out of this. This is our issue to be dealt with by everybody. I would like to hear people&rsquo;s views and to have them taken on board.</P>
      <P>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that at early stage today this House put time aside in order to discuss a process of impeachment. I hope somebody seconds it because I believe it to be crucial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I totally accept the principle of the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s comments with regarding the process of impeachment. However, we are in unmapped territory. Where is the map to come from? Who is to advise us on it? We will probably need independent legal advice from a constitutional lawyer. I listened to the country&rsquo;s most eminent constitutional expert on radio this morning. Nobody can be in any doubt that we are looking at a very complex legal situation and in that context it must be discussed. Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I do not accept that we are going to simply take what is handed down to us from the <Col N="1134"/>other House or from the Office of the Taoiseach. As the Cathaoirleach says, we have to draw up our own process and procedure and have our own view on it. This is new territory for all of us and difficult terrain. In that regard we have to discuss it, probably in private session. The eminent constitutional lawyer remarked on radio that Senators or Deputies who have commented on the whole issue may not be in a position to serve on any relevant committee. We have to examine that and the extent to which we can discuss the procedure and the most appropriate process. In that regard it is an urgent matter and I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody shares the view that this is an extremely important issue. Everybody agrees it is essential we do nothing that would be prejudicial. We are entering uncharted waters, as has been stated, and we need guidance and advice on how to sail through them. If this matter was discussed on the floor of the House, someone could inadvertently say something prejudicial. It is essential we do not discuss the particular case at issue. From that point of view we need advice as to the generalities on how to proceed. That is essential, but it is not something that should be discussed on the floor of the House at this stage. It will be up to the House ultimately to make a decision in the matter, independently of the D&aacute;il. From that viewpoint, we need to have our own advice on the matter, but we need to proceed with care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally second Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It has already been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator agrees with our view, which is a variation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry. I have some difficulty with hearing. I accept what Senator Dardis and the other Members have said. Senators Brian Hayes and O&rsquo;Toole speak for us all in a sense in outlining the important points. It is very important that we get the basics right. We do not want to be specific, but the House, a committee of the House or some forum should be provided today to discuss this matter because there are serious questions as regards evidence and how the matter will proceed. At this stage, as I understand it, the matter is not immediate and not decided. All we know from proceedings in the other House yesterday is that a motion will be put forward next Tuesday with regard to the establishment of a committee. As several Members have said, much more needs to be established if we are to proceed properly in due course. As the matter is so much in the public domain currently, I ask the Leader, with perhaps An Cathaoirleach, to arrange, as has been <Col N="1135"/>suggested by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, a meeting for later today to decide how this House should proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>A report last week on the incidence of radon gas highlighted Castleisland but in many parts of the west there has been a very high incidence, causing up to 300 deaths per year. In the absence of new legislation in this area will the Leader inquire if there is a possibility of grants being restored to protect people from this radioactive gas? The Department of Education and Science spent a large sum last year remedying the problem in some schools but it should look at other schools. Public buildings, including the Houses of the Oireachtas, should also be examined because old buildings are a problem. Those built since 1998 have a radon barrier in place. This matter is worthy of debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleagues who suggested it is important that we discuss the general arrangements for the establishment of a committee to consider impeachment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator seconded the motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I have. It is important we discuss this without discussing the particular case or the personalities involved. We must get the procedures right, otherwise the issue of that process will be vitiated and fouled.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader give us a date on which we will discuss Iraq? I was approached coincidentally on separate occasions by two people, who have some influence in public life, on issues connected with Iraq. They asked me to raise two questions this morning. The first is to ask the Leader to find out from the Minister for Transport what measures are taken to inspect military traffic from the United States in transit through Shannon Airport. It is apparently possible that either torturers from the United States, or their victims, are being transported through our airspace and our airport. Is this a fact? The second question, which is distinct from but related to the first, is to establish whether it is the case that there is an American vessel in Dublin Port carrying depleted uranium shells which contravenes our legislation governing radioactive material. This was reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na yesterday which took little interest in the information. We are entitled to ask about this matter. What measures are being taken to monitor, first, military air traffic and its personnel going through Shannon and, second, the military hardware contained in vessels in Dublin Port?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I too believe we must think carefully about procedures. This is very important in the case mentioned and I am aware of all the difficulties of complication and pollution. I would be happy if the Leader would arrange for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to <Col N="1136"/>consider this matter and bring some recommendations to us. This must be done in consultation with what is being done elsewhere. It would be ridiculous if a different standard of proof were required in the two Houses. It would be equally demeaning if this House was seen merely to exist in order to rubber stamp a decision which effectively had been taken elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House at a convenient time to discuss whether he has proposals to discourage the use by manufacturers of alcoholic drinks of major sporting events as a form of promotion and advertising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for the T&aacute;naiste to come to the House to discuss insurance, which is something she promised to tackle? We were told premium prices would come down for motor, home and business insurance. Small companies are closing down on a weekly basis because of the high cost of insurance and we still hear of young people having to pay anything from &euro;3,000 to &euro;6,000 for car insurance. An equality issue is also involved here; non-nationals who have secured Irish driving licences are charged more for insurance than Irish citizens. That is discrimination. It is time we had a debate on insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>We all agree we must be especially cautious regarding the impeachment process. Any stray or unintended comment could eventually prove prejudicial. I had intended making much the same suggestion as Senator Maurice Hayes, that perhaps the Leader would consider calling a meeting today of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I hope Senator O&rsquo;Toole will agree to that because it would be important that the matter is discussed in private. There is a need for some consideration of the matter before it is discussed in public session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>People under 18 cannot go into a bookie&rsquo;s shop and place a bet. Likewise, people under 18 cannot play the lottery, yet children can legally place bets on the tote, which is a State-run body. This happens throughout the country on dog and horse racing tracks. Some people may say there is no harm in this, which may be true for the majority of children, but others can get hooked on gambling. This addiction has had a devastating effect on families.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to amend the Gaming and Lotteries Act, or other appropriate Act, to address this anomaly in the system? If children under 18 cannot place bets in bookies&rsquo; shops or play the lottery they should not be allowed bet on the tote.</P>
      <P>I must comment on last week&rsquo;s debacle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the duopoly in the mobile phone market in this country. The profitability of O<?oasys [of8]?>2 has gone from &euro;81 million to &euro;200 million. That could mean Vodafone, which was the most profitable company in the Irish market last year, will show profits in excess of &euro;300 or &euro;400 million. It is unrealistic to allow any company in a small State to make supernormal profits without putting something back. Those companies should reflect the Irish nature and Irish characteristics and try to comply with the wishes of Irish people regarding regulation and self-regulation, as it currently stands, to ensure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We did own it and we sold it off so that these companies could make huge profits. We should have had this debate four years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow Senator Hanafin to speak without interruption. There is a time limit and Members should be fair to Senator Hanafin and others who wish to contribute to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>When a company is making supernormal profits, it is not unreasonable for the Government to ask it to reinvest in infrastructure, such as the provision of WiFi spots and to decrease prices. We are out of line with other European countries and supernormal profits are being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a growing state of chaos and crisis in the Prison Service regarding access for prisoners to the medical officer. There were reports yesterday about Castlerea Prison, County Roscommon, where a prisoner was held, stripped to his underclothes, in a padded cell. This is 2004 and if such treatment is continuing in our prisons, there is an urgent need for the Minister to come before the House to explain why psychiatric facilities are not available for this prisoner at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum. It is of the utmost importance that this matter should be dealt with. The importance of medical care in prisons is as essential as it is in society in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the continuing and justifiable requests in recent weeks for a debate on Iraq, will the Leader consider providing time for an urgent debate on recent developments in Israel and the Gaza Strip? I make this request in light of the fact that the European Council of Ministers issued a statement <Col N="1138"/>earlier this week condemning the demolition of over 1,000 houses in Rafah and the subsequent homelessness this has caused, particularly among women and children. Once again the innocent are suffering. I have always taken the view, as has the House, in support of Government policy that we should be even-handed when dealing with matters in the region and that the Israeli state has every right to defend itself. However, we must also consider the question of human rights.</P>

	<P>Amnesty International will be publishing its findings this week which, again, will detail the human tragedy that continues to unfold in the occupied territories. The House must constantly monitor what is happening in the region. In light of recent developments, the statement made by the European Union and the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is currently acting as the Union&rsquo;s Foreign Minister, it is incumbent on us in this country, which is a friend of both Israel and Palestine, to have an urgent debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of those, including Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Maurice Hayes, who stated that while we are not sure how best to handle the process of impeachment, it is important that we deal with it. We must not put this matter aside and hope that it goes away. We must deal with it today.</P>
      <P>There was a scheme in China many years ago under which doctors were paid not for the number of visits patients made to them but for the number of weeks they did not visit them. In other words, these doctors were paid for keeping people well rather than for looking after them. Will the Leader draw to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children a scheme that was introduced in Britain yesterday to the effect that family doctors can be paid up to £100 for every patient they keep out of hospital? In the region of 40 primary care trusts which pay for hospital services are said to be interested in this scheme. This appears to be an interesting scheme, similar to that in China, to which my attention was not previously drawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I will first address the major issue that is occupying the minds of Senators. When one reads that Seanad representation is to be involved in a joint committee, every Senator called upon would want to behave in the correct fashion, possess the correct knowledge and work to agreed procedures. It is proper that Members would take such duties seriously. Arrangements will be made to brief the leaders of the various groups in the Seanad and I hope to do so today but that is subject to verification. Contact will be <Col N="1139"/>made with the offices of those Members to make suitable arrangements. That may meet the concerns expressed in much of the discussion that took place earlier in which many helpful proposals were also put forward. This would be a good beginning to the provision of information and a means of empowering us to know what faces us. I understand from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statements that it is hoped to have a motion before both Houses next Tuesday for the setting up of a joint committee. It would be wrong to wait for that to come before us on Tuesday and to be passive participants. This has never happened before. We need to be fully briefed and have a constitutional duty to ensure we are informed.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General is meeting Opposition spokespersons from the D&aacute;il this morning to brief them on the matter. Arrangements will then be made to meet the leaders of the groups in the Seanad to brief them also. It is better that both groups are briefed separately because although it will be a joint committee, the motion will come before each House. Leaders of Seanad groups will be contacted today to make the appropriate arrangements for such a meeting. Senator Brian Hayes went into the matter in detail and was quite correct to raise it. I suggest we wait until after the meeting before deciding on our next move. I appreciate the fair way the Senator raised the issue and the spirit of co-operation shown by him. The Taoiseach also made it clear that this is not a partisan political matter, quite the opposite.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole commented on what happened last week. The Cathaoirleach has ruled that matter out of order. On the procedure for next Tuesday&rsquo;s motion, it is important that we are well briefed and know what we are about.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara said this deals with uncharted territory. It is difficult terrain for us. Senator Dardis said we need clarity on the issue, which is correct. We need to be very careful about what we say on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt raised the matter of radon gas and requested a debate. A long time ago somebody told me that if I kept my window open at night, I would not have radon gas in the room. I sleep with an open window all the time, winter and summer &mdash; a notion I took when I was told that.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to the proposed motion. He also asked about inspection of military aircraft through Shannon Airport and mentioned the possibility of people involved in army misbehaviour in Iraq passing through. He asked also whether the American vessel in Dublin Port has hardware of a deadly nature on board. I will make inquiries on that matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes asked about the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I thought of that also but we will take the proposed route first. He also asked for the Minister for Health and Children to be invited to the House to discuss proposals to discourage promotions by manufacturers of alcoholic drinks at sporting events. I will do that.</P><Col N="1140"/>
      <P>Senator Terry asked that the T&aacute;naiste be invited to the House to discuss insurance. The PIAB is due to commence work this week or next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It commenced last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We have on the spot knowledge; it has already commenced. The Senator also wants the House to discuss the issue of equality in the context of insurance. I will ask the T&aacute;naiste to come to the House.</P>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; also suggested discussing the impeachment process in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Senator Cummins spoke about underage gambling. We all got cards from people who are very concerned that young people can bet on the tote. This completely negates the Gaming and Lotteries Act. The Senator called for an amendment to the Act. That is a finance matter and I will ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to consider it.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin raised the matter of the huge profits being made by the duopoly in the mobile phone market here. He asked whether prices could be reduced, bearing in mind the propensity of the Irish to talk.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke spoke about the lack of psychiatric services in the Irish prison system. That is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I will ask him to consider debating the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney called for a debate on Iraq and the issues in Gaza. The difficulty is that the Minister will be away this week and next week on important EU business. It is approaching the busiest period, but there is a standing invitation regarding that debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn suggested paying money to doctors if they keep people out of hospital. I am sure that in his case it is good living that has kept him healthy, wealthy and wise. I do not see why I should pay anyone if I am in good health. That is owing to my own regime, although it is not always very healthy. It is a dotty notion because it is not doctors who keep people out of hospital but people themselves. However, the Senator subscribes to the idea.</P>

    <Title>Autism Services: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank the Leader for facilitating this debate on autism. The issue of autism was discussed previously in <Col N="1142"/>the House. In the light of some of the decisions made by Government over the past five to seven years, it is important to carefully examine on an ongoing basis the decisions that have been made and how they have been implemented on the ground. There is no doubt that great strides have been made in recent years in the delivery of services to people with general disabilities, including the autistic spectrum disorders.</P>
      <P>The philosophy of the Government, which is welcomed on all sides, is that people with a disability should be given the opportunity to live as full a life as possible and to live with their family and as part of the community.</P>
      <P>The Government has made great efforts to promote mainstreaming, particularly in respect of younger people and children. The mainstreaming of children with disabilities in the standard education process has had a major impact not only on those with a disability, but also on children who do not have a disability. It allows such children to integrate with people with a disability at an early stage and helps them to understand and accept that people with a disability are still people &mdash; that they are very much real people with real ambitions and goals in life, notwithstanding their disability. One of the strongest elements of mainstreaming has been that it has ensured that young people learn to live with others from an early age, regardless of other people&rsquo;s physical or mental condition. It helps all people to live in a harmonious environment and to progress so that children have the opportunity to live to their fullest extent and to achieve the goals they set for themselves, regardless of the ultimate aim.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Malley, might be familiar with the life story of Mr. Stephen Shore, an American advocate for persons with autism. I wish to give a little background detail about his life. He was born in the 1960s and diagnosed with strong autistic tendencies at the age of two and a half. The preferred means of dealing with people with disabilities, particularly children with autism, at the time was to progress towards institutionalisation. It was recommended that Mr. Shore be institutionalised at the age of four. His parents intervened, thankfully, to ensure that did not happen. They believed that early intervention plays an important role in determining the ultimate outcome of the person&rsquo;s life. Mr. Shore is now in his 40s, married and employed in the education sector in the US. His view is that autism involves perceiving and processing information from the environment in a way that is somewhat different from others. It is important that we recognise that such people operate in a way that is different, rather than being some aberration. We have to accept that people with autism focus on different things because their sensory receptors are set differently. The mainstreaming programme assists students and people progressing to adulthood to develop a level of understanding.</P><Col N="1143"/>
      <P>I am aware that huge strides have been made, particularly in the health boards. The Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science are involved in dealing with children. It is obvious that the Department of Education and Science has a huge input. It recently announced the appointment of 350 extra teachers, who will make a huge difference when they come on board at the start of the next school term in September. Although there have been advances in the health boards at local and regional levels, there are difficulties. I suppose there are always difficulties in terms of the Government&rsquo;s delivery of services.</P>
      <P>Certain facilities and professional services are not as readily available in some parts of the country as they are in more built-up areas. I have experience of a carers group in the Loop Head area of my home county of Clare. Senator Daly and I have met representatives of the group on two occasions in recent weeks. They outlined their grave concerns and difficulties. One does not become aware of the scale of the problem until it is brought directly to one&rsquo;s attention. There are 14 people under the age of 14 with intellectual disabilities, and disability generally, in the Loop Head area. Nine of the people in question suffer from autism. The causes of autism have been debated and research in the US has suggested that there may be a genetic link. Other American research has suggested that there may be a clustering effect as a result of environmental problems, such as pollution. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify whether the Department of Health and Children has done any work in that regard.</P>
      <P>Loop Head is a beautiful and remote region. It is a considerable distance from large centres of population such as Ennis and Limerick. People living in the area have limited access to services that are available in densely populated areas. Some parents are not in a position to take their children 30, 40 or 50 miles to the places where these services are located. People working on the land, mothers working in the home and people caring for elderly relatives cannot bring their children to centres some distance away. There is a huge drive and commitment by parents to ensure that their children are given the best level of care at an early stage. There is a need for early intervention in cases of autism. Delays in the delivery of such services are a cause of concern to those parents who feel their children will not get the same opportunities that are available to people living in more populated areas.</P>
      <P>The problem is not a budgetary one because, while in many cases we argue for greater funding for particular areas, in this case the funding has been made available by the Government. The difficulty is in trying to get speech and language and occupational therapists to work in isolated rural areas. Many of them want to work in urban areas and in the private sector. I compliment the Minister of State and his Department on the <Col N="1144"/>progressive strides that have been made, particularly in commitments to funding. There is a necessity now, however, to look below the surface in implementing the delivery of autism services. We should make vacancies for speech and language and occupational therapists more attractive to candidates. The Department is funding a number of college students who will come on stream in the next two or three years, but there is gap at present.</P>
      <P>A vacancy for a therapist in west Clare has been advertised for some time but has not been taken up. That is a matter of concern because while funding for the position is available, unfortunately, there is no candidate ready to take the job. The Department or the health board should make the post more attractive by way of offering a greater financial reward. The authorities could also consider recruiting therapists outside the State from places such as New Zealand, which has been to the fore in training speech and language therapists for autism.</P>
      <P>The provision of such services is important for rural communities. I have used the Loop Head peninsula as an example but I am sure there are other isolated communities around the country to which Senators will refer. Such communities should have the necessary facilities to ensure that local children will receive the early intervention they need and deserve, in a manner that does not disrupt family and community life.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State and his Department on the delivery of an autism unit in Ruane school, which is close by. That unit has become a benchmark for the people of the Loop Head peninsula who are trying to ensure the delivery of a similar service. The peninsula carers&rsquo; group is working with the health board on such a plan and I hope there will be a successful outcome. While I realise the Minister of State has been helpful in the past in this regard, I ask him to assist us in any way he can now. We must try to make vacancies more attractive to the professionals we need to employ, either by way of better remuneration or through the delivery of a mix of services. People working in the private sector do not want to take on the onerous tasks associated with working specifically on autism. That has been one of the great difficulties in resolving the staffing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I wish to raise a number of issues with him which concern my area of Kilkenny. It has been brought to my attention that some schools are seeking funding for new buildings and development facilities for autistic children. One of them is the School of the Holy Spirit in Kilkenny City, which currently caters for 12 to 15 autistic children from the city and its environs. Last weekend, I was contacted by, the parent of a child in that school. Her son is 12 years of age. She was very upset because she knows that once he is 13 or 14 and leaves primary school, there is nowhere in <Col N="1145"/>Kilkenny where he can receive secondary education. I urge the Minister of State to contact his colleague in the Department of Education and Science with a view to expediting the building of the proposed new second-level School of the Holy Spirit for autistic children in Kilkenny city and its environs.</P>
      <P>I have also been contacted by a group of parents who have set up an organisation with a view to establishing a school in Goresbridge in Kilkenny, in the former St. Enda&rsquo;s national school. This is an old building, which has not been used for a number of years but it is in good repair. There are some six to ten autistic children within that immediate catchment area. The group of parents is looking at this building with a view to establishing a new national school for the children of the south Carlow and east Kilkenny area, who are affected by autism.</P>
      <P>I recently came across a surprising statistic, which I have not been able to verify. It suggest that one in every 100 children born in this State is affected by some form of autism, in a mild or more severe form. It is likely that everyone in this House and everyone in the country knows a family affected by autism, and we are familiar with the stresses it places on family life. This is an important issue, and I am glad we have the opportunity today for another discussion on it.</P>
      <P>A number of surveys and reports on autism have been carried out over the past few years. There appears to be a large worldwide increase in the rate of those being diagnosed as autistic. In the US they are talking of an autism epidemic. According to figures released in the UK, approximately one child in every 100 features on the autistic spectrum. In this State there are significantly more autistic children coming into the system annually than in the past, and the demand for services to meet the needs of this special population will continue to grow. All Senators are familiar with the growing demands on national schools throughout the State to provide special needs assistants, and the problems involved. I urge the Minister of State to contact his colleagues in the Department of Education and Science with a view to providing extra funding for special needs assistants.</P>
      <P>In 2002, 25,500 people were registered on the national intellectual disability database, representing a prevalence rate of 6.49 per 1,000 of population. The prevalence rate for mild intellectual disability is 2.4 per 1,000, and for moderate, severe and profound intellectual disability the figure is 3.7 per 1,000. From those figures we can see that the prevalence of autism in the State is significant in terms of numbers. Families affected by autism live under great pressures. In 2002 there were 23,000 people with intellectual disability in receipt of specialised services, representing 90% of all those registered on the national intellectual disability data base. Some 468 people, or 1.8% of those so registered, are currently without services and are identified as requiring appropriate services in the period <Col N="1146"/>2003 to 2007. This number has reduced by 47, or 9%, from 2001. The remaining 1,930 people are not availing of services and have no identified requirement for services during the planning period of 2003 to 2007.</P>
      <P>Most of this group are in the mild and not verified ranges of intellectual disability and their continued registration on the NIDD is being reviewed. However, the remaining 33% of this group have a moderate, severe or profound degree of intellectual disability. The need for continued monitoring of the circumstances of these people is highlighted. There are just over 8,000 people in receipt of full-time residential services, a net decrease of 194 since 2001. The number of people with intellectual disability accommodated in psychiatric hospitals continues to fall down by 162 since 2001 to 515. Approximately 22,500 people avail of day programmes, of this group 7,500 are in full-time residential placements and the remainder attend services on a day basis. Over 60% of all children and adults with intellectual disabilities live in a home setting with parents, siblings, relatives or foster parents. In 2002, just over 2,000 people were without services or without a major element of service. The provision of 1,633 full-time residential placements and 682 day programmes is required to meet the needs of this group in the period 2003-07.</P>
      <P>In addition, 1,446 people will require residential support services during this period. Most service needs arise immediately. A group of 308 individuals living in psychiatric hospitals in 2002 has been identified as needing to transfer from these locations to more appropriate accommodation over a five year period. In spite of a significant investment in intellectual disability services in recent years and a corresponding growth in the level of service provision, the demographic factors outlined above are certainly contributing to a long waiting list for services, in particular for full-time residential places. In June 1997, D&oacute;chas was established in response to the desperate need for an organisation to represent the needs of people diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder, ASD. D&oacute;chas works in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science to highlight the individual needs of ASD people and also to secure appropriate services for their members. To date, D&oacute;chas has acquired an office in O&rsquo;Connell Street, Limerick which operates daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. as a service and information centre. It operates a summer camp for children with autism for three weeks during the month of July. It holds monthly support group meetings for families with autistic members and it has been successful in highlighting the need for a respite centre for autism. The Red Hill respite unit opened in July 2000 and run by Rehab Care in association with the Mid-Western Health Board appears to be successful.</P><Col N="1147"/>
      <P>D&oacute;chas is dedicated to creating hope and a practical future for people with ASD disorders within the embrace of family supervision. D&oacute;chas is currently campaigning for respite services for adults in the Mid-Western Health Board area. However, such services are needed in all health board areas. Their main concern is that while respite care is available for children, families cannot avail of respite care once the child becomes an adult.</P>
      <P>Children and adolescents with autism become adults with autism, but it is only in recent years that it has been recognised. Prior to 1943, the year Mr. Leo Canner identified the syndrome, people with autism tended to be labelled schizophrenic or mentally retarded. There are services available for children and adults who are either schizophrenic or mentally retarded but none specifically for those with autism. People with autism were placed in whatever services were available, even though those services were not designed to meet their needs and generally proved to be completely ineffective. This trend is gradually changing for children as advocates procure more services, designed specifically for people with autism. As the services available to adults with autism expand, the needs of adults are being discovered in more detail.</P>
      <P>Adults with autism are emerging as people who very often require a continuation of the intensive training they received in childhood and adolescence during their educational years. Adults are able to retain skills they have acquired and are able to learn new skills when they partake in specialised services in adulthood. Without such a continuation of intensive services, however, many adults with autism will regress terribly. As children and adolescents with autism become adults, many of their needs remain the same, but many change. Adults require some skills that children and most adolescents do not yet need, for example adults need to be able to generalise their skills across a wider variety of environments because they live and work in the community. Adults also need to be prepared for the changes their body goes through as they mature. Adults need to be taught how to control their diet and related issues. Adults also need to be taught to engage in differing age appropriate activity, such as taking a walk or jogging instead of playing on a slide or a swing.</P>
      <P>We have seen in the past number of years a significant increase in the amount of funding provided in this area. The figures have shown there is a significant increase in the number of people who will require these services in the course of the next few years. I urge the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science to co-ordinate their approach to ensure that these people, many of whom were not diagnosed as autistic as a child, have appropriate services. I urge both Departments to continue to increase funding and to improve the services available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate on autism. The issue must be addressed. Additional funding amounting to &euro;643 million has been addressed to health-funded support services for people with disabilities since 1997. This includes an additional &euro;25 million in current expenditure, which the Minister for Finance made available in 2004 budget for services for people with disabilities. Of the &euro;25 million, &euro;18 million is being used in 2004 to provide additional emergency placements and extra day-services, especially for school leavers with autism and intellectual disability and to enhance the health related support service for children. Additional revenue and capital funding of &euro;388 million has been provided since 1997 for services for those with an intellectual disability or autism. This has provided 1,700 additional residential places which are based in the main in the community and new residential respite places that were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, approximately 465 additional dedicated respite place have been provided. In addition, 2,950 new day places were also developed. Alternative placements and enhanced level of services for the persons with an intellectual disability or autism have also been funded for those who were in psychiatric hospitals or other inappropriate placements. The number of persons with intellectual disability or autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in May 2003 was 438, which is a reduction from the number of 970 in 1996.</P>
      <P>The new accommodation provided includes community-based homes and a number of residential and day complexes. Since 1998, approximately &euro;16 million has been invested to enhance the early intervention, pre-school and multidisciplinary support services for children with autism or intellectual disabilities. Between 1999 and 2002, the Department provided additional funding of &euro;11.43 million to enable health boards to put in place a range of support services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism who present with major behavioural problems and therefore require a more intensive level of support. One of the major difficulties facing the health services in delivering support services to children and adults with disabilities is the shortage of certain professionals, such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and psychotherapists.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places. Last year the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children announced 150 therapy training places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. There has also been a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of the procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. The success of these measures is reflected in the increase in <Col N="1149"/>the number of speech and language therapists and occupational therapists employed by the public health services since 1997. There has been a 100% increase in the number of occupational therapists and a 71% increase in the number of speech and language therapists.</P>
      <P>While the statistics and figures are good and the Government is doing the best it can in a difficult situation, there are great demands on the parents of autistic children, of whom I know a number, particularly if they have other children. I wish to mention One to One, a group of parents in Sligo. This group has made me aware of its existence, particularly over the past two to three months. There is no classroom in mainstream education in County Sligo for children with autism. That is hard to believe in this day and age. One parent travels to County Mayo, a 100 mile round trip, twice a day with a child so that he can have an education or a chance of education.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say the Department of Education and Science has been working on this matter and has identified two schools which are prepared to provide a classroom for the teaching of children with autism. This project is at an advanced stage and the North Western Health Board has signed up to the proposal to provide speech and language therapists, psychologists and whatever back-up service is needed in the classroom. I ask the Minister of State to speed up this project to ensure there is a school to which these parents can send their children next September because that is their main concern.</P>
      <P>As a member of the North Western Health Board, I attended a conference on autism at which I listened with interest to a speaker who was a successful businessman. I met him afterwards and we spoke about autism, the different problems and so on. I told him he had a great knowledge of the problems associated with autism and he told me he was autistic. I could not believe it. The Government should do everything it can to ensure every child with autism gets the best chance possible to improve and educate himself or herself and, I hope, to lead a normal life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I am not too sure when we had the initial debate on this subject but I believe it was over a year ago. However, I deeply regret that little has changed in my county of Carlow in that time. It looks as if the planned autism units will not be up and running in Carlow this September. That will be another September and another school year gone even though there is an active parents&rsquo; association in Carlow and despite its best efforts. I acknowledge the Department of Education and Science has made efforts but it took the wrong track initially with one school which it tried to encourage to take one of the autism units. The school was not in a position to take it because it needed major refurbishment and building works. The infrastructure was not in place in the school and the staff made that clear to the Department <Col N="1150"/>which did not listen and pursued the issue with the school for a number of months thus, unfortunately, wasting many valuable months in the process. That is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>The Department must have a strategy. The carrot and stick approach whereby the Department encourages schools by saying that if they take an autism unit, the Department will fast track any building works planned for the school unfortunately does not necessarily work. It is not just a question of getting an autism unit for a school; there are considerable implications subsequently. Bringing children with autism on to a building site, which invariably most schools in the middle of extensions are, is not recommended. The Minister might check that with his experts. Children with autism need specialised care and a stable, familiar surrounding. The last thing one should do is bring them on to a building site.</P>
      <P>I am involved in the Oireachtas Joint Houses Friends of Science group to which Luke O&rsquo;Neill from Trinity College gave a talk in which he highlighted the lack of take up of the MMR injection and the implications of that. Parents have a real concern about the link between the MMR injection and autism. The person who originally spoke about that link has since been discredited. A link between that person and a legal firm working for another agency has been proved. How many children have taken up that injection this year compared to previous years? I am aware that to avoid an epidemic, whether of measles, mumps or otherwise, a 90% vaccination rate is required. The danger is that if children do not get the injection, it might go below that threshold which could have severe implications.</P>
      <P>It is important parents are given as much information as possible to help them make up their minds whether they want their children to have the injection when they reach 18 months or so. Parents were put off the idea initially but now that the person who spoke about that link has been discredited, there is an onus on the Department of Health and Children to relaunch that campaign and make parents aware of all the facts. It is a difficult decision for parents to make. If they vaccinate their child and he or she develops autism subsequently, they will always wonder whether it was because of the injection. If they do not vaccinate their child and he or she dies from measles, they will be in an awful predicament. As far as I am aware, autism only shows up around the same time as a child gets the injection, so it is unfair to assume a link between both. The Department of Health and Children has a considerable role in this area.</P>
      <P>I am dismayed by reports lately that the Department of Education and Science has plans for specialised education with a one glove fits all mentality whereby every school with 150 children will get special needs assistance. The INTO is also unhappy with these plans because it means the larger schools might lose out on extra help. In <Col N="1151"/>fact, smaller schools, which might not necessarily need the help, will get additional assistance.</P>
      <P>The Minister made an announcement at Easter about the appointment of 350 new special needs teachers for schools, which is good news. However, the problem is that he did not indicate from where they will come. Based on past experience, these teachers will be taken out of the existing pool of teachers. In other areas, when extra personnel are appointed, that is what happens but in teaching, it means in effect redeploying existing personnel.</P>
      <P>I have little confidence in the Department of Education and Science planning ahead. One has four years&rsquo; notice that a child will be going to school. If every Department or company had four years&rsquo; advance notice, they would more than likely be able to cater for whatever turned up. The Department of Education and Science, however, has got it totally wrong. For example, in the late 1980s, too many teachers qualified and there were not enough jobs for them. By the time I qualified in 1995, however, too few were doing so. Afterwards, the authorities came along and appointed a great many resource teachers. While that was a welcome step, the problem was that they came out of the classrooms. Unfortunately, there were not enough qualified people to replace them there. That is why there are now 2,000 unqualified teachers in primary schools alone. That is surely unsatisfactory and certainly does not benefit any of the children involved.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science must rely on there being an equal and opposite reaction to every action. If it appoints extra teachers and removes them from the mainstream, it must ensure that there are teachers to replace them. That is common sense. If one were going to the doctor&rsquo;s surgery tomorrow and he was out sick and had been replaced by someone who was not a doctor and had not gone to college or trained, but was suddenly substituting, one would not have confidence in that person. Yet that is happening in primary schools every day of the week.</P>
      <P>I am sure that there are excellent teachers who are not fully qualified, but there should be more conversion courses. There are a great many BA graduates with higher diplomas who would love to do the conversion course for primary teaching but are not allowed to do so. The numbers were cut back this year, as I highlighted in the House. The Department is full of contradictions in that area.</P>
      <P>In the Carlow case, there has been no progress in a year and a half and I am not sure of the solution. We have heard all about the extra resources and funding, but the reality is that the dedicated autism units have not materialised on the ground, as Senator Scanlon admitted regarding Sligo. In Carlow, it was proposed at one stage that parents travel with their children every day to Goresbridge in Kilkenny. A round trip of 50 miles every day would be totally daft. The <Col N="1152"/>planning section of the Department of Education and Science responsible for both building and general planning must anticipate events.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that so little has happened as a result of the Jamie Sinnott case. We had thought that there would be great strides in that area. I plead with the Minister that the building unit in the Department of Education and Science in Tullamore not use the carrot and stick approach with schools. If they are entitled to an extension or building, they should be given it. The two things should not be coupled together because that amounts to a form of blackmail. I hear from teachers that it is going on around the country.</P>
      <P>The sooner we get these centres up and running, the better for the children and parents involved. A child is only in primary school for eight years and one year out of eight is a long time. In the Carlow case, two years have been wasted &mdash; almost a quarter of the children&rsquo;s primary school education &mdash; during which time they will not have the proper resources. That is definitely a scandal in this day and age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the Minister and congratulate the Department on its efforts so far. I am not saying that matters are ideal by any means, but progress is being made. I have read the statistics on funding for residential placements and respite and day places over the past few years. From psychiatric hospitals, we have moved towards community-based houses, which is to be welcomed. Some measures are coming forward, but the subject is very difficult.</P>
      <P>Nobody has the real answer to how we can make progress on early intervention. We must start at that level. Perhaps it goes back as far as the maternity hospitals, where the problem may be detected, although, equally, that may not happen for a year or two. However, within two years of a baby being born, early indicators and identifiers will show up. That is where we must start, since it is the core element. If we can have early identification of the problem and examine it to see what is available at the pre-school level, we may be able to put a proper plan in place, identifying what measures can be taken regarding support and backup services for parents. There is a huge gap and that is the core of the problem.</P>
      <P>As a professional in the field dealing with assessments at post-primary level and very often having to deal with attention deficit disorder, an area similar to that of autism, I feel it is too late at that stage. Parents suddenly realise when their child is ten, 11 or 12 that he or she is not fitting in with the mainstream and that something is wrong. It is not picked up at that point. The human resources of special teachers and educational and clinical psychologists are not available. There is a huge gap.</P>
      <P>When the new legislation is introduced, I ask the Minister to consider the pre-school level and see that we have the parents with us from the maternity hospital stage. The health boards must be taken on board at that stage so that we have <Col N="1153"/>the psychologists, the home-school links and the public health nurses. There is a whole area of professionals at that level. We need not go into the issue of resource teachers or talk about speech therapists or anything of that sort at that stage. We must plan very early and try to introduce integrated arrangements for children aged two or three. That would help parents greatly. We must facilitate that as the child gets older. It is a very important issue and if we picked the problem up at that point, it might help relieve many of the problems.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we have skipped on proper assessments. We do not have the educational or clinical psychologists, the medicine or the health board professionals in place. We must also use our skills in bringing the parents along with us. That resource area has been lacking in recent years. There is a significant overlap between the Department of Education and Science, in its delivery of such a programme for children with special needs, and the Department of Health and Children, which must take up the work with clinical psychologists and the other professionals who must be brought on board. One is not aware of what the other is doing, as I know, having worked in the system. If one has a plan for an assessment by an educational psychologist, one must wait until one can refer the matter to the Department of Health and Children. One wastes six or nine months before one comes to a final report, which is a huge gap. All that should be brought together.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I am not sure if the National Council for Special Education will be part of the new Bill or whether it has already been set up. However, that national council should be given a role because its members are the people to bring matters together quickly. One should not forget that the parents are waiting, wondering what will happen with their sons and daughters. We must try to facilitate them instead of writing reports. I have been sitting on such reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>So has the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>One would have the parents, the home-school liaison officer, the guidance counsellor and the public health nurse around one. At the end of the process, I never got a report back or knew what was happening to the child in question. We never seemed to be able to get to the grand finale and say that the child would enter a certain arrangement with a specific plan and programme. I ask the Minister, in the new Bill coming forward, to streamline all that so the parents, who are very vulnerable, will be able to say that at long last they are getting guidance for their child, who can go into a special programme. That programme will look after his or her needs whether it is an attention deficit disorder or involves a special education programme or a resource teacher. They need <Col N="1154"/>residential and respite care and that is a core issue of the new Bill.</P>
      <P>The great shortage of professionals has been mentioned in terms of speech and language, occupational therapists and psychologists. It used to make my blood boil that 550 out of the maximum 600 points in the CAO system were required to get to university to do this course and yet children are crying out for occupational therapists. We are stuck because of academic procedures and the fact that the colleges will not provide places. In addition, the Department is not helping to create places. I am glad the Minister of State has tackled that issue. I hope he will pursue further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am glad to see we are doing our best. I am asking the Minister of State to ensure, when this new Bill is enacted, that all these structures are put in place and to try to provide a service. Anyone looking at the programme on television the other night would have such sympathy for parents who are trying to handle these cases and are not able to get the backup they need from the Department. There is a gap between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children in terms of the implementation of services. I hope the Minister of State will correct that in time. Much has been done, but, as the saying goes, more needs to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Where did we hear that before, &ldquo;a lot done, more to do&rdquo;? Senator Ormonde seems to be describing a different country from the one we are dealing with on the ground. The reality is that autism is not being dealt with in any real way. There is an extraordinary shortage of people at all levels. I agree with Senator Ormonde as regards the shortage of professionals. It is not just at the therapy end. Where are they? There is a shortage of educational psychologists. Those we have are running around the country testing. They do not have the opportunity or the time to plan programmes in consultation with the groups mentioned by Senator Ormonde and then to implement them. One is constantly being told about the number of people waiting for assessment. The real difficulty is what happens next. I know educational psychologists from Ireland who are working in the North or in the UK. The reason they will not work here is because of the total frustration of not being able to sit down with children who have problems and plan programmes that can be implemented and assessed. Their whole working life here is spent testing and testing, eventually getting reports out but without any subsequent follow-up.</P>
      <P>Autism above all issues is extraordinarily complex. I have always failed in explaining autism to people, even to teachers who had not dealt with it themselves. It is important to talk to ordinary people about it. The autistic spectrum covers such a wide range that we really need people to have some clear understanding. People thinking or talking about autism should recognise that some autistic people have very high IQs. They are often very bright people with extraordinary creative drives. It is a condition, for want of a politically correct word, that is rooted in problems of social, emotional and communication skills.</P>
      <P>In terms of communication, autistic people tend to interpret the absolute meaning of words. Whereas the average person might say, &ldquo;I will kill <Col N="1156"/>you if you do that&rdquo;, an autistic child might well believe he or she is going to be killed. They cannot get out of that. The position is the same in terms of their social skills. The tactile sense is foreign to them. They are not emotional. They are not clingy. They do not like touching or hugging, in general terms. There is an emotional difference in the way they relate to people and places. If one takes the three areas of difficulty, emotional, social and communication, that is where the problem starts.</P>
      <P>That might not be a huge problem in many cases, but what happens next is crucial. It is because of their different interpretation of words, their social and emotional responses, that they appear different. They recognise themselves to be different. They are distressed about this and it is from that level of distress that they will suddenly ask: &ldquo;What am I doing wrong here?&rdquo; Their interpretation of what they are doing wrong is also wrong. This just leads us into a riddle. It is a good idea to see autism as a type of see-through rubric cube because one can move in all sorts of directions within a shape, but at the same time one can hardly explain it to people. It is extremely difficult to understand.</P>
      <P>Given its complexity, it ranges from what might be called mild to serious levels of autism. These are just my words; I am not sure precisely what they mean. Not all autistic children are the same. In fact, no two autistic children are the same. Then there are those with a high level of function with autism, normally referred as people with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome. They need a different level of response.</P>
      <P>One of the problems here is that a fully functional educational psychologist has to be a fully qualified teacher, with teaching experience over a number of years and must also be fully qualified as a psychologist, with experience in psychology for at least a couple of years. That entails a longer course than a surgeon&rsquo;s. I do not know whether people understand that is the calibre of person required. They should be able to go into schools and explain to pupils, teachers, parents or whatever what it is that is going on. To try to explain autism can be so difficult. The shortage of educational psychologists is a problem. Then there is a temptation to promote or allow people to become educational psychologists with a slightly lesser level of qualification than I have just outlined. They would be recognised, but they might not be fully trained teachers or psychologists. They might be fully trained teachers without a diploma in psychology or fully trained psychologists without teaching experience or qualifications. Any school will say that an educational psychologist must be someone who is a psychologist and a teacher who also specialises in education psychology. It is complex.</P>
      <P>One looks at the autistic child and the level of response in social situations, the communication and emotional difficulties. One assesses how the child is interpreting &ldquo;reality&rdquo;, the levels of distress <Col N="1157"/>and confusion and the behavioural difficulties as they arise and on that basis plans a programme. For that programme to be put in place, the teacher will need a high level of support at school level. When we talk in this House about more money for special education and psychology, forget about the broad vision: what we mean is a child with autism who needs support, very often one-to-one support involving one teacher and one pupil. If I said that on television or radio, people would say I was asking for the moon but there is no other way to do it. Along the Border there is considerable co-operation and a public representative from Northern Ireland told me that in Middleton in Armagh a full new autistic unit has been built but lies unused. That could cater for some of our problems as well as those of the South Eastern Education and Library Board in the North. We must encourage people to work together on both sides of the Border on that issue, particularly in the Border schools. Once an assessment is carried out, the psychologist should be anchored to remain in contact with the child instead of being sent off to do more assessments. The psychologist should meet the teacher, the principal teacher, maybe the parents and the support teachers in the school, to outline the programme for the child who has a particular difficulty in communication skills or in the emotional area. They can collaborate to help the child through the distress and confusion caused by the autism which is rooted in social, emotional and communication difficulties.</P>
      <P>There is a shortage of all kinds of therapist, whether speech or occupational. We all know the work they do but until we must attend an occupational therapist ourselves or have a frozen shoulder and attend a physiotherapist, we do not understand how useful they are. Many people know someone who has had a serious stroke resulting in a loss of speech, or movement on one side of the body but who, with therapy over some months, can regain 90% of those powers. The same can be achieved for autism but because the problem is inside a child&rsquo;s head, it is not as obvious. That is why we must put these services in place.</P>
      <P>I may stand up here and make a strong case for the national development plan, more roads and investment in railways, and the opening of the Sligo-Limerick line and so on but if I have to make a choice, I will. If someone tells us that the development of extra DART stations is being delayed in order to put the money into dealing with autism, I will support that and will give the Government fair dues for the decision. I can understand Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s point about the frustration at our level because we cannot see this happening. We must grasp this issue and do the business here because otherwise we are letting down the children and their families.</P>
      <P>Several schools in east Clare, close to the Minister of State&rsquo;s Limerick constituency, have done good work to deal with autism in primary <Col N="1158"/>schools and have been quite successful. We all know the difficulties families who have a child with autism face in trying to find support and help; they will do anything for their child. In addition, they have another difficulty which sees their relatives, friends and neighbours involved in a constant series of fund-raising activities for some special school or unit which does not have money to provide the service. This is an extra tax on these people in the absence of Government resources and distribution of tax revenue. I urge the Minister of State to consider this.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to address this issue. It is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas discuss such issues. The Minister of State needs to bang the table and ensure the Cabinet listens and makes money available for the services we want to achieve in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I am optimistic that children with autism can go to their local schools. One of the greatest problems facing us in the west is that there has been a long battle for services for autism usually involving child care services for young children and school transport to schools where the health board or the Brothers of Charity provide services. It is hard for families to provide education for children with autism. I agree with my colleagues that there is a need for educational psychologists. It is a matter of trying to provide one-to-one attention in a local setting if possible, which should be the case. However, much of the battle seems to concentrate on appropriate school transport for a young person. This refers to perhaps a direct taxi service rather than minibuses or school buses travelling long distances to bring a child to a special educational centre. This is often raised in my constituency. In a town like Ballinasloe, young children with a disability might receive services from the Galway County Association, the Brothers of Charity take over until the children are 18 years old and then parents are left to wonder how to get further training or employment for people with autism.</P>
      <P>The link between autism and creativity is an interesting one. Senator Scanlon referred to people who give lectures or talks and say they suffer from autism. I read a review recently of a book entitled <i>Autism and Creativity</i> by Professor Michael Fitzgerald, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Trinity College. He explores the link between autism in men, among whom it is more common, and exceptional ability, and looks at the reality of the situation rather than the Hollywood version in movies such as &ldquo;Rain Man&rdquo; and &ldquo;Forrest Gump.&rdquo; He claims that Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome, the high functioning autism, is very common among well-known historical figures including high achievers, Newton, Einstein, Darwin and Warhol. Such people may behave inappropriately in social settings and may be egocentric and hypersensitive <Col N="1159"/>but they are very capable of original ideas. They may lack common sense but they have above average intelligence.</P>
      <P>This is the double-edged sword of autism, revealed by a deficit in social situations for which the compensation might be exceptional mechanical ability and a capacity for detailed observation. Many prominent philosophers, politicians and writers display classical features of autism which demonstrates the importance of understanding this problem. Professor Fitzgerald emphasises the need for autistic and non-autistic people to understand the condition for the autistic person to be fully included in society where everyone has strengths and weaknesses. This is particularly true of attempts made to provide a suitable environment for people with autism. I was invited to a farm in Claregalway, County Galway, which provided courses for people with autism. I think there is a similar farm near Kinnegad. I was most impressed with the commitment of those who provide the service. I urge the Minister of State to consider the extension of such schemes, as the programme in Claregalway appeared to be most useful.</P>
      <P>Local authorities provide schemes, such as the disabled person&rsquo;s housing grant. It was stated in a report of the Disability Federation of Ireland that, in addition to that scheme, there should also be a scheme for chronically ill young people, those with significant disabilities which affect their housing needs. It especially recommended a three year programme to provide appropriate accommodation in the community. This issue should be examined, as the needs of people with disabilities tend not to be addressed by existing housing grant schemes. Disabled people are easily overlooked, especially at a time when many people are seeking to have their housing needs addressed. Local government housing policy can play a pivotal role in addressing the needs of people with disabilities in their own communities. People with disabilities should not be trapped in unsuitable and potentially dangerous housing situations because their needs are not addressed by existing schemes.</P>
      <P>It is important that the issues of education and housing for people with autism are addressed. The Minister for Health and Children and the Ministers of State at the Department should be congratulated on the extra funding and services available in the Western Health Board region. It is important that this funding be increased. For too long we have exported the problem to other health board areas, especially to Dublin and the eastern region. Appropriate services should be provided by the Western Health Board. It is important that children have access to services in their own schools and home area. I hope this will be the approach taken by the Department, health boards and local authorities. People should not have to leave their home regions to access services for autism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, and congratulate him on his efforts to tackle the serious difficulties experienced in the area of special needs education.</P>
      <P>Everybody, especially the parents of those with special needs and autism, recognises the past neglect that has occurred in this area. On 17 October 2001, the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor stated in the House that in the past, the extent to which support services were provided was entirely dictated by resource availability in any given year and that all this changed in 1998 when the Government took the unprecedented step of deciding that all children with special needs in the primary system should have automatic entitlement to the supports they required, irrespective of their level of need or location. In effect, the Government introduced a demand-driven system where the needs of the child rather than the availability of resources became the deciding factor.</P>
      <P>Almost three years&rsquo; later the same situation pertains. In many instances, access to and the provision of services to people who have been identified as being in need, still remain inadequate and unavailable. That is the tragic reality. Many parents and siblings of autistic people throughout the country are grappling with this problem. The Minister&rsquo;s endeavours heretofore are totally inadequate to address the needs of young people with autism.</P>
      <P>Educationalists agree on the need for early identification and attention. Until recently GPs were unable to identify autism. Parents usually brought the matter to the attention of medical professionals. We need to see change.</P>
      <P>The Minister must respond to the disturbing situation that exists among certain groups dealing with autism. I refer the Minister of State to an article in <i>Phoenix</i> magazine of 9 April 2004 which raises concern about various autism facilities throughout the country. It drew attention to the egoistic behaviour of a certain family in pursuing the governance of societies dealing with autism. The article referred, in particular, to two centres, one in County Galway called Tigh Ronan and another at Dunfirth farm near Enfield, County Meath. I urge the Minister of State to allay the fears of the many people who worked hard to provide such centres to deal with local needs. The management and utilisation of funding of these centres must be thoroughly investigated. Parents were unaware of what was taking place. While other such centres exist, the article focused, in particular, on the two to which I referred.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board, of which I was a member, was asked to intervene in this matter on several occasions. Litigation was subsequently initiated and the Irish Society for Autism was challenged regarding its power to change the locks on certain properties thus denying people access to services.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House. During the past two weeks we have seen what is perhaps a first test of the new regulatory structure for financial services that was put in place last year. This new structure, which brought the financial services regulatory activity of four different bodies into a single new authority, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, was established by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003. That Act rationalised the regulation of financial services and, in doing so, placed consumer issues at the heart of financial regulation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>IFSRA has a dedicated statutory position of consumer director and the Government has allowed it the resources to greatly expand the focus on consumer issues in financial services. Members will have seen the difference this new structure has made in the regulatory reaction to the recent events at AIB. The regulator has been open and forthright in dealing with the issues which have arisen and has truly been the consumer&rsquo;s friend in the matter. Actions speak louder than words and the evidence of both the Government&rsquo;s and IFSRA&rsquo;s actions contradicts the assertions made by some people last year that IFSRA would be uninterested in the consumer and that the Government was more interested in protecting institutions than in protecting the consumer.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on some of the things IFSRA has done in the 12 months since it was formally established, arising from its new statutory remit. As regards consumer protection measures, the financial services regulator has taken a number of initiatives, namely, independent consumer guides on mortgages, savings and investments and personal loans and credit have been published; costs surveys on motor insurance, personal current accounts and credit cards have also been undertaken; a consumer helpline, information office and website have been established; the consumer director monitors the market and co-operates with the Competition Authority where appropriate; to ensure that financial service providers act in a fair and transparent way, IFSRA has supplemented pre-existing codes of practice by issuing an interim code of practice to guide the activities of insurance companies, mortgage intermediaries and moneylenders; a comprehensive review of all codes of practice has commenced and three consultation papers have been published in regard to conduct of business, the marketing and sale of tracker bonds and the mandatory competency requirements of financial service providers who deal with consumers; in order to foster safe and sound financial institutions in a competitive market, new client <Col N="1162"/>money requirements that apply to investment firms and stockbrokers have been amended and new money laundering guidance notes lave been issued; and new governance requirements for stockbrokers were introduced and the financial service regulator&rsquo;s staff are assisting my Department in reviewing client asset legislation.</P>
      <P>This is a substantial list of actions taken or under way in IFSRA. The Government&rsquo;s actions will also continue to speak for themselves. Last year was the time for a radical overhaul of the institutional structures for financial services regulation. This year, we are in action again with a second, complementary, item of legislation which will give further powers to IFSRA to protect consumers and the financial system. Earlier today in the D&aacute;il we considered Report Stage of this Bill, under which IFSRA will be given powers, with appropriate constitutional safeguards, to apply financial sanctions to miscreant financial institutions and also, in certain circumstances, to individuals within those institutions. For institutions, the penalties proposed can be up to &euro;5 million. Individuals may be disqualified from working in the financial sector.</P>
      <P>In addition to the penalties provisions, the Bill provides for significant additional powers for IFSRA to require formal statements from institutions in regard to their compliance with legislation, that is, compliance statements, on which IFSRA may also require sign-off by auditors. This provision will be in addition to provisions of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 which will impose an obligation on the directors of companies to prepare and publish a directors compliance statement. The legislation currently before the D&aacute;il will put the ombudsman system for financial services on a stronger footing, ensuring for the first time that there will be a single scheme serving the whole range of financial services consumers, operating on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with the AIB affair. Among the responsibilities transferred to IFSRA under the 2003 Act were the functions which formerly rested with the Director of Consumer Affairs under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. This Act required credit institutions to notify the director of their charges. However, it did not make a failure to notify correct amounts to the director an offence.</P>
      <P>IFSRA is carrying out a serious and detailed investigation and we should not prejudge the facts until it is completed. A team of senior inspectors has already advanced its work and, as a result, IFSRA has established that it should be possible to identify from records at least two thirds of the customers who have been affected by incorrect charges.</P>
      <P>Naturally, the focus of the IFSRA investigation is initially concentrated on identifying the amount involved and the customers affected. The next phase of the IFSRA investigation will involve finding out how this could have arisen in the first <Col N="1163"/>place and then persisted over an eight-year period. It will also identify whatever measures need to be taken to address the issue.</P>
      <P>IFSRA has also agreed with AIB that a &euro;25 million deposit will be made with the Central Bank to cover anticipated costs of reimbursing customers, including interest. An independent investigation has also been set up. I note that this investigation has been set a very tight deadline for reporting of mid-June, which I think is right. The public needs the reassurance of knowing that this matter is being pursued vigorously and that remedial measures are being put in place.</P>
      <P>As regards ongoing official policing of the 1905 Act provisions, I understand there is a spot-checking system in place and the majority of these spot checks have concentrated on foreign currency cash transactions. These account for the vast majority of foreign exchange transactions carried out by consumers. Random checks do not pick up everything, and I understand the IFSRA will consider any changes to the regulatory procedure required following its investigation in the current case.</P>
      <P>The chief executive of IFSRA stated: &ldquo;This case, I believe, clearly demonstrates that we do have powers and we are willing and able to use them on behalf of the consumer.&rdquo; However, he has noted a desire that IFSRA would have additional powers to levy penalties or sanctions in appropriate cases. As I have already outlined, the Central Bank and Financial Services of Ireland Bill 2003 is currently before the D&aacute;il and will address these issues.</P>
      <P>I have also tabled Report Stage amendments to the Bill currently before the D&aacute;il which will ensure that in addition to the new penalty powers of IFSRA, breaches of the bank charge provisions of the Consumer Credit Act may also be treated as an offence, with all that this entails.</P>
      <P>In human institutions, mistakes will sometimes occur. Banks need to ensure they have compliance and monitoring systems in place to minimise the number of mistakes and to identify those mistakes when they happen. They must also be fully committed to compensating consumers who lose out, must be open in their communications with the regulator and must foster a culture of openness, professionalism and fair dealing among their staff.</P>
      <P>I turn briefly to the question of mis-selling of financial products. There is public concern about the way banks sell their products. Some cases have been highlighted in the media recently about situations in which elderly customers have purchased products that seem on the face of it inappropriate for them. As with any product, customers need to be vigilant at all times. Banking products are complex, but independent information is increasingly available from the regulator. I accept it is not always possible for all consumers to assess the risks involved in the more complex products, or right to expect them to do so. Banks should have procedures in place to <Col N="1164"/>ensure that products are not mis-sold. This is something the IFSRA is actively examining.</P>
      <P>IFSRA will set new and additional standards for banks in this area. These standards will be embodied in new codes of practice being developed following the public consultation process, which recently concluded. If a regulated entity ignores or breaches those codes, the regulator will be able to penalise it. When consumers feel they have been mis-sold a product, they will be able to go to the statutory financial services ombudsman for redress.</P>
      <P>To sum up, a great deal has been happening recently in regard to financial sector regulation. The Government has sponsored legislation, enacted last year, to establish IFSRA, which is already proactively managing the situation that has arisen in AIB. The Government has, through the legislation, considerably extended the consumer protection and education functions of IFSRA and has allowed it the resources to carry out those functions. Further legislation is already on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      <P>We should await the results of IFSRA&rsquo;s detailed investigation before drawing final conclusions on the particular case, but it is clear that IFSRA has in its first year taken a significant number of actions to protect consumers and the financial system, and additional work continues.</P>
      <P>We must all, Government, Oireachtas, regulators and financial institutions, learn the lessons that will emerge from the AIB case and from other issues that come to light in order to provide greater safety and reassurance to the financial services consumers. The Government is determined to do its part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. He does not sound his best today; perhaps he reflects the state of banking in this country and the lack of public confidence in the system.</P>
      <P>I regret this issue is coming before the House today when, perhaps, debate is still ongoing in the D&aacute;il. My colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, has put forward amendments on the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, but I am not in a position to say whether they were accepted. The timing on this could have been better organised. It does not help that the Minister had to tear across here from the D&aacute;il for this debate nor that the report will not be out until mid-June. This debate tries, in a way, to pre-empt the report. While the debate concerns the general banking system, all of us will of course refer to the AIB controversy because it is fresh in our minds.</P>
      <P>We cannot blame the public for its cynicism on this issue. We know that if any of us owe money to the bank, it is not long before we get a reminder. In the past, prior to the time when interest rates rose so high in the 1980s, people were encouraged to borrow heavily. However, when matters started to go wrong, the banks were very quick to call in loans and repossess property and farms. This is still fresh in people&rsquo;s memories.</P><Col N="1165"/>
      <P>The Minister admitted that the overcharging in AIB was going on for eight years, an astonishing length of time. He mentioned in his speech a proposed penalty of &euro;5 million. Those who pick up the tab for the &euro;5 million will not be the offenders but the bank&rsquo;s customers, because the money will come from general banking charges. How can we put forward sanctions that will hit the offenders and not be passed on to the ordinary customer?</P>
      <P>The Minister hopes the Central Bank inquiry will ascertain approximately two thirds of the customers who are owed money. What plans has he got to ensure the remaining third will receive compensation or that no bogus applications are made for compensation? It is a sorry mess. The overcharging took place over a period eight years and I imagine some people genuinely entitled to claim compensation have forgotten about their transactions.</P>
      <P>While AIB said it was unaware of the overcharging, a claim was made in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday that in 1998 the Director of Consumer Affairs had asked the bank to ensure it was not overcharging for these services, but the bank failed to confirm whether it was overcharging. This implies a breakdown in the system. When asked to clarify whether it was overcharging, the bank did not even reply to the Director of Consumer Affairs. It is not right that consumers should be treated with contempt by the banks who give the impression that they are untouchable. It was only because of media hounding that AIB came clean on this issue. It said at first that it had lodged &euro;14 million with the Central Bank to cover reimbursement, but that has now been increased to a stunning &euro;25 million. It is quite possible this could increase further.</P>
      <P>Many questions must be asked of the banking institutions and the Government. Why is an internal inquiry taking place and why is the Garda not involved? Why do we ask an institution to investigate itself? Has the Minister full confidence in that system? Should not an outside agency such as the Garda be brought in to investigate the overcharging? Why have the Taoiseach or T&aacute;naiste not apologised for allowing a situation develop where the integrity of the banking system was again denigrated? Why must the consumer take the pain while those meting it out get away scot free? What will it take for the Government to give consumers the voice they deserve and which employers and workers currently enjoy?</P>
      <P>AIB customers would probably not have faced such overcharging had IFSRA been up and running prior to 1 May 2003. Unfortunately, internal rows between the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste led to the delay. Currently, the Government has no power to seriously punish AIB for its misdeeds. One would wonder what view the board of directors of AIB and other institutions which have been caught out in the past hold on that. There are no sanctions.</P><Col N="1166"/>
      <P>In the past few months my colleague in Carlow-Kilkenny, Deputy Hogan, has highlighted the rip-off culture, of which the charging of 1% instead of 0.5% commission is a prime example. We have consistently called for the following measures: regular price surveys to be conducted to highlight good value and name and shame those charging excessive prices; a price league website with prices on all major products to be created; codes of conduct to be developed for service providers and retailers on issues such as passing on exchange rate movements; a good practice provider quality mark to be devised and promoted for suppliers of goods and services who agree to be bound by relevant codes of practice; the local authority to be worked with to drive a pro-consumer agenda at local level involving regular price surveys and measures that protect consumers&rsquo; interests against local cartels; fines to be imposed for non-display of price lists in banks, petrol stations, pubs, hairdressers and so on &mdash; the fine of &euro;127 should be increased to a maximum of &euro;3,000 to put pressure on people to give full information to consumers; and consumers to be represented in national partnership agreements. It is clear that recent agreements have been dominated by the producer with little thought given to consumers.</P>
      <P>It is important that workers in the banking system, who are doing their job and are unfortunately being tainted by a minority within the banking sector, have their good name restored. People must have confidence in the banking sector, which must not be above the law. It is important that we impose real sanctions, not token gestures. It is also important that the sanctions hit offenders, not consumers who are already being hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House to discuss this very important and topical issue. The Minister cannot be completely satisfied with the conduct of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority given its neglect in exposing the rip-off by AIB of approximately &euro;25 million, which has been lodged with the Central Bank. It could be more than that, yet the very well paid officials of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority did not detect it. If I were responsible for that organisation I would question my own position. It is meant to be a regulatory authority but it failed to detect something that had been going on for eight years. Although it has not been in existence for eight years, its first action on being set up should have been to find out all the rates and costs and to check on what was approved by the Central Bank. That seems a basic requirement. I am quite surprised at the lack of detection. This might not have been detected were it not for a whistleblower reporting it to RTE whose chief news correspondent, Mr. Charlie Bird, efficiently and actively took up the case and took on the role of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.</P><Col N="1167"/>
      <P>I understand approximately 10% will be untraceable because it relates to small investments prior to the introduction of the euro and involved cheques and different exchange rates. It would be impossible to trace. I stated here some weeks ago that in the circumstances the Minister should hammer the point home to the AIB. As a long-time customer of AIB I have always found it an excellent bank. The staff at local branch level are certainly not responsible but it seems they must pay for these mistakes. Given the upcoming People in Need Telethon television extravaganza on Friday, 21 May, it would be an excellent gesture if the &euro;2.5 million that is owing to small investors throughout the country who cannot be traced, were donated to try to rescue at least some of the PR losses that have been incurred. The whistleblower has done the country some service in this regard, given of the length of time this was going on.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time AIB has been in difficulty. The Minister will recall the Government having to rescue the situation regarding the Insurance Corporation of Ireland when he and I were Deputies. The Government should have taken equity in AIB at that time because it has never repaid the Government. It was an extraordinary debacle and scandal caused by abuse of the system. The risks against which insurance was taken out were unreal. Tornadoes and other types of risk that nobody else would touch were insured against and people made a lot of money out of the situation. Many people acted fraudulently in their work.</P>
      <P>The Bank of Ireland does not have a great record either. Some $700 million was lost in the First Bank of Maryland and, again, no heads rolled. If a Minister were responsible for a loss of $700 million he or she would not remain very long in his or her job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Martin Cullen, and the electronic voting debacle? Should he resign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I said $700 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us hear Deputy Leyden without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We await the report of National Irish Bank on how it has conducted its affairs over the past while.</P>
      <P>In the report it is stated that regarding the sale of products to individuals it is very important that it is explained, particularly to elderly people who may not be conscious of the dangers, that if people sell their home to a bank for, say, &euro;0.25 million, they could lose &euro;18,000 per annum if they are in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension. It is a shock to learn that is the case. Credit is due to public broadcasters such as Mr. Joe Duffy of RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; who exposed this <Col N="1168"/>and brought it to public attention. This demonstrates that it is worthwhile having a fearless public service broadcasting organisation.</P>
      <P>During the course of the discussion on 12 May I referred to Shared Home Investment Plan Limited. I stated that I believed it was not properly informing its clients. SHIP is just one of the organisations involved in this area. I do not know who owns SHIP, whether it is owned by a bank or by individuals or private companies. It is a very reputable company. Its product can be very beneficial for those in receipt of contributory pensions who want to enjoy life, lead the life of a millionaire and head off to the Bahamas or go on a world cruise. It is possible for them to use the money obtained for the equity in their house to enjoy themselves rather than leaving it to be inherited by somebody who is not doing much for them. It is a very attractive scheme. SHIP has taken exception to the concerns I expressed regarding the holders of non-contributory State pensions and the impact equity release plans can have on eligibility for those benefits. In a letter to me the Chairman of SHIP, Mr. William Kane stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">I wish to assure you that none of SHIP&rsquo;s clients to date have been affected adversely in this regard and as part of our compulsory consultation with clients and their families this issue is now discussed in order that there is no confusion. In addition our letter of offer which is sent to clients and their solicitors contains a specific clause highlighting the issue in question. I hope that you are therefore reassured that our clients are kept fully informed in this regard. I would welcome an opportunity to meet with you to address any other queries you might have. I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have read this into the record because &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; could be challenged or a claim for damages made against it by the companies mentioned. We enjoy full parliamentary privilege which we should use with caution and respect. I am being very careful. I made the point that people should be warned and I have read the response from the company in question. I suggest that when non-contributory pensions are sent out they should be accompanied by an explanatory leaflet explaining that if beneficiaries receive a large amount of capital assistance from a bank or other organisation they will lose benefits such as sickness benefit, old age pension and so on. It is a major blow to lose one&rsquo;s medical card and other benefits, simply because one wants to get this large amount of money. The Minister is aware that inflation is currently very low. The return on one&rsquo;s investment from the banks is practically nil, at approximately 1%. We should be alerted to this matter, in the circumstances. It is the responsibility of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Minister, Deputy Coughlan. I would appreciate if the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s senior officials could bring the matter <Col N="1169"/>to the attention of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I accept that SHIP and other organisations may be informing people of their responsibilities and the danger of losing their benefits. I ask the Minister to provide copies of the leaflet to warn everyone about the problems in this regard. I do not deny that the service, which is being provided by an honourable registered company, can be beneficial to many people.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I cannot say I am particularly satisfied with IFSRA. The Minister, Senators Ross and O&rsquo;Toole and others have said we have an opportunity to give the authority teeth. We should allow it to take action, to impose penalties and to ensure that organisations face some sanctions if they do not fulfil their responsibilities. There are no sanctions at present. Financial institutions can lodge a voluntary contribution to the Central Bank, to be returned in the event of it being exonerated in any way or if there is some excuse for its activities. The Minister said today that he proposes to amend the Bill to allow IFSRA to be more effective. It cannot operate in a productive manner if it cannot impose restrictions and sanctions.</P>
      <P>IFSRA was established independent of the Central Bank to try to achieve more control of financial institutions. It may be doing a good job, but the Minister cannot be satisfied that it did not detect this abuse of the system, but instead had to depend on journalists. If a whistleblower provided such information to Senators, I am sure they would use the facilities available to them to bring the matter to the attention of the public. RTE&rsquo;s decision to run with the story was quite courageous in the circumstances. In fairness to AIB, it put up its hands and admitted that problems had been ongoing for a considerable amount of time and there is a possibility it will give an apology to its customers. Mistakes are made by every organisation and I do not argue that mistakes were not made in this instance. Given that the mistakes have been detected, we have an opportunity to make changes.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether IFSRA has control over the credit card business of organisations. Credit cards can be open to abuse. Many more safeguards are needed in respect of the use of credit cards. I cannot understand why so much fraud is allowed to take place, given that it is possible to add security features to credit cards. I am not sure if IFSRA has any control in this regard. If not, we should consider examining this area. I recently received returns on my credit card from companies that were not registered. I did not know who they were, as they were not registered as limited liability companies and they did not supply telephone numbers. It is confusing to receive such demands. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his patience. I thank the Minister for attending this debate.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1170"/>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to discuss some of Senator Leyden&rsquo;s points. It would be wrong to state, as Senator Leyden did &ldquo;in fairness to AIB&rdquo;, that it came out with its hands up, admitted everything and behaved well. That is not the case because AIB behaved disgracefully. It misled the public even though it had been caught red-handed. It put the figure of &euro;14 million into the public arena, but it was forced within days to raise the figure to &euro;25 million. AIB tried to distance its senior staff from this fraud by trying to blame junior staff, but it was forced within days to admit that the behaviour was not exclusively confined to junior staff. I would not particularly trust a so-called &ldquo;independent&rdquo; AIB inquiry, given that it has behaved in such a manner. The bank gave an incorrect date. It stated the problems had been ongoing for eight years, but they had been continuing for ten years. It misled the public in that regard. AIB also said it was sorry that the customers affected are untraceable, but it was forced to admit within a week that at least 80% of the rip-offs, as they have rightly been called, are traceable. In its response to this accusation, AIB misled the public on at least four counts. It displayed a certain arrogance by handling the matter in such an absurd manner. It took a week for the Chairman of AIB to move in to issue a statement, which was so close to countermanding and contradicting the first statement that it must have been a matter of acute embarrassment to the bank.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to tackle this big issue in isolation. I am glad the Minister broadened it somewhat, because it should not be considered in isolation from what happened in the last two weeks. The events of recent weeks are no more than a symptom of what is wrong with Irish and foreign banks. Nobody could consider Irish banks to be symbols of private enterprise, risk-takers, those who assist industry and those who make a great contribution to the country&rsquo;s GDP. It is a long time since Members of the Oireachtas, particularly those on the left wing, argued that banks should be fully owned by the Government, or that they should be nationalised. I do not believe they should be nationalised, but we should ask questions. Who are the banks? For whose benefit are they run? I contend that they should be run for the benefit of the small shareholders who own them, in essence. It is obvious that some small shareholders are owned, in turn, by large shareholders, who use their blocs to support each other.</P>
      <P>The banks should be run for the benefit of small shareholders and consumers, but they are not run in such a manner. There is plenty of evidence to suggest the banks have become some sort of runaway monsters that are run more for the benefit of bankers than for the benefit of shareholders or customers. I wish to cite comments made by the chief executive of Bank of Ireland in an interview last week. I have already pointed this out in another place, so I apologise if anybody is aware of it. The chief executive gave <Col N="1171"/>a staggering reply when he was asked about recent events in AIB. He said defensively that we have a wonderful banking system. He chose an extraordinary week in which to make such a remark. It is evident, from his replies to that and other questions during the week, that the chief executive of Bank of Ireland is incapable of saying anything bad about AIB. It is quite extraordinary.</P>
      <P>It is likely, in any other commercial rivalry, that a chief executive would take some advantage of the discomfort of another to try to pinch customers. When the chief executive of Bank of Ireland was asked last week about AIB&rsquo;s problems, he said that we have a wonderful banking system. What can we derive from the fact that during another interview he described AIB as a very competitive bank? Can one imagine Michael O&rsquo;Leary adopting a similar approach in respect of Aer Lingus? If Aer Lingus was caught charging too much, would he say &ldquo;hold it there boys, this is a great airline, they are a very competitive lot&rdquo;? It just would not happen. What does it tell one about the difference between the banks and really strong companies with an enterprise ethos? It tells one that the banks automatically protect each other as a knee-jerk reaction. They will not put the boot into each other and will never say a bad word about each other. That was notable last week. While I am open to contradiction about this because I do not read everything that is written about banks, I did not see a single banker put the boot into AIB. I did not hear anyone from the Ulster Bank, National Irish Bank, the Bank of Ireland, Anglo-Irish Bank or anybody else saying &ldquo;Come to us, we won&rsquo;t overcharge you&rdquo;. Would it not be natural for them to say &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll charge you less and we haven&rsquo;t been charging you these appalling amounts for so long&rdquo;? They did not say that, however. They were either silent or said things are okay and we have a great banking system. They are dead right &mdash; it is a great banking system for them, but not for the customers or shareholders.</P>
      <P>Approximately three weeks ago, at the annual general meeting of AIB, all eight or nine resolutions were passed by 97% to 3%. That tells me that the Bank of Ireland, Irish Life and all the other large banking shareholders were voting for each other. Of course, if one of them voted against any resolution at an AGM, the others would do likewise and who knows what would happen then. We might have a competitive banking system, God forbid. It would ruin their party. It is very unlikely to happen in this country, however, given the way in which we are allowing these sort of things to go on.</P>
      <P>It is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s attitude that, having discovered an abuse of the sort practised by AIB, we suddenly find that damn all can be done about it. That is because under the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, there are no penalties for this particular offence. The banks <Col N="1172"/>can rip off &euro;25 million but cannot be penalised. How did that happen? It is an extraordinary indictment of governmental deference to the banks that they can commit an offence by taking at least &euro;25 million, although I am sure it is a lot more than that, including other spheres as well, and nothing can happen.</P>
      <P>We now have a new regulator who has forced them morally at least to put &euro;25 million in escrow in the Central Bank. That is an improvement but the banks continue on their merry way and we see more revelations each week, not only about the first issue but also about travellers&rsquo; cheques and other areas where they overcharged without being detected. I contend that this is a far deeper problem than AIB.</P>
      <P>I now turn specifically to the AIB affair itself. Some of the drafting in the Minister&rsquo;s speech is somewhat depressing and dilutes the offence. In establishment channels &mdash; maybe in the Department of Finance or higher up &mdash; there is an instinct to dilute the offence and protect the banks. In his speech, the Minister referred to this offence under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, stating: &ldquo;This Act required credit institutions to notify the director of their charges. However, it did not make a failure to notify correct amounts to the director an offence.&rdquo; However, the Minister is not talking about a failure to notify correct amounts to the director, but about a fraud. He is talking about a bank charging an illegal amount and probably doing it knowingly, yet the way the Minister&rsquo;s speech was phrased indicates to me that it is only a soft Government interpretation of what is going on and that there is still an inclination to let the financial institutions off and give them the benefit of the doubt on this occasion.</P>
      <P>In his speech, the Minister also stated: &ldquo;As regards ongoing official policing of the 1905 Act provisions, I understand there is a spot-checking system in place and the majority of these spot checks have concentrated on foreign currency cash transactions.&rdquo; Why did these spot checks never come up with a result? If such spot checks were going on, why was the overcharging not detected by IFSRA? At least &euro;25 million was involved, which means that hundreds of millions were changing hands in this offensive way, involving abuse, by being channelled through foreign exchange transactions in this category. It seems to me that the spot checks were inadequate. The banks were aware that IFSRA was a toothless tiger because the spot checks being carried out by the regulator were not working. While the Minister said that IFSRA has done all sorts of good things by taking initiatives and producing immense amounts of documentation and information for consumers, it does not appear to have detected the worst offences that were going on at that time.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, IFSRA&rsquo;s work is vital when it comes to explaining complicated financial products which people do not understand, but it is not good enough to use the <i>caveat emptor</i> <Col N="1173"/>approach. We must find a method of ensuring that consumers who purchase complicated products, such as tracker bonds, are aware of what they are buying.</P>

	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak about financial regulation. In recent years, this House has had many debates on the banking sector, including bank charges and the way in which banks do business generally. The largest financial institutions in the State operate a near-monopoly position whereby they all seem to offer the same services at the same cost. It is unfortunate that there seems to be no sense of competitiveness between the financial institutions. If one examines these institutions, one finds there is very little difference between them. We ought to be concerned about that because of their power over the ordinary man or woman in the street.</P>
      <P>I saw a particular example of this power quite recently when I was doing some work for a constituent who was having difficulty in making mortgage repayments. The constituent managed to get everything sorted out and wanted to pull a number of loans together in order to re-mortgage the entire amount. He was able to show through earnings and other income that he was in a position to manage the repayments. We had a meeting with the bank but it was not interested in re-mortgaging the deal with this individual. The bank was only interested in advising the person to go elsewhere with his business but if he did so, he would have to repay all the loans in three months. The bank had promoted these loans to the individual as a solution and had driven him to this position, yet it was now absolving itself of responsibility. The institution to which he was referred, said that if he got things in order in three months, it would examine the matter.</P>
      <P>The kind of power that banking organisations have over people&rsquo;s everyday lives is nothing short of scandalous. The abuse by certain institutions and by certain managers in certain locations, indicates their overriding objective in doing business is to make a profit. I manage a business and I accept that profit is important but if profit is king and nothing else matters then it is a sad state of affairs. The business sector has a responsibility to the community and to the society in which it operates. Making generous, fancy donations in terms of sponsorship to the People in Need Telethon, the Special Olympics etc., does not absolve one from the need to operate business in a fair and equitable manner for the benefit of everyone in the State, namely, shareholders, employees and customers.</P>
      <P>On many occasions in this House we talked about credit cards and the exorbitant interest rates charged. In this State they charge the highest interest rates in Europe on outstanding balances at the end of the month. Many people are not aware that even if one makes the minimum payment at the end of each month with <Col N="1174"/>certain institutions, one still pays interest on the entire balance. Making the minimum payment merely reduces the capital owed, but makes no impact on the interest. Interest still has to be paid from the beginning of the month, even if one has made a payment during the month. This sort of small print which we do not notice on our credit card bills is not acceptable. Nor is the arrival every six or nine months of a letter which urges a person to sign up for more credit regardless of a person&rsquo;s credit history, in cases where it may be obvious that an increasing balance shows the person is not able to use the facility in an appropriate manner. What is going on? Is there no conscience involved? When one eventually tells the institution that one is having difficulties, it suggests converting the debt into a long-term loan, which is cheaper. Of course it is cheaper, because the institution has inflated the interest charges in the beginning. One then gets a call from some other institution urging one to transfer the credit balance and offering a six-month interest-free period. This is not fair.</P>
      <P>We have also seen loans being provided through ATM machines. One might be stuck in town on a Saturday afternoon or night, spending money, and it is suggested there is no problem because one can borrow through the ATM machine. There is no-one at hand as one&rsquo;s voice of conscience. There is huge encouragement to borrow more money. It takes a very strong individual to withstand that constant bombardment of &ldquo;buy now, pay later&rdquo; and the urge to continue to buy. Because of Ireland&rsquo;s banking system one does not have to worry about paying later, because the banks make so much profit from selling one money continually, without conscience. That is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Consider the actions the banks are taking among various communities. We have talked about this in this House over a number of years. The issue has gone off the boil, yet banks are closing rural branches all over the country and are cancelling services. They cancelled the mobile banking service in Connemara recently because it was not making money. They say they have installed ATM machines and that facilities have been made available in branch offices in Oughterard and Clifden. If one lives in Rosmuc, however, one might have to travel 20 miles on public transport to lodge one&rsquo;s few euro. Nor can one cash a cheque these days. The bank in effect says it cannot possibly hand over one&rsquo;s money from one&rsquo;s own bank account, if one arrives with a cheque. The cheque must be lodged first. In certain circumstances, if it is drawn on the branch that one attends, one might get the money immediately. If the money is drawn on another bank however, or another branch of the same bank, one just has to wait for it to be cleared. The bank then holds one&rsquo;s money, making no apologies, while making obscene amounts of profits. The bank has no conscience regarding its overall objective as a realistic and proper part of the community.</P><Col N="1175"/>
      <P>Financial regulation is vitally important, but banking culture must change. We cannot continue to allow the banking industry to abuse the power it has in our community, society and economy. We need to say &ldquo;stop&rdquo;. I welcome IFSRA and I expect and hope it will do a good job. I commend what it has already done. It has a difficult job. It is for us, the public, the bank customers and shareholders, to make it clear to banks that we will not accept an abuse of power in an industry in which we invest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. Listening to these debates, I sometimes wonder if I am living in the same world all the time, or if people change so much. What brings politics most into disrepute is when people shoot from the hip with knee-jerk responses to the issue of the day in a manner completely at odds with all they have been saying on the issue for the previous six years.</P>
      <P>There was a debate recently in this House on compliance and compliance statements. I fought for three hours against both sides of the House to get support in the IASA Bill in order that a director&rsquo;s compliance statement would require directors of companies to sign off on the statement that their companies are compliant with all the rules and regulations. I could not get agreement. That Bill eventually had to be changed in order to satisfy people on both sides of the House who talked of what an unfair burden this was putting on company directors. One man asked how they could possibly be held responsible in such situations.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden is no longer in the House, but I hope that regarding all I have heard since this debate began, and the strong line promised, I will see the same again. The Minister of State said the IFSRA Bill coming through the Houses will give the IFSRA authority to require compliance statements from directors and that it may also require auditors to sign off on them. There should be no &ldquo;may&rdquo; about it. It should be an absolute essential. That is the reality of the matter, though we have heard much nonsense about it. There will always be people to do things wrongly, to take shortcuts and to rip us off. In a well-run pub I would be ripped off by more in one night than by means of this 0.5% or 1% nonsense that we have been hearing of for the past two months. Charlie Bird makes a big issue of this, and it is a big issue. I am not making light of it, yet it is very small in the light of some other issues we are considering.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the banks some questions. Why, 15 years after the Cecchini report, which the Cathaoirleach dealt with in his other life when we were opening the Common Market, does it take five to six weeks to get a personal cheque cleared in Europe? Why is there no cheque clearing system in Europe? Why is it that we are restricted to buying a credit card service in the country of residence? Why can I not get a credit card in <Col N="1176"/>Brussels and use it in Ireland? I would like to see legislation allowing that. I can use my Irish credit card in Brussels, and pay dearly for it.</P>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Senator Cox about the purposes of the financial institutions. They are in the business for the money. I am not surprised at that. They are not providing a social service, do not want to do so and are not paid to do so. What annoys me in all this legislation is that we penalise institutions. That is a joke. We penalise the AIB shareholders for something wrong done by its directors. The directors do not suffer even the loss of a shilling. If the institution is fined, it does not matter to the directors. The individuals responsible should be fined. We are finally confronting this issue in the proposed legislation, so that in some situations we may penalise the individuals. That is how it should be.</P>
      <P>I ask Senator Cox to consider the following. Nobody on the other side of the House supports the maintenance of mutualisation in large financial institutions. The Minister would confirm this if he were here. Regular representation is made to him to allow building societies and other institutions to be sold off, to allow carpet-baggers receive a few thousand euro, with the company then owned by the shareholders. People then ask why they are in it for the profit. The EBS will be the only large mutual company left. There is no debate in this House as to the impact that makes. It is the core of the point that Senator Cox made about whether companies are in business as mutual societies to do good for the customers, or to make a profit by selling it off. When the next largest building society is about to be sold off in the next six months to the shareholders, there will be cheers and support. Nobody will care. Up until now such institutions have been working for people buying houses and trying to get houses built, which is why building societies were initially established. Nobody cares about that. It is all about the quick profit.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will not believe what I am about to say. I am glad he is sitting down to hear it. This morning, a Member on the other side of the House stood up on the Order of Business and complained about telephone charges. In fairness, he was not here when we had this big debate eight or nine years ago. We said the selling off and privatisation of Eircom would not reduce prices; it was never meant to do so. We are now worried about broadband. I assure Members that if Eircom was still owned by the State, we would have broadband in every house in Ireland if there was a copper wire going into someone&rsquo;s telephone pole. That will not happen now because Eircom is in business simply to make a profit. That is an issue at which we should look.</P>
      <P>There is another issue at which I would look and which is much more important than the<?oasys [jy?>0.5%. Members should go into a branch of any bank and look at the cost of foreign exchange. How many speakers today have checked the cost of sending currency within the European Union? There are three price ranges for sending money <Col N="1177"/>from an Irish bank to a bank anywhere else in the European Union. The price to send money which will get there in its own time is quite cheap. One is not given a date as to when it might go through. There is another price of over &euro;30 to send money by the close of business and there is an in between price which will get money there in two days. If one writes a cheque, one has no notion how long it will take to clear &mdash; it could take five or six weeks. The bank has our money for three days and it is working for it morning, noon and night. Money being transferred apparently goes nowhere after 5 p.m. in the evening and goes nowhere on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday. The banks are making money out of it. That is a legislative issue and there is no reason we should be tied in to such situations.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden and other speakers referred to the shared home investment plan, SHIP. It is a fine idea for some people who have many assets but no money, or plenty of equity but no shillings. If they are properly guided and advised, it can be of great help to them in improving the quality of their lives.</P>
      <P>It seems there is no free market in such areas. My argument with the market is always that whenever it might do us any good, it is never free. The credit card issue raised by Senator Cox is the classic example. Why can someone living in Europe not get a credit card anywhere in Europe? There is no reason they should not be able to do so. We are living in the same euro zone and so on. These are the issues on which there should be legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross referred to the banks. What level of investment does Bank of Ireland Finance, Bank of Ireland Asset Management or Bank of Ireland funds have in AIB? I would say we would fall down if we saw the amount and that we would have much counting to do. I would say if we counted &euro;1,000 per minute, we would be a long time counting the amount of money Bank of Ireland has invested in AIB. The reason it invests in AIB is that there is no competition and Senator Ross is absolutely right in that regard. We need to move on. At the same time it is not about knee-jerk reactions to the 0.5%, sticking the knife in the bank, hitting it hard and dealing with it as harshly as possible because it deserves it. We also need to know the people who are responsible.</P>
      <P>Let us remind ourselves of the hearings of the Committee of Public Accounts a number of years ago which the directors of AIB attended. As the Minister of State&rsquo;s party leader has said time and again, she was told they did not know it was going on in their company. Their internal auditor had brought matters to their attention but they took no notice of them. Reporting within that financial institution is weak, flawed and has failed. It is not a matter of having an investigation to find out the level at which the information stopped. The real question is, why did the people at the top not have structures in place to ensure they got the information. That is what needs to happen.</P><Col N="1178"/>
      <P>As regards looking at the whole question of banking, we should begin by discussing foreign transactions and not only the 0.5%. Let us look at the whole area because what will happen is that next time there is a scandal, we will discuss another aspect. Nobody cares about it. There is no media coverage. This scandal has passed already. There were only four or five speakers today. If this debate had been held one week ago, speakers would have been queuing up outside the door and they would have been looking for extra time. That is the reality. I would like to see how we will deal with these compliance issues.</P>
      <P>Each time the Government brings in a new regulation, a new burden of responsibility in terms of reportage or a commitment of compliance, there is a line up of speakers in this and the other House to oppose it. Members should cast their minds back to the recent debate on the personal injuries assessment board. We were doing what every politician I had heard speak about it for four years wanted, yet all it met were arguments, opposition and people asking about solicitors and the person who would not be looked after. There is no interest in getting it right until the next row takes place.</P>
      <P>We need to look at a recently prepared Government policy document on effective regulation and on the yardstick or benchmarks for effective regulatory procedures which was not debated here. We should not have an over-regulated society. Regulation should be there, but it should be a light touch, real and honest. That is the way we should deal with compliance. What happened in the bank last week is probably happening at the moment in some other area of what some other bank is doing. We must recognise that compliance must be met. There is no point blaming the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority if we have not given it the authority and resources to do the job we require of it. What happened was unfortunate but there are worse things happening every day with which we are compliant, for example, with credit cards, to which Senator Cox referred, with foreign transactions, which I mentioned, and with a million other things, particularly the fact the bank can hold on to our money for three to seven days.</P>
      <P>I spoke to somebody recently who transferred money on the Wednesday before Easter. It was only lodged in the bank to which he was sending it the following Wednesday. The bank said Good Friday was a bank holiday, Saturday was a dead day, nobody worked on a Sunday and the Monday was a bank holiday and nobody worked. When asked where the money was for those four or five days, the bank gave no answer. The bank reopened on the Tuesday and the money finally got there on the Wednesday. It took one week for the money to get there in this day and age when one can press a button and transfer any amount of money from one account to another as a result of computerisation. It is time these people were asked the really hard questions and not about 0.5%, but about the level of service <Col N="1179"/>they are giving, the costs they are charging and the real rip off that is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators for their contributions, although I cannot respond individually to all the points made. Indeed, some of these points will require serious reflection. However, it is fair to say the record of today&rsquo;s contributions should be read carefully by anybody who claims to have a serious interest in the regulation of the financial sector.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues raised are already being dealt with by IFSRA under its existing powers. These powers will be further strengthened in the legislation which is due to come before the House shortly. There has been much activity recently in regard to the regulation of the financial sector. Last year&rsquo;s legislation sponsored by the Government established by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority which is proactively managing the AIB situation. The resources being made available to IFSRA will ensure that it can effectively carry out its functions. These functions are now very much extended, particularly in the context of the protection and the education of the consumer.</P>
      <P>IFSRA, in the short time since it was established, has taken a good number of actions to protect consumers and the financial system. It has been proactive in developing consumer protection and information. This is in addition to dealing with investigations such as that arising from the AIB matter. We should await the results of IFSRA&rsquo;s detailed investigation before coming to a conclusion on that case.</P>
      <P>Codes of practice are an important tool in financial regulation. They existed in some financial service providers before IFSRA was established. Last December, IFSRA introduced interim codes for insurance companies, mortgage intermediaries and money lenders. Good advice principles are incorporated in all these codes but they are not completely uniform across all sectors and products. This lack of uniformity may prevent consumers from fully understanding their rights. To establish this, IFSRA is seeking to develop unified codes which will meet both consumers&rsquo; needs and international best practice.</P>
      <P>IFSRA recently finished a public consultation process. Their consultation document made a point of seeking comments on the needs of older clients. The penalty provisions provided for in the legislation going to the D&aacute;il today will also apply to the enforcement of those codes. If a regulated entity ignores or breaches those codes, the regulator will be able to penalise it. Likewise, if a consumer feels he or she has been mis-sold a product, that person will be able to go to the statutory financial services ombudsman for redress once the Bill has been enacted.</P>
      <P>I will turn briefly to issues of compliance with the legislation and the compliance culture generally. Senators will be aware that the Central <Col N="1180"/>Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2003 will shortly be coming before this House. Provisions in that Bill will give the financial regulator the power to require the directors of a financial institution to provide it with a compliance statement. Once the Bill has been enacted, the regulator will have the power to require the directors of a financial institution to provide, on a tailored basis if necessary, a statement on their compliance with specific legislation, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1995, or a specific code, such as the code of practice for credit institutions issued under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that, apart from the provision in this Bill, the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 will impose an obligation on company directors to prepare and publish a directors&rsquo; compliance statement. That statement must cover the company&rsquo;s compliance with the Companies Act 1990, tax law and any other enactments that provide a legal framework within which the company operates and that may materially affect the company&rsquo;s financial statements. That will also embrace the legal framework within which regulated financial services companies operate.</P>
      <P>Financial sector regulation poses immense challenges for all us legislators. In his contribution, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, explained the broad range of activity, both regulatory and legislative, going on at present. We should acknowledge that lessons will be learnt from recent situations and that IFSRA will now have the powers that it needs for that. Our response to such matters should make us better prepared to meet future challenges and new issues as they emerge in financial service regulation. All stakeholders &mdash; the Government, the Oireachtas, the regulators and the financial institutions &mdash; will need to be constantly vigilant so that consumers&rsquo; needs can be treated as a priority.</P>

    <Title>Interpretation Bill 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to introduce the Interpretation Bill 2000 in the Seanad and to outline its purpose and content. Most Acts and statutory instruments contain definition or interpretation provisions. They are there to make the legislation concerned more coherent by reducing the need for repetition. They also allow legislation to be shorter and improve clarity. Some interpretation matters arise time and again in legislation.</P><Col N="1181"/>
      <P>Due to their general application, these have from time to time been gathered together and included in an interpretation Act, which was then applied to all subsequent Acts and statutory instruments. In addition, general rules for interpretation of legislation have been developed by the courts over the years and continue to be developed. They form the part of the law that is called judge-made law or the common law. These general rules have often been given statutory effect, sometimes with improved clarity, in interpretation Acts.</P>
      <P>Most jurisdictions have some form of general interpretation enactment that applies to its written laws. These general interpretation enactments provide a means of setting out rules that govern how the provisions of written law are to be construed and include defined terms that are commonly used.</P>
      <P>The first general interpretation Act was the Interpretation Act 1889. Its purpose was twofold: to simplify the reading of statute law by deleting from each statute and statutory instrument standard definitions and phrases and to improve the clarity of legislation by giving statutory effect to certain standard principles of statutory interpretation developed by the courts. These remain the key purposes of any interpretation Act. Apart from minor amending Acts, major interpretation Acts were enacted in 1889, 1923 and 1937.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to repeal and replace all the former interpretation Acts except the Interpretation (Amendment) Act 1997. The 1997 Act deals with the enactment of statutes that abolish common law offences and is being left as a standalone piece of legislation as it is not relevant to the interpretation of most Acts.</P>
      <P>The last major interpretation Act was enacted in 1937. The fact that it has stood the test of time is indicative of its success. However, a new interpretation Act is necessary to deal with changing circumstances, including constitutional and statutory developments since 1937. It is also necessary for four other reasons: to provide new definitions to terms frequently used nowadays in statutes and statutory instruments; to consolidate provisions that have been added by interpretation amendment Acts since 1937; to modernise the language used in the interpretation Act; and to take account of developments in statutory interpretation by the courts.</P>
      <P>The Bill further simplifies the matter for those who have recourse to the interpretation Act. The practice of having to examine one of three sets of interpretation Acts, depending on the date of passing of the Act to be interpreted, will not be necessary in most cases. Due to the proposed repeal of all previous interpretation Acts relating to statute law, the new definitions, which are set out in the second part of the Schedule to the Bill, will apply only to Acts and statutory instruments made after the legislation is enacted and comes into operation. Spent and obsolete provisions in the earlier interpretation Acts, including <Col N="1182"/>definitions of matters that no longer frequently occur in legislation, are not being re-enacted in the Bill.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill also contains safeguard provisions to preserve the effect of obsolete definitions that have been omitted from the new Act. The safeguard provisions also prevent the application of a reworded definition if it causes legal anomalies or absurdities when being applied to an existing Act or statutory instrument.</P>
      <P>Apart from the standard Preliminary and General Part, Part 1, the Bill is divided into five other parts. Part 2 is new and includes miscellaneous rules to assist in interpreting enactments. Part 3, dealing with citation, operation and commencement of enactments, reflects the current law but clarifies a number of matters in that law. Part 4 and the Schedule deal with the meaning and construction of words and expressions. Again it reflects the current law but incorporates a large number of new matters and omits obsolete definitions. Part 5, powers and duties, and Part 6, amendment of enactments, in general reflect the existing law but in more modern language.</P>
      <P>In July 2000, shortly before this Bill was published, the Law Reform Commission published its consultation paper, Statutory Drafting and Interpretation: Plain Language and the Law. In December 2000, the Law Reform Commission published its report on that matter. In the context of both the consultation paper and the report, discussions took place between the commission and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, including the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. As was indicated in the D&aacute;il on 26 June 2001 by the then Government Chief Whip, &ldquo;aspects of the report will be reflected at Committee Stage of the Interpretation Bill&rdquo;. Accordingly, a series of amendments was moved on Committee and Report Stages of the Bill in the D&aacute;il to take account of some of the issues arising from the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report as well as a number of other issues.</P>
      <P>I wish to indicate to the House that I propose moving a number of further technical amendments to the Bill, the most obvious of which is that a new commencement provision will be provided for in section 1 of the Bill. It is proposed that this will be six months after the passing of the Act.</P>
      <P>An interpretation Act is an invaluable tool for those who draft, use or interpret our laws. It helps by eliminating the need for standard interpretation provisions and definitions to be set out extensively in every new Act and statutory instrument which effectively would clutter up the Statute Book. The absence of general principles of interpretation from each individual Act and statutory instrument allows our laws to be read more easily. It also ensures a coherence of interpretation across the Statute Book that would not otherwise be there. Those who draft, regularly read or interpret our laws can do so with more precision and confidence when the <Col N="1183"/>basic rules and definitions of interpretation are of general application, are clearly set out in an interpretation Act and are well known and understood. In summary, although the Bill is of a technical nature and of interest primarily to the legal community, it is very important. It will effect a much-needed modernisation and simplification of the language of the rules and definitions found in the former Interpretation Acts and add new rules and definitions. This will have a positive knock-on effect on the drafting and interpretation of our legislation. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for setting out the reasoning behind this proposal which has been passed by the D&aacute;il where it was thoroughly examined. As the Minister of State said, while this may not be the sexiest Bill to come before the House in a generation or so, it is important. Not only is it a tool for practitioners of law, its applications in court have a direct effect on everyone&rsquo;s civil rights and on the interpretations of decisions and decisions given by the courts. In his introductory remarks the Minister of State referred to the sections as set out in Part 4. It is interesting in looking at this to note the definitions given in section 18(<i>h</i>) to &ldquo;periods of time&rdquo; and in section 18(<i>i</i>) to &ldquo;time&rdquo;. Those issues had a serious impact on the way in which the courts dealt with the question of when warrants can be served and their effects, in connection with another matter in the past month. This is important and we should go through it rigorously on Committee Stage. My party supports this Bill and will go through it as comprehensively as possible.</P>
      <P>There is a real problem in the Oireachtas in terms of the processing of legislation by Members on all sides. Our committee system is not working as it should. It is Executive driven because the Government of the day always has a majority. Only the lead spokespersons for the Opposition parties attend the committee meetings. We should engage ordinary Members on all sides in much greater scrutiny of legislation; that applies to all Bills that come before the House. We have far too many ministerial orders, statutory instruments and secondary legislative mechanisms within our legal system. Too often neither House scrutinises ministerial decisions, which is a shame. If one compares the number of Bills produced 50 years ago with the number produced today, it is probably only a fraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>One has only to go back 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, even 15 years ago, in the Minister of State&rsquo;s experience. Whenever a Minister announces an initiative at a press conference a new Bill seems to be part of the package. That is not a good thing. We should minimise the amount of legislation that comes <Col N="1184"/>before these Houses and spend more time on it to ensure it can be implemented and is up to speed.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the staff in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel who have, under great pressure, done an excellent job for all Governments over many years. I suspect the office suffers a lack of resources and we must support it and ensure the best talent in the country is there to help those of us who must make decisions about the law and implement them. I congratulate them on their work on this and other issues.</P>
      <P>A White Paper on regulation, Regulating Better, some of whose proposals should be reflected in this Bill, was published recently. For example, the Minister of State might give active consideration to the need for consistency in law. A small issue that crops up frequently on this side concerns commencement orders, which usually refer to sections 2 or 3 of the Bill. What is the official position in terms of a commencement order? For example, in one Bill one finds the phrase &ldquo;This Act comes into operation&rdquo; but in another the phrase is &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation&rdquo; on such and such a day. Which is correct? We must have consistency in all the Bills that come before this and the other House. The official position that comes from the Law Reform Commission and others is that the active voice is the correct interpretation. If so, why do other formulations continue to appear in other Bills? We need to proof these.</P>
      <P>We also need clarification on section 6 of this Bill which I do not understand:</P>
      <P LI="1">In construing a provision of any Act or statutory instrument, a court may make allowances for any changes in the law, social conditions, technology, the meaning of words used in an Act or statutory instrument and other relevant matters, which have occurred since the date of the passing of the Act or the making of the statutory instrument, but only in so far as its text, purpose and context permit.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Does this give significant power to judges to reinterpret Acts that have passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas? It is a dangerous precedent to allow people to make that distinction and, in effect, create a new body of law in their courts. I am sure my elementary understanding will be greatly helped by the Minister and his staff as we continue through the Bill.</P>
      <P>Electronic versions of the Acts are also a serious problem. In a court of law where reference is made to an Act of the Oireachtas, one must present the hard copy of the Act in the courtroom. Am I right in saying that electronic versions are not regarded as the complete version of an Act in our court system? If, in this technological age, we are trying to encourage e-government we should regard all Acts in electronic format in the same way as the hard copy. This would help the operation of the courts and is the case already at tribunals of inquiry and <Col N="1185"/>at committees of these Houses. It was particularly helpful during the DIRT Inquiry because when our colleagues referred to various Acts or other important documents, these would come up on a screen. Does the electronic version have the same standing in a courtroom as the hard copy? Why are we not providing for this in the context of section 7 where reference is made to the authentic version?</P>
      <P>With regard to section 10, I am informed that the OECD and the recent White Paper, Regulating Better, have advocated that a review mechanism should be included in all primary legislation. There are two ways of doing this; either we review the legislation and make a commitment by way of a section or include a sunset provision to the effect that the Act will no longer apply after 50 years in operation. This would be a good thing, because, as legislators, we often respond to new developments in society that only have an impact for five, ten or 20 years. Outdated legislation with no regard to modern society still continues to be enforced. Has the Government given consideration to this recommendation, which I understand has come from the White Paper on regulation and the OECD, in regard to putting a review mechanism into primary legislation that comes before the Oireachtas? That would be a useful thing because it would remind us all of the impact of proposed legislation over a specified period of time after which, if necessary, it could be reintroduced. Such a provision already exists in regard to the Offences Against the State Act. It includes a time provision to the effect that each House of the Oireachtas must renew support for the legislation for it to remain in effect. It is done in the case of emergency powers being put in place, but it would also be a worthwhile provision in all legislation.</P>
      <P>Section 11 provides for the use of examples. This is good because legislation would be greatly helped by concrete examples of how it should be used. Not only would it make it easier for everyone to understand, but it would also give legislators a greater comprehension of Bills coming before them. The Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s office should be ruthless in ensuring examples are provided and that Departments produce legislation that show concrete examples that would be of help to the lay person.</P>
      <P>Legislation needs to be set out in the plainest language possible so that every citizen can understand what the Houses of the Oireachtas are implementing in each case. I am aware that equality proofing is carried out on Bills in the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s office. There has been a proposal that Bills should be poverty-proofed. We also need to introduce plain language proofing, so as to allow everyone to comprehend legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>We support the Bill and will work with the Minister on it on Committee Stage. The detail of the Bill is of the utmost importance in terms of <Col N="1186"/>interpretation by justices of the Bench. We should spend adequate time on it, as was the case in the other House. I am sure the experienced Members of this House, who include former Ministers and people of vast experience of parliamentary encounters, would greatly help the Bill by way of scrutiny on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern. I wish to pick up on what the leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, said. I noticed there was no mad rush of enthusiasm for the Bill which was drawn up in 2000. I think it was first dealt with in 2001 and I understand why it appears to have been going around the Houses for a while.</P>
      <P>Although I guided 18 Bills through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the five years I spent in the Department of Public Enterprise, I do not understand the Interpretation Bill. I cannot understand what it is interpreting or what it is setting out to do. The Minister did his best in his commendably short speech &mdash; there is no point going on about it. I do not mean to insult or castigate those who put it together or the officials present, but it is most obscure legislation.</P>
      <P>I noted at the end of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech there was a reference to the fact that a new explanatory memorandum would be produced six months after the enactment of the Bill. The main purpose of the Interpretation Bill is to give greater clarity of expression to former Interpretation Acts. It includes references to 19th century legislation but excludes the 1997 Act, which is a standalone Act. Perhaps I am not taking the correct meaning from it, but I cannot quite understand what it is all about. I downloaded the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, on the Bill in the D&aacute;il. It was lengthier than that of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, but that did not make it better or worse. That is not the point; it was very worthy. Apart from the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech there was a contribution from party spokespersons. I think everyone else ran out. I could not understand anything that was said about the Bill and I do not think anybody else could either. I will just have to accept that its purpose is to bring about clarity in better and plainer English and provide for a greater level of understanding to what we often term, the ordinary person in the street. If one went to Grafton Street or O&rsquo;Connell Street and explained to people that the Interpretation Bill would make legislation plainer and asked a person to spend an hour reading it, I would think he or she would give up after 20 minutes.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the business of law making and the role of the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s office. I am not speaking in ignorance, as I have guided many Bills through the Oireachtas over the years. I often thought the purpose of legislation was to make the understanding of it as difficult as possible so that legislators in both <Col N="1187"/>Houses of the Oireachtas would not have a chance of putting their imprint on the Bill.</P>
      <P>Legislation is about people. I do not refer to this Bill in particular, but to legislation in general. Laws that are enacted have an effect on everybody in some way or other, or an effect on certain groups within society. Their aim is, I hope, to improve the lot of people or to clear up some loopholes in earlier legislation. Legislation is fertile ground for solicitors, barristers and other practitioners of the law. They are all worthy people and I do not have any gripe with them. I do not share the common disregard for those who go about that business.</P>
      <P>Those in the office of the Parliamentary Counsel who put together legislation must observe previous legislation and the likely consequences of particular measures. However, the language used, such as &ldquo;whereas&rdquo;, &ldquo;wherefore&rdquo;, &ldquo;whereto&rdquo;, &ldquo;hereunder&rdquo; and &ldquo;hereafter&rdquo; is arcane and has no relevance to ordinary people. Those involved in drafting legislation may like to think they are in an elitist category. When television monitors were introduced throughout the Houses of the Oireachtas, I often had the impression that such people had many a wry laugh at how far removed we were from their notion of what lawmakers should be.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>If one reads the debates of both Houses, one will see that what we are about is not reflected in the language used in particular items of legislation. I cannot understand that. There is no one whose lot would not be improved if the language used in legislation clearly and more precisely spelt out the detail of such legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes will be aware that when we were drafting our report on Seanad reform, we put forward a suggestion that, before Second Stage is taken, there should be a debating process involving those who stand to be affected by legislation. These people could be invited to the House, given the right to listen to the views of the lawmakers and those responsible for drafting legislation and they would then be in a position to indicate what should happen. Members may believe it is absurd to suggest that we should give the people a say in the development of legislation but I am of the opinion that this would be good. This is one of the matters we will be pursuing strongly in our reform package.</P>
      <P>We operate here in a sort of semi-incestuous atmosphere. We talk to one another and believe that we are doing great work. In the main, we are doing good work but the people who stand to be affected by the law do not know anything about it until Second Stage is taken in either House. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes when a Bill is dealt with by a committee, Members are very much ruled by the civil servants who run the secretariat. I have no complaint about these people because they do great work. However, the people who stand to be materially affected by law <Col N="1188"/>&mdash; for good or ill &mdash; should be involved and consulted in the process at the earlier drafting stage. This would give rise to much better legislation than that envisaged, drafted, submitted and put through the Houses in isolation from those it stands to affect. What I am saying may sound outlandish but why should that be the case? We make legislation on behalf of the people. Such legislation is not intended to hold sway in some form of pious never never land.</P>
      <P>I doubt if matters relating to the Interpretation Bill will become clearer on Committee Stage. I cannot make much sense of the Bill. Members may think I am a silly woman but I am of the opinion that I am speaking the truth. Other people might not like to do so because they may not wish to disturb anybody. Surely, however, the Interpretation Bill should make matters clearer. To interpret something is to understand it and make it clearer. This Bill does not make anything clear to me.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Brian Hayes and the Leader of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, for their contributions.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes raised a number of questions to which I do not have definitive answers. However, I will enter commencement mode and try to make matters clearer for him. I understand that the Law Reform Commission has issued a report which will change the terminology used in commencement provisions. The Minister dealing with the Bill on Committee Stage will go into that matter in greater detail.</P>
      <P>As regards section 6, the explanatory memorandum provides greater clarity and states that the section will enable a court, when interpreting an enactment, to make allowances for certain changes which have occurred since the enactment was passed or made but without going so far as to encroach on the province of the Legislature. It also states that this follows the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in its report, Statutory Drafting and Interpretation: Plain Language and the Law, and that this principle is also applied expressly through the interpretation of statutory instruments. This section represents an attempt to solve the particular problems that have arisen in the past and have been considered in such cases such as Keane <i>v</i>. An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 1997, Universal Studios <i>v</i>. Mulligan in 1998 and Mandarin Records <i>v</i>. MCPS (Ireland) Ltd. in 1999. These difficulties flow from changes which occurred during the period between the enactment of the statute and its interpretation. The Senator may deal with that matter in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>In respect of electronic versions, the authentic version is that signed by the President and enrolled in the Supreme Court office. There is a catch-up period for electronic versions. At present, there are approximately 80 years&rsquo; worth of prior legislation which must be captured electronically.</P>

	<P>How many years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What will be the position then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume it will become an authentic version. The legislation is contained on a CD-ROM, a copy of which we received recently, but there are errors in the material which must be excised before it can be used as an authentic version.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes also referred to a review mechanism. His suggestion was sensible and laudable. When the Leader and I first entered the Houses, every item of legislation was dealt with in both Chambers and matters moved much more slowly. That was great in a way because at least we knew what was happening. So much legislation passes through the Houses now that in order to have a review mechanism we would need to increase staff numbers etc. However, such a mechanism would be worth considering.</P>
      <P>Section 11, as Senator Brian Hayes commented, allows the use of examples. For lay people, this is vital. A picture is worth a thousand words and it is a good idea to provide examples to help those of us who are not involved in the legal profession.</P>
      <P>The Leader asked me to clarify the position regarding the six months. It is hoped the Bill will commence within six months of enactment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
      <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, conscious of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the Oireachtas and the McCabe family, that the early release of prisoners responsible for the brutal killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was not part of the Good Friday Agreement, calls on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that this policy is not reversed in the ongoing discussions between the Sinn F&eacute;in Leadership and the Government on political developments in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister. With the Chair&rsquo;s permission I will read from a script, something I have not done since I entered this House two and a half years ago. I would like to do so this evening in order to put certain matters on the record.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In putting this motion to the House, my colleagues and I are giving the Government an opportunity to come clean on the full details of a secret deal negotiated between it and Sinn F&eacute;in last October. The public and the House want to hear the truth. More importantly, those directly affected by the brutal killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe want to hear the truth.</P>
      <P>This evening, we want the Government to put on the record of the House exactly what was agreed in discussions last October aimed at kick-starting the suspended institutions. As a means of copper-fastening trust in the peace process and of setting the record straight, the Government has an obligation to come clean on the matter.</P>
      <P>For too long this process has been aimed at making further concessions to the IRA as it continues to hold the entire political process to ransom. Peace is on its terms alone. We must all challenge this fundamental hypocrisy which undermines the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. In endorsing the Agreement, the Irish people bought peace for a certain price. The deal was relatively straightforward. The IRA stopped murdering people for an opportunity to allow its political representatives in Sinn F&eacute;in to enter the Northern Ireland Government and to also allow IRA prisoners to be freed under the terms of the Agreement. This was a difficult and painful pill for ordinary people to swallow, particularly in Northern Ireland where the IRA&rsquo;s murderous campaign was visited on all sections of the community over the past 35 years.</P>
      <P>We should not forget that the IRA killers of garda&iacute; in this State have also been released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Between 1998 and 1999 a total of 444 prisoners from all paramilitary organisations were released in Northern Ireland while in this State 57 prisoners were released. The notion that this was only a painful pill for the people of Northern Ireland is untrue, because significant numbers of convicted killers were also released here under our obligations under the Agreement.</P><Col N="1191"/>
      <P>The McCabe case was also outside any reasonable interpretation of the prisoner release programme. It was different, not least because the accused were convicted of manslaughter charges after the Good Friday Agreement was accepted. More important than that, the Irish people were given an assurance when voting for the Agreement that the McCabe killers would not be granted early release. In the D&aacute;il on 27 May 1998, only days before the referendum, the former Taoiseach and former leader of my party, Deputy John Bruton, asked the Taoiseach to clarify the matter on the record. He asked:</P>
      <P LI="1">Does the Taoiseach agree that a measure of clarity is necessary as it is not clear from the Belfast Agreement whether the relevant provision applies only to those already convicted or to those who may be convicted in future of offences committed in the past? The Agreement specifies that such people to which it applies will be released within a maximum of two years. Will the Taoiseach ensure maximum transparency regarding individual decision making and the procedures adopted in view of the understandable concern of victims&rsquo; families?</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Taoiseach replied:</P>
      <P LI="1">Of course there must be maximum clarification. In the Good Friday Agreement we were talking about the release within two years of people already convicted. There is no doubt about this and I am certain of it as I have been asked a similar question on at least three occasions in the past 24 hours.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Later, in September of that year, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue accepted what the Taoiseach had said in the House on 27 May 1998.</P>
      <P>Let us be absolutely clear that when Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was gunned down in Adare, this was plainly and simply a bank robbery organised and put into effect by the IRA. These men who were part of that deed were not angry young men from west Belfast or the Bogside. They were involved simply and straightforwardly in a bank job. To suggest that this case has analogies in Northern Ireland is way off the mark. This had nothing to do with Northern Ireland, even within Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s warped justification concerning the alleged struggle in Ireland. Let us also be clear that the killers were lucky to get away with manslaughter charges when the more serious murder charges had to be dropped because of unprecedented intimidation of witnesses by so-called republicans. The mandatory sentence of 40 years for murder of a member of the Defence Forces would have been the sentence had a charge of murder been successful in that case.</P>
      <P>It was with horror that we recently learned that our Government was prepared to ignore the solemn commitment it gave to the people in 1998 <Col N="1192"/>in even contemplating the release of the McCabe killers as part of a new deal with Sinn F&eacute;in. Policy in this area has been reversed without recourse to this House or to the people. The new formulation, as seen in the amendment to tonight&rsquo;s motion proposed by the Government, is that the early release of these criminals might now be contemplated where there is an end to all forms of paramilitarism by the IRA. The Government has broken its word and I am astonished the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who regularly speaks with such authority on the subject of the relationship between Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA, would be part and parcel of this secret deal and this undignified concession to an existing terrorist outfit in this State and in the other state. I do not believe he has much credibility on this subject when one considers his involvement in making further concessions to private armies in the course of his work as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, when he speaks on Northern Ireland, and when he speaks in particular about the relationship between the IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in, he speaks for me and many people like me in this State. I fundamentally agree with his sentiments and with his clear and unequivocal language. He spoke for me in speaking so regularly and passionately about this subject in the past, but he does not have much credibility now when it has been exposed that he and other members of the Government were prepared to do this secret deal last October. This is an issue he must address.</P>
      <P>If Mr. David Trimble had accepted the IRA&rsquo;s act of decommissioning last October, those responsible for Detective Garda Jerry McCabe&rsquo;s death would now be out of prison. Under paragraph 13 of last year&rsquo;s joint declaration, the IRA could still be running their rackets, specifically because criminal activity was left out of the paragraph 13 commitments. Stopping punishment beatings or intelligence gathering is not the same as ending paramilitarism because it tacitly accepts the continuation of this outfit&rsquo;s criminal activity. Even if the Government were prepared to compromise on the release of the McCabe killers, as was clearly demonstrated last October, it sold us short in that commitment and the commitments that were sought from Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA at that time.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to state unequivocally in this House this evening whether last October&rsquo;s deal included two of the gang members who managed to escape from the scene at Adare eight years ago. I understand that both of these individuals are now on the run and that Sinn F&eacute;in wants an amnesty for them in connection with any possible future charges they might face in relation to the McCabe case. We need clarity on this issue.</P>
      <P>It is now ten years since the original ceasefire. Most people here want to move on. The real problem is that as long as a private army is in existence, and as long as that private army is <Col N="1193"/>inextricably linked to a political grouping, which it is, it will be virtually impossible for the kind of closure to take place which is at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement. We have put up with this ambiguity for far too long. We have an obligation to brave and dedicated people such as Detective Garda Jerry McCabe not to allow our history to be written by a bunch of thugs and crooks. This matter is of the utmost importance because it goes to the heart of what this State is about and to the heart of what those brave men and women, who put themselves on the line day in and day out against paramilitary groups of this type are about. We need an explanation from the Government. That is the intention of our motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion. I spoke on this issue in a debate in the D&aacute;il on 9 February 1999. That debate revolved around the findings of the Special Criminal Court. The people responsible for the crime were not charged with murder but with manslaughter and the sentences were based on that. Those of us who are from west Limerick were appalled and remember vividly what happened in June 1996. For a political representative from west Limerick it was especially emotional because not alone were Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and his family from west Limerick but three of the people involved came from west Limerick. None of us can condone what happened because it was an act of brutal murder. What helped to focus the whole issue in our minds in recent times was an article in one of the Sunday tabloids which showed the late Detective Garda Jerry McCabe slumped in a car with 15 bullets discharged into the car itself.</P>
      <P>In the context of the abolition of capital punishment by the then Minister for Justice, former Deputy Ray Burke, there was to be introduced a mandatory sentence of 40 years for offences such as this involving members of the Garda, the Prison Service, or a member of the Government. In this case, because of plea bargaining and the reduction of the charge to manslaughter, lesser sentences were imposed ranging from 14 to 11 years.</P>
      <P>The Government has been embarrassed in recent times by the leaking of information regarding this issue. It came as a surprise to most people that in the negotiations in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Taoiseach were involved last October this was being conceded. According to the Government this was being conceded on the basis that all paramilitary activity would be ended. This flies in the face of what was previously said on this issue. It is worth bearing in mind how definitive the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, who was to the fore in trying to lecture other parties on zero tolerance when he was in Government, was when he spoke in the House on 9 February 1999:</P>
      <P LI="1">I refer to speculation on the question of early release for those who have been convicted of <Col N="1194"/>the killing of Garda McCabe. I wonder how many different ways we have to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; for people to get the message that those involved will not have the benefit of the early release terms contained in the British-Irish Agreement. There has been clarity from the outset &mdash; from the time the British-Irish Agreement was negotiated &mdash; about this and the position has been made clear by the Taoiseach and me on numerous occasions. That there will now be manslaughter rather than murder convictions does not alter the Government&rsquo;s stance on this issue.</P>
      <P FLI="0">A great deal of the discussion during the D&aacute;il debate in 1999 related to intimidation and the circumstances of the time. When legislation was being introduced, Members called for measures to be put in place to counteract the level of intimidation involved in this case.</P>
      <P>Many people in the mid-west region are shocked. As the Taoiseach in June 1996, Deputy John Bruton was given the difficult job of sympathising with the wife and family of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. All of us can recall the evocative scenes when the large funeral took place in Limerick. For that reason, this issue resonates with the general public and, in particular, with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>I would like to discuss the prospect of an early release, which has been considered. The only thing that stopped such a deal from going ahead in October 2003 was that decommissioning did not go far enough. One can assume that the British Government was not aware of the deal, as it was entirely an Irish arrangement. We remember that the Taoiseach was not too optimistic on the morning in question, when General de Chastelain pinpointed the level of decommissioning at the time. The package was negotiated on the basis of restricted decommissioning. It was obvious at that stage that Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA had not considered the total endgame in respect of the ending of paramilitary activity.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a strong statement about the conduct of the IRA when he was in Limerick in recent days. He attacked the involvement of Sinn F&eacute;in. That is fine because it probably makes good copy for the media, but the whole thing smacks of a certain degree of hypocrisy, as far as I can see. Somebody is talking out of both sides of his or her mouth in respect of this issue. If one is consistent on this matter, one will be aware that it is not a question of ending it, even if paramilitary activity in the North of Ireland is brought to an end.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s party leader, Deputy Harney, said at a party meeting in Limerick in 2000 that, as far as she is concerned, the killers of Detective Garda McCabe will never be released, under any set of circumstances. It is worth bearing in mind that the prisoners in question are not serving life sentences &mdash; they are not serving 40 years &mdash; but sentences of between 11 and 14 years. Detective Garda McCabe was killed in 1996. We are talking <Col N="1195"/>about the amount of time that has been served and the date on which they will be released. We are not talking about the long term, but about the short term.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the principle of the matter. There is no doubt the persons in question are guilty of murder. The circumstances changed and the trial became a manslaughter trial because witnesses were intimidated. The sentences of between 11 and 14 years that were handed down were small when one considers the offences that were committed. Even if negotiations commence with Sinn F&eacute;in about making progress in the North of Ireland, the Government cannot consider slipping this in. People were surprised to learn recently that it was suggested as part of a package going back to last October, that it was being agreed and that it was going to be slipped in.</P>
      <P>The Government lied about Omagh when it was asked in the other House whether discussions were taking place with the Real IRA. Deputy Kenny succeeded in getting the Government to admit eventually that discussions took place. A Member of this House, Senator Mansergh, had discussions with the Real IRA after the Omagh bombing. Whom do we believe? Do we believe the Taoiseach, who has said that there will be no deal? Do we believe those who say that it was agreed at the time and that the prisoners in Castlerea would have been released by now if agreement had been reached last October? The pieces of the Government&rsquo;s jigsaw are not fitting together. There is a certain element of talking from both sides of the mouth on this serious issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister should reflect seriously on the comments of his predecessor, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, who was very definitive on this issue. Given that there will be elections on 11 June, it is probable that this issue will not go away. It suits the Government to deny totally at this stage that these people will be released. Mr. Gerry Collins MEP has been strong on this issue in west Limerick. He has said that his personal opinion is that they should never be released. Does the Government&rsquo;s policy reflect the MEP&rsquo;s opinion? The people deserve honesty, truth and consistency from the Government in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss this issue, given its importance to the administration of justice in this jurisdiction, the political situation in Northern Ireland and, not least, the family of the late Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Detective Garda Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan, whose courage and dignity I salute.</P>
      <P>I regret the tone of the remarks that have been made here this evening. There have been charges of hypocrisy and electioneering and hints of duplicity. In the circumstances, it is sad because it contrasts with the dignity and reserve of those who are closest to this issue. I refer to the remarks made by Detective Garda McCabe&rsquo;s family and Detective Garda O&rsquo;Sullivan. I am saddened by the tone of remarks which have been made in an attempt to score political points and by references to electoral prospects in the mid-west, which are not related to the core issue before the House, which is a far deeper issue.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my view that those who killed Detective Garda Jerry McCabe by shooting him twice, and who pumped nine bullets into the slightly luckier Detective Garda Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan, are examples of all that is worst, lowest and most cowardly in Irish society. Such people are least deserving of any admiration, support or sympathy. I agree with Senators who said that these people&rsquo;s conviction for manslaughter did not reflect in any way the gravity of the offences they committed. Their sentences reflected the gravity of another offence committed by those closely allied with them, namely the intimidation of witnesses to prevent the full facts from being expounded on the basis of admissible evidence before the Special Criminal Court. The court and the DPP conducted themselves in the face of such intimidation. The sentences which were imposed were quite long for a manslaughter conviction, but they were light when one considers the gravity of what happened in Adare in June 1996.</P>
      <P>I say without equivocation and without speaking from both sides of my mouth that it is the fixed view of the Government that the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe should serve their entire sentences. There is no question of their early release under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Suggestions that have been made publicly that there was such an agreement, or that there was a private agreement between the Taoiseach and Mr. Gerry Adams that would happen at a time when they had not even been convicted of any crime are wholly untrue and unreliable. I am saddened to hear some Senators ask who we should believe in these circumstances when one of the parties to the conservation that is alleged to have taken place is somebody in whose veracity Senators have absolutely no belief. The public at large has very little belief in their veracity either, bearing in mind the continual <Col N="1197"/>denials by that party that he was ever a member of the IRA.</P>
      <P>The Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA movement has been guilty of wholesale duplicity over this matter from the word go. It denied that any of its members were involved in the atrocity at Adare and sent out their political spokesmen who said they accepted the denials as being true. Having had conversations recently with some of the people who were involved in the investigation, I understand those denials were made so trenchantly at the time that they put the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a false trail for a short period. The garda&iacute; did not believe that anyone could have the brazen effrontery to make such a radical denial in circumstances which transpired later to be completely mendacious.</P>
      <P>Ever since then the Sinn F&eacute;in movement has been pressing the Government to release those men ahead of time. That movement has been claiming, wrongly, that it had an agreement that they were comprehended within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. For its part, the Government has said at all times, both then and since, that they were never so comprehended. I have spoken to officials in my Department who were present in Castle Buildings in Belfast at that time, and they are adamant that it was made clear to everybody who would listen that there was no question of their inclusion in that agreement. When it comes to questions of credibility and veracity, therefore, there can be no doubt that they were never comprehended within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, and they will never be released on foot of that Agreement. Let it be clearly understood that they will never be released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in any circumstances whatsoever.</P>
      <P>As Senators have remarked, it is now ten years since the IRA ceasefire first came into effect, and six years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement by some of the parties in Castle Buildings in 1998. At this stage, it should be understood that the main obstacle to the full implementation of the Agreement has been the resolute, determined refusal by the provisional movement to deliver on its side of the bargain. Manufactured and specious issues constantly cloud the scene when the full implementation of that Agreement requires a number of simple things, one of which is a total and radical transformation of the situation in Northern Ireland in which members of the provisional movement move unambiguously, irreversibly and without equivocation from their role as the underpinnings of paramilitarism to exclusively peaceful and democratic politics.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has engaged in a massive campaign of deception and propaganda. It has sought to create the illusion that it is a party, independent of the IRA, that acts as a broker between the IRA and political establishments North and South, and whose job it is to try to persuade the IRA that the circumstances have come in which to end the paramilitary campaign. Sinn F&eacute;in has <Col N="1198"/>sought to create the illusion that it is somehow distant from the IRA, independent of it and &mdash; as Gerry Adams attempted to beguile the Irish people into believing yesterday and today &mdash; that the party is governed by its annual conference and nothing else. Unfortunately, that is a radical and profound untruth.</P>
      <P>While some aspects of my recent remarks in Limerick did not receive adequate attention, I sought to bring to public view material which was found in possession of the provisional movement. It states clearly the actual relationship between Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA. These documents show that provisional IRA volunteers are required to believe the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">That the provisional army council and its successors are the inheritors of the First and Second D&aacute;il as a provisional government of the Irish Republic . . . this ethical fact should and must give moral strength to all volunteers and [note my words now] all members of every branch of the republican movement. The IRA &mdash; its leadership &mdash; is the lawful government of the Irish Republic. All other parliaments or assemblies claiming the right to speak for or to pass laws on behalf of the Irish people, are illegal assemblies, puppet governments of a foreign power and willing tools of occupying forces.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The text continues by stating that:</P>
      <P LI="1">Volunteers must firmly believe, without doubt and without reservation, that, as members of the IRA, all orders issued by the army authority and all actions directed by the army authority are the legal orders and lawful actions of the government of the Irish Republic. This is one of the most important mainstays of the republican movement [which, as we heard earlier, includes Sinn F&eacute;in and all its branches] &mdash; the firm belief that all operations and actions directed by the army are, in effect, the lawful acts and legal actions of the government of all the Irish people.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Shortly after my own interview on radio yesterday, I heard Mr. Adams equivocating, wheeling around and trying to avoid the issue, but I challenge him to deny that that is his belief and the belief of all members of the republican movement, whatever part they play in either branch of that movement. It is a central tenet of Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA that the IRA army council is the legitimate government of the Irish Republic, and that all its orders and decisions are lawful acts taken on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>The significance of all that is that it radically defines the function of Sinn F&eacute;in as a political party. It is not an independent party, it is a party that operates on the supposition that there is an authority superior to it &mdash; part of the same movement it forms &mdash; which speaks with a legitimacy and lawful authority that is coercive and which all volunteers must accept as a fundamental and &ldquo;ethical fact&rdquo;, as they term it. <Col N="1199"/>The consequence of that is that no member of Sinn F&eacute;in ever criticises the IRA. None of them has ever uttered one word of criticism of the IRA. None of them has ever condemned any action known to have been taken by the IRA. None of them has ever, on any occasion, challenged the IRA about any of its actions, nor in public have they distanced themselves from, or in any way repudiated, any action of the IRA. That is not just simply a matter of taste or political perspective; it is because the fundamental rule of the republican movement is that all its branches are subject to the authority of the IRA. As long as members of the provisional movement believe that to be the case, it follows that they cannot pose in politics as an independent political party. They cannot ask the rest of the community to accept them as a party which is free and engaging in exclusively democratic and peaceful means because in the last analysis they are not free. As long as they are shackled to this ideological view, there is an immovable impediment to their being involved in the institutions of government North or South. As long as that is their structure and that chain of authority exists within the provisional movement, there is an immovable impediment to their participating on the basis of ordinary democratic constitutional politics.</P>
      <P>If we get to the stage where paramilitarism in Ireland ends, to the point where the army council of the IRA no longer holds sway over the provisional movement, and all the apparatus, structures and ideology of the provisional movement are transformed so that the IRA agrees to be part of the past, and the red line is drawn across the page book of history; if we get to the point where that can be done, and paramilitarism can end, with firearms put away or destroyed, dumped or buried in concrete &mdash; their disposal is a matter of indifference to me &mdash; and there is no more organised IRA criminality of any kind; and if the punishment beatings, torturings, exilings, attempted murders and incidents like those involving Bobby Toal are irreversibly and manifestly history, this country will have taken a massive step forward.</P>
      <P>Despite anticipating taunts of hypocrisy, or a lack of credibility, it would be easy for me to leave the problem to others and not to even discuss how we might get to the desired situation. It would be easy for me to reside in a realm of moral purity in which instead of undertaking my duty as someone who passionately believes in democratic constitutional politics, I would forget all this and say no progress can be made. I could say I would not talk to anyone, did not want to hear about anything and would tell the IRA to return to me when it had wound up and decided to surrender. It would be easy for the Taoiseach to take that attitude too.</P>
      <P>The hand of history, however, is on the shoulders of politicians and it demands of the elected members of our Government that they make efforts to get us from our current <Col N="1200"/>unacceptable position to one where this country, North and South, is freed from paramilitarism in its entirety. The hand of history on one&rsquo;s shoulder makes it clear to anyone who bears the responsibility of elected office in a society such as ours that one cannot simply say one will abdicate from the fulfilment and act of completion of the Good Friday Agreement. The potential for good is so huge, the potential to transform the lives, attitudes and the entire future of this island so big, that one cannot simply say one will have nothing to do with the peace process.</P>
      <P>The Government has acted honourably and truthfully in all its dealings in these matters. I urge Members of this House and any other forum not to assume they know in its entirety what was being discussed in the past, or that they can draw judgments about the appropriateness of where the Government stood or did not stand at the time. As I said in Limerick recently, it was our understanding in April 2003, on the morning we went to meet President Bush and Prime Minister Blair in Hillsborough Castle, that sufficient time had been given to the provisional movement to organise executive and army conventions to bring about the end of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland. That was our understanding, and when walking up the path to Hillsborough Castle it became apparent to us for the first time that we had been massively shortchanged.</P>
      <P>The Government is indefatigable in its pursuit of the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and is unafraid of rolling up its sleeves to work out what that fulfilment involves and how it can be brought about. Neither I nor any member of the Government will participate in a process whereby the release of these men is made into some appetiser or inducement to others to bring themselves to the point where they will then be in a position to shortchange us again. The Government is clear that this will not happen.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendment encapsulates exactly where the Government stands, without equivocation. In very generous, and if I may use the phrase statesmanlike, words of a retired member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Garda Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan, if there was a case of going from one situation to a wholly different one, he would not, in particular circumstances, stand in the way of what was proposed.</P>
      <P>I thank in particular the family of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe for its dignity and for the words the family members spoke in recent days. It has not been easy for them, thrown as they were into the centre of this maelstrom. They have said that they trust the Irish Government, and they are right to do so. Their trust will not be misplaced or abused. Anyone who considers these events must however realise that upholding our Constitution, the rule of law, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the democratic principles by which we all stand lies at the centre of the Government strategy, and that these elements are not <Col N="1201"/>expendable in pursuit of any accommodation with anybody in this country.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>Among other evasions and obfuscations made recently by Mr. Gerry Adams, he challenged me in his eloquent and sweet words to put up or shut up regarding provisional criminality. It would of course suit the provisional movement if I were to disclose in public all I know about everything that movement is doing. People like Mr. Adams would feel well satisfied if by using the taunt &ldquo;put up or shut up&rdquo; they found out what the Irish Government knew in detail about what they were doing.</P>
      <P>When I say that the Provisional IRA is involved in ongoing massive criminality North and South, I have spoken nothing but the unvarnished truth. Just as the provisional movement, in order to procure its ends, unleashed intimidation on a major scale after the killing of Jerry McCabe and the trial that followed, intimidation that has never been condemned by any member of Sinn F&eacute;in, it also uses intimidation to frighten its accomplices in crime within this State. The provisionals use physical intimidation and have shot a number of people in the legs. They have used moral intimidation to bring about a reign of fear, so that those who do their bidding in their massive stolen goods trade and in other criminal pursuits for profit, will never reveal what they know or act in a way which would assist a prosecution. That is the reality of which all senior provisional figures are aware. These high ranking officials of the provisional movement, if I can dignify them with that term, orchestrate this crime, step in when anything goes wrong and immediately act as the Mr. Fix Its making sure the criminality is allowed to proceed uninterrupted and unimpeded. Those people rub shoulders with household names in the Sinn F&eacute;in movement day in, day out, and let nobody be under any illusion about that.</P>
      <P>If the challenge is put to me to put up or shut up, I will not make the elementary mistake of simply revealing Garda and Army intelligence to the provisional movement but will say on my honour as a democratically elected representative that every word I have spoken is true and that the majority of things said in response have been manifestly and deliberately false.</P>
      <P>Crime is a huge business for the IRA. A House of Commons committee estimated that, through fuel laundering, cigarette smuggling and other activities, it was in receipt of £12 million sterling per annum.</P>

	<P>This is going on in our society and I will not be silenced on it. The people must know what is going on because those moneys are not being accumulated for some international charity; they are being used for the purposes of the entire provisional movement. This is self-evident to anybody who wants to inquire into it.</P>
      <P>We face a challenge to our republican values and to our democratic system. That challenge comes in large measure, but not exclusively, from the provisional movement which is now confronted with a historic choice. If it attempts to go on as before, it will run into the resolute, determined and complete opposition of those who hold democratic office in this country. Alternatively, after the twin towers attack and 11 March in Madrid, it has the choice to say there is no way it can hold the threat of going back to war &mdash; its famous phrase &mdash; over the free people of this island. That is not an option and, therefore, it is now confronted with the moment of truth. Does it adhere to the ideology I mentioned, does it adhere to the racketeering, criminality and so on or does it make this quantum leap from all of that into democracy? I have no confidence the choice will be made for the latter option but if it is, I will generously respond, as will the people. If it is not, the war of attrition of words will be won by those who stand up for democracy. There was a time when constructive ambiguity was required to move the situation from where it was to where it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We are beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1203"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now beyond that point. Ambiguity is now unambiguously destructive on the question of paramilitarism and the relationship between the IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in. As we have reached the point where all ambiguity is now destructive and fundamentally corrosive of democratic values, the moment of truth has come for the provisional movement to make its choice. Whichever way it makes its choice, we will meet it head on. We will meet it head on if it continues with paramilitarism. Alternatively, we will meet it head on and generously if it makes this quantum leap from paramilitarism to constitutional democracy.</P>
      <P>The attitude exemplified by Detective Garda Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan is the true attitude which the people should carefully read, study and take on board. Contrary to what has been stated or implied, I will never, as Minister for Justice, Equality or Law Reform, nor have I ever intended to, take any steps in regard to the Castlerea prisoners without first personally speaking to the widow of Jerry McCabe, Mrs. Anne McCabe, and to Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan. If and when the happy time arrives that paramilitarism ends, that would be the happiest journey I could possibly make. However, until that time arrives, I will not in any way compromise my office, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the principles of Irish republican constitutionalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I was most impressed by nearly all of what the Minister had to say. I heard him yesterday on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; when he went as far as anybody in a position of great authority to say that Gerry Adams and others like him were still and had been members of the IRA. The scenario he painted today was depressing, although I am not sure I share his ultimate conclusions. What the Minister is saying is that it is up to the IRA or what he generously terms the &ldquo;provisional movement&rdquo; or the &ldquo;republican movement&rdquo; to decide its future. That is merely a euphemism for the armed movement which we have come to know as Sinn F&eacute;in, the IRA or whatever we want to call it. What he is really saying is that it is a moment of truth for it &mdash; democracy or the gun. I wish I believed that because I have heard this from the mouths of others for ten years since the ceasefire.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The provisionals had the choice of democracy or the gun for the past ten years and have taken the same decision each time. They have taken both roads and they have been successful in taking the choice of democracy and of the gun. They have managed through tomfoolery and deceit to fool people into believing they believe in democracy while at the same time holding on to their guns. Not very long ago I saw a sight in the other House which did not fill me with any great pleasure, namely Mr. Gerry Adams sitting in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery. If the Minister is <Col N="1204"/>right, Mr. Adams is the man who holds sway over the Members of the D&aacute;il by being a member of the army council and not through any democratic means. That is what we are dealing with.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>We are dealing with something else here. We are dealing with Members of the D&aacute;il who are elected &mdash; there is no denying that &mdash; but who are controlled by people who not only do not believe in democracy, but who believe in killing people. This is a different debate from the almost trivial debates we have here &mdash; the minor debates on matters which are not so important, and I include finance, health and so on in that. This is about people who believe in murdering others for political means and who are tolerated. There is a growing toleration which is symbolised in the suggestion that we should release the killers of Garda McCabe. We have reached the stage where we are saying &ldquo;All these guys will get out sooner or later&rdquo;. There is a contradiction in many of our thoughts on this matter, and I see it in the Government amendment to this motion. The Minister is courageous and sincere in what he says, but the Government amendment is extraordinary in its blatant contradiction and doublethink. I am not entering into semantics, since it sticks out a mile. It states:</P>
      <P LI="1">. . . notes and approves the stated position of the Government that the persons convicted of the brutal killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe will serve in full the sentences imposed on them by the courts and notes the Government&rsquo;s clearly stated position that there will be no possibility of their early release other than in the context of a definitive ending of the Northern conflict including an end to all forms of paramilitarism by the IRA.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is a blatant contradiction. Either they will serve their fixed terms or not; one cannot have it both ways. I know what is being said by the Minister. He is saying that, if they lay down their arms once and for all, the Government will let them out.</P>
      <P>We are being subjected to a process of softening up before they are let out. I know in my bones that that is on the agenda. It has nothing to do with the Good Friday Agreement. It has to do with what they call the &ldquo;final settlement&rdquo;, which will be agreed by the provos like they have agreed everything else. Every time they agree to lay down their arms, they have a minor explosion which keeps the process going, keeps them getting elected to the D&aacute;il and Stormont and maintains them as a tolerated military organisation. All those in this country who have negotiated with them in the past ten years have known perfectly well that they were negotiating with people holding guns to their heads.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that, and says it himself. He is negotiating with people with guns in the cupboard, who are gunmen themselves and, at the same time, control many other gunmen. He is <Col N="1205"/>saying that, if they let all their arms go and the conflict ends completely and verifiably &mdash; I am using all the jargon which has been used before and has not convinced anyone or achieved anything &mdash; the Government will release the killers. We should not say that in public. We should say what the Minister was saying yesterday, with such immense conviction and scoring so many telling points against Mr. Adams. My interpretation was that he was saying that Mr. Adams was still a member of the IRA army council. Nowhere is it more apparent that such doublethink is going on.</P>
      <P>Let me move on to the issue of releasing the people in question. I happen to have some constituents in Northern Ireland, some of whom are Nationalist and some of whom are Unionist; I suppose they are balanced. The most bitter pill the Unionist population had to swallow in the Good Friday Agreement was the release of the prisoners. That was what they found so difficult, as everyone knows. The RUC widows and others felt quite rightly that those guys were getting away with something under the guise of the other side laying down their arms, which they never did.</P>
      <P>I do not know what their response will be if we refuse to release Detective Garda McCabe&rsquo;s killers. Perhaps they will say that we were not prepared to make the same sacrifices they were. However, I am very doubtful whether it was the right decision in the first place to let those killers out in the North. It gives a weapon to the Provisional IRA, and the people on the other side were let out too.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to know what way to vote tonight, since I know that utterly sincere views are held on both sides. There is an almost unanswerable case for not letting those people out because of the signal of weakness that it sends to Mr. Adams and other members of the IRA army council. It is saying to them that if they keep going, those guys will get out. It is part of the nudge and wink approach and gives them hope that they may hold onto their arms for ever. However, I also see great virtue in saying that, if there is final solution, great sacrifices will have to be made by all sides. There is no answer to this problem, and I deeply regret that it has come to a divisive debate of this sort in this House. We should take what the Minister has said to heart, expressing a great degree of confidence in the fact that he has the courage to say in public that members of the Provisional IRA are operating as criminals in this country and that he is prepared to confront them.</P>
      <P>It is time that members of the army council of the Provisional IRA were named and outed and that we got to know who they are. It would be an enormous shock to the general public if they were named and exposed as liars. It is an extraordinarily sobering fact that the most popular political leader in this country also <Col N="1206"/>appears to be a member of the IRA army council, not only condoning the killing of people in Northern Ireland but representing the killers of one of our garda&iacute;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already moved the amendment. Most of what is being said on all sides of the House tonight, particularly by the Minister, every reasonable and moderate person on the island would subscribe to. The point was made by the motion&rsquo;s proposer that the Garda is an unarmed force which has given this country tremendous service. Armed or unarmed, it certainly deserves 100% support from the Government and the Oireachtas. Anything that might in any way impinge on that requires very careful and measured consideration.</P>
      <P>Many of us had great difficulty with the Good Friday Agreement. However, it was supported by a majority of the people on this island, and as democrats we must accept the outcome. Apart from the ceasefire, which I would not understate as a significant step forward, there has not been the progress envisaged by all the people who supported those proposals through the referendum, North and South.</P>
      <P>It must be credited to the authors of the Agreement and those who worked extremely hard to achieve it that it was not done easily. Ten years ago, Albert Reynolds invested tremendous energy and political courage in bringing matters to that stage, and that must be acknowledged. When he left Government, that was lost, and we reverted to where we had been. The Bertie Ahern Government made tremendous and successful strides to put matters back together. It is certainly a prize which most reasonable people would have wanted. It achieved significant improvements in the political and social environment in Ireland, not least between North and South.</P>
      <P>Not everything is the fault of Sinn F&eacute;in or the IRA. Failure on demilitarisation is certainly something that has not assisted the process. Decommissioning and the umpteen attempts certainly did not help. That also gave rise to apprehensions within the Unionist community, which in turn undermined the structures being put in place because they were not being supported. I was recently struck by a discussion I had with an elected representative of the DUP, who readily acknowledged to me when talking about paramilitarism that they had not been as vocal as they should in condemning that of the loyalist groups, which have had far greater levels of activity since the Agreement than was the case before.</P>
      <P>Politicians of all shades must condemn all elements of paramilitarism. Tonight we are condemning IRA activities, and that is right. Presently I will explain some of the other reasons we should be doing so, which may not have been <Col N="1207"/>mentioned. It is also fair that it be done in a balanced way so that all those involved in paramilitarism are aware that society, their Governments and particularly their elected representatives on all sides will not countenance, support or condone it, and will take every measure to prevent and stop it.</P>
      <P>Going beyond paramilitarism, the Minister referred to criminal activity. I take one example from my own constituency. Apparently in the run-up to the last election when Sinn F&eacute;in had selected its candidates, within that party in Wexford there was a strong body of opposition because of alleged activities in the drug trade. It was kept quiet and only came to light in the recent past when a Circuit Court case was taken involving a former member of Sinn F&eacute;in who had been beaten and intimidated by another member. He sued that member and Sinn F&eacute;in headquarters and was awarded &euro;17,000 compensation for his wife and himself because of the intimidation. I asked publicly for Sinn F&eacute;in to clarify the position. The news broke prior to the party&rsquo;s Ard-Fheis and a statement was issued by the chairman of the party accusing Fianna F&aacute;il of infiltrating Sinn F&eacute;in and spying on it and asserting that this was the cause of the difficulties. I wish we had that level of ingenuity within Fianna F&aacute;il in Wexford. Unfortunately, we do not. We use more transparent means of pursuing our political activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not always so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked Sinn F&eacute;in to clarify whether these serious allegations had been investigated by the party and, if so, by whom, the<i> modus operandi</i> used and whether such serious allegations were brought to the attention of the Garda. To date Sinn F&eacute;in has failed to answer. At this stage of the game, smokescreens by way of allegations about infiltrating and spying on Sinn F&eacute;in are not acceptable. We have a right to demand far greater responsibility from a party which is getting considerable support, North and South. The party has a right to put its case and policies before the public and to seek support. However, it does not have a right to continue with its links and involvement in criminal activity.</P>
      <P>Attempts are being made to secure what are called &ldquo;acts of completion&rdquo;. One would wish well to all those involved in that area, including the Taoiseach and the Minister. I speak from the perspective of one who has a lifetime commitment to the emergence of a united Ireland. I have been a strong critical voice for continuing British policy in this country. We have suffered much over the years and they have never acknowledged this or in any way apologised for it. With that, I now see Sinn F&eacute;in as an obstacle to the achievement of a united Ireland. That <Col N="1208"/>affects my view of what the party is doing and the activities in which it engages. I say that in the context of my contacts with people in Northern Ireland, many of them elected on both sides of the divide. The posturing and the triumphalism that is in evidence is alienating and polarising political opinion. Ultimately, I would have hoped that in 1998 the historic Belfast Agreement would have laid the foundations for at least better working relations with people in Northern Ireland, who are all Irish people. I hold the view that Unionists and Nationalists in the North will remain forever second class citizens within a British sphere of governance. They can become first class citizens in an Ireland of some shape where we work together in the interests of all the people.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the Northern Ireland Assembly elections I was alarmed at the findings of an opinion poll undertaken by the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>. It showed that five years after the Agreement was signed, 97% of Protestants still supported the union while only 2% were in favour of a united Ireland. Some 27% of Catholics supported the union while only 56% supported a united Ireland. Those are astonishing statistics. While it is only an opinion poll and may be incorrect, and even allowing for a large margin of error, it shows what needs to be done if we are to persuade moderate opinion to think differently than in the past.</P>
      <P>The early release of prisoners should have been linked to decommissioning. It is easy for me to say that because at the time, in 1998, agreement was difficult. This relates to one aspect of the motion with which I disagree. It fails to acknowledge the difficulties which Unionist families who had members serving in the North&rsquo;s security forces who were killed, had to contend with in accepting the Agreement. This aspect is reflected in the amendment but not in the motion, which gives no recognition to that. A former chairman of Down District Council and a member of the Ulster Unionist Party visited New Ross on the occasion of the twinning of Wexford town with Newcastle. He said that his vision for the twinning was that the children of New Ross would visit children in Northern Ireland, in Newcastle, and that children from that area would in turn stay with the New Ross children thereby becoming friends. He went on to make the key point that this would help to ensure they did not make the mistakes that we have made.</P>
      <P>I met him subsequently when a close relative of his who was in the RUC was killed by the IRA. It was sad to see that a man of such moderate views who was looking to the future of Ireland, could be put in that position, and the damage that this did. As regards the release of the people who murdered Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, they were convicted of manslaughter. They could, in other circumstances, have received a prison term <Col N="1209"/>of 40 years. It is fair to say if they are released after 14 years, there will have been an element of leniency.</P>
      <P>It is important to bring an end to the atrocities. I am glad the Minister said that only in circumstances where it can be verified will he approach the families of those who were the victims of that terrible day to discuss the issue with them. When the day comes there should be no fudge. When it happens &mdash; we all look forward to it &mdash; perhaps there should be a period of 12 months to allow complete verification of total cessation of involvement in any kind of criminal or paramilitary activity and a stepping down of the IRA, as the basis for such a conclusion.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said the hand of history is resting on politicians. I know that simile was used before but it is correct. It is important, with the hand of history resting on people, that we are not seduced into becoming unwilling participants in the subversion of the State. That is something we need to measure and be cautious about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>The last remark by Senator Jim Walsh is a good place from which to start. He mentioned, as did many speakers, the Good Friday Agreement. There was a great sense of hope and optimism when it was signed. The extent to which it was supported, particularly in this part of the country, was an indication of how much the wider community felt on the issue. People want to move on from an era of bloodshed and division into a period of constitutional politics and democracy, to a point where the killing is left behind. and where at least we are united in terms of hearts and minds if not allegiance. We are a long way from getting rid of the Border, if that is the stated ambition.</P>
      <P>However, there is a strong sense among people, particularly in recent months, that we are being used in a duplicitous fashion. Public reaction to any notice of the release of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe&rsquo;s killers is indicative of how strongly people feel on the issue. In negotiations there is a line beyond which one cannot go. While the Taoiseach rightly says that we want to see the end of paramilitarism and must move towards that goal, one can give too much away. There are times when one must hold the line. It is difficult to accept what is happening in the democratic process leading to the local and European elections as Sinn F&eacute;in parades around like a democratic constitutional party. The party has Members in the other House. It takes on the trappings, but not the responsibility, of democracy. Until it does so with the end of paramilitarism, as the Minister rightly said, we are in a very strange situation whereby we have within our political and constitutional establishment a party which does not fully subscribe to the Constitution. The Minister has been vociferous in putting it up to Sinn F&eacute;in. We <Col N="1210"/>must do likewise and must ask the public to do so too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We must ask the media too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not enter that debate with the Minister. I would be more lenient than he on the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is because it is more lenient on the Senator than on me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Not necessarily. Does Sinn F&eacute;in uphold the Constitution? The Minister referred to a destructive ambiguity. The spokespersons for Sinn F&eacute;in utter the greatest ambiguity of all and abuse the English language in an attempt to go down two sides of the road at the same time. When will we be honest enough to say that we have come out of a history of paramilitarism, that there are parties with that background but we can move on from that? &ldquo;We&rdquo; is appropriate because Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA are part of this nation. They are people we know in our communities, there is no separation between them and us. We may like to think that we are separate but Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA members are in our communities. I do not know how to put it up to them but the time has come to do so. The Minister is doing so but should not go too far and create a demonising effect which generates a sense of victimhood. There is no one better at playing the victim than Sinn F&eacute;in, as we have seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not give them too much ammunition on that front. Let us have an honest, open and upfront debate. I am glad to hear the Minister say that ambiguity now is destructive. The ambiguity of the past was not always constructive. I am an optimist and believe it is good to have Sinn F&eacute;in involved in the democratic process, standing for election like everyone else in the constitutional tent but it does not come all the way in. It keeps one foot outside and one inside and there are times when we feel that it is making fools of us all. We must hold the line on this issue.</P>
      <P>Let us remind ourselves of what happened in Adare; it was a post office robbery. To dress it up as anything more than criminal thuggery is more than ambiguity. An unarmed garda was shot and murdered and another almost killed. The continued public outrage is not surprising because it was an attack on the foundation of the State. Let us never forget what it was or dress it up as anything else. I am glad there is such a sense of public outrage at the notion that the killers of Garda Jerry McCabe would be released because it would be a step too far and would be <Col N="1211"/>giving away too much. The Taoiseach may have pushed out the boat a little to test the waters. One never knows what exactly he is up to, he is such a wily operator.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe the Taoiseach has received his answer and perhaps it is the one he wanted and the message he wanted was sent. We will probably never know. It would be a trade-off too far and would be unacceptable and the Minister has made it clear that it is not going to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo previous speakers in welcoming the Minister to the House this evening for this important debate and I congratulate him on his recent speech, The Challenge to our Republican Values. I am sorry that it was not published in full by our newspapers. I encourage Members and the public to read it because it is a history lesson which all Irish people should take on board and study very carefully.</P>
      <P>Moving on to the motion before us this evening I do not apologise for statements I have made in the past, inside and outside this House, on my views with regard to the killing of Jerry McCabe and my views of Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA. I come from a somewhat different position from other Members because I was a member of the Defence Forces for 21 years during which I spent much time in the late 1970s and the 1980s, travelling between Portlaoise Prison and the Special Criminal Court. I also spent time on the Border and travelling from there to the Special Criminal Court. I do not apologise for having an affiliation and a bond with my colleagues who wore the uniforms of this State or for having been a commissioned officer in its one legitimate Army. I do not, never have nor will recognise the legitimacy of any alternative army.</P>
      <P>Tonight&rsquo;s motion raises several questions. The Government has a responsibility to negotiate but those of us speaking on the motion do so from a limited knowledge. We do not have the security briefings or intelligence information that people in the office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or in Cabinet may have. Likewise the Minister must accept that we are speaking from the knowledge that is available to us, whereas he is speaking with greater knowledge. The atrocity in Adare on 7 June 1996 was not caused by a stray bullet. One cannot qualify a death by the number of bullets used. Whether it is one bullet or 14, the man is dead in the eyes of his family and colleagues. There are very precise rules of engagement with firearms and in shooting that are honoured and respected by those who carry weapons. To walk up behind <Col N="1212"/>a police car and unleash a volley from a Kalashnikov set to automatic defies all rules of engagement. That is massacre; it is indiscriminate shooting. This was not a ricochet, a loose bullet or a return of fire. The IRA statement on the day was that none of its volunteers or units was in any way involved in the incident in Adare, that there was absolutely no IRA involvement. Mr. Adams denounced the killing of Jerry McCabe as totally and absolutely wrong. He indignantly attacked those who sought to link Sinn F&eacute;in to the killing. Two days later, the IRA admitted responsibility. Having done so, it then set about undermining the justice system in the State by intimidating witnesses. One witness served 18 months in prison for contempt of court rather than give evidence. We should not forget this.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty with the fact that Pearse McAuley, who was involved in this incident, was only 12 months out of Portlaoise Prison at the time. Those involved have shown absolutely no remorse for their actions on that day. One of the first steps in reconciliation is a show of remorse. What we have is the glorification of the act and the manufacturing of bodhr&aacute;ns signed by the McCabe killers for export to the United States. Sinn F&eacute;in Members of the Oireachtas have posed with the killers for photographs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us clarify a couple of things. An act of regret or some form of recognition for an act of wrongdoing might in some way lighten my tone when I refer to these killers. In recent days we have seen a game of words played out. I fully accept the sincerity of the Minister and the Government. I also accept that their responsibility is greater than ours in moving the peace process forward. I am heartened by the Minister&rsquo;s words. Every time the subject comes up it is a further stabbing at the McCabe family, especially Jerry McCabe&rsquo;s widow. I regret that, as do the Irish people.</P>
      <P>It has been stated in the House, and successive Ministers have repeated it, that the release of the killers of Garda Jerry McCabe does not come under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. That is fine, but the interpretation of the Irish people is far greater than merely not qualifying under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement &mdash; it is a clear and unequivocal understanding that they do not qualify whatsoever for release.</P>
      <P>I could speak on this subject for another 25 minutes but I only have a minute remaining. I wish I had the same latitude as applied to the Minister. When we talk about an end to paramilitarism, like previous speakers, I want a clear verification process. I do not accept that they have any intention of giving it up. I am sorry to say that, but it is my firm belief. I have never believed it is more true that their approach is to <Col N="1213"/>have an armalite in one hand and a ballot box in the other. That is the game they are playing and is the greatest deception we have ever had in the State. I congratulate the Minister on standing up to these people. The phrase that comes to mind is &ldquo;give up yer auld sins&rdquo; of CD and DVD fame. We will meet them half way, but they must be honourable in their intent and stop fooling the people and the Government and leading us a merry dance. Criminal activity is taking place and they have no intention of giving it up. Let us be serious and not play games with the killers and family of Jerry McCabe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and the forthright manner in which he elaborated on the republican movement and those involved therein. It has always been my belief that Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA were inextricably linked and that the republican movement is involved in corruption and racketeering, and continues to be involved in punishment beatings.</P>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, have no wish to play politics with the issue, irrespective of what the Minister may think. It is our duty as an Opposition to get clear answers to questions put in the public domain. I looked at my party&rsquo;s policy from more than 30 years ago when the Minister was, perhaps, a party member. It spelled out that our policy was the reunification of the country by peaceful means and with the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland. They were the principles under which I joined Fine Gael and they are still our principles. I am glad they form part of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>When capital punishment was abolished, a cast-iron guarantee was given that anyone convicted of the murder of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Defence Forces would serve his or her full sentence. That was the least the Government of the day or the public expected. Like Senator Minihan, I believe the attitude of the public has remained constant on this important issue. The garda&iacute;, guardians of the peace, have put their lives on the line through turbulent times since the foundation of the State. They have faced down these so-called republican activists who pose a threat to the very existence of the State and its institutions. We continue to owe a deep debt of gratitude to the members of the force for their dedication and bravery in confronting these violent criminals who, according to the information given by the Minister, do not even recognise our courts or the existence of the State and its institutions. The Minister&rsquo;s outline of IRA beliefs concurs with my understanding of the IRA and the republican movement. It is incumbent on us as legislators to have strong deterrents in place which will make criminals think long and hard before they shoot with intent to injure or murder a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Defence Forces. That such <Col N="1214"/>criminals should serve their full sentences is the least that members of the force or the community as a whole should expect from its legislators.</P>
      <P>Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was gunned down in a ruthless, cold-blooded and calculated way by his killers. As has been stated by previous speakers, they only avoided 40 year sentences for capital murder because of the intimidation of witnesses. It is important that the public, especially teenagers who probably do not know anything about this matter, should be informed about the republican movement and what these killers did to people who were protecting us.</P>
      <P>As other speakers said, the Provisional IRA and the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership stated immediately after the murder that they had no involvement in the killing. A few days later they sought, and continue to seek, the release of these murderers as part of the Good Friday Agreement. Only yesterday we had a challenge from Gerry Adams who stated that in a one to one discussion with the Taoiseach it was said that these prisoners would be allowed release under the Good Friday Agreement. The Taoiseach has continually stated that these prisoners will not be released under the Good Friday Agreement. The Minister reiterated that this evening. I would believe democratic politicians before I would believe the leadership of the so-called republican movement.</P>
      <P>It is worrying for Mrs. McCabe and members of the Garda to hear about proposals for deals being made to free the killers of Jerry McCabe if certain eventualities come to pass. The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, in his letter in 1999 to Mrs. McCabe pledged that the IRA members responsible for gunning down her husband would serve their full prison sentences. This view is also held by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, and many other members of the Government. In my view that letter was a legally binding contract between the Government and Mrs. McCabe. Reports in the public domain indicate that the two men still being sought by the Garda for Jerry McCabe&rsquo;s murder may be allowed to return home as part of a separate concession to terrorists. That point was raised by Senator Brian Hayes and I do not believe the Minister addressed it.</P>
      <P>It was deeply disturbing to see reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 May about a British source stating that Britain always believed that a deal had been done last October between the Irish Government and Sinn F&eacute;in to release the murderers of Detective Garda McCabe. These kinds of reports are disturbing and they were embarrassing to the Government. The caused deep hurt to the McCabe family. We need to know exactly what was agreed at these meetings in October last. Will the IRA disband? Will the current violence and corruption end? These <Col N="1215"/>questions must be answered. We have waited long enough for normal constitutional democracy to prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that, despite all the efforts that have been made, all the infuriation and frustration endured and all the words spoken, five years after its completion, some aspects of the Good Friday Agreement have not yet been achieved. In the most recent negotiations, it became clear to the two Governments that they were unlikely to achieve full implementation unless some issues well outside the scope of the Good Friday Agreement were settled. Those issues remain outstanding. It was from this that the concept of acts of completion came to the fore. What was envisaged in that regard was nothing short of a definite settlement of the Northern Ireland issue involving, as one of its central planks, the complete and absolute end of paramilitary activity.</P>
      <P>What emerged from the talks in 2003 was a complex set of understandings and agreements with which all parties to the Agreement were to engage. The parties came close to settling the issue at that time but, unfortunately, fell at the final hurdle. The Government is engaged in new negotiations to bring about a definite end to the situation in the North. However, there appear to be a few additional ingredients being brought to the table which might, in some way, create common ground. One can only hope that such common ground will be achieved in something that was missed in the previous negotiations. This might help bring forward some new resolution.</P>
      <?oasys [ah?>
      <P>The elements involved are no secret. I refer here to stability of the inclusive institutions, the ending of paramilitarism in all its forms and the decommissioning of all illegally held arms. I use the word &ldquo;illegally&rdquo; because certain spokespersons who talk about the decommissioning of arms become caught up in the difference between what are legally and illegally held arms. Some arms are held legally in the North of Ireland, even though one element involved in the negotiations would lead us to believe that this is not the case. We must also deal with the areas of policing and human rights.</P>
      <?oasys [xh?>
      <P>It is unhelpful in any negotiation if people seek to take one element of a deal, move it outside the only context in which it is relevant and try to make a case for it. The question of releasing the prisoners from Castlerea is a case in point. This matter is consistently raised by Sinn F&eacute;in. There is also the question of how to deal with those paramilitary crimes that were committed by people who are now on the run. How do we respond to this matter within the terms of the Agreement? The fact is that neither issue comes under the Good Friday Agreement. This was one of the main stumbling blocks in the previous <Col N="1216"/>negotiations. Sinn F&eacute;in made it clear at that stage that it could not convince the leadership of the IRA to make any kind of positive gesture unless the prisoners were released. Having listened to the Minister&rsquo;s comments earlier and those of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s spokesperson on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;, I wonder how hard that organisation tried to convince the IRA to make such a gesture.</P>
      <P>The position of the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government on this matter has been outlined in categorical terms and it is to the effect that unless and until complete assurances are given as to the end of paramilitarism and the completion of decommissioning, this matter will not even be contemplated. The Minister also stated earlier that, in the event of such a happy ending, he would be willing to go to see the most important people in this drama and explain his and the Government&rsquo;s position.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments since the foundation of the State have tried to achieve what we are currently trying to achieve. There is no prospect of the restoration of the devolved arrangements or of the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in the absence of such a definite outcome.</P>
      <P>Any decision the Government takes will come about in the context of this island being a better place in which to live. We would then be living in a new and historic situation which we would never before have enjoyed. The Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government should, if such a day arrives, be answerable to the people alone for whatever steps they were obliged to take in achieving that particular and desirable goal. They will not be judged by the media, in soundbite form, or by any jumped up journalist who may or may not know what he or she is talking about.</P>

	<P>The Senator should not refer to Senator Ross when he is not in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has always made it clear that these prisoners will not be dealt with under the Good Friday Agreement. That has been reiterated on numerous occasions and the Minister reaffirmed it this evening. If one needed to inform oneself as to the bona fides of the Government, one would need only consider the stout defence it mounted when these prisoners went to the Supreme Court seeking to have themselves included under the Good Friday Agreement. Needless to say, the Government won its case.</P>
      <P>Everyone in the House is of the opinion that these individuals should serve their sentences. No right thinking person would say otherwise. However, the Government is involved in complex discussions aimed at trying to bring about acts of completion on all sides and it must take account of what might, perhaps, be unpalatable actions in order to achieve its goals. If men can see their <Col N="1217"/>way, in the manner of that wonderful Garda Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan, to the development of a situation where that may happen, the rest of us should find it in our hearts to look the same way.</P>

	<P>Many good points have been made in this evening&rsquo;s excellent debate. The security of our State is the backbone of our democracy and when that security is threatened, we are all threatened. If we do not punish those people who threaten our security, we weaken our democracy. The crimes of the killers of Garda McCabe are unacceptable to every right-thinking person in the country. Not many years ago this killing would have been a hanging offence, but the killers have only received the punishment for manslaughter. Many people would consider their sentence very short.</P>
      <P>These people were members of an illegal organisation which, as the Minister said today, continues massive criminal activity and intimidation North and South. Members of this illegal organisation are still at large. The Minister was asked why he cannot apprehend and lock up these people. I accept he is doing his best. We know this criminal activity is going on North and South and we cannot stop it. That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>No matter what negotiations the Minister and the Government must enter into to ensure we have peace North and South, the majority of the people would find it unacceptable if the McCabe killing were used as a pawn in the process. It is unacceptable that members of an illegal organisation would use it as a tool to get what they want. If the release of these prisoners is the only outstanding issue, it is being used as a continuing excuse not to bring about the peace we all want and expected following the Good Friday Agreement. These people have only a short remaining period of their sentence to serve so let us not use the situation as a pawn.</P>
      <P>The IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in have removed their balaclavas and donned pinstriped suits. Let us not be fooled by the facade.</P>

      <P>This is a serious matter. I commend the Minister for his clear and forthright statement on the matter. There was much fudging on the issue and this Minister has been clear and unambiguous. The situation is difficult. We are in the endgame of a horrible situation of conflict. <Col N="1218"/>Many people would think, perhaps correctly, that the release of the McCabe killers is a price worth paying for final peace. In my opinion it is only worthwhile if we really see the end of the IRA, the destruction of the arms and explosives and get a statement saying the war is over and the IRA is disbanded.</P>
      <P>Many people from both sides in the North have suffered terribly. Outrages were committed by beasts from both sides. The families have been asked to accept that the book must be closed while they still experience traumatic loss. Most of them have accepted this with dignity. It is important that Mrs. McCabe is consulted and kept informed on these matters. That may not always have been done.</P>
      <P>Some terrible killings have taken place in the North. One I had forgotten about was in the news again recently. It was the killing of two decent young men, friends from childhood, one a Roman Catholic and the other a member of the Church of Ireland. The Church of Ireland man was to be married and his Roman Catholic friend, in a lovely ecumenical gesture, was to be his best man. They were both slaughtered by Protestant thugs, yet those people are to be released.</P>
      <P>Another case involved an IRA man called McGinn who openly rejoiced in the killing of British army personnel. An unfortunate off-duty RUC man entering a sweet shop to buy a packet of sweets for his girlfriend was blasted off the face of the earth by McGinn who later laughed in the court about it.</P>
      <P>The other evening I switched on my television to watch Senator Ross, who unfortunately did not materialise, on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;. However, Mary Lou McDonald was there, as bold as brass and twice as unnatural. She had unspeakable gall. She was hoity-toity about torture in Iraq. What about the people who are belting hell out of people with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As she is not here, the Senator should not mention her name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity she is not, because I would say it to her face. We will erase her name; I wish I could. However, torture is still carried on in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The McCabe murder was murder. The killers got away with the charge of manslaughter because they intimidated the witnesses, which is a disgrace and should not be tolerated in this country. They pumped shots into the two garda&iacute; while they were strapped into their car. I saw the reprinted photograph in the newspaper the other day. Those garda&iacute; did not have any chance whatsoever. Imagine the thoughts in their minds as a brute approached and fired shot after shot at them to kill them. The IRA then lied and said the killers were not attached to it and that it was not an official action. Now, however, it claims them.</P><Col N="1219"/>
      <P>It is appropriate to ask a question which was asked very cogently by Vincent Browne on his programme the other evening. Is being a member of the IRA sufficient reason to get off any charge? The action that involved the killing of Garda Jerry McCabe was just a criminal act, a bank job to fund the pockets of the perpetrators. An excellent point of principle was made by Vincent Browne when he asked whether they would also have got off if they were found and convicted of paedophile rape. That is the question we ought to ask. Vincent Browne did the country a service by asking that question. It underlines the principle involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for his timely statement in Limerick on Monday night. He left nobody in any doubt of where he and the Government stand with regard to Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA. I come from Adare and what happened there in June 1996 was a brutal murder. Every time we walk through the village we are reminded of it.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has said the killings have nothing to do with the Good Friday Agreement. We have trust and confidence in the Minister and how he will implement his statement. If we have a full cessation of violence, a sufficient period, which could be up to two years, should elapse before there is any implementation or any discussions on the element discussed here today. I wish the Minister well. I have listened carefully to all the speakers on this motion and urge Members to give full backing to the Minister to carry out the declarations outlined in his statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the contributors to this debate, including the Minister. It was an excellent debate. While we disagree on this issue, because it is a matter of strategy and of principle, all of the voices of constitutional politics in this House should be heard on this issue.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>It is not and was never the intention of our group in putting forward this motion to divide the House on a spurious matter or to seek party-political advantage. However, we believe the Government&rsquo;s strategy on this is wrong. We have now reached the time when those parties connected with the republican movement must make a decision once and for all. By offering this carrot in the form of this amendment in the context of overall ending of paramilitarism, we are giving away a game we should not give away. I believed the Taoiseach when he gave that commitment in 1998. I do not believe Mr. Adams. The Minister posed that question. I do not believe Mr. Adams because I spoke privately to people who were in Capitol Buildings that night <Col N="1220"/>who told me that the IRA leadership came directly and asked the Government whether these people were included, and they were told &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I believed the Taoiseach on that.</P>
      <P>The dilemma is that the goalposts have been moved since 1998. The Government is wrong in putting forward this amendment, this final carrot in terms of the ending of paramilitarism. It is naive to view this group of killers as the only group remaining and to believe the IRA will go out of business, that all criminality will cease and that knee-capping will end. That is the group of people it denied in its first statement. The Minister knows better than I that a close family member of one of the people who is serving a sentence, a constituent of mine, was taken across the Border recently in South Armagh and shot in both knees.</P>
      <P>The notion that the provos have great respect for the four people who are doing time in Castlerea is nonsense. It is naive to believe the world will be transformed if they are allowed out. I do not believe the world will change simply because these people are released from their prison sentences. That is the issue of strategy I suggest the Government has got badly wrong on this occasion. As the Minister knows, there is cross-party agreement on the Northern Ireland peace talks, but we disagree on this issue, and it is right that this disagreement be heard in public. One of the great dilemmas of this process is that it has been between executive and executive and has bypassed most of the parties in this House. For ten years we have put up with it. For ten years we have seen advances by the Provisional IRA as it continues to use bargaining chips along the way and make fools of us all.</P>
      <P>The time has come for that to end. We must tell them we will not cross this Rubicon. If the Minister accepts the motion and takes the attitude with these people that our republic is strong, that we will not capitulate to every demand they put on the table, that after ten years we have had enough of them, he will be in a much stronger position in the end-game discussions to which colleagues have referred.</P>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that 55 people in this State and 444 people in Northern Ireland were released under licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That was not the case in the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It was in Northern Ireland. If the Minister has evidence that any of the 55 people released in this State have been involved in the type of criminality that he has rightly put on the record of this House, I advise him to test it in the courts. These people have already got away with murder. It would be adding insult to injury if they were allowed to be involved in smuggling, racketeering and other forms of criminality. On <Col N="1221"/>that point I ask the Minister for greater clarification. If there is evidence, let the Minister have it tried in the courts, convict those people again and put them behind bars.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not reply to my specific question about the two on the run who escaped prosecution eight years ago in Adare. Are these people part and parcel of one ultimate deal? They must face the charges, as the other men did, if <Col N="1222"/>they come back and are arrested in this State. We should never countenance in this State the notion that crimes can be simply expunged and put to one side. In the name and memory of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and other fine officers who have given their lives for this country, we should not allow terrorists to rewrite our history. On that basis, I will be calling a vote.</P>
