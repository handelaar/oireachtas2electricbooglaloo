	<P>I have received notice from Senator Scanlon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the criteria for the processing and confirming of grant applications under the equal opportunities child care programme.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Terry of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to state when the razor wire mounted on the wall surrounding Farmleigh will be removed.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to state when the new primary school will be provided at Kilfinane, County Limerick.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to review the role of ALAB.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify if there will be a reduction of 25 beds and staff cuts at the Plunkett nursing home, Boyle, County Roscommon.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Scanlon, Terry and Finucane as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Feighan as it is repetitious of a similar motion taken on 28 April 2004. Senator McHugh may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the Annual Report of the Ombudsman 2003, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 4 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements;</P>
    <P>No. 2, Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2004, Committee Stage, to be taken from 4 p.m. until 5 p.m., to resume at 7 p.m. and to conclude at 8.30 p.m. by one question from the Chair. However, we will watch how the debate develops because I would prefer the Bill to get as full an airing as it needs on Committee Stage; and No. 21, motion 19, the Private Members&rsquo; motion, to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that at the conclusion of the Order of Business statements on the interim report of the Commission on Electronic Voting will take place for a period of two hours. I want the Leader to inform the House whether it is still the Government&rsquo;s intention to push ahead this Friday with the Electoral (Amendment) Bill which would give effect to e-voting, given the Commission on Electronic Voting ruled so overwhelmingly against the Government&rsquo;s plans last week. It would be an act of ridiculous proportions if the Government were to push ahead with this Bill next Friday. I ask the Leader to make a very firm statement in the House today as to her intentions to bring the Bill before the House on Friday.</P>
    <P>The commission has done an excellent job in venting public and Opposition frustrations on this issue so far. I heard the Taoiseach state over the weekend that when the commission can give full support to e-voting we will proceed. The Government needs to convince the Opposition and the public at large of the merits of this proposal. Will the Leader not agree that the only person who should be charged with fraud is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for shamelessly wasting &euro;52 million? This is the same week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>He should be charged with fraud.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should withdraw that remark.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This man has committed to spending &euro;52 million on behalf of the taxpayer when there are so many other projects to be supported. This was the same week the Minister for Social and Family Affairs attacked people for <Col N="711"/>social welfare fraud. One of her colleagues is up to his neck in it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, please withdraw that remark.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I will substitute the word &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;gross deception&rdquo;, in deference to the Chair. We need statements on this matter today. It was this House, on all sides, that first raised many questions and objections to e-voting. This House needs to debate this matter today. Unless the Government takes on board the views of the Opposition and the public at large, it will once again show the irrelevance of this House on general issues such as this. We need to debate the issue fully and openly and not to have the Bill before us on Friday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the proposal. I was disappointed with the Chair&rsquo;s ruling last week that it was unnecessary to adjourn the House to discuss this issue, but I accepted the ruling. It is unfortunate that we did not have a debate. For that reason it is crucial we support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s proposal that this debate be taken. It is a very serious matter. It is daft that we should enter a debate on this legislation on Friday without having discussed the most germane and relevant information that has come into our hands about it.</P>
    <P>I also believe the House was misled on the issue of accuracy and secrecy when we discussed this previously. I have no way of knowing whether that was done deliberately. It seems the report has made it quite clear that we were seriously and absolutely misled in respect of secrecy and accuracy, among other issues. I want to know how that happened.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not proven.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to know how that came to be the case. The Minister said the problems mentioned by the commission were brought to its attention by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is the case, why were the problems not brought to the attention of the Houses, particularly the Seanad? There is something completely and utterly wrong about that. We need to discuss the matter. Most of us feel it should be considered. I do not know if we were misled by choice or inadvertently. Members on all sides could suggest better ways to use the &euro;50 million that has been spent on the misuse of the electronic voting proposals.</P>
    <P>I speak as someone who supported electronic voting until the last debate we had on the matter, when I said that sufficient doubt had been created to bring about a change of mind. I am on the record as having changed my mind in that regard. <Col N="712"/>I ask the House to consider what I said. If this issue is to be dealt with, it can only be dealt with on a non-party basis. I made that point on the last two occasions on which we discussed the matter. The decision should not be in the hands of a political party. The Government should not have an interest in the matter, apart from the individual interests of public representatives. There is no reason it should not be dealt with in an all-party fashion, with all concerns being taken into consideration. I ask the Chair to take on board the issue of whether the House was misled. I intend to raise the issue at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>It is hard for Independent Members to keep up with the many changes that are taking place. Every time we check, it seems that Fianna F&aacute;il has had another change in its configuration.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think that is a matter for the Order of Business. It is irrelevant.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It has lost one, kicked out another and another one is going to the House of Lords. I do not know where Fianna F&aacute;il is going.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know where the republican party is going now. Is it going to send a few more over to Westminster?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We could lose a few more.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We could have Lord O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to know whether Dr. Conor Cruise O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s problems with the Revenue Commissioners will cause a difficulty for the Labour Party.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse and support the proposal made by the leader of the Fine Gael Party in the House, Senator Brian Hayes. This is the first opportunity the House has had to discuss, however briefly, the interim report of the Commission on Electronic Voting. It is important that we should give it a good deal more time than that which is proposed. It is clear that we should be told in advance whether the Government intends to proceed with the debate planned for Friday, which would be farcical. The commission&rsquo;s report is a serious one. It constitutes a damning indictment of the judgment of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. Not only did he seek to railroad through what we now know to be unproven technology &mdash; I will not put it more strongly than that &mdash; but he did so with a breathtaking arrogance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="713"/>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unacceptable, frankly, that he chose to treat those who asked reasonable questions almost as technophobes or Neanderthals. We know that he was wrong, so he should pay the price. While there can be a tendency for Opposition Members to ask for resignations and the heads of Ministers more quickly than we should, I think that in a similar instance in any other jurisdiction, the Minister in question would no longer be in office.</P>
    <?oasys [dc20]?><P>The House is probably aware that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, appointed a commission for Africa yesterday. It struck me that the House could usefully have a debate on the issue. It is probably not an exaggeration to say that the entire continent of Africa has become something of a basket case in recent years. Its infrastructure is probably less developed than it was in colonial days. Africa is riven by civil strife and war. Civil governance is not established and corruption is endemic. There are signs of hope, such as the establishment of the African Union and the pursuit of a policy of renaissance for Africa by the South African President, Mr. Mbeki. Many Senators have an interest in the issue. A particular source of interest is the fact that Ireland has provided an increased amount of overseas development aid to Africa in recent years. The House could have a useful debate on the matter and a degree of consensus could be reached.</P><?oasys [dc0]?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the case of Mr. Tom Sweeney who is on hunger strike outside the gates of Leinster House. In all my years in the Houses, I do not recall any such similar protest.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden, you raised this issue last week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I did.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be more appropriate as a matter on the Adjournment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am calling on the Minister with responsibility for the Residential Institutions Redress Board to outline Mr. Sweeney&rsquo;s case to the House. Issues affecting the world are raised in the House, yet there is a man outside the gates on the 21st day of a hunger strike. It is about time someone took action because in a few days he could be dead. The Archbishop of Dublin, Most Rev. Diarmuid Martin, who is a great humanitarian, made a private visit to him last night. The Leader of the House has also intervened with regard to an ambulance.</P>
    <P>Hunger strike is an extreme weapon of protest. Although I accept that governments cannot give in to every hunger strike, something must be done in this case. He is not allowed to put up a tent to keep himself and his son, who is with him, dry at night. This was a particular problem last night given the wind and rain. We are standing idly by and it is time somebody dealt with this case. Initially he was offered &euro;115,000 by the <Col N="714"/>redress board, but it was reduced by approximately &euro;50,000. If it is restored, he will break his strike and go to his grandchildren&rsquo;s First Holy Communion on Saturday. I appeal to the Leader to ask the appropriate Minister to come to the House for an emergency debate to explain why Mr. Sweeney is on hunger strike and how we can assist in getting him to come off it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Having watched the Committee Stage debate on electronic voting, the arrogance of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government amazed me. Any Member who raised queries on it was labelled a Luddite or accused of anti-globalisation. If the Minister had adopted a constructive tone with all the leading people in this field and Opposition Members, he might not have found himself in the unfortunate situation in which  he is now. If the Minister was a managing director of a company and made a decision on the basis of the information he had to spend over &euro;50 million, he would not be in a job now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>As spokesperson on European affairs, I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government on how they conducted the ceremonies to celebrate European Union enlargement on 1 May. It was a great day to be Irish and for the Government. I am proud of how the Taoiseach and the Government conducted the ceremonies with superb panache. I ask that the House convey these congratulations to the Taoiseach, the Government and the Garda for implementing the regulations that ensured it all ran smoothly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s comments. Although I was abroad in Cyprus, I watched it on television and was immensely proud, as were many of my Cypriot friends who watched it with me, of the colour, efficiency and dignity with which the whole ceremony was held.</P>
    <P>With regard to electronic voting, I do not believe it was fraud on the part of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but incompetence. Incompetence can be a resigning matter, particularly with the large amount of money involved. However, my distinguished friend, Senator Finucane, does not appear to know that much about business. As Senator Ross has said, and I agree with him, the sad fact is that in business if a managing director loses &euro;52 million, he is usually given a bonus and shares.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Not down in Limerick.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, undermined the senior professional body dealing with computer science by rubbishing it as a flat-earther and anti-globalisation protestor. If it is claimed that Ireland has the most wonderful electronic industry, why was the contract given to <Col N="715"/>one Dutchman? It seems bizarre that there was no confidence in our own industry to produce this type of voting machine.</P>
    <P>It is now more essential than ever to have a debate on the Iraqi situation. We must continue to expose the hypocrisy of the United States and Britain. Mr. Rumsfeld affected to be shocked that American soldiers could torture. We all knew this was happening. He defended similar actions in Guantanamo Bay. Perhaps his excuse is &ldquo;We export torture&rdquo;. We know this is what has been happening. It has been authoritatively reported in <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>The Guardian</i>. It was never denied that the USA had been exporting those people whom it could not sufficiently maltreat to places such as Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. We should expose this hypocrisy. I am old enough to remember that within the past 15 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator calling for a debate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the UK Government licensed the export of a custom-built torture chamber to the Gulf states.</P>
    <P>There have recently been a number of court cases involving people in and around the Oireachtas, the costs of which have been absolutely crippling. Humanely speaking, whatever the rights and wrongs of the cases, one must feel sympathy for people faced with legal bills of &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million. Due to the enormous and unregulated fees charged by the legal industry, citizens are being intimidated. They are being frightened out of access to justice and to the courts. The Competition Authority should consider this. The whole judicial system should also be investigated, including the political appointment of judges and the fact that they do not have to make any declarations of interest. Judges seem to put themselves above the law, ignoring mandatory sentences. I am against mandatory sentencing, but the Oireachtas made the rules and the judges ignored them. The whole system must be investigated.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Army on the superb display it put on at the ceremony at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and also at Arbour Hill. I also commend the garda&iacute; who, on a very hot weekend, behaved coolly for the most part. Anyone who was at Arbour Hill this morning could not but have noticed the flower display, for which the gardeners deserve credit.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on Iraq in view of the allegations of torture and killing by American and British soldiers. These things happened during a war. We all remember in our own country the executions of 77 republicans during the early years of the Free State and, of course, the ambush at Ballyseedy of which Paudie Fuller&rsquo;s father, Stephen Fuller, was the sole survivor. That does not mean we should excuse <Col N="716"/>these actions or be afraid to talk about them. We should have a debate on Iraq during which we can discuss developments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought we would start today&rsquo;s proceedings with congratulatory remarks about the accession of ten new EU member states but instead we are debating an issue that has caused the Government to become the laughing stock of Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because of the manner in which it has told us untruths in this Chamber regarding the proposed electronic voting system. I understand yesterday&rsquo;s Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party meeting was somewhat heated.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not heated at all.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Will we have an investigation into the counting software used in the 2002 general election? It is important that we have a full investigation into the system used in four or five constituencies on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children should come to the House to clarify whether the Hanly report is alive or dead. Politicians and those running for election are misinforming the general public about the Hanly report. There is a great deal of confusion at accident and emergency units around the country about whether they will survive. They will probably survive until after 11 June, when the Government will have new priorities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps Hanly is in the accident and emergency department rather than being dead or alive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is part of the untruths team that is travelling around the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope we will have an economic debate some time this session. I am pleased to see Ireland moving back up to tenth place in the world competitiveness league, only behind Finland, Denmark and Luxembourg and ahead of all the larger states of the EU.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government deserve some credit for establishing the Commission on Electronic Voting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They were forced into it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition wants to damn us if we do and damn us if we do not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Hayes and other Members who spoke about e-voting. It is now quite apparent, particularly following the commission&rsquo;s ruling, that the matter needs further consideration. I am sure the Leader agrees that <Col N="717"/>we do not need to debate the Electoral (Amendment) Bill this week, because it may need further clarification.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Committee Stage has been passed and the Bill is on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I say this in the light of what has happened since. The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report is important, but I ask the Leader to accede to a debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a request, not a question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. The voting system belongs to the people and we need to give it more consideration. There is no need to rush. We are now aware of the possible inaccuracies &mdash; whatever about leprechauns &mdash; and the question of reliability. I always felt the system would fail on grounds of secrecy in view of the Supreme Court ruling of 1972 in the case of McMahon<i> v. </i>the Attorney General. I respectfully suggest that the Leader consider accepting the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very difficult to talk of human rights in other parts of the world after hearing our colleague Senator Leyden talk of the human rights issue at the gates of Leinster House. The world goes on nevertheless.</P>
    <P>I support Senator McDowell&rsquo;s request for a debate on Africa. Specific questions need to be answered. In Darfur in Sudan, near the Chad border, ethnic cleansing is being carried out as we speak. Men, women and children are being killed and the international community has not yet responded. However, Sudan has been elected within the past 24 hours to the UN Human Rights Commission. What is going on in Sudan relates to the politics of the region, but the Minister should express an opinion. Regarding what is happening in middle Africa, and the establishment of the commission to which Senator McDowell referred, has Ireland any involvement or input into that commission? It would be useful to clarify Ireland&rsquo;s role, especially in light of our very deep commitment to the African continent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent weeks we have seen disturbing advertisements on roadside hoardings and in supermarkets. Cancer cures costing &euro;100 are being offered within 24 hours, with contact numbers supplied. This is very disturbing for people who are terminally ill. These advertisements were the subject of a radio programme yesterday, and people from all over Ireland were telephoning in. I ask the Leader to ask the relevant Minister what regulations exist to curb this malpractice, which raises the hopes of the terminally ill. Urgent action must be taken.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was the e-voting report not supplied in Irish as well as in English? This is in breach of the regulations. Only the heading was in Irish. We will shortly debate the Ombudsman&rsquo;s <Col N="718"/>report, which is in English and Irish, as is normal practice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The e-voting report is a matter for the commission chairman.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader should make inquiries. Will the Leader tell us why the voting system failed in this House last week? When we tried to vote electronically, we could not do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Cullen, pulled the plug.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The failure is a matter for the Chair. An inquiry is being made.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should be given the details.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>They will be provided to Senators.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Leyden on the need for the appropriate Minister to attend the House and speak about the redress board. We were promised legislation last Christmas but we have no idea when it will be brought forward.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>In what area?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the redress board. Perhaps the Minister might come and update the House on what is happening in that regard. I am aware many people are waiting for institutions to be included.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague, Senator Cummins, who talked about the advertisement for the cure for cancer. What is going on? The way people are allowed get away with it is appalling. If there is a medical practitioner involved in such advertising, he or she can be dealt with by the Medical Council, held accountable and called before a fitness to practice hearing. In some cases people who are not medical doctors are calling themselves doctors but we have no forum here to deal with them unless they are reported to the Garda and it becomes a criminal offence. Currently, however, there is no mechanism in place to deal with people advertising their wares, which is all they are doing because they are not providing a professional service.</P>

	<P>I raised the issue of e-voting in the House a few months ago and the circumstances in which the contract was awarded to a firm for remote e-voting. I felt the firm was very close to the Government. There is now egg on the Government&rsquo;s face due to the fact that this company has not carried out its duties in a proper fashion. I also take issue with the way the Minister talked down to us and called us Luddites and stupid. I am delighted to see egg on the face of this arrogant Minister.</P>

	<P>Do you have a question for the Leader?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be invited to the House, and for once I would like to congratulate him on the fact that the garda&iacute; exercised their powers in an excellent manner during the march. Many protesters were very peaceful but an anarchist group &mdash; I would say it was the WOMBLES &mdash; came to this country and tried to cause trouble. However, the garda&iacute; behaved in an excellent fashion. I am delighted that we can have some law and order on days when we need it. I take issue with the comments made by a lady on radio today who objected to the judge remanding some of these protesters on bail. She said it was a disgrace that the garda&iacute; and the judge should be imposing fines on people who only removed the hats of garda&iacute; or who would not get out of the way of garda&iacute;. I praise the Minister and the garda&iacute; and I hope we see much more of that.</P>

	<P>I share Senator Mooney&rsquo;s call for a debate on Sudan. It is perhaps not one of the better known conflicts yet it is a serious one in that it has the potential for even further division. It appears it is becoming a Muslim-Christian conflict but because it does not involve American soldiers it has not made the headlines and this serious issue is not spoken about.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with what my colleague and the Fine Gael Leader in the House, Senator Brian Hayes, said about the need for this House to debate the electronic voting debacle. The Leader will be aware we are soon to embark on a debate on Seanad reform but before we do that the Seanad must be relevant. The public issue of the day, the electronic voting mess, requires to be debated in this House.</P>
    <P>I realise we are trying to jump ahead by 48 hours but the idea of finalising the Electoral (Amendment) Bill in the Seanad is Alice in Wonderland politics. We should not waste our time and taxpayers&rsquo; money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like an indication from the Leader that this House will remain relevant and not go down the cul-de-sac of Alice in Wonderland politics.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who have praised the Government&rsquo;s contribution to last week&rsquo;s accession of new countries into the European Union. Perhaps not only in the House, but throughout the country, we have not fully taken on board the significance of what happened last week, when a new Europe was built. A peaceful Europe is being created. When I was first a Member of the Seanad, back in 1987, Europe was divided. We had the Berlin Wall and a cold war. Missiles from the Soviet army were pointing towards western Europe. The European Continent and the world are entirely changed today, and Ireland has played a significant role in the building of that new Europe, of which we can all be very proud.</P>
    <P>I hope this is appropriate but the Cathaoirleach may interrupt if it is not; the House should send its congratulations to our MEP for Munster, the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, who has announced he is not seeking re-election. His contribution over recent years, not merely to Munster or Irish politics but to those of Europe, has been immense. He is a marvellous ambassador for politics and Ireland, and we should wish him well.</P>

	<P>He would make an excellent commissioner.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, the leader of the Opposition, made a proposal, which was later seconded, and that is his right. Regarding the electronic voting Bill, I understand that Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked on Friday morning why it was on the following week. I know that we do not talk about the other House, but I must point out that it passed Committee Stage and is on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il. I raised a query because I wondered why we should have the Bill when we are not to have electronic voting. I understand the commission requires a legal framework. It was set up for the job which it did so admirably and will now be placed on a statutory footing. For that to happen, it needs a legal framework, hence the need for the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is only one section.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I was explaining the reasons. I was not going to walk in here today without knowing why the Bill was being taken. The commission needs a statutory set-up and legal framework, hence the need for the Bill to be passed. On the Senator&rsquo;s point that we now need <Col N="721"/>two hours now to debate electronic voting, we will have four hours on Friday to do so. That seems ample to me. I know Senators will be expressing in macro-form then that which they have expressed in micro-form and we will reply properly. I do not know why the Senator would want another two hours.</P><Miles com="cl" par="105"/>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole supported Senator Brian Hayes on the matter of seeking two hours now for a debate. He alleged that the House had been misled by both secrecy and inaccuracy. I notice a combination of Opposition Members that bodes well for both the Opposition and ourselves in replying on the issue today.</P>

	<P>On a point of information, we are not members of the Opposition and are independent of all others.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Lord O&rsquo;Toole. Senator McDowell also agreed with Senator Brian Hayes, alleging that this matter was a damning indictment of the Government. The Senator raised the Commission for Africa which the UK Prime Minister has set up and which will be chaired by Bob Geldoff. It is important the Senator raised the matter as we have a significant presence there. Over many decades Ireland has made a commitment to Africa and a debate on it would be useful.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden referred to Mr. Tom Sweeney who is on hunger strike outside the gates of Leinster House. I went to see him last week because the Seanad raised the matter. Somebody with him asked for an ambulance, but he would <Col N="722"/>not get into it. We will endeavour to find out with whom to raise this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane referred to the Commission on Electronic Voting and castigated the Minister. Senator Ormonde congratulated the Taoiseach on the enlargement of the EU and the celebrations at the weekend. The arrangements and organisation of the programme over the Saturday and Sunday were a mammoth task. The occasion passed off well. Major concerns were raised in this House last week about possible overreaction on the security front. However, if the garda&iacute; were not there, it would have been another matter. I thought they handled everything remarkably well. There was not much of a protest really. It was a beautiful sunny day and everybody there was glad to be involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the dignity and colour of our enlargement day. He saw it from one of the countries, which in part joined the enlargement. He also commented on electronic voting and on Iraq, in particular. It is difficult to know precisely what we are being shown on television in this regard. The allegations of human rights infringements by UK forces in Iraq are apparently being examined. The Americans, however, have almost confessed to it. The crudity of the leaders themselves is being expressed further down the line&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-and that is how it is happening. It is frightful and awful. It is a blot on humanity that one person should treat another in this way, no matter what the hierarchical differences between them. One can scarcely look at it, it is so awful.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon talked about the Defence Forces and the way they displayed themselves, both on Saturday and today. He referred to the way the graves are kept. I agree with his call for a debate on Iraq and we will seek that. Senator Bannon wants a full investigation into the results of the 2002 election. I would like that, however, we did not have electronic voting in my constituency so I would not come into the fray.</P>

	<P>Where does it stand?</P>

	<P>Senator Mansergh wants an economic debate and remarked how we had moved up the competition ladder. Nobody is praising that at all. I thank the Senator for raising it.</P>

	<P>It is coming up on the doorsteps all the time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>In practically every house one calls on these days everyone is employed. When <Col N="723"/>I started in 1982 it was common to find everyone in a house unemployed. Nearly everyone is employed now, which is great. It is a yardstick.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Still they are not happy.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a characteristic of humankind not to be happy. Senator Coghlan mentioned the voting system, which he says belongs to the people. Senator Mooney wanted a debate on Africa. I agree that is much needed.</P><P>Senator Cummins raised the signs regarding cancer treatment, one of which I saw in Dungarvan in March. We rant and rave about Joe Duffy, but he did the nation a service yesterday for an hour and a half in this regard. The difficulty is that proper alternative medicine has an authentic structure and people avail of it. However, the people behind these posters are not part of that. A man is offering a cancer cure for &euro;100. It costs &euro;20,000 in the Killaloe East Clinic to be &ldquo;cured&rdquo; and then people pass away. It is shocking when people are so caught up in despair over their loved ones. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, made a statement on this today in the newspapers, but we should invite him to the House. The regulations are the problem, as Senator Feeney said. If one regulates the reputable alternative medical practitioners, what does one do about the others? It is significant that 20,000 people went to Killaloe. Three very well-spoken women contributed to Joe Duffy&rsquo;s radio show yesterday whose husbands had died and from whom the practitioner extracted &euro;20,000 each. They did not believe in the possibility of a miracle cure but thought the treatment would arrest the progress of the disease. The autopsy on one of the husbands showed that all the tablets administered to him were still lodged in his gut. It is terrible. I am glad the Senator raised the issue because it would be suitable for the Minister to come in and talk about it.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Browne&rsquo;s point, the report on e-voting will be published in Irish next week and we have the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be available next week, as will the Seanad report, as Gaeilge.</P><Col N="724"/>
    <P>Senator Browne also mentioned the Residential Institutions Redress Board and he has asked several times when that Bill will be introduced. I will try to deal with it when I deal with Senator Leyden&rsquo;s request to outline Mr. Sweeney&rsquo;s case to the House.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Feeney supported Senator Cummins&rsquo;s point that some people who are not medical doctors are calling themselves doctors. It seems that it is very easy to be a &ldquo;doctor&rdquo;, although I mean no disrespect to any doctor in the House. I do not refer to medical doctors, but to the holders of doctorates in philosophy.</P>
    <P>The company Senator Feighan mentioned was a PR company, not an implementation company. He congratulated the Garda which will please the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. I will convey the message to him most earnestly.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>No. He has a very worthwhile job. He also repeated his request for a debate on Africa.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford asked for the appropriate Minister to come to the House to discuss electronic voting. I was waiting to see if the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, could come in but he has been appointed to the implementation body and it is difficult to get an appointment with him.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>He is one of the leprechauns.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He is a very busy person and everyone is caught up in the local elections.</P>
    <P>Further to our discussion on Europe, we are enthused about the new member states but we should recognise that they all have old cultures with histories stretching back thousands of years in some cases. While it is wonderful that they have shaken off the yoke of serfdom and have joined the European Union, it is equally important that we remember that they have long histories and distinctive cultures.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the House has, with commendable speed, set time aside to discuss the report of the Ombudsman. After all, the report was published only a week or so ago.</P>
    <P>This is the first report to be presented to these Houses by Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, who took up her position midway through last year. As it covers the entire year 2003, I appreciate that much of the work behind it took place when her distinguished predecessor was in charge. That said, determining the thrust of an annual report is very much the prerogative of whoever holds the position of Ombudsman when it is finalised. What we have before us, therefore, is unmistakably Ms O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s first report. It is also, as she points out, significant in one other respect. It is the 20th annual report of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>It makes a great deal of sense for Members of the Oireachtas to take the opportunity this early in her stewardship to offer her feedback on the areas she has chosen to highlight and possibly share their insights with her on the institution&rsquo;s operation. It is not that I would claim for Senators and Deputies any monopoly in expressing views on what the current or any Ombudsman should do or exceptional wisdom in commenting the problems she has remedied. I do not doubt that several people from other walks of life have told her what they thought since her report was published.</P>
    <P>The office of the Ombudsman is an institution with which parliamentarians have a unique relationship. This is not just because anyone taking the job has to be willing to face his or her character and ability being discussed in both Houses or even that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s annual reports are made available to the Houses before anyone in Government sees them, but because the Ombudsman is, in a sense, an extension of our public representative selves who can reach parts of the public service we cannot reach and can spend more time than is available to us in resolving the problems that arrive on our desks. The office of the Ombudsman does even more than that; it probes our system of public administration at several levels and across all its components in an almost random, low-key way. By following up complaints from people who felt hard done by at the way officialdom treated them, it can tell us what needs attention and what could be fine-tuned and it functions as an unspectacular check on the workings of our machinery of Government. Ms O&rsquo;Reilly describes this as a privileged bird&rsquo;s eye view of public administration and the working through of legislation on the ground, which she promises to share with us and the community generally through her engagements with the Oireachtas and its committees.</P><Col N="728"/>
    <P>In her first report, the Ombudsman gives us, at the least, an inkling of what she thinks is important to her and her task. Many institutions were established in the 1960s and 1970s to deal with dispute resolutions of various kinds and they promised to operate in a common sense way without the presence or expense of lawyers. Many of them turned into quasi-legal fora. When legislation to establish the Ombudsman was being debated in these Houses, similar emphasis was placed on the informality and user-friendliness of the particular institution. It is significant that after 20 years of operation that promise has been kept and our new Ombudsman can boast that her office can still provide resolutions for disputes between individual citizens, at no cost to them, and public servants. Not only that, the staff of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office actually help inarticulate citizens to put into words what has upset them and help them see the complaint.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman makes the point that she and her staff, by also addressing procedural deficiencies, yield results often more broadly based than those achieved through the formal legal system. There are two features of her office&rsquo;s operation that she highlights. First, it does not see itself as hostile to the organisation against which a complaint has been made but as supporting both parties to bring about resolution. Second, it aims to reduce the need for it to get involved in solving complaints by encouraging each organisation to develop its own internal complaints mechanisms. She is conscious that this has been done on a wide scale as a result of initiatives taken by her predecessor. She notes that the practicalities of setting up such systems have been discussed by the managements of various organisations but she wants to take these further by encouraging organisations, particularly local authorities, to pool information on how effective resolutions to difficult problems have been achieved. These approaches are very much in tune with the customer service ethos that my Department and others are currently inculcating.</P>
    <P>Much of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report is taken up with selected cases under various headings. They make interesting reading for anyone who is charged with running a public service organisation or anyone who in a personal or representative capacity has been involved in tussles with various Departments, offices or boards. I do not know which ombudsman in what country started including in his or her reports selections of the complaints which came his or her way. Whoever it was had a clever inspiration because such selections give a flavour of the problems with which an Ombudsman must deal. I am conscious that they are not provided for the entertainment of readers although they can help to get the office and the assistance it can provide better known to members of the public who feel they have no come back against an official decision or action which harms them. I appreciate that they are sometimes brought to our attention because the Ombudsman feels they illustrate a <Col N="729"/>problem she hopes to eradicate or one in respect of which she believes there is a satisfactory solution that is not being taken up by officialdom and which she feels is of such importance that she needs the help of Members of these Houses to sell to the powers that be. The House will share my pleasure that none of the cases recounted in the 2003 report seems likely to fall into the latter category. Obviously, the Ombudsman is more patient, more tolerant or meets a better class of complainant than most of us; we do not get in her select cases any example of a &ldquo;chancer&rdquo; who tried to pull wool over her eyes or those of her staff.</P>
    <P>Important as the select cases can be in helping us to understand the Ombudsman&rsquo;s role, the fuller story is, I suspect, to be found in the tables and charts at the back of the report. They tell us the number of complaints which reached the Ombudsman last year and what happened to them. These are interesting and probably show a pattern none too different from our own post-boxes. Slightly more than 3,000 complaints were received last year but when those falling outside the Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction were winnowed out, 2,213 remained.</P>
    <P>The report does not tell us what happened to this particular bunch of complaints because the processing of a complaint often spans a number of years. However, it does tell us about complaint cases completed last year &mdash; a mixture of complaints that came in during 2003 and those carried over from previous years. The way those complaints panned out is probably instructive. Of 2,359 complaints, 346 were fully or partially resolved, more than a third were not upheld, over a quarter were discontinued and 20 were withdrawn. When we move to complaints related to the Civil Service, 440 of 1,027 were not upheld and another 256 were discontinued.</P>
    <P>Across the board the pattern is for complaints to cluster most heavily around those Departments, which give out money, namely, the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Agriculture and Food and Education and Science. Looked at in the light of the throughput of individual transactions in these Departments, the number of complaints to the Ombudsman they generate may seem minuscule. However, two facts must be remembered. Some people cannot cope with official forms and are driven to distraction by the details of complex schemes or the niceties of material they must provide if they are to get some benefit to which they are entitled. In this report the Ombudsman has segregated a clutch of case reports involving these vulnerable and marginalised people towards whom she feels a special responsibility. When one reads the particular cases, they give a sense of the importance of what her office does beyond what the crude statistics might lead us to believe. The second point to be borne in mind when looking at the small number of complaints upheld is that the Ombudsman deals with complaints of last resort. He or she cannot deal with a complaint unless it has already exhausted the redress <Col N="730"/>arrangements in a particular organisation. That said, the assistance rendered by the Ombudsman&rsquo;s staff sometimes involves helping their clients to use those mechanisms.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to find that that the number of invalid complaints received in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office massively exceeds the number of disallowed votes at a general election in any Irish constituency. Of 3,075 complaints in 2003, 862 were invalid. I can understand the 48 concerning pay, the 87 on Garda and courts and even the 156 on public bodies outside the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit. However, almost 400 invalid complaints related to private companies, banks and insurance. I suspect that the publicity the ombudsmen, the banks and insurance companies created leads to many invalid complaints to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>A category of complaints that caught my eye concerns cases in which a member of the public did not get a reply from a public service organisation. I appreciate that this may happen by accident in the best regulated organisation and I have no details on how in any particular case it occurred. In my early days in this job, someone mentioned a comment made in this House by T.K. Whitaker that in his life as a civil servant and a Senator he had noticed a correlation between courtesy and efficiency. That struck me as a sensible rule of thumb for dealing with public bodies. Therefore, I do not need to see reasons behind unanswered correspondence in order to be unhappy about it. Most public bodies have some kind of customer charter which obliges their staff to answer all letters within a certain number of days unless they raise complex issues needing more time to resolve. From my experience in the Department of Finance and the OPW, I know they are strongly policed in this regard.</P>
    <P>Ms O&rsquo;Reilly wears two official hats, which impinge on these Houses, those of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. I do not accuse her of insider trading in bringing to our notice in this report an issue with a freedom of information dimension, because the complaint clearly falls within the Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction. She is worried about an approach by Louth County Council to the release of information which resulted in an applicant being directed to go through FOI to get information, hence having to pay the up-front fee. Lest there is any feeling that this is part of an orchestrated campaign, I would like to make it clear that public bodies have always been encouraged to adopt a proactive approach to the release of non-contentious information so that the need to go through the formalities of the FOI Act is kept to a minimum. The recommended approach in this regard is enshrined in a notice from the central policy unit on FOI in the Department of Finance. In addition, since the introduction of up-front fees, the unit has emphasised that people making FOI requests should not be put to unnecessary expense and should be given the opportunity to obtain a refund where information can be <Col N="731"/>obtained outside of or exempt from FOI regulations.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman mentions new responsibilities that she expects to be conferred on her under new legislation, notably the Disability Bill and an amendment of her own governing statute. She also mentions the arrangements being made to divert appropriate complaints to the Ombudsman for Children. She looks forward to all of these. I expect we shall hear more about them between this and her next report. In the meantime, I commend the report to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I felt there were some undertones to his speech and that it made some digs at the Ombudsman, but perhaps I misread it. I will read it again carefully. He appeared to compliment her on one hand but pointed out some faults on the other, but perhaps that is due to the speech writer rather than the content.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report. It is good to be debating a report that is only a few months old and remains valid. We often get reports that are two or three years old and it is pointless to debate them. This report is still quite fresh. I am delighted the report is bilingual. I raised this matter on the Order of Business last week with regard to the interim report on e-voting, which was not bilingual. We have to wait two weeks for the Irish version of that report which is ridiculous. Perhaps the Ombudsman could take up that issue. All reports from State agencies should be bilingual and both versions should be issued at the same time.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear the Leader admit, as I had not realised it, that the report on Seanad reform belongs to the same category. It was issued in English and the Irish version is due in a few weeks&rsquo;. This is ridiculous in a country where Irish is a first language and where we promote Irish at every opportunity. Every county now has gaelscoileanna and col&aacute;ist&iacute; and Irish is coming more and more to the fore. The debate in this House on the matter of Irish becoming an official language of the EU received widespread support. Now, a few weeks later, we have produced some reports in English only. This issue should be discussed.</P>
    <P>I am aware that six months covered in this report relate to the term of the previous Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, and that the second six months relate to Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly. We have not had a full year report covering Ms O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s time in office yet. Pages 8 and 9 of the report are disturbing. They alert us to the fact that people with disabilities continue to be discriminated against, due to mindless bureaucracy. These pages made interesting reading and pointed out the difficulties involved in obtaining essential repairs grants and disabled persons&rsquo; grants.</P>
    <P>I am aware of some of these difficulties. While the staff in Carlow County Council are excellent <Col N="732"/>at their work, the system is so slow that, invariably, some people die before they are allocated a disabled person&rsquo;s grant. That is a shocking indictment of the system. I compliment the South Eastern Health Board in the Carlow area which has taken a pragmatic approach to the home help for the elderly scheme. I feel sure that, like me, many public representatives, when an application to a local authority for a disabled person&rsquo;s grant is turned down, turn to the health boards. I find the health boards more ready to facilitate people and they allow work to start and will pay the grant retrospectively. The administration of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant is not as accommodating. To expect a person who suffered a stroke to wait up to two years for a downstairs toilet or for alterations to a shower or bath is unfair. This area should be re-examined and needs increased funding.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste, quite correctly, pointed out recently that there are issues concerned with ageing and planning for old age. There are certainly related issues in terms of building regulations. I visited the new house of a friend recently and noticed that the light switches were all at a certain level. These regulations are now covered by law, which is welcome, and people in wheelchairs, for example, can now access their light switches.</P>
    <P>We should examine the building regulations and adapt houses so that in 40 years&rsquo; time when we are older we can still live in them. Many older houses in Carlow need major renovation because they were built with steps. Nobody thought ahead. Consequently, rails are necessary on the steps to enable people to gain access to the houses. We all grow old and we need to avoid that kind of scenario. I hope the Minister will examine that issue and provide extra funding for disabled person&rsquo;s grants, essential repairs grants and housing aid for the elderly. If an occupational therapist issues a report that a person has suffered a stroke, the person should get a grant automatically or, if not automatically, work should be allowed to commence straight away and the receipts and a bill submitted later. That would be a sensible approach.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we need an Ombudsman but we do. I am amazed by stories I hear as a public representative that I find hard to believe. One that springs to mind concerns a neighbour of mine who applied for planning permission to Kildare County Council. He submitted a planning application. New development levies were to be introduced a week after he was due to be given planning permission. The week before he was due to be given planning permission, Kildare County Council wrote to him seeking further information. That pushed him into the new development levy zone and he had to pay a few thousand extra euro in development charges. That was totally unfair and I directed him towards the Ombudsman. Through no fault of his own Kildare County Council pushed him into the new development levy zone. The information <Col N="733"/>Kildare County Council requested could have been furnished seven weeks earlier. It is a bit rich that a local authority should leave it until the 11th hour to seek information. I have no qualms about making the accusation that Kildare County Council acted disgracefully on that front and that it did so deliberately in order to gather more development levies.</P>
    <P>I challenged the Minister of State at the Department Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy, when he was here for the debate on rural housing guidelines to have the Government investigate that case, but nothing came of it. I wrote to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and he washed his hands of it. I hope the person in question will succeed when he brings his case to the Ombudsman because what happened was totally unfair.</P>
    <P>A major issue raised in this report is that of enforcement by local authorities. We have witnessed a building boom over the past few years and it is amazing with what builders are still getting away. The Planning and Development Act 2000 was to solve all problems. Unfortunately, it has not done so. How many builders have been refused planning permission because of past history? That was a major feature of the Planning and Development Act. I am aware of a housing estate that has been built in Carlow where people have been living for six or seven months and still do not have a telephone service because of a row between Eircom and the builder who has not put in the infrastructure which is necessary for Eircom to connect the telephones. The local authority has been tardy in that respect. I have brought the issue to its attention, but matters are not going well in the area of enforcement.</P>
    <P>When I was out canvassing lately I was amazed to discover that brand new houses did not have vents as are required under planning regulations if a house is to be connected to the natural gas grid in order to avoid explosions. The Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, is right to highlight that difficulty. We need full-time enforcement officers working in county councils who can inspect building sites while houses are being built and examine, scrutinise and monitor constantly because once a developer has left it is very hard to get him back to rectify problems. This would save the Ombudsman, the local authority and the public much grief afterwards.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the report that caught my attention was the idea of visitors to the office of the Ombudsman. That is an excellent idea. With Senator Feeney, I was privileged to join a parliamentary visit to Lesotho in Africa. We spoke very highly of the office of the Ombudsman when we were there. Unfortunately, Lesotho is still in the early stages of democracy. We explained the idea of committee structures at parliamentary level and also the idea of an ombudsman who is independent of the parliamentary system and acts as an extra voice <Col N="734"/>for the public. Lesotho is examining these concepts and that is a very welcome development. The Ombudsman has met a number of people and should continue to do so, especially in developing countries.</P>
    <P>The trends referred to in the report are worrying. The number of valid complaints received is up in almost all areas &mdash; the Civil Service, local authorities and health boards. That is not the direction in which we should be going. An Post features prominently. I am not surprised by that because An Post needs a major shake-up. I certainly am not satisfied with its performance. The service it gives is atrocious. We cannot depend on next-day post arriving. As long ago as the mid-1800s same-day post was guaranteed. That is hard to believe given that there was far more post than there is now because we have e-mail, faxes and other forms of communication now. An Post needs to get its act together in that regard. I am sure there will be many more complaints if it does not do so.</P>
    <P>I have dealt personally with Ombudsmen and found them very courteous. However, there was a long delay in dealing with queries. I was a member of a residents association in my estate, which was dealing with the issue of boundaries. The planning permission granted to the developer was very sloppy and did not clearly specify what boundaries were to be put in place. We went to the Ombudsman to obtain a ruling. He contacted the local authority, came out to see the estate and gave us a report. Unfortunately, it took longer than I would have expected and, in that instance, it did not yield a result. Perhaps it is a question of allocating extra resources to the Ombudsman. The office should be given every possible resource to enable it to give a speedy response.</P>
    <P>I was appalled in the context of section 7 of the Ombudsman Act, which can be invoked by the Ombudsman where there is a significant delay on the part of a public body in responding to the office of the Ombudsman, that the Department of Education and Science came out on top for the fourth year running. If the Department of Education and Science is slow in responding to the Ombudsman, what chance does an ordinary member of the public have? I hope the Minister will communicate with the Minister for Education and Science on that point. It is unsatisfactory and should not be allowed to continue. He should also communicate with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because local authorities are also guilty in that regard. A public body should automatically respond as quickly as possible to the Ombudsman without the need to invoke section 7 to remind it to reply quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the fees people must pay to secure requests under the Freedom of Information Act. Deputies, Senators, public representatives and county councillors should be exempt from such fees if their request is genuine. It is not fair to expect them to spend money <Col N="735"/>investigating issues on behalf of the public. The Minister should re-examine that issue. In any case where there is a clear public interest involved, the fee should be waived for public representatives.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about recent trends regarding forms. I regard myself as fairly well educated. I am certainly not the cleverest person in the world but I am by no means the least clever. However, forms are becoming more difficult to complete. Members of the public find it difficult to complete forms relating to pensions and medical cards. Something will have to be done to simplify such forms.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State admitted in his speech that 156 bodies remain outside the remit of the Ombudsman. They should be included in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit on a phased basis. Perhaps the Minister of State will outline the plans that exist to include such bodies. Ms O&rsquo;Reilly indicated that she would like some of the public hospitals to come under her remit. The public would welcome such a move. I am sure that certain bodies cannot be included for various reasons. Will the Minister of State indicate the number of bodies that can be included? What is the relevant timescale for their inclusion?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and his officials to the House. I am an enthusiast for the office of the Ombudsman, which was established in 1980. The establishment of the office was one of the many excellent administrative reforms introduced by the much-maligned Government that served between 1977 and 1981. The creation of an independent electoral commission was a similar reform. The office of the Ombudsman has stood the test of time.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Browne&rsquo;s suggestion that the remit of the office should be extended to the rest of the public sector and his point that some forms are too complicated. He may have been a little unfair in another respect, however, because the report under discussion is a bilingual one, as all reports of a public nature should be. It is necessarily the case that such a report should be drafted in either of the two official languages, before being translated into the other language. It is obvious that a report may be urgently needed in some circumstances. The recent publication of the report of the Commission on Electronic Voting may be an example of such an instance. It could be argued that it is acceptable for a summary to be produced in the other language in such circumstances, if it is impossible to produce both versions of the report simultaneously.</P>
    <P>We have been fortunate to have had three exceptionally distinguished holders of the office of the Ombudsman &mdash; Mr. Michael Mills, Mr. Kevin Murphy and Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly. Part of the report we are discussing covers Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s period in office. I pay tribute to him not only for his work as Ombudsman but also as a very distinguished and able senior official in the <Col N="736"/>Department of Finance. He had particular responsibility for the public service and social partnership and he made a major contribution to the development of the economy and social partnership over the years. I am sure that Mr. Murphy and many others will be given honourable mentions when the second volume of the history of the Department of Finance comes to be published, the first volume having been written by Professor Ronan Fanning.</P>
    <P>I differ slightly from the Minister of State in one respect. The office of the Ombudsman is a public office, but I consider that it relates more to the system of administration than to the political system. I was impressed by the manner in which the office dealt with a case some years ago. I advised a widow in Cork to take her case to the Ombudsman to claim entitlement to a widow&rsquo;s pension. There was some uncertainty about her exact entitlement because some documents had gone missing. She was given an award following the intervention of the Ombudsman. The then Department of Social Welfare agreed to pay arrears of £14,000 or £15,000, which was quite an amount of money. The Ombudsman is a real recourse for individuals who fear they have exhausted every avenue, but still feel they have a strong case that is being ignored.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State was right to emphasise the fact that the office of the Ombudsman is not an adversary of the public service, a point that was made by the Ombudsman in her report. The office works with the public service. Many of us in the political system are aware that it is generally unfruitful, with few exceptions, to treat the public service as an adversary. The Minister of State emphasised that the Ombudsman is right to encourage various public offices to develop and refine their complaint procedures, so that only the most difficult or insoluble cases reach her. The Ombudsman mentioned in her report the impressive statistic that half of all complainants are better off as a result of contacting her office. People can contact her office only when all other means of recourse have been exhausted.</P>
    <P>We need to bear in mind when considering particular cases that many schemes are quite complex, as the Ombudsman mentioned. The finances of public authorities are quite tight, generally speaking, although a strong social and humanitarian dimension needs to be brought to bear. The cases that have been brought forward absolutely vindicate the value of the office of the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman has pointed out that there is an unequal balance of power between those making complaints and, from their point of view, the relatively amorphous authorities with which they are dealing. She stated that she exercises the powers of her office by &ldquo;persuasion, criticism, publicity and moral authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the case involving the Revenue Commissioners has finally been resolved. A ruling from the office of the Ombudsman should be automatically binding, except where it is <Col N="737"/>clearly unreasonable or based on a misapprehension of the facts. If such problems have not arisen, public authorities and Departments should have to accept the Ombudsman&rsquo;s rulings. It is important, in the interests of confidence in the system of public administration, that an absolutely impartial person should be entrusted with making the final judgment about whether the system of administration is right or wrong.</P>
    <P>I notice that one of the cases cited in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report related to the refusal of Tipperary Town Council to pay the disabled person&rsquo;s grant to a person who was quite sick. The case was satisfactorily resolved. The type of case highlighted by the Ombudsman may involve urgent remedial works, for example, particularly if the person involved is ill. The office may investigate promises made by public authorities that have not been fulfilled for one reason or another. It emphasises the importance of transparency and consistency. The Ombudsman deals with administrative errors. In exceptional cases, the office may prefer not to set a precedent, for example by providing for a resolution &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo;. There may be strong humanitarian arguments for such decisions &mdash; one may not want to prejudge relatively similar cases in the future. There is also the issue of where a public authority has mistakenly overpaid an individual a grant or allowances to which he or she is entitled, as well as those fraught cases where a public authority has overcharged, such as patient charges in nursing homes.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>A Member earlier referred to Mr. Tom Sweeney who is on hunger strike outside the gates of Leinster House. Protests by individuals outside Leinster House or Government Buildings are nearly always based on an administrative complaint. The complaint may have been made to the appropriate Minister but the person feels the Department or public authority involved has not given him or her justice. Is there merit in allowing the Ombudsman a fast-track procedure to reach judgment on emergency situations that arise? I appreciate there could be dangers and downsides to such a process, but no one wants a stand-off when an authority disagrees with a person&rsquo;s entitlement. Some cases requiring a quick judgment are better off not being put to a Minister but to the Ombudsman who is recognised as an independent and impartial arbitrator.</P>
    <P>At present, and in the future, some public services are farmed out to the private sector for pragmatic reasons. I would not like to see such services removed from the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit. Regardless of whether a public service is run by the public sector or privately on the State&rsquo;s behalf, it should legitimately be within the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. The Ombudsman and her predecessors in the office have been praised, quite rightly, by all sides of the House. When they were appointed, we all knew the job they would have. However, no Member realised how they would seize it with such enthusiasm. Many people are grateful to the office of the Ombudsman when they were not in a position to seek legal advice or their cases were unsuitable to go before the courts. The holders of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office are owed a great debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>The report is not very long but it is interesting. I welcome, as the Ombudsman has, the appointment of the Ombudsman for Children. Ms Emily Logan is a sad loss to the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital; however, she is highly experienced in dealing with children and has a splendid background for the job. I look forward to seeing her report next year which I hope is produced with the same speed as this one. It is good the Leader of the House has arranged for the report to be debated in the House so soon after its publication. These reports should not just be considered historical documents. There is little value to reports that gather dust in the Oireachtas Library. I am always anxious when a document is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas because it can mean the end of it. However, that has not been the case with the reports of the Ombudsman. All Members have seized on them because they are interesting and so apposite to what we do, making them good and useful reading.</P>
    <P>Some of the cases in the report on medical provision need to be publicised more. One case concerned the Midlands Health Board and the provision of orthodontic treatment. The delay in getting orthodontic treatment for children is a serious problem in all health boards. When parents see their children with a jumble of teeth and how, through the lack of treatment, it affects them psychologically and physically, they often seek treatment from a private scheme. The Midlands Health Board has a three year waiting list for orthodontic treatment. In one case cited in the report a mother decided, after some time, that she would bring her child to a private practitioner who removed one of the child&rsquo;s teeth. When eventually the child was called by the orthodontic dentist employed by the health board, it was noticed that treatment had already begun with a private practitioner. The dentist involved said he could not continue the treatment under the public scheme and that the child would have to return to the private practitioner. The child&rsquo;s mother felt this was unfair as she had not been made aware that the child, if taken to a private practitioner, would be taken off the public list and, moreover, since the health boards, as the Minister of State is aware, frequently employ private practitioners to do public work. It was hard for the woman, who was simply trying to do the best for her child, to find that she would have to bear the whole cost of treatment. However, the <Col N="739"/>Ombudsman got the health board to give an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &euro;1,000 towards the costs of the child&rsquo;s private treatment.</P>
    <P>Cases such as this need to be made more known. As a member of the Joint Committee for Health and Children which has debated the difficulties in orthodontic treatment provision for the past four years, I cannot recall a situation where those who availed of private treatment were taken off the public list. Parents, whose only wish is to do the best for their children, could easily find themselves in such a situation. The three years waiting list in the Midlands Health Board is much shorter than in other areas. Some children, reaching adolescence with unattractive teeth which may be prone to rot, will seek some private treatment. However, they will find that they strayed over a line and must then go the whole hog with private treatment. This may not have been their choice, particularly in view of the costs of orthodontic treatment. The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report highlights the need for the provision of explanatory leaflets to parents of children on orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I was surprised by the case in the East Coast Health Board area of a woman who was charged maintenance in a hospital, though her husband had a medical card. The one thing that should have been as clear as a bell to everyone was that people who have medical cards should not be charged when they are in hospital. It is very odd that a sophisticated group of people such as those who run the East Coast Area Health Board should charge a person &euro;45 per day who was not liable to pay. This is sloppy behaviour and I wonder how often it goes on. While some areas are fairly obscure &mdash; for example, people might not know they were obliged to go either totally public or totally private &mdash; I thought everyone in the country would have known this since medical cards were introduced. I cannot understand how it happened that this woman was charged.</P>
    <P>When the Ombudsman pointed out to the health board that this was wrong, the money was refunded. The amount concerned was &euro;7,746.30, which is a large amount to anyone but for someone whose income level allowed her to have a medical card, having to pay this amount would oblige her to economise heavily in other areas. Nobody would wish to do this and any health board that behaves in this manner needs to be severely reprimanded.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman said that the error should not have occurred, but there was no element of compensation to cover the loss of purchasing power in the intervening period until the woman was refunded her money. She could have failed to receive any compensation at all if it were not for the fact that the Ombudsman continued to complain about this and managed to obtain &euro;2,102.58 extra based on the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>This sort of thing should not happen. The Ombudsman only gave sample cases but from <Col N="740"/>quite obscure areas to matters that are perfectly straightforward and well known by the public and should be known by every official in the land, it is unfortunate to see cases such as this coming before her. They should not arise in the first place. I commend the Ombudsman on the splendid job done by her and her predecessors. I hope that cases such as these, which she should not have to deal with, are investigated carefully by those who run the health boards.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I recently received a letter about the complications of the EU subsidy scheme, which are also creating work for the Ombudsman. It is a most complicated scheme to understand. However, the examples I have given here, especially the case in which a person with a medical card was charged by a hospital, should not have arisen. I hope the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office is freed from such complaints in future.</P>

   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the report. It is a transparent document which makes it easy for all of us to understand the role of the Ombudsman and her office. It is important to realise that for many people the Ombudsman may still be an unknown service. On the other hand, the report suggests that more people are becoming aware of their rights. Many of the people who have recourse to the Ombudsman are those who would not normally want to find themselves in a conflict-type situation. They would not want the embarrassment that goes along with it and would rather remain privately worried about the lack of justice in their treatment.</P>
    <P>As a result of the improvement in public services through local authorities and Departments, which means they are well laid out and easier to understand, people are now aware of their entitlements and are able to express themselves much better when making a complaint. This is mentioned in the report. It is important because if we are worried that a major part of the population who might have complaints would not consider using such a service, we should highlight the service and make it more accessible.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Ombudsman points out that up to 50% of all complainants felt better off as a result of the intervention of the Ombudsman. In other words, they received some positive reaction. That is a large and impressive number. It is often felt that when one makes an appeal to any public body, one&rsquo;s chances of succeeding are less than might normally be the case. I find it encouraging that 50%, or one out of two, complainants had some success.</P>
    <P>I also find it encouraging that according to the figures in the report, public bodies, by and large, are responding quite promptly to any queries they receive. Only 16 section 7 notices, which are the notices requiring compliance, were sent out, which is the smallest number since the office was set up. This suggests that the public bodies themselves, probably because they want to do the <Col N="741"/>right thing but also because they might find themselves named in a specific case, are now anxious to ensure that their services and their responses are beyond question.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see the small number of complaints made in one case concerning An Post. I found this very surprising, but then I remembered a programme I had seen on BBC the other night which said that normally, for some strange reason, people in the UK do not complain about inadequacies in the postal system. They were given figures of many millions for irregularities in postal deliveries, yet they accepted it and did not complain. I am not suggesting that An Post should have a higher rating in the area of complaints. This is an area in which one hears many complaints, regardless of whether those making them avail of the services of the Ombudsman, about post not arriving on time and so on. Some areas of the country are particularly bad, especially one area in Dublin which is infamous for bad service, yet the number of complaints is small.</P>
    <P>When it comes to postal services, should we just accept weakness and feel we have no redress or that it does not fall within the remit of the Ombudsman? I would not like to think we would all start sending in thousands of complaints, but there are areas that need attention. I am not picking out An Post for any particular criticism because it is not warranted in my experience. Hearing the discussions outside, however, one might suggest that much of it is not credible in its own right.</P>
    <P>The area of planning accounted for 27% of all complaints. That is a very large number &mdash; over a quarter of the total. Many of the complaints may have been related to enforcement orders but they seem to be mostly to do with planning. This does not surprise me because this is another area in which we hear much discussion among people who are dissatisfied. It is not a matter of not receiving permission to build a house but the procedures or lack thereof. Often when people go to the local authorities the relevant files are not available. In many cases papers are missing from the files. I am not sure why this should be the case. It may be one of the reasons there is so much dissatisfaction with the implementation of the planning code.</P>
    <P>We have had a discussion about one-off housing in rural Ireland. We have discussed cases where people jumped the gun and went ahead of their own volition without a commencement notice, even though they had planning permission. This is more fundamental than the specific cases to which we are accustomed. If there is need for an improvement in the area, it should be made. A person wishing to set up a home will feel particularly vulnerable not simply as a result of getting a refusal, but by not knowing why the refusal was made or by not having access to certain information. Such information might allow people to understand the reason for the refusal or whether the ruling differed in other <Col N="742"/>cases. As there are so many complaints in that area, I hope the issue will be tackled by the public bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>Another important area has been touched on today. Some cases require more urgent attention, such as the one involving the unfortunate man currently on hunger strike outside Leinster House. This shocking case has been raised on the Order of Business in the House. It should not occur in this day and age. An emergency or express service should be available, similar to the intervention of the Labour Court. Such a service, which it may be possible to establish, could intervene almost immediately in the case mentioned where a health issue is involved. The matter should be examined.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has raised the matter of the Official Languages Bill 2003. Ominously, she reports that she expects a much greater workload as a result of the Bill. She is right. If several hundred public bodies mentioned in this legislation have to deliver a bilingual service, and produce a report which could be the subject of Oireachtas discussion, there will be pressures in this area, even though a commissioner, the equivalent of an ombudsman, has been appointed by the President. In order to help the Ombudsman, it would be helpful if public bodies thought about this matter as soon as possible, availed of the back-up service and advice available, and decided to deliver in the manner required and within the specified time. The Ombudsman has a reason for saying she expects an increased workload as a result of the Official Languages Bill.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is doing an exceptionally good job. She has kept her nose to the grindstone. There has not been a great deal of public controversy, but it is clear that she is beavering away quietly in the background. She has great public credibility, always an important starting-point for such a service, which must also seen to be independent and effective.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to debate the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, which I welcome. I congratulate the officeholders who preceded Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly. Michael Mills, the first Ombudsman, was exceptional. He set the agenda for those who followed him, and did a wonderful job. Mr. Kevin Murphy brought an independence to the office and was totally committed to the job. I have no doubt that Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly will also do a wonderful job over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I often wonder about the Ombudsman&rsquo;s back-up service. Going by the various complaints involving so many different backgrounds, the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office must be an authority on all matters. The Government should consider giving that office more backup. The issue of getting a response from the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office has been raised. I have no doubt that office is overworked, which is one of the reasons for the delay in response times. The Government should put <Col N="743"/>extra resources into the office because it is doing a wonderful job for the public at large.</P>
    <P>Like Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; I have noticed that 27% of the complaints made to the Ombudsman, more than a quarter of all complaints, involve planning issues. At the end of the day, planning decisions simply reflect somebody&rsquo;s view. We all have various views, but decisions on planning law must be properly made. Planning is a very specific area in which great expertise is needed. The number of complaints about planning issues made to the Ombudsman, representing 27% of all complaints received, is enormous. We have seen great inconsistency in planning decisions across the country and within local authorities. Such inconsistency is responsible for the number of complaints made.</P>
    <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; noted that 50% of the complaints received a positive response. It is heartening that when one complains to the Ombudsman, one has a 50:50 chance of a positive response. The Minister of State noted one category of complaint involving a member of the public not getting a reply from a public service organisation. He said he appreciated that this may happen by accident in the best regulated organisation and that he had no details on how in any particular case it occurred. Unlike Deputies, the Members of this House may not table a question to a Minister. All we can do is write to the various Ministers. Over the past ten years I have noted that when one writes to a Minister about a problem, one gets an acknowledgement within a week or fortnight, but will not get an answer for at least three to six months. The Minister of State should tell his colleagues in Government that when a Member of this House writes to a Department, a positive response, rather than a mere acknowledgement, should be made. I have no doubt that many public representatives invite people to write to the Ombudsman if they have problems. If public representatives received proper and prompt replies to the many letters we write to the various Departments, that might well lessen the workload of the Ombudsman. I ask the Minister of State to relay this to Deputy Parlon. The latter raised the matter in his speech, and I have no doubt that he would be sympathetic to the wishes of the Members of this House. It is my experience,<Miles com="jy"/>and that of many Senators, that we do not get prompt replies, although we may receive acknowledgements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that this report has reached us so quickly after the end of 2003, because it brings us up to speed with what happened last year. Unfortunately, many reports we receive are very much out of date, and are old news by the time they come before this House and the D&aacute;il. Compliments have been paid already to the Ombudsman and I welcome the report in so far as it goes. It shows that over a ten year period the number of complaints has been <Col N="744"/>fairly static. For example, in 1994 there were 2,487 valid complaints. That number is down slightly this year but it demonstrates that over a ten year period, the number of valid complaints has remained more or less the same. I would have expected that figure to be dramatically lower because public bodies and official organisations must now be fully aware of the office and the necessity to ensure that in their regulations and dealings with the public they are more cautious and caring.</P>
    <P>The positive outcome attained in half the number of cases that came before the Ombudsman is welcome and indicates clearly that it is a very useful office which is working effectively and doing the job it is legislated to do. The wide variety of issues covered in the period, including nursing home subventions, disabled persons&rsquo; grants, housing for the elderly, orthodontic treatment, tax incentives or allowances, expenditure on education etc. indicates clearly the effectiveness of the office and the necessity to give it further support and direction.</P>
    <P>In that regard I welcome the indications in the report that the office has been holding regional meetings. When the Department of Social and Family Affairs regionalised its services, it provided more effective and efficient services,which were more easily accessible to the public. I note from the report that the office made a number of visits to some of the regions. I would encourage that and I strongly urge the Ombudsman to establish an office, perhaps in liaison with the Citizens Advice Bureaux, in many major towns.</P>
    <P>Much of the work they do would be similar and it might be possible for the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office and the citizens advice offices in various towns to co-operate in providing a regional local service. That is one of the areas, in terms of social welfare in any event, which saw a dramatic improvement in the service and brought about a resolution to many problems at local level that would normally go to appeals officers or other mechanisms. I welcome the effort to regionalise the service and the commitment in the report to the provision of a high quality service and closer co-operation, liaison and dialogue with the bodies and institutions, which is essential because many problems can be resolved at local level by discussion between the local authorities and the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office.</P>
    <P>Like previous speakers, I am not surprised at the huge increase in the number of complaints relating to planning; 27% of all the cases last year related to planning issues. There was an increase from 93 cases in 1994 to 185 cases in 2003 relating in the main to planning enforcement. In a recent television documentary, although I did not see the programme in question, certain allegations were made in regard to planning, local authorities and local councils. In that regard, in so far as the party I belong to is concerned, we hold no brief for any individual developer or planner who is <Col N="745"/>flouting the law by not obeying the regulations or conditions laid down in respect of planning.</P>
   <Miles com="cl" par="115"/><P>While some people in my party might have friendships with individual developers, in so far as the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in Clare is concerned, we hold no brief for any developer who is not complying with the conditions and regulations laid down in the statutes. In the view of the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation in my constituency, anyone who flouts the law should be prosecuted and due process engaged in. They should not be allowed to flout the law and engage in practices which are not in accordance with those laid down in the planning regulations.</P>
    <P>Many of the complaints we get about planning would not refer to enforcement but it appears there is a real problem about the enforcement of conditions laid down in planning permission applications. That was referred to in the report and it is something about which the Ombudsman has given some advice. I hope the next report will indicate a major improvement in this area because it is not satisfactory that there should be such a large number of complaints about planning.</P>
    <P>A number of individual cases were discussed in the report, and I am sure it would not be possible in any report to cover the huge volume of cases dealt with by the Ombudsman, but it is timely that the people in the various bodies carefully examine the reports published since the office was established in 1984 to understand how it is possible that legislation still has not been changed, an issue referred to here on a number of occasions, to minimise the necessity to go through these procedures. Each Department should be given a copy of this report and asked to indicate precisely, within a certain period, how it intends to deal with, for example, cases involving disabled persons&rsquo; grants, whether somebody has a tax certificate to complete work if it is holding up a job and allowing people in very bad housing conditions to continue to suffer or a homeless person who cannot be dealt with because of some red tape or regulation.</P>
    <P>This report should be sent to each Department which should be asked to make a submission to the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who is in the House, indicating clearly how they are dealing with issues raised by the Ombudsman over a number of years and the reason the legislation has not yet been amended to avoid similar cases happening again. It is welcome that individual cases are resolved but the underlying causes of these and shortcomings in the legislative area need to be dealt with quickly. It is important that when valid cases are raised and solutions found, and those solutions necessitate further legislation, we should be in a position to expedite that process to avoid them occurring in the future.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the commitment in the report to streamline the office, modernise its <Col N="746"/>systems, speed up decision making, in so far as it is possible to do so, engage in closer co-operation and dialogue with the various bodies and institutions and to have close co-operation with the children&rsquo;s ombudsman, who was appointed recently. There may be some overlapping but it is necessary to avoid it and duplication of services like these. There should be close liaison and co-operation between both bodies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the first report of the new Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, who does justice to her office in the report. I welcomed her appointment and, on reading the report, I believe that welcome was justified. I welcome also the clarity and openness of the report but perhaps the most positive reflection on the work of the Ombudsman is, strangely, the fact that from 1994 to 2004, the number of complaints dropped by approximately 10% despite an increase in the population and a more demanding population in general. That is important and it reflects very well on the positive impact of her work on other areas.</P>
    <P>I want to underline a point that we might be inclined to miss but which was touched on by Senator Daly. The fact that the Ombudsman gives so much space in her report to the administrative streamlining of the operation of her own office is welcome, praiseworthy and is something we should reflect on. It might be a role model for many of us.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh and I, as members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, will certainly be looking closely at that, since those are the kinds of developments that are important in increasing the efficiency of any type of operation. I welcome what she has done. I am appalled but not surprised that for four years in a row the Department of Education and Science has headed the section 7 list as the most culpable Department in the State for the non-availability of information. When one thinks back on discussions we have had here on various aspects of its work, the fact that three speakers today have mentioned Tom Sweeney being on hunger strike outside the gate, and the difficulties that the redress board and others have had in getting information from the Department, it rings a bell somewhere. It is so difficult to access information from the Department that the Ombudsman has had to issue section 7 notices against it.</P>
    <P>I notice also, in her tuarasc&aacute;il, go nd&eacute;anann an tOmbudsman tagairt do fhost&uacute; She&aacute;in &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in mar choimisin&eacute;ir don Ghaeilge. Sa m&eacute;id at&aacute; scr&iacute;ofa aici, t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil s&eacute; cos&uacute;il go mbeidh an-mhead&uacute; ar fad ar na gear&aacute;in ag teacht chuici as ucht an Acht teanga a reacht&aacute;ladh le d&eacute;ana&iacute;. N&iacute; thuigim &eacute; seo go soil&eacute;ir: &oacute;s rud &eacute; go gcuireann an tAcht teanga dualgas ar dhaoine, ghr&uacute;pa&iacute; agus institi&uacute;id&iacute; eags&uacute;la ruda&iacute; &aacute;irithe a dh&eacute;anamh agus go bhfuil pl&eacute; leis sin ag <Col N="747"/>an Ombudsman, conas is f&eacute;idir leis an Ombudsman cur i bhfeidhm a dh&eacute;anamh ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il tr&iacute;d an Acht when she says herself on the first page that her work is done? It is a marvellous quotation:</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P LI="1">Where some form of redress is merited my Office relies on persuasion, criticism, publicity and moral authority to have its recommendations implemented.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
    <Miles com="cl" par="110"/><P FLI="0">That is a mighty reflection of the positive development of the office. There was a significant debate when establishing the office of the Ombudsman concerning whether to give the office holder legal powers of compulsion. That is an issue to which Senator Maurice Hayes, a former distinguished Ombudsman himself, has made reference on occasion. It shows how effective it can be without having legal compulsion. I remember discussing it at the time and thinking that perhaps such powers should ultimately exist.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recognise that the legislation includes the power to allow the Ombudsman to make a specific report to the Oireachtas on various matters. That is something that her predecessor did early last year. It is extremely important the Ombudsman has the independence and authority to do that. I compliment her and her predecessors on doing their job so well on the basis of moral authority, criticism, publicity and persuasion; we can all learn something from that.</P>
    <P>I wish she had more impact on the Department of Education and Science. It was impossible to go through all the cases in detail, but I read the one concerning school transport. Why is it that a family coping with all the difficulties and distress that arise from having a child with learning difficulties, finding a place and getting the child to where that service of education, support or therapy is being delivered, must get into a big, long row with the Department of Education and Science to get something that they were entitled to all along? They did not know their precise rights. People often ask why public representatives waste their time doing things for people when it is their right in any case. This is a classic example of where the parents of a child with learning difficulties had an entitlement and did not know the precise manner in which to phrase, frame, contextualise and appeal. Were it not for the intervention of the Ombudsman, those people would have been out of pocket to the tune of &euro;10,000. I have forgotten the exact figure, but it was very high. We public representatives all deal to some extent with casework, and we must certainly welcome the existence of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>It is also important that politicians are never tempted, as we sometimes are, to try to second-guess the Ombudsman. It is the court of final appeal unless the Ombudsman decides to come to us. Since the Act allows for the Ombudsman <Col N="748"/>to come to the Oireachtas should she wish to do so by way of special report, that is the basis on which we should deal with any cases. It would certainly be unfair for individual politicians to try to second-guess the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I would like to think the Ombudsman might have some impact on cases such as that outside the gate, about which I am concerned. All of us who have spoken to the man are concerned about the issue. It is not precisely the sort of issue that comes within the authority or discretion of the Ombudsman, and I do not know what the answer is in that case.</P>
    <?oasys [ic24]?><P>In welcoming the Minister, I mentioned the Irish language commissioner. If not in his reply to the debate, perhaps the Minister might come back to me on it at some stage. The Irish language commissioner has a specific function. The Ombudsman also has a function under the legislation. However, does the fact that she does not have the power of legal compulsion as such not create some gap in ensuring the Official Languages (Equality) Act 2003 is fully implemented? I also welcome her co-operation with Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, an duine a fosta&iacute;odh mar choimisin&eacute;ir don Ghaeilge.

    <P>Idir an d&aacute; linn, I welcome the report and would like the House to offer its congratulations to the Ombudsman on what her staff, her office and she are doing and the openness with which she approaches her job. The report is a role model and an example of best practice.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister and also the report of the Ombudsman. I compliment her predecessor. It is good news that there has been a reduction in the cases taken to the Ombudsman. Like other speakers, I am rather concerned, particularly regarding education. There are many issues involved, and there will probably be more to do with special needs, which is a big issue currently, and school transport, which was mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. The same is true of the health service, which has been touched on. It is interesting to note that yesterday I was inquiring of the Western Health Board about the number of people on a waiting list for orthodontics, and 868 was the figure provided. They were very proud of the fact that it was fewer than 1,000, since five years ago there were 2,000 people on the board&rsquo;s waiting list for such treatment. That will give Members an idea of the <Col N="749"/>case histories documented so very well in this report.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Daly, I find issues regarding planning and its enforcement very important. Every local authority will tell one that it grants 90% of applications, and perhaps more in some cases. However, a serious question about the enforcement of planning has arisen, particularly through the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, but also on many other occasions. We really need proper staffing of councils on that issue. On local authorities in general, one of the issues which has affected many people &mdash; there are many cases mentioned in the report &mdash; is the operation of the disabled person&rsquo;s housing grant. It now seems to be the only grant that exists for any house improvements other than schemes for the elderly. It is very popular because it does not require a person to be living alone. If two or three elderly people are living together, there is no investigation of the numbers in the house, which is positive. We see issues regarding tax affairs. In my county of Galway, there was a case where a grant could not possibly meet the provision of a bathroom and bedroom downstairs for a disabled person. The Ombudsman agrees there is no point giving someone a grant of &euro;13,000 towards work that costs &euro;40,000. Where is the balance to come from unless it is decided to go for some type of capital project, as suggested? I would like to see that scheme re-examined in a general way. A few case histories indicate how inadequate it is to try to do work on that scale for a disabled person when the grant does not meet a fraction of the total estimated cost.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to the carer&rsquo;s allowance in the report. I remember writing years ago to the then Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, about a person who was providing 24-hour care but was not getting the allowance because he or she was not living in the house all the time. The position now is that someone does not have to be living in the house to provide 24-hour care and that is more sensible and practical. Finally, on the question of heating, as referred to in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, in some cases local authorities do not give grants to the disabled, in others, grants of 50% of total costs are provided. This must be examined. Up to 90% of grants are available from the local authorities for most of the works, but to leave people without heating, as happened with Tipperary County Council in one of the cases in the report, is totally wrong. The Ombudsman addressed that properly and I hope all local authorities will provide reasonable grants for heating. Heating is very important, whether for the elderly or the disabled, and hopefully will be provided for in the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The office of the Ombudsman is one we can be proud of. By any international standard, it has been an outstanding office and I am glad to see the incumbent is maintaining the high standards of her predecessors. I congratulate her on that. I am also glad she is maintaining <Col N="750"/>clarity of language and communication in her report, which makes it easy to read, and also that she is looking at the administrative procedures in her own office. It is always great to be able to say that the physician is healing herself.</P>
    <P>I would like to concentrate not on particular cases, but on general principles. The Ombudsman is an officer of the Oireachtas, working on our behalf and on behalf of the citizens. The office therefore deserves all the support we can give it. As Senator O&rsquo;Toole has said, it is a moral authority rather than a legal one. It is about one fair person in possession of the facts making a common sense judgment. As Senator Daly said, there are so many of these reports that it is a pity they are not used more as learning tools. They should be used more in the training of civil servants as examples either of good practice to be followed or of bad practice to be avoided. People should see where their policies, regulations or practices were deficient. As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, I was an ombudsman in another jurisdiction. Every year I would write to the heads of agencies, outlining the number of complaints received and indicating the specific areas under their control. This was not telling people how to do their jobs but it expressed the hope that they might investigate what was wrong in those particular places.</P>
    <P>The other matter I found helpful was that a committee was dedicated to the Ombudsman, in the same way as the Committee of Public Accounts deals with the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General. That was helpful, because it meant that a Department which was performing poorly, as indicated by many complaints, could be interrogated by parliamentarians. The Accounting Officer could be asked to explain why so many complaints had been received. I would commend that to the Minister of State as a possibility to be considered. It is a pity that the Ombudsman puts in so much work and that there is such valuable information in these reports that, somehow, the waves wash over. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Ombudsman on the way she is performing her task currently and to thank her for her report and the work she is doing on our behalf.</P>

	<P>I wish to protest about the limited time given by the Government to this important debate. Two hours is totally inadequate to discuss the annual report of the Ombudsman. I ask the Leader to take into consideration in future the importance of this report and show respect for the Ombudsman by allocating greater time to discuss it. A number of speakers on this side of the House wish to contribute to the debate, but are not being facilitated this week. I wish my protest to be noted.</P>

	<P>I thank all the Senators who were here and who participated in the statements. Some others, I understand, were outside promoting their election campaigns while the debate was going on. I would like to refer to a few of the points raised. Senator Browne complimented the Ombudsman on printing the report in Irish and English. This has been the norm for several years. The office of the Ombudsman has a number of fluent Irish speakers, which is helpful. I expect that will obtain for the future. In any event the new legislation introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, will ensure that bilingual reports are delivered concurrently.</P>
    <P>I note Senator Browne&rsquo;s interest in the disabled and in stroke survivors. It is an area of which we must all be conscious. The Ombudsman mentioned she will be getting new responsibilities under the code that will be more focused on their particular needs. That is a positive step. When the office of the Ombudsman was established, it dealt only with the Civil Service. It was subsequently extended to local authorities and the health boards. The idea was that each extension should take place in line with demand and when the Ombudsman&rsquo;s staff could undertake it without difficulty. For this reason the 1980 Act allowed new bodies to be added by Government order. This option is open, but the Ombudsman indicated she would prefer to follow the route laid down in the new Act, to take account of the way her office&rsquo;s procedures had evolved since 1984. The Government proposes to bring an amending Bill before the Oireachtas within the year and then to decide when each of the 130 excluded bodies will be brought within the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit. A big bang approach, bringing all the bodies on board at once, could damage the excellent quality of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister of State might be able to take that on board.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mansergh questioned the out-sourcing work of Departments or public bodies. This does not take in areas outside the Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction. Clearly, this will have to be considered in the context of the impending Bill. Senator Henry raised a number of issues from her professional experience as a medical consultant. She mentioned waiting lists for orthodontic services and, based on cases in the report, highlighted the desirability of producing <Col N="752"/>leaflets to ensure that individuals did not do something that might inadvertently result in them losing benefits. The Ombudsman mentioned the number of section 7 demands she had to make for documents, especially to the Department of Education and Science. I suspect this may be due to the pressure that Department is coming under as a result of the commission on child abuse. Apart from this glitch, it is a consolation that the need to make these demands is falling off.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly noted with satisfaction that the Ombudsman held information sessions around the country and is recommending that she establishes regional offices. As an independent office, the Ombudsman has not been included in the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. However, the Ombudsman, committed as she is to an efficient office, may well give thought to doing so when we have more than 10,000 civil servants located outside Dublin city.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke in very positive terms about the work delivered by the office. He noted that complaints have dropped over the years by 10% against the background of a larger population, which is more inclined to complain now than in 1984 when the Ombudsman was first appointed. Senator Maurice Hayes brought his experience of a very good period as ombudsman in Northern Ireland to bear on the discussion and his suggestion to use the report as a training tool is very important. My Department and others take that issue on board. Training does not always work but the experiences that come out of the report and the comments made here are very positive. I commend the report to the Senators and I thank them for their very constructive and complimentary remarks on it.</P>

    <P>The substance of the debate on Committee Stage relates to the wording of the proposed amendment of the Constitution.

<P LI="1" el="5">Subject to legislation enacted pursuant to Article 9.1.2&deg;&rdquo;.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. He probably wonders why I have tabled so many amendments that do not sit comfortably with each other. I suggest them as options which could have been discussed by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution had it been allowed to sit. We would have preferred it if the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution had dealt with the provisions of this Bill to provide for greater consultation. While the proposals in these amendments do not sit comfortably with each other, I want to present them to the Minister. The proposals are the way we should have gone about this business. I do not have a monopoly on wisdom as to how best to deal with this matter but we should have engaged in wider consultation.</P>
    <P el="0">I will present some of the options I propose in these amendments. Amendment No. 8 proposes that Article 2 should be amended in a minimalist way such that it would restate Article 9.1.2, that <Col N="754"/>is, the power to limit citizenship by legislation. Another option would be to amend Article 2 so as to reduce the broad scope of the existing wording. Amendment No. 3 uses some of the words proposed in the Government&rsquo;s wording.</P>
    <P el="0">With regard to amendments Nos. 4 and 10, the courts have never adjudicated definitively upon the exact meaning of Articles 2 and 9. Until we are clear on the exact interpretation of Article 2, we should not seek to amend it. My interpretation of Article 2 leads me to believe that it merely confers an entitlement to apply for citizenship; it does not automatically confer citizenship. If it confers citizenship, how can the Minister purport to restrict the so-called automatic right to citizenship, as he proposes in section 6(4) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001? If Article 2 confers citizenship on all those born on the island of Ireland, are Unionists aware that this is the case? I propose we seek to amend Article 2 so as to ensure that its wording is clearer and more accurately reflects its real meaning, namely, that it confers an entitlement to apply for citizenship and does not in itself confer citizenship. Rather than effecting any substantive change to the meaning of Article 2, amendments Nos. 4 and 10 are designed to clarify it.</P>
    <P el="0">With regard to amendments Nos. 5 and 11, we propose that Article 9.1.2 should be amended in a minimalist way such that it reflects the absolutist nature of Article 2.</P>
    <P el="0">In regard to amendment No. 6, the Government has identified the broad nature of Article 2 as being the problem. If Article 2 is the provision, which has given rise to a problem, it is that article which should be amended in an honest and upfront way, but not in the oblique way in which it is being proposed.</P>
    <P el="0">Amendment No. 6 takes the Minister&rsquo;s proposed wording in full and adds it to Article 2 instead of Article 9. In proposing this amendment, I acknowledge and highlight not only that Article 2 is the correct place to make this amendment, but that an amendment of this kind necessitates North-South and British-Irish consultation, which has not been part of the process to date.</P>
    <P el="0">I have presented the various options we believe should have been discussed by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and which the Minister might still consider.</P>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the information of Members, I point out that amendment No. 2 is consequential on amendment No. 8, amendment No. 3 is consequential on amendment No. 9, amendment No. 4 is consequential on amendment No. 10 and amendment No. 5 is consequential on amendment No. 11. Where the main amendment is not agreed, the consequential amendments cannot be moved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter in which I have a deep interest not least because of its connection <Col N="755"/>to the Good Friday Agreement. I have complete confidence in the way the Minister is going about dealing with this matter. To refer this Bill to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution would be simply a delaying tactic. This is a relatively straightforward and simple change and it addresses two problems. One is the practical consequences in regard to maternity hospitals, but the core principle it addresses is the unintended backdoor access not merely to Irish citizenship, but particularly to EU citizenship, as highlighted in particular by the Chen case.</P>
    <P>I would be opposed to any alteration to Article 2. I am not sure whether Senator Terry understands that would involve, effectively, a reopening of the negotiations on part of the Good Friday Agreement. I am not a constitutional lawyer but my understanding of the Constitution is that when it is being judged or a decision is being made in regard to it, the articles are taken together and, therefore, it is perfectly legitimate. When any case is being decided upon, Articles 2 and 9 would be read together. They deal with nationality and citizenship. As the Minister said on a previous occasion, they are synonymous. If we were to alter or amend Article 2, which is part of the Agreement that was decided by the people, we would be re-opening the negotiation of something which does not need to be re-opened.</P>
    <P>Article 2 applies to all the people of Northern Ireland as it was intended to apply to them. It does not only state &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo;, it states &ldquo;entitlement and birthright&rdquo;. We are talking about entitlement and right. The word &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; is in that article because certain Unionists, such as the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, might have objected to the notion that he was automatically Irish, an Irish citizen regardless of whether he liked it. The word &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; was a way of getting around that and effectively providing that he or anyone like him has the right to be an Irish citizen if he or she so chooses. This article provides for a birthright and the word &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; is alongside it so that it is not something that is imposed or forced on people against their will.</P>
    <P>This amendment, if accepted, would effectively mean that we would have to re-open the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement for something that has intrinsically nothing to do with it. This matter is to do with people who have no connection with this country and who probably come here for the limited purpose of mainly acquiring EU citizenship rights rather than Irish citizenship rights. The annex to the Good Friday Agreement, inserted by the British Government, clearly defines the people of Northern Ireland. We must not get our wires crossed. We are trying to deal with this practical problem and matter in a self-contained way that precisely does not impinge on the Good Friday Agreement or upset it.</P>
    <P>Some concerns were expressed briefly by certain parties in Northern Ireland when this Bill <Col N="756"/>was published, but I note with some satisfaction that after a full explanation of it was given, those concerns were abated. I have no reason to believe that it is now a major concern of any party in Northern Ireland because it has been clearly explained to them that this is ring-fenced from the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Senator Terry whose party, strongly and commendably, has supported the Good Friday Agreement since it was put in place not to press an amendment which would have the effect of re-opening the debate on the Agreement in a way that is entirely unnecessary and redundant.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should all have been presented with copies of the Constitution for the purpose of this debate. I forgot to bring my copy with me. For a debate of this nature, copies of the Constitution should be furnished to Members.</P>
    <P>As regards what Senator Terry stated earlier, as I understand it we are changing a right, which exists under the Constitution. In the recent court case relating to the dual mandate, the judge stated that there is a right to run for election to the D&aacute;il. This obviously can be qualified by legislation but it remains a right. I would have thought that the matter we are debating also involves a right. I accept that it can be legislated for but it is still a right. The Minister is interfering with a right. Even if it can be qualified by legislation, that right still exists under the Constitution. If it was not a right and was just an entitlement to apply for a particular right, there would be no need for this constitutional amendment. That is the point Senator Terry was making. The Minister should clarify whether it is a right. If it is not a right, the referendum should not proceed. If a right exists and it must be qualified by legislation, it must be qualified proportionately to one&rsquo;s needs.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s comments about Article 2. I do not accept that articles of the Constitution can be kept pure from the amendment. It is as if the Constitution will remain as it stands at present, regardless of whether the amendment is carried in the referendum. There are two different articles in the Constitution, which deal with property rights. If one was amended, both would be affected in terms of the way the courts would interpret them. In this instance, the Minister is effectively amending Article 2.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh said that the next matter to which I wish to refer has been debated but I do not accept that. However, I accept that it was raised by the Labour Party in the D&aacute;il. We are dealing with something that was part of the agreement reached in the multi-party talks. Although the latter does not form the whole of the Good Friday Agreement, it remains part of it. I refer to the law of treaties in that regard.</P>
    <P>This is a complicated issue and we should not be dealing with it in this way. The type of process required for dealing with it would have been similar to that employed by the All-Party <Col N="757"/>Committee on the Constitution. In such a process, different aspects could have been teased out and expert advice obtained. Hearings could have been held, if necessary, and we could have obtained legal and other advice.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the Minister&rsquo;s intention in bringing forward this measure now. I have already been out knocking on people&rsquo;s doors and I am aware that the debate on this matter is being simplified. I hope the discussion around it will evolve during the campaign. People are making simple responses in respect of this matter and they are not considering the complications involved. The Minister stated in the weekend&rsquo;s newspapers that he would like to introduce a green card system. The Labour Party would favour such a system and we, therefore, have some common ground with him. However, people will not appreciate that during the referendum because of the way the issue will be debated.</P>
    <P>The referendum will not attract one extra vote for the Progressive Democrats. It will obviously help Fianna F&aacute;il in that regard, which is its intended purpose. I am not stating that was the Minister&rsquo;s intention but it is the reason the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is supporting this measure. The Progressive Democrats will not make even the slightest gain in terms of its support in the elections so I do not understand why that party did not delay this measure and have it dealt with in a much more detailed way.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>On the point of two articles of the Constitution being read together, there is an exact parallel in the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956. One of the articles in that legislation states that every child born is an Irish citizen, while a separate article states that if a person is born outside the jurisdiction in Northern Ireland he or she must make a declaration to take up citizenship. That is exactly what is being done in the Bill before the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not rehearse the arguments put forward on Second Stage. What is being sought here is further delay by means of referring this matter to an all-party committee. I have been a Member of the Seanad for seven years and I have not seen a simpler amendment to change the Constitution being put before the House. The Bill merely asks that the people allow the Oireachtas to legislate in respect of the children of non-nationals, which is eminently sensible.</P>
    <P>If there are people who are opposed to the substantive issue involved, it would be better if they declared their interests and we could have a debate on that issue. There is a great deal of obfuscation taking place in respect of this matter. I refer more to the comments of Senator Tuffy than those of Senator Terry in that regard. What the people are being asked to do is make a small and clear-cut change to the Constitution. The need for this has arisen because of the changes that emanated from the Good Friday Agreement, <Col N="758"/>which changed the constitutional position in respect of certain articles. As a result, people have been able to exploit a loophole which does not exist in other countries. That is the substantive issue. If people want to debate that matter, I have no difficulty doing so. However, people should emerge from cover and state their position rather than continuing to pursue their current peripheral and insignificant line of attack.</P>

	<P>My sister has lived in the United States for 30 years. Last November, while presenting a paper in Milan, she became seriously ill and was rushed to hospital. She had retained her Irish passport and was welcomed into the hospital with open arms because she is an Irish citizen. At present, if a non-national has a baby here he or she are entitled to obtain all the benefits offered by the EU. From that point of view, we are allowing Irish citizenship to be exploited. The point I am trying to make relates to the value of holding Irish citizenship.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment suggests that we should actually again tear open the terms of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, consider what they involve and insert new wordings in them. I fully accept that this would be one way to approach this issue. All of the rhetoric I have heard for a long period runs to the effect that we should not touch these articles and that they should be left intact. As Senator Mansergh stated, it was a transient feeling that the articles were somehow being violated in a significant way, which led to a degree of disquiet among certain people who believed they should be consulted on the issue. It is worth looking at Article 2 very carefully. I agree with Senator Tuffy that we should all have our copies of the Constitution in front of us. The first sentence in Article 2 states: &ldquo;It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation.&rdquo; The second sentence is one on which public debate has not focused, but it is crucial to an understanding of Article 2. It states: &ldquo;That is also the entitlement of all persons otherwise qualified in accordance with law to be citizens of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;otherwise qualified in accordance with law to be citizens of Ireland&rdquo; proves conclusively that the first sentence was intended to bestow the birthright and entitlement of citizenship on everyone born on the island of Ireland, without qualification. The second sentence says the same entitlement and birthright applies to people who are otherwise qualified in law to be citizens of Ireland. The word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; means that the first sentence is conferring the entitlement to citizenship on the category of people born in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a point I did not feel I had the latitude to make on Friday because time was pressing. Article 2, in effect, provides that Irish <Col N="759"/>citizenship for people born in Ireland is by self-selection. An entitlement and a birthright are what are conferred on a person. Senator Terry says correctly that citizenship is not automatically conferred by Articles 2 and 3. However, she is wrong, in my respectful submission, when she says that all Article 2 does is give the right to apply for Irish citizenship. It gives something more. It gives the right to have Irish citizenship if one so chooses. It is not a mere right to apply for it where one could be told &ldquo;no&rdquo; and to forget it. It is an entitlement to have it if one so chooses. That is the point I tried to make the other day with regard to the argument, slightly plausible but fundamentally misconceived, that the provisions of the 2001 amendment were, in some sense, inconsistent with what is now being argued. Those provisions provide that the son or daughter of a diplomat have the entitlement, because they are born in Ireland, to have Irish citizenship if they so choose, but they make it very clear that it is not an automatic conferral by Irish law on them of citizenship. It is likewise for people born on boats and planes in Irish waters or airspace. Citizenship is an entitlement if they so choose, or, as the language of the statute says, in the case of a child, if the choice is made on its behalf to have Irish citizenship.</P>
    <P>The second sentence of Article 2 puts beyond any doubt that the clear meaning of the article was, as the Taoiseach conceded in his correspondence with Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn at the time, that any person born in Ireland, regardless of circumstances, was henceforth to be entitled to Irish citizenship. Deputy Quinn raised that point in his letter and asked the Taoiseach if he could, on a belt and braces approach, include in Article 9 a qualifying provision, which would maintain the right of the Oireachtas to control the issue. Attached to Deputy Quinn&rsquo;s letter was a prescient memorandum from my good friend Finbarr O&rsquo;Malley raising the issue and showing how, by amending Article 9, one would not have to reopen what happened in Castle Buildings but could make it clear that citizenship was not an absolute entitlement in every circumstance, regardless of how tenuous or non-existent a child&rsquo;s parents connection with Ireland was.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach conceded fairly in the D&aacute;il the other day that his priority at the time was to have a simple issue before the people and not to open the Pandora&rsquo;s box with which we are now dealing. He decided to keep the issue simple and go for it. He said he thought that was justified because the Belfast Agreement was a simple issue. Although it was passed by an overwhelming majority of the people of the South, it was not the most robust of plants at the time. Some of us will recall that there was quite a deal of agitation in Northern Ireland as to its exact meaning. The Taoiseach, as he said in the D&aacute;il, wanted to keep it simple and at the time he did not foresee that any abuse of it would be of such a dimension or frequency as to cause any problems for the State. <Col N="760"/>He said candidly that this was not a significant issue in his mind and he was going for the simple wording that had been agreed in Castle Buildings and did not want to open the Pandora&rsquo;s box of other considerations.</P>
    <P>That was a political judgment at the time with which it is difficult to argue. However, some people, myself included, could see there would be difficulty down the road. I thought it would be an academic difficulty and that, coupled with the Fajujonu case and Supreme Court jurisprudence, it would be difficult to get people out of Ireland. The L &amp; O case had not been decided at that stage. Nobody foresaw that significant numbers of people would be attracted to this country by virtue of being able to acquire EU citizenship by arriving in either part of the island and having a child. That was not foreseen as a significant problem and if people had thought so, I have no doubt that Deputy Quinn's advice might have been taken at the time.</P>
    <P>If the issue was of such seriousness that it raised a red flag warning us of serious consequences which outweighed the advantage of simplifying the issue to be put to the people in 1998, which led to the amendment of the Constitution in 1999, a different decision might have been made. Hindsight is 20:20 vision. Then it was a question of looking prospectively at the chances of getting agreement on a simple issue, uncluttered by an immigration issue, which was far from people&rsquo;s minds.</P>
    <P>What we have now is that Article 2 empowers people to decide whether they wish to be an Irish citizen. The choice belongs to the person. It is a self selection process based on the clear language of Article 2. That choice cannot be taken away from people. It cannot be taken away on the advice of the Attorney General, even in the sense of saying with regard to a minor that the rights of the minor can be postponed until the minor is 18, by statute as matters stand currently, or that any qualification, such as the connection between the parents and the country, should be of a particular strength or duration. It cannot be qualified in that way.</P>
    <P>Where does this leave us with regard to Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment? I acknowledge, lest she feels I am taking advantage of her, that what she is suggesting is one alternative approach, which would have been considered if the matter had been considered at greater length. That approach was considered. My Department considered carefully whether we should touch the wording of Articles 2 and 3. For all the reasons set out by Senator Mansergh, it became blindingly obvious to us that if there was any alternative route to the top of this mountain, other than up the north face of Articles 2 and 3, we should take it because the revisiting of the wording of those articles was fraught with difficulties of a political and every other nature.</P>
    <P>Where does this leave the debate? Deputy Quinn&rsquo;s belt and braces suggestion is the appropriate way forward. It was a thoughtful <Col N="761"/>reflection at the time and is, on thoughtful reflection, the right way forward on the issue now. We must now examine the combined effect of Articles 9 and 2 and address the unintended consequence of the Good Friday Agreement whereby we are vulnerable to unreasonable exploitation and abuse of our citizenship laws.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Jim Walsh that this is a simple issue. It is not rocket science. We are simply suggesting that we return to the position that obtained before the 1999 amendment of the Constitution and give the Oireachtas the power to intervene in a very narrow way with the general principle, which is that the people of Northern Ireland have a right to citizenship of this State if they so elect. The Oireachtas is free to regard the people of Northern Ireland in the same way as the annex to the British-Irish Agreement regards them, namely, that people who are children of British or Irish citizens or of long-term residents of Northern Ireland are identified by the British and Irish Governments as being worthy recipients of the right to dual citizenship or citizenship of either country as they choose. It is the principle of Article 2, of the British-Irish Agreement and of the annex of the Agreement that a group of people was in contemplation, which we would all colloquially call the people of Northern Ireland, and who are in a state or part of a state which is divided in its loyalty, to whom the two governments, by an international treaty which is now registered at<?oasys [jy?>the United Nations,  guarantee the right to citizenship of the United Kingdom, of Ireland or of both states, without limit and absolutely. That is what the two Governments decided. It is that principle I do not want to invade, qualify or change.</P>
    <P>It is because of the wording of Article 2 and its susceptibility to exploitation that we have a situation in which the people of Northern Ireland have the same right in respect of both countries, but people with no connection with Northern Ireland have the opportunity to piggy-back on the new terminology of Article 2 to achieve Irish citizenship where they cannot achieve United Kingdom nationality. Mrs. Chen could not by going to Belfast avail of the terms of the British-Irish Agreement to confer British nationality on her child and therefore avoid deportation or whatever she was seeking to avoid. She could not elect in relation to Britain. We therefore have a lack of symmetry and a lack of mutuality. Article 2 as so interpreted goes further than was necessary and creates a difference in the entitlement to citizenship between the two countries because it confers the right to citizenship without qualification on people who have no connection with the island of Ireland North or South in the case of Southern citizenship, but it confers it only on people who have some connection with Northern Ireland or long-term residence there in the case of United Kingdom citizenship. It is that asymmetry with which we are dealing.</P><Col N="762"/>
    <P>To return to Senator Walsh&rsquo;s point, all of this sounds highly theological and highly complicated. However, in essence this proposal could not be simpler. The two Houses of the Oireachtas will have the power in respect of people, neither of whose parents are Irish or British and neither of whose parents are long-term residents of Northern Ireland, to provide that they must have some minimal connection with Ireland in terms of the duration of their stay in Ireland or their entitlement to be in Ireland before the right to Irish and EU citizenship kicks in. I repeat that this does not mean the Government&rsquo;s proposed legislation will be enshrined in the Constitution. It will be open to either House of the Oireachtas thereafter to vary the period from six months to ten years or to make other provisions to vary it in one way or another. This is a perfectly sensible, simple, rational and reasonable change to our Constitution. It does not require immense reflection to arrive at the conclusion that it is the best of the approaches available. If I thought for one minute that changing Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution was the appropriate way of arriving at the summit at which we all want to arrive, which is a reasonable law, I would take that route. However, I know full well, as Senator Mansergh has said, that it would result in immense complication and confusion and bring down the whole edifice of the Good Friday Agreement in pieces around my head in circumstances where, as was pointed out by Deputy Quinn so long ago, it is unnecessary to take that risk.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the point, which has been canvassed fairly frequently, that this Bill will create a second class of citizen or an underclass in Ireland. That is a profoundly mistaken view. First, as I said here on the last occasion, because Ireland is party to the International Convention against Statelessness, nobody will be deprived of Irish citizenship by this amendment of the Constitution and the laws which will be in place thereafter, unless that person is already entitled to another citizenship by descent. The existing text of our citizenship and nationality law, which reflects that international obligation not to create stateless people will continue to apply. It states very clearly that anybody who would otherwise be stateless shall be an Irish citizen. The reverse side of that coin refers to children whose parents can confer on them nationality of the parents&rsquo; home state. Therefore only people who will not through their parents be entitled to citizenship of some other state will be affected by the passage of this referendum. Looked at in a different way, that is the same as saying that everyone who has the right to one citizenship will not be entitled to avail of Irish citizenship as a matter of choice if their parents have no real tangible connection with this country. If they are entitled to their parents&rsquo; citizenship they cannot accrue a right to Irish citizenship as well if their parents have no tangible connection with this State. That is what this proposal is about.</P><Col N="763"/>
    <P>I expect the two Human Rights Commissions will sit down together and visit this territory. I am not trying to get my retaliation in first because I will be accused of being combative and arrogant. However, I fully accept the validity and common sense truth of the two Governments&rsquo; declarations on this matter, which is that this approach by the Irish Government is entirely consistent with the British-Irish Agreement which has been registered at the United Nations as a treaty, and is entirely in accordance with the joint intentions of the two sovereign powers who are party to that agreement. The point may be made by some that a child who is born in Ireland and has only, say, Nigerian, Romanian, Chinese or French citizenship, will not be in the eyes of Irish law the same as an Irish citizen and will be somehow more vulnerable on that account. I reiterate that if an immigrant family comes to Ireland today, as asylum seekers or as economic migrants who wish to take up work opportunities, the children of that family are citizens of the state in which they were born or the state from which they came with their parents. Nobody who looks at such children playing in an Irish playground or walking down an Irish street will argue, in any plausible scenario, that their fundamental rights in Ireland are inferior to those of children who were born here and who are Irish citizens. I have never heard such an argument convincingly made nor do I see its force.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>As I said earlier in the other House, I do not believe that the right to life of a child of a French couple living in Ireland, for example, is less protected than the right to life of a child of an Irish couple living in Ireland. It is not the case that the home of a French couple, neither of whom are Irish citizens, is less protected under the dwellings provision, which nominally attaches to citizens only, than the home of an Irish couple. I am not of the opinion that the good name of foreigners of Ireland is less protected. It is not the case that they cannot sue or that they cannot have access to our courts through judicial review. None of those arguments stands up in practice. Such arguments are contrived.</P>
    <P>If the Constitution is interpreted by the courts as affording fundamental rights only to Irish citizens, who are the only people mentioned in the fundamental rights provisions, would we not be in breach of EU law if we were to say that the fundamental rights of EU citizens in Ireland are not protected by the Irish courts? I believe we would be in violation of the European treaties if we were to make such a statement. I regard that argument as a non-point.</P>
    <P>I have to say, in advance of the results of the Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s further reflections, that I have not seen any cogent explanation of the argument that the children of non-nationals in Ireland are less protected. If the commission believes that to be the case, why has it not been agitating for the past year for the law to be <Col N="764"/>changed? Why has it not said that a disgraceful distinction in Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental rights means that foreign children in Ireland are unprotected? Why has it not clamoured and knocked down the doors of this House, separately from the debate on the proposed referendum, to say that nothing is being done for many unprotected people? I regard the argument as insubstantial and somewhat contrived.</P>
    <P>I wish to be orderly by returning to Senator Terry&rsquo;s point. It would be political folly and unnecessary to pursue the Article 2 route. I fully accept that she has proposed her amendment simply to show that there is another route up the mountain, but the route in question is the most dangerous route. It would result in bodies being carried down the mountain, whereas the route up the back slope is much easier.</P>

   <Title>Family Law: Motion.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
    <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Government to furnish the House with a report of progress to date and future plans aimed at securing the full compatibility of Irish family law with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, with particular reference to the Convention rights of non-marital and one-parent families.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I apologise for being unable to agree to the proposal that the previous debate be allowed to continue for a further 15 minutes, but the seconder of this motion will have to leave almost immediately. I am surprised that the Government has tabled an amendment, which is almost the same as the motion itself. I sought to word the motion in a non-contentious manner, as I usually do. My motion does not seek to undermine Article 41.3.1&deg; of the Constitution, in which the State &ldquo;pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack&rdquo;. Anyone who reads the consultation paper on the rights and duties of co-habitees, published last week by the Law Reform Commission, will see that it states exactly the same. The consultation <Col N="766"/>paper does not apply to couples if one of them is married.</P>
    <P>The recent enactment of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 has cast a spotlight on many aspects of Irish law, most particularly on our laws concerning family life. The Act somewhat belatedly incorporates the provisions of the European convention into Irish domestic law. The Act broadly requires Irish domestic law to comply with the provisions of the convention. If a provision of Irish law infringes the convention, it is open to a court to make a declaration of incompatibility with the convention.</P>
    <P>Article 8 of the convention requires the contracting states to respect the private and family life of all persons, among other issues. In interpreting the scope of the rights protected by Article 8, the European Court of Human Rights has taken a broad and generally inclusive view of the concept of family life. The court has consistently ruled that Article 8 concerns not only the traditional family, based on marriage, but extends its protective scope to families that do not fit this classical mould.</P>
    <P>I wish to declare an interest by stating that I have been the president of Cherish, which is now known as One Family, for many years. The organisation provides support to single women with children. Many one-parent families have emerged as a consequence of divorce and separation, etc. I have a special interest in this area.</P>
    <P>The case law of the European Court of Human Rights has established, for example, that for the purposes of the convention, the term &ldquo;family&rdquo; includes a non-marital cohabiting couple, particularly if the couple has children, as well as a one-parent family, regardless of whether it is based on marriage. The court has also affirmed that a non-custodial parent and his or her child may enjoy a legally protected family life for the purposes of the convention.</P>
    <P>I wish to compare this stance with the position in Irish law. In stark contrast to the position of the European Convention on Human Rights, for most purposes, Irish law recognises only the family based on marriage. Family units not founded on matrimony enjoy next to no rights with fewer obligations towards their members. A couple cohabiting outside of marriage are deemed for most legal purposes to be strangers before the law, being no more obliged to each other than flat mates. While the position of the non-marital child has been greatly ameliorated by the Status of Children Act 1987, the position of each parent <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the other parent of that child is unenviable. No matter how profound or lengthy their relationship or how stable their family, the law still regards both the non-marital mother and father as legal strangers.</P>
    <P>Cohabiting couples are subject to none of the extensive rights and obligations of married couples. Take for instance the example of a woman living with a man who is not her husband. <Col N="767"/>The woman becomes pregnant and decides to take time off to rear her family. Working as homemaker, she cares for her child and partner for several years. Several years later she has another child with the same man and decides to stay at home again to care for her children. If her partner were to leave her, the woman, despite her considerable effort and sacrifice, would not be entitled to a single cent of maintenance from her partner while her children would. Even if he has promised solemnly to maintain her through thick and thin, such promises are legally unenforceable as maintenance agreements between cohabiting couples are not legally recognised in this State.</P>
    <P>Without making financial contributions towards its purchase, she will have no claim over the property of her partner should their relationship founder. In particular, the provisions of the Family Home Protection Act 1976 do not apply when the parties are not married. The home, therefore, in which she and her children reside could be sold from under her without her knowledge, let alone her consent. Many people who are cohabiting do not realise that the notion of common law husband or wife is an urban myth.</P>
    <P>If her partner were to die without making a valid will, moreover, she would not be entitled to any portion of his estate, regardless of the length or the profundity of her relationship with the deceased. The Succession Act 1965 entitles the spouse of a deceased person to the majority of his or her estate, if a valid will was not made. Even if the wife was disinherited by a written will, she would still by law be entitled to override it, taking one third of the estate if the couple have children and a half if they do not. By contrast, where a non-marital cohabiting partner dies without making a will, his surviving partner is left high and dry as she is not entitled to any portion of the deceased&rsquo;s estate. There is moreover, no provision in law to remedy the situation where a deceased person excludes a non-marital partner from his will.</P>
    <P>Ironically, these legal deficiencies are most glaring when legal protection is arguably most necessary. If a woman&rsquo;s non-marital partner were to be hospitalised in circumstances where he was unable to make decisions for himself, she would not be permitted to make such decisions on his behalf without an iron cast power of attorney. She may, therefore, find herself excluded from crucial decisions pertaining to her loved one&rsquo;s health, such as where a partner is unconscious and on a life-support machine. It is also worth noting that a 50 year old woman in an intimate relationship for some years may find that next-of-kin for legal purposes will be her parents or a sibling.</P>
    <P>The tax system favours married couples over non-marital couples, though less so since the introduction of individualisation in the tax assessment of married couples. In particular, a non-marital partner will pay significantly more inheritance tax on donations made by a deceased <Col N="768"/>partner than will a spouse receiving property on the death of his or her husband or wife. Married persons are exempt from gift and inheritance tax in respect of transfers between spouses. By contrast, non-marital partners enjoy no such exemption, exposing them to high levels of capital acquisitions tax when a partner dies. Similar spousal exemptions in respect of capital gains tax and stamp duty are not available to non-marital couples.</P>
    <P>Section 151 of the Finance Act 2000 remedied this disparity by creating a tax exemption where a property that is the principal private residence of the cohabitees is bequeathed on death to the surviving partner. However, certain limitations exist such as the surviving partner must have lived with the deceased for three years prior to the latter&rsquo;s death and not have another house in her possession. If the surviving partner moves house within six years of the deceased&rsquo;s death, she can expect to pay full capital acquisitions tax based on the market value of the house.</P>
    <P>Some might suggest that she has no one but herself to blame for this predicament. If she wants to enjoy the rights that flow from marriage, then she should get married. Many cohabiting couples intend just that. When working in the Rotunda, I often asked women having children in cohabiting relationships if they would not get married. Most intended to but were either saving for the wedding or some other occasion that comes in the way. Marriage may also not be an option as one of the partners may already be married but can only become eligible for divorce at least four years after separation. Other couples may, despite their best efforts, split before they reach the altar. Same sex couples, of course, cannot marry and are left in a particularly invidious position which Senator Norris will address.</P>
    <P>Marriage remains popular, although people now tend to marry later than in former times. Some centuries ago, it was not popular because it only made a difference to those with property. However, there is no denying the underlying growth not only in the number of couples who are delaying marriage, but also in the proportion of families living together with no expectation of marriage at all. For various complex reasons the phenomenon of the non-marital family has become decidedly more prevalent in society.</P>
    <P>Ireland in the 21st century has a two-tier system for the recognition of family rights and obligations. This legal situation is underpinned in Article 41 of the Constitution that recognises the family based on marriage as the natural and fundamental unit of society. The Constitution consigns the growing number of alternative family forms, such as non-marital partners and lone, unmarried parents and their children, to a legal no-man&rsquo;s land. This narrow perspective has, in turn, informed legislative developments where the rights and obligations conferred on married persons are unavailable to families not based on marriage. However, of the 900,000 family units <Col N="769"/>enumerated by the 2002 census, 12% were one-parent families, 85% of which were headed by a woman. There were approximately 30,000 cohabiting couples with children and approximately 47,000 cohabiting couples without children. These figures show the reality of life for many people in society.</P>
    <P>The legal distinction between non-marital and marital children was, for most purposes, abolished by the Status of Children Act 1987. There is still discrimination against the child of marriage regarding adoption. Constitutionally, a non-marital child can be adopted with the consent of his or her mother and any other guardian. However, the child of married parents cannot be approved for adoption in this manner. Due to the restraints created in Article 42 of the Constitution a marital child can only be adopted when there has been a complete and comprehensive abandonment of the child that is likely to last until the child reaches 18 years of age. Legally, it is a difficult predicament to establish that this has happened. Ironically, it illustrates how the constitutional preference for marriage can work to the disadvantage of some members of the marital family unit. A child in long-term foster care may find that she cannot hope to attain the long-term stability that adoption may provide simply because her parents are married.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to second Senator Henry&rsquo;s motion. I admit that when Senator Henry took me through her views on this a couple of weeks ago, I was unaware of the intricacies and problems involved. She has articulated these very well in a number of areas. I commend her for introducing the motion and I have much pleasure in seconding it.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate, together with the publication last week of the report of the Law Reform Commission, will spur the Government into action. I seek an indication that it will approach the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights Act in a proactive way. I was disappointed that the Government put down an amendment which does not encourage a proactive approach. Senator Henry put down a non-aggressive motion hoping there would not be an amendment. The Government&rsquo;s amendment states that Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;calls on the relevant members of the Government to keep the law on these matters under review and bring forward legislative proposals on them as appropriate.&rdquo; If there is such a thing as putting something on the long finger, this is it. The wording of this amendment could have been more proactive and could have given Senator Henry&rsquo;s motion some more attention.</P>
    <P>I hope the State will not wait to be taken to court before it brings about changes in our legal system. If that was all we did as a result of the European Convention on Human Rights Act, it would be a passive, grudging and unworthy <Col N="770"/>approach. If, as I hope, we approach the Act positively, we will seek to search out those of our laws and procedures that conflict with the convention and put them right before we are compelled to do so. That is the essence of tonight&rsquo;s debate. Nowhere is this more necessary than in the field of family law, which has not caught up with either the changes in European practice or the changes that have been happening before our eyes in this society.</P>
    <P>As Senator Henry said, things have changed. The world in general, and Ireland in particular, have changed vastly since the Constitution was first enacted in 1937. In those days it made perfect sense to define the concept of the family as a group based on marriage because at that time that was overwhelmingly the norm. There was practically nothing else. Nowadays, as we all know, that is no longer the case. There are many single-parent families. Senator Henry mentioned some figures in this area. We have an even larger number of people living together outside the framework of marriage, with or without children. It is vitally important that our law should change in step with these changes in our society.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of family law? It is not to protect or promote the institution of marriage, however much some of us might want to.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what is in the Constitution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I know what the Constitution says, but that is not the purpose of the law. The Constitution aims to protect marriage, while the purpose of the law is to cater for the rights, obligations and special needs that arise when people take on the commitment of a long-term relationship.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the Constitution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Every relationship involves giving and taking on the part of both parties. Usually it is love that provides the driving force for this, whether the parties are married or not. As we know, however, love is not enough to make the world go around. When people share their lives, especially when they have children, a cluster of interlocking rights, obligations and special needs arise. It is to provide for these that family law exists. Just as family law is and should be blind to the religion or race of the people involved, it should also be blind to their marital status. I say that as a fan of marriage. It is important that we continue to recognise the institution of marriage in our Constitution. I would have great difficulty, however, with any intention to ignore the problems that are being created due to the changes in society.</P><Col N="771"/>
    <P>Marriage is a great thing, but I do not see it as a reason for depriving people of rights they should have or releasing them from their obligations. Nor should it be a reason for failing to cater to the special needs that arise by virtue of people&rsquo;s commitment to their relationships. Despite what the Primate of All Ireland, Archbishop Brady, said at the weekend, I do not think marriage as an institution is in any great danger from the changes we need to make. We must be careful and take this into account, of course. The vast majority of our population still gets married and will continue to do so, but it is far better that they should do so out of their own free will rather than because they have been bribed with a set of privileges that only married people can access. In business terms, one bribes people to do something or rewards them for doing it. I would much prefer we did not use bribery. We need to take action in the areas about which Senator Henry has spoken.</P>
    <P>More importantly, our feelings about marriage should not be used as an excuse to deny unmarried people in relationships what should by right be theirs. To discriminate generally against people because they are not married is an insult to the institution of marriage and does nothing to promote it. In this country we seem to be particularly slow at getting our act together in such matters. Perhaps this is because of our long Catholic tradition or because most of us are still practising Catholics. We have surely learned, albeit slowly and painfully, to move away from the idea that our laws exist as a kind of policing element for any particular religion. Even if the people were 100% Catholic it would still be desirable for our laws to be totally blind as far as religion is concerned.</P>
    <P>Some time back I visited a Muslim country and witnessed the attitude of the law there, which discriminated thoroughly against everyone no matter what religion they were. Our Constitution was written in 1937 in a fair and understandable way. We must recognise that there have been changes and examine this issue together. The amendment says we should review the matter, but no action is suggested. It is important in our increasingly diverse and pluralistic society that we are proactive. This is what should concern us as legislators, whose duty it is to serve the people rather than any particular organisation. I realise, however, that Rome cannot be built in a day, so I support the modest and gradual approach reflected in last week&rsquo;s report from the Law Reform Commission. Now we need to show that we are willing to bring our laws into line with present-day realities and to take the first steps towards doing that. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P el="0">I welcome the motion put before the House by Senators Henry, Quinn, Norris, O&rsquo;Toole and Ross. I hope the Leader will not accuse me of treachery, but it does not matter to me whether the motion as proposed or the motion as amended is passed because we are all in agreement on this issue.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Independent Senators&rsquo; motion seeks a report of progress to date and future plans aimed at securing the full compatibility of Irish family law with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, with particular reference to the convention rights of non-marital and one-parent families. I am grateful to them for raising this issue and I propose to give the Government&rsquo;s response to it, as encapsulated in the amendment which has been moved by Senator Jim Walsh on behalf of the Government side. As I said, I am not here to get into combative mode or ask the House to divide unnecessarily.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>None of us is.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="773"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights deals with the right to respect for private and family life and provides that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence and that there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.</P>
    <P>The Senators&rsquo; motion puts forward the idea, by implication, that Ireland is in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and that a plan is needed to rectify this situation. I do not necessarily agree with that analysis which implies that some serious and long-standing problem exists. However, I am not aware of any outstanding judgments against Ireland under Article 8 of the convention and nor am I aware of any imminent case that might put us on the wrong foot. In saying this, I do not wish to be critical of the Senators who tabled the motion. I welcome their initiative in doing so because it affords us a valuable opportunity to discuss the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights relating to the family and the increasingly important subject of the rights of non-marital and one parent families. However, as regards the motion to be passed by the House at the conclusion of this debate, it was my intention to make the point that the Government amendment was preferable.</P>
    <P>By means of the amendment, the House is asked to note that it is the Government&rsquo;s objective that Ireland should fulfil its obligations under international law, including its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. This is most important and it is just as true of past Administrations as it is of this Government. Ireland has always taken its international obligations seriously. It is never our practice to accede to international treaties without ascertaining whether and to what extent domestic legislation and administrative practice must be changed to comply with the treaty in question. Other countries are somewhat inclined to sign documents on an aspirational basis. We are very careful in signing international treaties and sign them only when we have our own house in order and believe that our laws comply with the demands of a treaty.</P>
    <P>In the past, Ireland has been found to be in breach of Article 8 of the convention in three cases, namely the Johnson, Norris and Keegan cases. In the Johnson case, the unequal treatment between children born outside marriage and marital children was found to violate Article 8. That was dealt with in the Status of Children Act, to which Senator Henry referred. In the Norris case, the Court of Human Rights held that the <Col N="774"/>criminalisation of certain sexual activity under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 was in breach of the convention. This violation was remedied by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993. In the Keegan case, the court held that the rights of an unmarried father regarding the adoption of his child had not been respected. This was put right by the Adoption Act 1998. Since the coming into force of this Act, all fathers are consulted about the adoption of their non-marital children.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights is further enhanced by the coming into force last December of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003. As Senators know, this measure was introduced on foot of a commitment by the Government in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Prior to the coming into force of this Act, the convention was binding on Ireland at international level but was not part of our domestic law. The Act alters that position fundamentally as it facilitates the bringing, in Irish courts, of cases involving alleged breaches of rights under the convention. In other words, it will make rights under the convention enforceable in Irish courts. This means that cases of this type can be processed much more expeditiously, and with associated savings in legal costs and expenses, than under the arrangements previously existing, such as when Senator Norris was obliged to go to Strasbourg to have his rights vindicated. In addition, Irish judges can now, as a matter of law, take full cognisance of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in the domestic situation.</P>
    <P>Irish law takes account in a number of ways of non-marital relationships and the situation of unmarried parents. I will outline the laws I am referring to, first, those within my ministerial responsibility. The Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as amended by the Status of Children Act 1987 and the Children Act 1997, provides for the appointment of an unmarried father as the guardian of his child by a court order under section 6(<i>a</i>) of the Act or by statutory declaration of the father and mother. The appointment of the father as guardian means that he can apply to the court under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child. Also, regardless of whether he has custody of the child or shares custody, the guardian-father has a say, jointly with the mother, in decisions affecting the upbringing of the child. Even where the father is not a guardian, he still has the right to make an application to the court regarding the custody of the child and the right of access to the child.</P>
    <P>The Domestic Violence Act 1996 also recognises non-marital relationships. Persons who may apply for a safety order under the Act include a person who is not the spouse of the respondent but has lived with the respondent as husband or wife for a period of at least six months in aggregate during the period of twelve months <Col N="775"/>immediately prior to the application for the safety order. It also includes a person, being of full age, who resides with the respondent in a relationship the basis of which is not primarily contractual. A person who has lived with the respondent as husband or wife for a period of at least six months in aggregate during the immediately preceding period of nine months may apply for a barring order.</P>
    <P>I am aware that these provisions have been the subject of a number of criticisms on the basis that they seem to distinguish between heterosexual relationships and those of persons of the same sex, that they are too tightly drawn and on other grounds. However, the significant point is that they afford the far-reaching relief available under the Domestic Violence Acts to people in non-marital relationships and in this way recognise the reality of such relationships and the need to protect vulnerable people from violence in their own homes.</P>
    <P>A further example is the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 1996, which amends the definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; contained in the Civil Liability Act 1961 for the purpose of actions in respect of fatal injuries. The definition now includes as a dependant a person who was not married to the deceased but who had, until the date of the deceased&rsquo;s death, been living with the deceased as husband or wife for a continuous period of not less than three years.</P>
    <P>Going outside my own area of responsibility, non-marital relationships are recognised in a number of other Acts, for example, in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I will not go into too much detail regarding what has been done in the social welfare legislation, but I have supplied the text to the House for people to consult later.</P>
    <P>For capital acquisitions tax purposes, a member of a couple can apply to avail of dwelling house relief. Essentially, capital acquisitions tax no longer applies on the transfer of the home on or after 1 December 1999 provided it is the principal private residence of the disponer and-or the recipient and the recipient has been living in the home for the three years prior to the transfer. That provision brought in by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, takes no regard of the sexual relationship involved, whether it be homosexual or heterosexual. Cohabitation is sufficient. That reflects a significant change in the law. The recipient must not have an interest in any other residential property because we do not want people moving in together in order to avoid the provisions of the Act. Subject to exceptions, the recipient must remain in possession of the house for six years after the transfer. That provision was made in order to stop people claiming to have some kind of cohabiting relationship, getting a tax free gift and then moving on.</P>
    <P>Point 1(<i>c</i>) of the amendment calls on the House to note the content of Article 41.3.1&deg; of <Col N="776"/>the Constitution. This provides that the State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack. It is in this area that there is something of a difference of approach between our constitutional provisions and Article 8 of the European convention as interpreted by the Court of Human Rights. Article 41.3.1&deg; pledges the State to guard the institution of marriage on which the family is founded. It thus places the family solely in the context of marriage. In the Nicolaou case, Mr. Justice Walsh said it was quite clear to him that the family referred to in Article 41 is the family based on matrimony. We have an elaborate jurisprudence based on that point.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the approach taken by the Court of Human Rights in the context of Article 8 of the convention is that family life extends beyond the family based on marriage. In the Keegan case, to which I already referred, the court recalled that the notion of the family in Article 8 is not confined solely to marriage-based relationships and may encompass other <i>de facto </i>family ties where the parties are living together outside of marriage. In the Keegan case, the court said that there existed between a non-marital child and his parents a bond amounting to family life even if at the time of his birth the parents are no longer cohabiting or if their relationship has ended.</P>
    <P>The constitutional position is clearly something that needs to be kept in mind in considering this motion and any draft legislation that comes before this or the other House. The difference between this position and that which has emerged from the Court of Human Rights is something which was addressed by the Constitution review group and will no doubt be considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in the future. The view of the review group was that the protection of the family as a unit, as distinct from the protection of the individual&rsquo;s right to family life, presented particular difficulties if the definition of the family unit was to be extended beyond the family based on marriage because of the uncertainties inherent in such an approach. The European convention does not protect the family unit as such, rather the individual&rsquo;s right to respect for his or her family life, the meaning of this being developed on a case by case basis in the jurisprudence of the Court of Human Rights. The Constitution review group took the approach that the Constitution should continue to contain a pledge by the State to guard with special care the institution of marriage and to protect it against attack. This should, however, be subject to a proviso that this provision should not prevent the Oireachtas from legislating for the benefit of families not based on marriage or for the individual members thereof. According to the review group, there should also be a guarantee to all individuals of respect for their family life whether based on marriage or not.</P><Col N="777"/>
    <P>Even in the absence of changes along these lines, it does not follow that Ireland is in breach of the European convention solely because the so-called <i>de facto</i> family is not, as such, given constitutional protection. We must ensure that the obligations in the convention are given effect in our statute law, subject to the constitutional pledge of special care for the institution of marriage.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn. I do not believe protecting the institution of marriage ever involves, by some kind of analogy, penalising unfairly those who are not in matrimonial relationships. It may involve, on some occasions, discrimination in the technical sense between married people and unmarried people because if there is no difference, there is no special status but by the same token discrimination, in the other invidious sense of the term, in terms of inflicting penalties, suffering and unfairness on people, is not a necessary concomitant of protecting the family.</P>
    <P>All of this brings me to the recently published consultation paper of the Law Reform Commission on rights and duties of cohabitees. I stop here to ask, in the presence of Senator Norris, what is wrong with the phrase &ldquo;cohabitants&rdquo;. &ldquo;Cohabitees&rdquo; seems to be a passive phrase, and I do not understand it. It annoys me when I see lists of people who are in attendance on an occasion being referred to as &ldquo;attendees&rdquo;. It is a misnomer.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This paper contains a comprehensive examination of the law as regards cohabitees and makes recommendations for change. It does not recommend any new institution such as registered partnerships and does not analyse this question, which is for another day but is not far off. Instead, it makes proposals in individual areas of the law that would improve the situation of cohabitants. It repeatedly stresses, as it successively discusses the various subjects that arise, that the commission&rsquo;s overall approach is that cohabitation is not to be equated with marriage. In general, the <Col N="778"/>commission appears to endeavour to propose solutions that correspond with the status of cohabitation rather than the lifelong commitment of married persons with a view to generating children, which is the primary purpose of the protection given to marriage.</P>
    <P>In discussing this paper it should be stressed that it is a consultation paper and not a report. The commission has invited observations by September next and will then proceed to draw up a final report making definitive recommendations. I look forward to the outcome of that process and hope that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution will have regard to the finalised report when that process of consultation has concluded.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of the consultation paper is that the reforms being proposed would apply to what are termed &ldquo;qualified cohabitees&rdquo;, but what I hope will be referred to as qualified cohabitants, defined as persons who live together in a marriage-like relationship for a continuous period of three years or, where there is a child of the relationship, of two years. This includes relationships between same sex or opposite sex couples, neither of whom is married to each other or to any other person. The commission argues that the exclusion of any person who is married is necessitated by Article 41 of the Constitution, which deals with the family.</P>
    <P>Among the specific provisional recommendations are the right for cohabitants to apply for a property adjustment order and a maintenance order in certain circumstances; the right to apply for relief under succession law where provision has not been made in the will of the deceased cohabitee; the extension of the definition of &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; in social welfare legislation to include those in same sex relationships; a relationship of qualified cohabitants should be recognised by the taxation code; qualified cohabitants should get more favourable treatment for the purposes of capital acquisitions tax and stamp duty, corresponding to that accorded to closely related persons but not as favourable, they argue, as that applying to a married couple; qualified cohabitants should be given greater recognition in the context of health care situations and decision-making; qualified cohabitants, not just those living together as husband and wife, should be included in the definition of &ldquo;dependants&rdquo; for the purposes of civil actions for wrongful death; and the residency requirement in respect of barring orders for cohabiting couples should be reduced and removed for cohabitants seeking a barring order where they have the sole ownership or tenancy in the property, and also in respect of safety orders.</P>
    <P>The general text of that paper accords with views I expressed at the Progressive Democrats conference in March when I said that legal recognition should be given to same sex unions or civil partnerships in some fashion but that this recognition should not put such unions on the same legal basis as marriage. I understand from <Col N="779"/>remarks attributed to Senator Norris that he is in agreement with me on that proposition. Those who are of a socially conservative disposition or who are worried by all these events should pause to ask whether any of this will damage the social fabric of society. Does it damage the social fabric of society if people who are living together currently have the tax break the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, gave them, and does it strengthen the fabric of society to deny people the other proposed changes which are to be found in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report?</P>
    <P>Social reality is changing and the law must respond in order to treat people in non-marital relationships equitably. Whereas I can see that Deputy Norris, coming from the point of view of equality for homosexuals in our society, is looking at this as a question of sexual orientation equality, there are other areas where there are non-sexual relationships which deserve some degree of support.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be an obligation and an entitlement for somebody who joins, say, a religious order to make the mother superior or some other member of the community the next of kin. There are some people in the clergy who share my view that it is right that the law reflects a relationship where responsibility and caring exists and helps those relationships rather than ignores them because whether they are homosexual, heterosexual, asexual, intellectual or based on faith communities, that relationship of responsibility and caring, one person for another, is one which should be supported by the law and not disregarded by the law on the basis that it is not marriage <i>per se</i>. That is what the Government amendment proposes.</P>
    <P>Having heard what Senator Henry said in opening the debate and having considered the text of the Government amendment, it is not a matter on which we should divide.</P>

	<P>Perhaps somebody will come into the House later and say he or she has a radically different view of the world and, if so, we will have to take that into account but it would be a pity to have a false division when everybody appears to be agreed on the approach to be taken.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister indicating a withdrawal of the amendment?</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

	<P>We will let the debate proceed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a welcome and refreshing debate and I thank the Minister for his contribution. I thank also the Independent group for putting down the motion, which is welcome on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Society is changing, and I welcome that change. I am glad I am living in this age and not that of my mother, which was a much more difficult society for the people at that time. Even in my time I have experienced changes for the better, which I welcome, but I recognise that there are many more changes to be made to make our society more equal, just and caring for all our people.</P>
    <P>I want to give some figures that indicate the way Ireland has changed in recent years; Senator Henry may have given some of these figures already. According to the Central Statistics Office, in 2002 there were 77,600 cohabiting couples in Ireland. That figure is up from 31,300 in 1996, an increase of over 40%. That increase is significant and must be recognised. Overall, those couples accounted for 8.4% of all family units in 2002 compared with 3.9% in 1996. The figures also show a 125% rise in the number of same sex couples over the past six years, from 150 to 1,300. Two thirds of those were male couples. We must recognise that in 1996 a huge number of people in gay relationships may have been shy about coming forward and letting that be known. However, it may still be the case today that there are many people in gay relationships afraid to come forward and acknowledge it publicly. The number of people living in non-marital relationships now stands at 155,000 adults, with more than 51,000 children, so we are no longer speaking about a tiny minority of people. It is a substantial number. Article 8.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights states, as the Minister said, that &ldquo;Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and correspondence&rdquo;. I do not think that anyone here today would argue with that.</P>
    <P>The time of politicians and others interfering in people&rsquo;s lives is well and truly over, particularly interfering in people&rsquo;s bedrooms. Some 12 years ago Ireland criminalised gay people and those seeking to use contraception freely. It straitjacketed those in unhappy and even abusive marriages. We live in a new Ireland and, as I said at the outset, I welcome that fact. Fine Gael has contributed in no small part to that creation. We could not argue with Article 8 and instead see it as not going far enough, as it is loaded with caveats, including the need to protect morals. That is a loaded phrase if ever there was one.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael sees no problem with making substantial improvements and developments in this area, in the same way as the Government seems to. We have developed several policies designed to protect everyone in the State, not least vulnerable children who may be living in <Col N="781"/>families outside what some people believe is the traditional norm, but are in fact no less loving or protective than any family that came before them. It is worth noting that this debate comes against the backdrop of cuts in social welfare that hurt every family, whether married, unmarried, gay or straight. The Government has been slow in debating this issue and introducing the necessary changes. I welcome what the Minister said today and look forward to any changes that he brings about.</P>
    <P>In the coming weeks, Fine Gael will aim to reignite the debate on civil partnerships that has been bubbling away underneath for some time. We have drawn up and agreed policies that will grant gay couples, and heterosexual couples who do not wish to marry, full equality before the law in the areas of tax, inheritance, next of kin, succession, workplace entitlements and others. Judging from those who have spoken here today, including the Minister, we are in agreement on that area. We will publish our policy on that over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Partnership rights are the State&rsquo;s way of recognising that the world and the country have changed. While we still strongly support the institution of marriage, we are mature enough as a society to know that we must offer those who do not, cannot or choose not to marry the options that they deserve. Respect for marriage and relationships that fall outside marriage are not mutually exclusive. The Government should remember that when deciding to respect this House by providing it with the legislation that we believe is necessary in this area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the debate on these issues. It is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas lead the way in the debate, addressing issues that are obviously of significant social consequence for major minorities nowadays. It is much better that we lead by having a debate and evolving a well-thought-out consensus in such areas, rather than, as has happened in the past, allowing matters to drift and taking a more <i>laissez-faire</i> approach. Practices come about purely because there is no policy in the area. It is more or less made up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. I have seen some of that and, from my perspective, I feel that some of it has not fully complied with the intention and spirit of our Constitution, in some degree perhaps having assisted in undermining it.</P>
    <P>I believe Senator Terry gave some statistics on cohabitation. That area is changing, just as Ireland is changing as a society, much of it for the good and some of it not. I do not necessarily subscribe to the view that everything new is good and everything old is not so good. We had many values in society for which we must have certain regard to ensure that, as we progress and pass on our legacy to future generations, it is done in a way that will best underpin their opportunities and the potential for them to lead a well regulated and adjusted life in society.</P><Col N="782"/>
    <P>It is my strong opinion that the family unit as we traditionally recognised it has really been the cornerstone of society over not just decades and centuries, but since prehistoric times. Evidence is now being produced that family units existed then so even in presumably uncivilised times, it was obviously recognised that society needed some basis for people to accord with each other so that it could regulate itself properly. Senator Quinn may have unintentionally ignored what is in the Constitution. It is worth reminding ourselves of Article 41.1.1&deg; and Article 41.1.2&deg;:</P>
    <P LI="1">1&deg; The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P LI="1">2&deg; The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Article 41.3.1&deg; states</P>
    <P LI="1">The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Minister put it rather well when he said that nothing in that in any way implied that there should be discrimination against other forms of family-type units which exist today. However, we must recognise that it challenges us. If we accept that the basis in the Constitution is a very good one for society not just 70 years ago, but today and for future generations, the challenge to us is how we ensure that cohabitees &mdash; other phrases have also been used &mdash; can be dealt with responsibly and fairly without, on the other hand, undermining the status of marriage in society.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Senator Henry alluded to the large number of single parent family units and any of us who have been involved in local authorities over the years will have seen a dramatic change. In my early days in local government, three-bedroom houses were generally allocated to married people and one-bedroom houses to elderly people. That is how it was. However, that has now changed completely and the vast majority of applicants are single parents, mostly girls, looking after their children. He or she is left in that situation in many instances by a partner who does not have the same commitment to the child, perhaps. People in that position deserve great credit and support. On the other hand, I have come across situations where applicants in that category are there specifically because of the structure of the social welfare system. Rent subsidy and lone parent&rsquo;s allowance is removed if he or she admits to be living with a partner. That is part of the <i>laissez faire</i> approach to which I referred earlier. It has been going on for at least a decade and a half or maybe longer.</P><Col N="783"/>
    <P>It is also worth noting that until recently every child had a father as well as a mother.</P><Miles com="cl" par="115"/>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but is there not cloning? The father, in many instances, is not supporting the child. I know the social welfare system is making attempts to change that. A couple that brings a child into the world has responsibilities as well as rights. In many instances, the State is not pursuing matters of this kind as strongly as it should.</P>
    <P>I want to refer, briefly, to the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report that deals with a number of provisional recommendations, none of which I have difficulty with. Much of what the commission is doing and the process to which the Minister referred will, hopefully, address many of the difficulties this category of people is encountering. As regards the definition of qualified cohabitees &mdash; the commission&rsquo;s term &mdash; where it refers to unmarried couples, some account must be taken of married people who give up their marital status and end up in second relationships, which beget children.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just returned from abroad and had not quite anticipated this debate. However, I am glad that it has been put down by my colleagues and I am happy to lend my name to it. I welcome it and I believe it is important that Senator Henry should have approached an area in which I am vitally concerned from a slightly different angle. I would like to say, at the beginning, that I have legislation in preparation which is virtually finished. We are just refining one of the sections at the moment, but this debate provides the opportunity to take some other matters into consideration as well, perhaps, just minor technical things. Lest I forget, I would like to emphasise for the Minister&rsquo;s benefit, that the proposed title is the domestic partnership Bill 2004. It scrupulously avoids the word &ldquo;marriage&rdquo;. I have always done so. Unfortunately, sometimes newspaper headlines, reporting what I have said, refer to &ldquo;gay marriage&rdquo;. I have never used that phrase and dislike it as it creates an unnecessary resistance to what is, in my opinion, very much a question of fair play, decency and justice. For that reason, I welcome not only the Minister&rsquo;s remarks, to which I will turn in a few moments if I have the time, but most particularly the eloquent <Col N="784"/>contributions of Senator Henry and Senator Quinn.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn is a deeply committed loyal Catholic. I know he is proud to be a Knight of St. Gregory and understand he is not at all ashamed to be a member of the Knights of St. Columbanus. It is gratifying to hear somebody from that background talk about &ldquo;the most decent and principled thing&rdquo;, although he is a strong supporter of marriage. So am I. Where did I come from? I did not descend from the trees. I came out of a marriage. My father and mother loved each other. They had a wonderful marriage. Thank God for it and I am grateful the institution was there to provide a happy childhood for me. For Senator Quinn to say, as he did, that the fact that one supports marriage should not be a basis for depriving other people of rights, is absolutely right, as is his contention that people should be led rather than driven into this.</P>
    <P>This is where I see a flaw in a previous tradition and a view that is sustained by some aspects of religious life in this country. In the judgment of Mr. Chief Justice O&rsquo;Higgins, in one of the cases which I took, for example, he maintained that the kind of legislative change we got under the criminal law code would undermine marriage. That was wrong and was simply based on a prejudice. If anybody feels this, he or she should read an important book called <i>Coming Out &mdash; Irish Gay Experiences</i>. The most poignant and desperately sad, desolating articles therein are not from the gay people. They are from the women to whom gay men were coerced into marrying. The damage was done to them. When the gay man decided he was able to come out, this was a wonderful bonanza for him, but tragedy for the wife who was trapped in this relationship. We need to be terribly careful about the way in which we think we support marriage. People like myself who believe in long-term committed relationships should not be seen as the enemies of marriage. We should be seen as allies. I am not asserting that all sexual relationships should be regarded in the same way. The relationships in which gay people engage are not the same as marriage. Many of my gay friends have told me they do not want to be described in this way. Sometimes, with a sense of humour, they add that they have seen what it has done to others and do not want it to happen to them. However, they recognise there is a difference.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, everyone is entitled to work within his or her own ethical religious context to change the views of the church, to get blessings if necessary. If they can bless a few agricultural implements and goldfish, I do not think it would kill them to bless a few poor old lesbians while they are at it. However, that is entirely up to them.</P>
    <P>I have been intellectually strong, although not rude or unfair, in my comments on certain <Col N="785"/>documents emanating from the Vatican and statements coming from the church here. I welcome the tone of Archbishop Brady&rsquo;s comments at the conference on the family. He was right to put at the top of his agenda the fact that the church condemns attacks on gay people and so on. However, I regret that extensive reference was made to a dangerous document emanating from the Vatican, under Cardinal Ratzinger, in which politicians are instructed not to vote positively in this area. That is wrong and I very much hope we will have the velvet glove rather than the steel fist in this debate. I will try to avoid contentious language in order that this may be possible. I trust that the kind of attitude adopted by Senator Quinn will prevail.</P>
    <P>The Bill I referred to will be finalised within the next week or two. It will then be professionally scrutinised and I will seek permission to put it before the House. I decided to look at the principle involved in this matter, which as the Minister said does not just extend to gay people. I was glad and absolutely supported him when he said that consideration of these matters should also take communities, such as religious orders, into account. Why not? The State has no right to pry into people&rsquo;s private sexual activity. I was glad when the Minister noted how significant was the change introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in a budget in the late 1990s as a result of a debate here in this House.</P>
    <P>We were not allowed to amend the budget but made recommendations, one of which came in the light of a case involving a gay couple who had been living together for 30 years in west Cork. The older man was aged 80 while the younger was aged 70. The older man got Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and, as a caring partner, put the house in the name of the younger man, who then got cancer and died, leaving the unfortunate old man who had shown himself, even though ill, to be a caring partner with a bill of &euro;300,000 for living in the house in which he was born. That is the type of unfair situation I want to address and that my Bill will address, if it is permitted. I would like to think that it might come from this House, selfishly because I have worked in the Seanad for a very long time and this would round out my political career, but more importantly because it would give recognition to the Seanad. It is 45 or 50 years since Professor Stanford&rsquo;s Bill providing for humane conditions in abattoirs was passed in this House. It would be useful if, after consultation with the Government, this matter could be resolved through this House.</P>
    <P>A social change is happening. Many people are involved in relationships outside marriage; one third of children are born outside marriage and the Bill will seek also to protect them. There has been a 125% increase in the numbers who acknowledge themselves as same sex couples. <Col N="786"/>That figure is significantly underreported because, even today, very few people are prepared to give that kind of intimate information. It could be multiplied by 100. I welcome very much the attitude of all those who have spoken, particularly Senator Quinn and the Minister. There has been a very positive and constructive debate about decent, committed people who want to register their partners so that they can be next of kin at a deathbed, so that they can live openly with someone with whom they have had a relationship even though they are outside the EU, and so that they can inherit property and benefit from pensions. Why should I contribute to pensions just to look after the widows and orphans of my colleagues? Why should someone with whom I have lived for 27 or 30 years not receive something from a fund to which I have contributed?</P>
    <P>People like me do not damage marriage. People like Britney Spears, who got married for half an hour in a drunken fit in Las Vegas, damage it. That was a marriage. Should I be asked, simply because it is called marriage, to respect that more than the two men who recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of their love and commitment, surrounded by their families in the Incorporated Law Society premises in Dublin? We need to rely once more on the fairness of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I seek and hope that this House may be able to help the Government in a situation where all parties, except Fianna F&aacute;il, when surveyed at the last election strongly supported this type of legislation, including recognition of domestic partnerships, registration and so on. Fianna F&aacute;il said it was in neutral mode and that it had no policy. I hope that this will go through from this House.</P>

	<P>I congratulate Senator Norris on his helpful contribution which, as always, was very stimulating. I am grateful to Senator Henry and her colleagues for bringing this matter forward for debate and to the Minister for the way in which he responded to it. I agree with the Minister that the House should not divide on this issue. We all seem to be heading in the same direction, possibly at different speeds. Therein may lie a compromise because Senator Henry described the amendment as the longest of long fingers. If the Minister could give an assurance that it was not a long finger but that these matters would be brought forward quickly, in due course it might be possible to withdraw the motion and the amendment. It is wise in these matters to wait until the consultation period of the Law Reform Commission has been completed. I recognise too the very helpful contribution of Archbishop Brady to that debate.</P><Col N="787"/>
    <P>We need to be concerned about children. I support Senator Norris&rsquo; view on long-term domestic arrangements rather than marriage and I would continue to make that distinction. A happy and stable marriage is the best place in which to raise children. There are, however, some marriages, which are awful places in which to rear children. Stable and loving relationships, however structured, are as conducive to the solidity and stability of society as many others. Times are changing. I was Chairman of the Mater Hospital in Belfast for several years and the midwives told me that a generation ago unmarried mothers coming in would buy or borrow a cheap ring in order not to be conspicuous in the ward. Now the married women take off their rings.</P>
    <P>We may ultimately need to consider a constitutional amendment too. There is always a problem with constitutional provisions founded on a particular view of society at a given time and on a certain set of social mores because mores change. The family has changed. I commend to the Minister a very useful book by a French sociologist, Philippe Aries, <i>Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life</i> which traces that change. While I acknowledge the form of marriage and family based on the nuclear family that obtained at the time of the drafting of the Constitution and which continues, this is changing for many reasons and we must recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the idea that there should be a marital relationship, which is somehow more &ldquo;pukka&rdquo; than a non-marital one because it creates the danger of stigmatisation. It requires a great deal of thought and discussion and I can understand why the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution shied away from it because when one moves away from the rock of the definition of the family created by marriage, it is extremely difficult to find a form of words to encapsulate the other types of relationships that exist. As long as our debate is informed by a sense of decency and respect for the individual, of the value of difference, and recognises that we must deal with people as they are and that life is changing, we have started a useful and helpful debate which I hope continues. We should wait until the Law Reform Commission completes its consultation.</P>
    <P>The Minister might think it useful for the Human Rights Commission to compare and contrast the positions of protection available in Ireland with the EU Convention and others. I would like us to agree that the debate should go on and that it is not necessary for us to divide the House. I commend the debate and I was particularly struck by the content and humanity of the Minister&rsquo;s response. These are the values that we must recognise.</P>

	<P>I welcome this debate and congratulate Senator Henry and her colleagues for putting down this motion. I hope the House will not divide on the Government&rsquo;s amendment which is on the Order Paper. The debate started here and should continue here. I welcome Senator Norris&rsquo;s proposal to bring forward legislation on this matter. I would also welcome its early publication so that the Seanad could play a lead role. This is one of the areas in which the House has an immense contribution to make to Irish politics. Despite all the political pow-wowing that goes on in the other House, we have time to debate matters rationally here and there is much expertise on both sides of the House. Legislation will eventually be introduced in this area and we could make our mark on it. I very much welcome this debate.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my party colleague, Senator Terry, whose policy document on civil partnership proposals was passed by our front bench. It will be published in the coming weeks and will reflect many of the ideas that have already been aired in the House. On behalf of the party I thank her for her work on this important issue.</P>

	<P>Who do better, men?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Long may that be the case. We must wake up to the variety of relationships that exist in society. The State must recognise the coming together of loving people to share a space, a family home, for a long period of time. It must meet them not only half-way but, in the fullness of time, must provide fully for such relationships. That is the kernel of this debate. We have a long way to go to recognise the multifaceted forms of Irish family that exist.</P>
    <P>As a young parent of a child of two and a half years and one of seven months, I do not know how single parents cope. It is difficult to have one parent exclusively looking after one, two or three children. For the most part, this work is done by women. I do not know how they cope. We must legislate for families in all their shapes and forms.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal of talk about the care and protection given to children. It is a scandal  at a time when so many couples want to adopt children, and go to extraordinary lengths to do so, that we cannot find enough people for long-<Col N="789"/>term fostering of children. That is the experience of health boards in regard to foster parents, at a time when parents are looking all over the world for children to adopt.</P>
    <P>When civil partnerships are ultimately recognised, which I hope will be the case, this should in no way dilute the importance and primary role of marriage in society. Nobody has suggested that civil partnerships should be on an equal footing with marriage; it is not a legitimate argument. Marriage has a special status and we must continue to highlight its importance and encourage people to marry, as well as to form long-term relationships. That does not undermine the fundamental unfairness that exists for many cohabiting couples. A young man and woman in my constituency could not afford to buy a house. The young woman has a child by another partner. The young man&rsquo;s father gave the couple a plot of land on which to build a house. The young woman has to pay stamp duty, whereas if the couple were married she would not be liable to pay it. That is a classic case of inequity. This family cannot afford to build a house that would be a loving home, which is a matter that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>On pension provisions, if a gay or heterosexual couple are living together for 20 or 35 years, why can part of the pension not be given to the remaining partner on the death of the other? We must address this unfairness. One of the greatest benefits of marriage is that when one marries a non-Irish citizen, after a period of time, that person is automatically entitled to residency. The same is not true for cohabiting couples and this is another issue we must address.</P>
    <P>Colleagues referred to welfare benefits. Another matter of serious concern relates to compassionate leave. If a loving couple who are living together are not married, why does labour law not give any protection to them in a case where one of the parties is sick or needs long-term care?</P>
    <P>The issue of next of kin is another obvious example where we need to modify the law, as is the area of property rights. It is horrendous that people can live together for a long period of time yet not be able to provide for the future on the death of one of the parties. That issue has to be addressed in future legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a fundamental discrimination that exists in regard to religious communities, whereby community members cannot bequeath their estate to the community. The same anomaly exists in the case of elderly brothers and sisters living together, which is common in rural Ireland.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

	<P>We must provide a structure for elderly brothers and sisters who care for each other and live in the same house to ensure they are not discriminated against.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate. We are at the start of a long road. In the presence of the Leader, I urge the Government to continue the debate in this House where we can make considerable progress in terms of advancing some of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. Government and the Opposition can work in a bipartisan way to ensure the legislation is updated to give the necessary recognition to civil partnerships.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes. This is not a polarised debate. We did not set out just to talk about cohabiting couples or heterosexual &ldquo;cohabitees&rdquo;, a term which the Minister decried because he wished to use a different word. Neither did we set out to talk about lesbian or gay relationships. We set out to discuss the totality of relationships outside the married state. The debate so far has been most interesting. The Minister made the point, as did Senator Henry, Senator Maurice Hayes and many others, that we are well aware of the article in the Constitution which recognises that the State must work positively to underpin marriage &mdash; the actual wording is more legalistic than that. We adhere to that and recognise that it should be the case. However, we also recognise that the world &mdash; and Ireland is no different &mdash; is made up of couples of varying needs, desires and circumstances which lend themselves to other types of relationships. Over time, such relationships gain recognition and demand responses from the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh, the party spokesman on legal matters will be in the House before 6.55 p.m. and with Senator Henry will propose a composite arrangement, which we hope will find favour with all Members.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way. As Senator Quinn and Senator Henry stated, the world has changed. We could all put our heads in the sand and pretend that nothing exists outside of happy, fulfilled marriages. We are all pleased there are many happy fulfilled marriages and there is no doubt that there are. I was extremely lucky in that regard. However, that does not mean I am not aware that there are many other sad relationships or couples in marriages, which have long failed, who, for some reason or because of convention, are not willing to say so. I know of couples who live in silence and that is sad. They go in and out the one door, meals are eaten and dishes washed in complete silence. To pretend that everyone is like Cinderella or Pollyanna is ridiculous and out of kilter with what is happening in society. I <Col N="791"/>emphasise that I do not decry the state of marriage but applaud it. I applaud people who have entered into it, worked at it, continue to work through various difficulties and challenges which rise to meet them almost on a daily basis and who decide they can work towards a fruitful and happy relationship. It is the most blissful state one could be in.</P>
    <P>However, I recognise there are many other relationships. When I was a member of a local authority most of my work there related to housing. At that time local authorities recognised the needs of single mothers. I echo what Senator Hayes said about the work involved in a mother, whether a single mother or a mother who was married and is separated, rearing one, two or three children. It is mostly women who rear children on their own; I do not know of many men who do so. Thankfully, the State has recognised single mothers, but I remember when it did not and castigated them from the pulpit and all sorts of other places. Local authorities decided early on that there are different definitions of family units and dealt with them according to their housing needs, not according to their morals, or as others might say, their absence thereof.</P>
    <P>I note from the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s paper that the number of relationships involving two men or two women is increasing. They have increased from 150 couples to 1,300 couples in recent times. Equally, there has been a major increase in the number of men and women living together. Some 77,000 recognised couples live in a loving inclusive relationship and want to continue in that type of relationship. To decry any relationship, regardless of a couple&rsquo;s gender, which is loving, inclusive and brings happiness is wrong. Who are we to throw stones? Who is anyone to castigate another person because he or she may appear to be different or in a relationship that is outside what, in true Catholic terms, would be regarded as normal? I feel I can talk openly about this issue because I was lucky to be in a marriage that was happy and inclusive, although we also had major difficulties at times. We did not get up every morning and go to bed every night thinking the sun was shining on us.</P>
    <P>This consultation paper by the Law Reform Commission is a good start to an ongoing debate, as Senator Brian Hayes said. This paper sets out what various countries are doing in this regard and the different types of cohabiting couples. It also sets out the recognised, contractual and presumptive relationships and what they can yield.</P>
    <P>Our justice spokesperson will be here before the end of this debate. He has consulted Senator Henry, myself and others and I hope we can come to an arrangement on this matter. I have dipped in and out of this consultation paper and have <Col N="792"/>read most of it. It is worth reading to learn what is happening in other countries in this area. We cannot put up a big fence and say that people will stay forever in the wonderful orchard of happy marriage. Many will, and good luck to them, I am happy for them, but many will not be able to. If they are not able to, we should start to examine the legislative path ahead. We can do that but it will take a long time. There will not be a metamorphosis in society overnight or a clap of thunder and suddenly everything will be in place to meet the needs of every type of couple. That will require an awakening, which has begun. It will require careful reading in this regard and for the Government to give this matter careful consideration.</P>
    <P>This House is the better for being able to have debates such as this where Members of all parties can express themselves freely and not feel they are overstepping the mark or making comments which might be harmful. We are making them with clarity, in truth and with respect. Respect is the key word. We must respect people and their various relationships.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is a landmark in the discussion on this issue. The positive input by the Minister to this motion, proposed and seconded by my colleagues, marks an important move forward. I ask the Minister and his Department officials to examine this in a challenging and open way, along the lines proposed by Senator Hayes. This is not a party issue. There is no political or party gain to be made from it. We need to examine how we can move forward. Senator Norris has made major progress in drawing up a Bill on this matter. The Department should be open to helping and supporting him in developing it and, if necessary, taking it over at some stage. I formally put it to the Minister to take that approach and I hope he will do so.</P>
    <P>In the maturation and development of society, there are clear signs along the way. Societies have always developed, irrespective of the ideas of different philosophers, with levels of antipathy between different groups. People of different views, culture, colour or who support different football teams start from a base of antipathy towards each other. As society develops, people move to at some stage recognising their similarities and differences but not accepting difference, and then later to acceptance of difference. People move to a stage where there is a tolerance of difference, of which we on this island have observed a great deal. One of the problems society creates for itself in terms of its objective of achieving a developed society is that tolerance is often given far too high a level of credibility because it is taking a step beyond tolerance that will effectively be the criterion on which society is judged, namely, the positive movement towards people of difference. In the <Col N="793"/>creation, development and building of a multifaceted society, diversity and difference is cherished and perceived to be an enriching quality and people seek not only to create the space for difference but work towards creating what would be described in other discussions as an intercultural society, an objective that can also be ascribed to this debate. This issue is about interculture and interplay between people of different backgrounds and beliefs, people in different groups who support different models. That is what defines a society.</P>
    <P>An issue that was recognised tonight is that concepts of love, commitment, sharing, support and longevity are not only to be found in the family model. As Senator Maurice Hayes said, often there can be situations in the marriage model which are less than positive, good, or supportive for the development of children and family life, and that is well recognised. We are dealing with recognising how we as a society can move forward, which is what we should do.</P>
    <P>The tone of the debate has been non-threatening, which is great. The archbishops should not have to be concerned about this matter. There should be no attempt to undermine the value and position of the family in the Constitution or in society. We should simply consider giving recognition to what exists.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we really understand the difficulties experienced by people who are different. I have many friends of long standing and people close to me who are gay. I do not believe Senator Norris will object to me stating that I shared an office with him for the first five years I served in the House. I saw some of the post he received and the negativity, abuse and horrible comments to which he was subjected. The Senator knows my views quite well and is aware that since then I have always advised gay people that they should not feel any need to come out or declare themselves to be gay. These people have enough trouble in their lives without adding more.</P>
    <P>I was involved in a discussion recently with some friends of mine who are positive, supportive and open. We were talking about mutual friends who were present and one asked why they would not just tell us that they are gay. That is the point where difficulties arise. Nobody should ever feel the need to make a declaration of their sexuality. It should never be necessary to do so. No more than someone should have to say he or she is heterosexual, neither should a person have to declare he or she is homosexual. There should simply be supports in place for these people in our society. We should give careful consideration to that matter. Many gay relationships are more loving, stable, long-term and loyal than the traditional family models. That is no reflection on anybody; it is just worth knowing.</P><Col N="794"/>
    <P>There are two groups in society about which I am always concerned. The first comprises the ageing parents of Down&rsquo;s syndrome children who worry about what will happen to their children when they die. The other group is comprised of partners in gay relationship who are the main earners and who wonder what will happen to their loved ones when they die. I am aware of funerals where gay partners were not even recognised by the families at the service. None of that is necessary. It is not about us trying to decide how matters should develop. It is about us being open and tolerant, without threatening anyone&rsquo;s beliefs, undermining anybody&rsquo;s faith or giving any offence to the Constitution. We must work along the lines outlined by the Minister. Much of what he said has been supported by the comments made by other speakers.</P>
    <P>Is it not possible to recognise that this is an issue for everyone and move forward? There are many examples of problems arising because someone decided to take a particular party line. I cannot conceive of any party line that might be taken in respect of this matter. In moving it forward we need to recognise the kind of supports people need. Where people have given their lives to each other &mdash; regardless of whether they happen to be unmarried or involved in a same sex relationship &mdash; we must recognise that they have given a commitment and have an entitlement. We must, therefore, deal with many matters such as pensions, property and wills. The Minister outlined the various items of common law that are evolving. This is a complex and complicated area and we need to address it.</P>
    <P>This debate has been a hugely important step forward and has also been completely non-confrontational. I am delighted that the Minister indicated that it is possible that we may reach an agreement on the motion. I compliment Senator Henry on tabling the motion and appeal to the Department to discuss with Senator Norris the content of the Bill to which he referred so that this issue can be moved forward in an all-party fashion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and his officials. I also welcome the motion tabled by the Independent Senators on which there has already been an extremely worthwhile debate.</P>
    <P>It is far better in this type of area to proceed by means of debate, clarification and consensus. Like most Members, I recall that 20 years ago this type of debate could have been quite divisive with one side wanting to force through so-called enlightened measures against the traditional view. However, since the late 1980s we have worked, to a large extent, together. I refer, for example, to the judicial separation legislation on which Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael worked together. In addition, there was the legislation on <Col N="795"/>illegitimacy. In the early 1990s, Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour worked together on homosexual reform. In the mid-1990s, the then Leader of the Opposition, now the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, played an important role in securing agreement on the way in which the divorce referendum could be passed.</P>
    <P>Nothing any of us wishes to say should be taken as a detraction from the important and vital roles of marriage and the family, which are recognised in the Constitution and are particularly valuable social institutions. Equally, everyone recognises that the pattern of relationships has changed. We are not starting from scratch in this regard. As the Minister pointed out, we have already made progress in narrowing a gulf that once existed between marriage and the family, on one hand, and any other sort of relationship, on the other. While there is a great deal of detail to be dealt with, most of us support that progress on humane grounds.</P>
    <P>I am contributing to this debate because I want to introduce a concept to it. I have in my possession a paper by the Law Reform Commission which refers to cohabitees. Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, used the phrase &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo;. I wish to introduce a third phrase, &ldquo;companionship&rdquo;, which reflects that about which we are talking, namely, loving relationships. The vital point &mdash; which was made by the Minister and Senator Brian Hayes &mdash; is that we should not be referring to relationships that are defined by sexuality, be it heterosexuality or homosexuality.</P><Miles com="cl" par="115"/>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate must be broader than that. I recall instances where brothers and sisters, friends or whomever lived together. We should not, therefore, view relationships in terms of sexuality.</P>
    <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, outside of marriage, people&rsquo;s precise relationship with each other, regardless of its nature, is no one else&rsquo;s business. There is an exception, however, if there are children involved or if it is a one-parent family. Recognising what Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, is there not a need for something broader? It is on this point that I disagree with the Law Reform Commission which, in respect of non-sexual relationships states &ldquo;The Commission is not concerned with such relationships because, in our view, it is not possible to devise a single scheme for the determination of legal rights and duties&rdquo;. That is a challenge we must embrace and overcome. It would have a liberating effect on the debate in this area if, for example, gay relationships or unmarried relationships &mdash; regardless of whether divorced persons are <Col N="796"/>involved &mdash; could be subsumed into a wider category I prefer to call &ldquo;companionship&rdquo; but which others may prefer to term &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo;. What we are discussing is broader than the term &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; which makes central the sexual nature of a relationship. If we could do that, we would be doing something useful and enlightened. We would also be able to get consensus on the matter if we were not exclusively focused on certain types of relationships. While this, obviously, subsumes and includes those sexual relationships, it does not necessarily put them up in lights as being the main reason for what we are doing. Many valuable, loving relationships exist.</P>
    <P>I was conscious, when a member of the tax strategy group under the previous Government, that tax revenue has much to do with the problem. The Exchequer collects an enormous amount of revenue from people who, although they may be in the types of relationships about which we are talking, are not recognised for tax purposes as such, for example, brothers and sisters, etc. There are some exceptions, particularly in the agricultural sector, but they are limited. If we look at capital transfer revenue, a huge amount of it comes from people who are living together not necessarily in a sexual sense, but under the same roof, or from relatively close relations but not parent-child or married.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance holds much of the responsibility in this area. We might like to think that it is all a question of moral attitudes and of changing them but we need to disabuse ourselves of that idea. Tax revenue has much to do with a certain degree of resistance to change in this area.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is useful but there is a long way to go. My main reason for speaking on this issue is to second the amendment. It covers most of what we would like to see achieved in the area and it calls on the relevant members of the Government to keep the law on these matters under review and bring forward legislative proposals as appropriate. When Senator Norris brings forward his Bill, we can examine it. Article 40.3.1&deg; is important and should be examined carefully.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Henry, Senator Norris and the other Senators who raised this matter. We are here as legislators to respond and to take regard of evolution in society. In our lifetimes a spontaneous evolution of family and relationships has taken place. It is difficult to believe the change in the perception of marriage and homosexuality from that held only 20 years ago to the view that is held today. What is wonderful about 2004 is that we have become more tolerant and I am pleased to be part of that move.</P>
    <P>In our Constitution the family is seen as the married couple. Research in the United States leaves no doubt but that children raised by two parents have better opportunities. A child raised by two people has an easier life and more opportunities than a child brought up by a lone parent because of the greater earning power of two people.</P>
    <P>I would like us to evolve in the manner suggested by Senator Henry. We have 90,000 one-parent families with children under 19 years of age. We have 77,000 co-habiting couples and one third of all births are outside marriage. I do not believe that our laws cater for the children from these relationships. Children are invisible in the eyes of the law. Our law must evolve to take into consideration children who do not get equal opportunities to those of children of a two-parent family. The State has a responsibility to look after those children.</P><Col N="798"/>
    <P>I have often pointed out that the Government has a responsibility to those who are less well off. It must be concerned about the children of single mothers, the cost of cr&egrave;ches, etc. The State must look after the human rights of each of its children. They did not ask to be born. We have an obligation as legislators to look after the children and to protect them from the changes that have taken place in society.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Some married couples also live in poverty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not dispute that fact. However, I am concerned with the issue of family as raised by Senator Henry. She knows what I mean.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am profoundly grateful to all the Senators who contributed in such a constructive manner on this debate. I am also grateful to the Minister of State for his remarks.</P>
    <P>Let me cheer Members up. Marriage is still incredibly popular. The marriage rate in Ireland is approximately the same as it was in 1951. Far fewer people got married then because of poverty and other reasons. The outlook, as far as marriage is concerned, is cheerful. Most couples who can get married and who have a loving relationship with a companion look on marriage as a gold standard.</P>
    <P>The Constitution does not propose something unnatural but something the majority of people seem to want eventually. While it is true that 90,000 family units are headed by single persons, 85% of whom are women, many of those single parents were already married and are either separated or divorced. Senator White is right that the children of such institutions must be carefully nurtured. This is very important. Approximately one third of the children born in this country are born outside marriage but about two thirds of those children are born to people in stable relationships. Many of those eventually marry which is what most of them want.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>My reason for asking the Minister to address this issue &mdash; I was pleased with his reply &mdash; is to ensure greater stability in society, not less. People have obligations as well as rights. We must suggest to them that despite the fact that they have not made legal and, in some cases, religious promises to each other, they have the responsibilities of the companionship they may have had, as mentioned by Senator Mansergh also. This is important.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that this debate arose at the same time as the debate on the rights and duties of cohabitees or cohabitants. I will send Mr. Justice Budd a copy of this extremely useful debate and I hope the Law Reform Commission will find it useful in its deliberations before bringing forward its paper.</P>

	<P>Senator Walsh stated that this is a very simple referendum. In theory it is a simple referendum with which we should, in principle, have no problem. However, I am concerned about this method of dealing with an issue. Amending our Constitution is a very serious matter. We should explore every available avenue to arrive at an appropriate solution. Putting a referendum to the people to amend our Constitution should be a last resort. This Bill is, therefore, extremely important. To date, the courts have not adjudicated on Articles 2 and 9 and therefore we do not know their real meaning. If the courts were to adjudicate on them, would the amendment proposed by the Government stand up? What would be the position, following the passing of this referendum, of economic migrants from countries outside the EU, for example, Albania, who have given birth here to a child who is now an Irish citizen?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This referendum, if passed, <Col N="801"/>will not deprive anybody of citizenship who is an Irish citizen. Therefore, to take the Senator&rsquo;s example of two Albanians who have had a child in Ireland who is now an Irish citizen, as matters stand their presence in Ireland falls to be decided in accordance with the principles laid down in the L and O case. Having an Irish citizen child is not an absolute guarantee of a right to remain in Ireland. On the other hand I emphasise the Supreme Court never ruled that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could deport people casually and at will notwithstanding that they had a citizen child. The ruling of the Supreme Court was that if there were compelling grounds in the view of the Minister for requiring the parents of the child to leave, it did not constitute an absolute bar on their deportation that the child was an Irish citizen. The Supreme Court never ruled that the Minister could deport anybody he considered inconvenient or whose presence he found undesirable.</P><Miles com="cl" par="115"/>
    <P>Between the beginning of 1999 and the end of 2003 some 10,335 European Economic Area non-nationals secured residency in the State on the sole basis that they had an Irish born child. A total of 2,400, roughly 25%, of these parents never claimed asylum. The vast majority of such parents were not married to EU nationals since, save in exceptional circumstances, the general policy is to grant the EEA non-national spouses of Irish or EEA nationals permission to reside here, whether or not they have Irish born children. There are no figures available on the break-down between mothers and fathers. At present more than 9,000 EEA non-nationals have indicated that they have Irish born children and wish to remain in the State on this basis. They constitute the 10,000 we have heard about in discussions. The position regarding these was set out in the dictum of Hardiman J. in the Supreme Court in the L &amp;  O case. He said: &ldquo;it seems to me that the existence of an Irish born child does not fundamentally transform the rights of the parents, though it requires the specific consideration of the Minister who must reasonably be satisfied of the existence of a grave and substantial reason favouring deportation.&rdquo; The notion that I was suddenly handed a free-flowing pen with which to authorise the mass deportation of 9,000 people is not grounded in reality. I committed myself to considering the rights of each of them on a case by case basis. It is not true, therefore, that cases involving Irish-born children who are Irish citizens are in some sense a foregone conclusion in administrative terms as a consequence of the L and O cases. That is far from being the case.</P>
    <P>A significant additional ingredient in such cases demands more rigorous and labour intensive consideration by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It appears that people continue to have a perception that there is a strong possibility of success in securing <Col N="802"/>permission to stay in Ireland at the end of the process. If one follows what Mr. Justice Hardiman said, there has to be a &ldquo;grave and substantial&rdquo; reason to tell the parents and their child to leave. If the child is not an Irish citizen, there is an expectation that the process of reaching a decision will be less time-consuming and more straightforward. Where deportation is appropriate, it will not be a question of &ldquo;grave and substantial&rdquo; reasons, but of the balance of what is fair, having regard to humanitarian concerns.</P>
    <P>The matter does not end if the parents of a child who is an Irish citizen are deported. The child cannot be made the subject of a deportation order. I cannot deport an Irish child. It is likely to arise at some point that parents will refuse to take the child with them in an attempt to frustrate the deportation process. I point those who think I am inviting such a case to be brought against me to the language of the Constitution, specifically Articles 41 and 42, which we discussed during Private Members&rsquo; business. Article 42 of the Constitution states, that parents have an &ldquo;inalienable right and duty&rdquo; to look after their children.</P>
    <P>If parents are being deported as a matter of Irish law, it could be strongly argued that they are obliged to bring their child with them. They have no legal right to dump or abandon a child in Ireland. I do not believe that would happen because the vast majority of parents are sane and loving. I do not want to suggest that people would consider abandoning a child to embarrass the State. Only a person with a very bad value system would think of doing so. There has never been a hint of such a move in any of the cases I have come across. Regardless of the country from which they come, parents throughout the world have an absolute and total commitment to their children, especially young children. This is equally the case in respect of asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>The amendments before the House would raise a further layer of complication if a child who is a citizen returned to the jurisdiction with a deported parent, for example, a year after the deportation. If a three year old arrives at Dublin Airport waving an Irish passport saying &ldquo;this is my mother&rdquo;, should I tell him that he can enter the country, but his mother cannot? I agree that the scenario is somewhat fanciful, but it is not the case that I can separate children from their parents without humanitarian and constitutional regard to the interests of the child. I cannot act in an arbitrary manner by saying that I do not care about the child&rsquo;s family relations and by decreeing that the child can enter but his mother should be sent back. If one examines the Preamble to the Constitution, one will see that it refers to the virtues of &ldquo;Prudence, Justice and Charity&rdquo; and to the Christian nature of the State. <Col N="803"/>One cannot conduct migration policy on such a crude basis.</P>
    <P>A good number of people face the circumstances mentioned by Senator Terry. Many decisions remain to be made. I have to maintain the integrity of our immigration laws. The Supreme Court has said that when I am of the view that a decision is necessary to maintain the integrity of the law, I can act to deport. I will need to have a &ldquo;grave and substantial&rdquo; reason, to adopt Mr. Justice Hardiman&rsquo;s phrase, to do so. I will not be permitted to do so as a matter of light and superficial policy preference.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke earlier about the importance of the proposed referendum. Senator Jim Walsh said that it is a simple process, but it is most important nonetheless. Our last resort should be to change the Constitution. Senator Mansergh spoke about my call for the proposal to be referred to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which I believe is the right way to proceed. I disagree with the Senator&rsquo;s argument that such a referral would be a delaying tactic. That is certainly not the case &mdash; I am treating the matter very seriously. We are not here to try to delay the entire process. I want it to be dealt with in a proper fashion. If we proceed with the proposed referendum on 11 June, we will not give the issue the consideration it deserves.</P>
    <P>I wish to respond to the Minister and to thank him for his reply. Many people will have concerns, particularly the 10,335 members of families who have been granted residency here. The Minister can deport a family only if he has &ldquo;grave and substantial&rdquo; reasons for doing so. One has to ask what such reasons might be. If members of the family in question are in receipt of social welfare in the State, would the Minister consider it a sufficiently &ldquo;grave and substantial&rdquo; reason to deport them? Do they deserve to be deported if they are not independent and self-sufficient?</P>
    <P>I wish to raise an issue that may cause problems in the future. I refer to the problems that may arise if the Minister decides to allow a family that includes an Irish-born citizen to stay here. What will happen if the family has a second child in this country after the enactment of this legislation? The child in question would not be an Irish citizen. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that all children are treated equally and protected while they are in this country, regardless of whether they are Irish citizens or citizens of a foreign state. It will be strange if a family has a child who is an Irish citizen and a second child who is a citizen of the country from which his or her parents originally came. Has the Minister considered such a possibility? How will it play out in terms of the family&rsquo;s life here?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="804"/>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise the case about which the Minister spoke. I would have thought such a case demonstrates that there is not a loophole in the Constitution. The citizenship rights that were bestowed on the child did not entitle the parents to be Irish citizens or to stay here, which meant that they could be deported. A constitutional amendment is being proposed on the basis that there is a loophole, but the case cited by the Minister shows that no such loophole exists, or at least that no loophole exists that can be abused.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party opposes the abuse of social welfare. Many changes in the social welfare code over the years have prevented people who were born as Irish citizens from abusing the social welfare system here. They have been required to show that they are looking for work, for example. It is obvious that more needs to be done in that regard. I feel that such measures would be more appropriate, especially if combined with the proposed green card system. It is obvious that other legislation that has been introduced by the Government has had an effect.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have said that it is a simple issue, but it is a complicated issue. If the proposed constitutional amendment is accepted, two children in a single family will have different rights if one was born in Ireland before the referendum and the other was born in Ireland after it. One child will have been born with the right to Irish citizenship, but that will not apply to the other child, assuming that adequate provision is not made in the legislation that is introduced after the referendum. Any referendum proposing a change to the Constitution is complicated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned on many occasions the fact that Deputy Quinn raised this issue when the Good Friday Agreement was being considered by the people. The Deputy raised the issue, which is the proper way to deal with any proposal to amend the Constitution. These different aspects should be explored further. No constitutional amendment can be taken lightly and this one could give rise to other unforeseen complications. Deputy Quinn was not claiming to have the definitive answer at the time. Instead, he was acknowledging that this issue is not so simple. The same goes for this constitutional amendment and there could be unforeseen consequences if it is passed. The House has not been given the opportunity to examine it further.</P>
    <P>The only rights that the children concerned would have under the Constitution are their rights as citizens. One gap in the Constitution is that there are no specific rights for children. Apart from an indirect one relating to education, their fundamental rights are those associated with adulthood such as the inviolability of one&rsquo;s dwelling. The Constitution only refers to the family and the role of the parents. This gap in the Constitution should be examined in the future. <Col N="805"/>An unborn child has rights under the Constitution and is seen as an equal. However, if this constitutional amendment is accepted, some children born in Ireland will not have the same equal status that they have now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator&rsquo;s Tuffy is arguing the Labour Party&rsquo;s point that any child born in Ireland, regardless of whether the parents are nationals, should have an immediate entitlement to citizenship. That is the substantive issue to which I referred to earlier. On Second Stage and in previous debates on this issue, application of citizenship rights in other EU member states was raised. Ireland&rsquo;s arrangements are unique and along the lines advocated by Senator Tuffy. The proposal that a child born of non-national parents, one of whom must have resided in Ireland for three of the past four years, will be entitled to citizenship is generous. However, I believe the period should be for a minimum of five years or longer. There will be an opportunity to debate this when the legislation is introduced.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s argument because this is an area that needs to be regulated. Evidence from the hospitals of women arriving in Ireland late in pregnancy has been raised. This is neither in the interest of their personal health nor of the child&rsquo;s. Many of these women do not have a full understanding of the language, which also imposes difficulties on the hospitals in giving effective treatment. There are also obligations to other EU member states because, as a consequence of obtaining Irish citizenship, one also obtains EU citizenship. There is a good argument for bringing broad harmonisation to this area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Terry and Senator Tuffy raised the instance of a family with one child who is an Irish citizen and another who is not. However, that instance occurs as matters stand. There are thousands of families in Ireland where one of the older children is not an Irish citizen while the youngest is a citizen. It does not seem to me to complicate life for those parents. A Nigerian family with one child born in Ireland and another in Manchester would be in the same position, if the referendum is passed, as a family with one child already born here and another in the future. The second child would not be entitled to Irish citizenship as a right, just as the child born in Manchester is not. If the family came to reside in Ireland thereafter, it might be considered odd that the older child was an Irish citizen and the younger was not. However, I do not see any injustice or lack of protection for the younger child consequent upon it.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh does not like the three year period of residence for the child&rsquo;s parents which is a more cautious viewpoint than the Government&rsquo;s. However, one could be more <Col N="806"/>liberal than the Government in arguing that a child is entitled to citizenship if the parents resided here three years after the child&rsquo;s birth. That is not in the Government&rsquo;s current text but one could liberalise or make the conditions stricter. That is a matter of detail and policy that I would be interested in debating when the Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>Anyone who is lawfully present in Ireland for five years &mdash; three years if their spouse is an Irish citizen &mdash; is entitled to apply for Irish citizenship and nationality. These people are also entitled to have their children made Irish citizens with them. Sometimes, it is done on a rolling basis as it is easier and cheaper to apply for naturalisation of one&rsquo;s children at a later stage. I do not see any problems in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry asked if I could have followed the route of testing legislation. I discussed this on Second Stage but I reiterate that it is simply impossible for me to run a Bill through the Houses believing it to be unconstitutional. The Attorney General would not permit this and, if he was overridden on the issue, he would be forced to resign. It would be a breach of my duty, and that of Cabinet members, as a citizen with loyalty to the State and the Constitution to admit that, although a Bill is wrong, I will still have a go and hope to get lucky with a Supreme Court ruling upholding it. Such a method of operation has never been countenanced by the Government. It would be a great abuse of the presumption of the constitutionality of legislation introduced in the Oireachtas. When I was Attorney General, such a ploy was never suggested. An Attorney General would have to resign if he heard Cabinet deciding such a ploy. The Cabinet would be breaching its duty of loyalty to the State. The State is the State based on the Constitution. We could not possibly have a group of people deciding to have a go at passing a law that was fundamentally unconstitutional. It would breach their fundamental duty of loyalty to the State and its Constitution. What does happen on occasion is that the Attorney General or a member of the Cabinet sees something in a Bill that might be constitutionally suspect, but the Government would not proceed with the Bill if it thought it was constitutionally improper. It could consider an argument against the Bill and decide that the balance of opinion was that it was constitutional and would be proceeded with. That would be a different situation.</P>
    <P>There is no method by which the Cabinet can simply come up with a Bill and run it through both Houses in the subjective belief that it violates the Constitution. The Attorney General&rsquo;s advice and the Government&rsquo;s position are clearly right. The second sentence of Article 2 is the key to all of this. It makes it clear that the first sentence is a method by which the entitlement to citizenship is conferred on people and that it <Col N="807"/>cannot be taken away. There is a variety of views in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and this House about whether, in principle, this is a good or a bad idea, but there are some people in the D&aacute;il and, judging by Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s views, in this House who actually believe it is wrong to change the <i>jus soli</i> absolute rule. Perhaps I am misinterpreting the Senator, but I gathered from her last intervention that she thinks it is wrong to do so.</P>
    <P>A Green Party or Sinn F&eacute;in Member may believe the present constitutional regime should be left exactly as it is because it guarantees citizenship to everyone born in Ireland in every circumstance, regardless of the length of his or her connection to Ireland. If that Member asked me in the House whether I believed a Bill I was putting forward was consistent with the Constitution and I said &ldquo;Probably not, but let us see what the Supreme Court says,&rdquo; it would be a resigning matter for me. Likewise, if I said I believed it was constitutional in order to mask my embarrassment and lubricate its passage through the House, I would be engaging in a gross deception of Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to put forward experimental legislation if one has clear advice, with which one agrees, that it would be unconstitutional. It is an attractive idea that this might be possible. It is like throwing a die &mdash; one does not think it will come up on six, but if it does that is great. If the world was like that we would have far fewer problems, but the Constitution would mean a lot less if Governments behaved in that way. I must take this relatively seriously. For me to experiment, come up with something I believe is unconstitutional and push it through both Houses in the hope that the Supreme Court will see it from a different angle is subversive and disloyal to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy referred to Deputy Quinn&rsquo;s letter. I have this letter and accompanying memo. I find it fascinating that for all the debate on this issue, nobody has ever put it into the public domain. One would imagine that if the Labour Party was content to put it in the public domain it would now be plastered all over the newspapers so its members could say &ldquo;We told you so.&rdquo; This time the usual impulse of politicians has been overcome by the desire not to know what they said because it would be more convenient to have a different view today.</P>

    <P LI="1">and</P>
    <P LI="1">In Part 2, page 6, lines 16 and 17, to delete &ldquo;, at the time of the birth of that person,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My understanding of the section, taking it at face value, is that at the time of the birth of the person concerned at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen must be alive. The Minister read out Article 2 of the Constitution, showing how one can read one thing from another thing in a section. I feel this is true in this case. The amendment seeks to remove a cruel loophole. If, for example, a father dies before his child is born, the child would not enjoy the constitutional right to Irish citizenship. If the mother dies during the birth, before the precise moment of the child&rsquo;s birth, the child&rsquo;s citizenship right would be in question.</P>
    <P>This matter may have been raised in the D&aacute;il and the Minister may have said he would deal with this issue through legislation. However, it would make more sense and avoid unnecessary litigation if it were dealt with now. The words should be deleted or the section clarified so that it does not mean the father or mother of the person must be alive at the time of his or her birth.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention of my amendment is the same as that of the Labour Party, although the wording is different. The current wording of the Bill means that if the Irish parent dies &mdash; generally the father, although it could be the mother&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is possible. If this happens, the child will be denied citizenship. This is a problem that needs to be addressed because I can see it going to court otherwise. The wording I propose to insert is &ldquo;or at any time previously.&rdquo;</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This raises the interesting question of whether a parent is a parent regardless of whether he or she is alive or dead. I have a bad habit in public discourse of referring to my late father. My wife constantly corrects me on this, saying that he is my father, always was my father and always will be my father. It does not follow that a person should cease to be a parent simply because he or she is dead.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue had already been anticipated by the ingenuity of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel. If one considers the theme of the Government&rsquo;s proposed legislation, it proposes to extend citizenship by statute to a person born on the island of Ireland if the person was born to parents, one of whom was deceased at the time of the person&rsquo;s birth, or if the deceased person was, immediately before he or she died, entitled to reside in the State without any restriction on his or her right of residence. The same applies in each of the four categories. The anomaly with which Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment and Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s amendment is designed to deal is precisely the kind of thing one can deal with in legislation, without complicating and jumbling the Constitution in order to deal with these exceptions.</P>
    <P>Curiously, at the time of the death of a person, the deletion in Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment would run contrary to the annexe of the British-Irish Agreement. For the purpose of giving effect to this provision, that annexe says all persons born in Northern Ireland and having at the time of their birth at least one parent who is a British citizen, an Irish citizen or is otherwise entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on residence, should be considered to be the people of Northern Ireland, and that at time of their birth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely it is the birth of the child that counts. It does not necessarily require the continuing existence of the parent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct. The minimum guarantee is that the group of people referred to will be guaranteed citizenship. There <Col N="810"/>is the possibility of a mother being kept alive on a machine, for example, though that would be rare. It is much more likely that an Irish father would predecease the child. In those circumstances one would encounter all sorts of complications. I do not want to get into the question of AI donors, and so on. We could be here until doomsday discussing such scenarios. The issues we have spoken of should be dealt with by legislation rather than by constitutional provision.</P>
    <P>Certain remarks of mine may have been unintentionally misinterpreted by others. On one occasion, when confronted with a microphone, I used the phrase &ldquo;manufactured arguments, North and South&rdquo;, in reference to arguments against the amendment. I used that phrase while having in mind some of the arguments used in the South which I believed to be manufactured. I will not go back down that road again. When I was talking of Northern Ireland, I was thinking more of the arguments based on the proposition which the DUP came up with, that this was some unravelling of the British-Irish Agreement and showed that anything could be changed in Dublin. I did not mean that the SDLP&rsquo;s concerns were manufactured. I have never thought that about the SDLP&rsquo;s concerns, but I used the phrase &ldquo;manufactured arguments North and South&rdquo; and I can well appreciate that some SDLP members might have thought that I was referring to their reservations. I was not doing so. I was talking of what I believe are the entirely opportunistic arguments advanced by the DUP.</P>
    <P>I also want to put another matter formally on the record, because it would be of value, particularly to the SDLP. Regarding the administrative arrangements which will be necessary to make the legislation workable, we will of course closely consult with those people north of the Border, so that people from Northern Ireland are not burdened with greater practical requirements to prove their entitlement to Irish citizenship in a way that is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has stated clearly that any attempt on foot of this legislation to differentiate between people born north of the Border and those born south of the Border would be unconstitutional. That is my understanding too. This amendment does not permit a distinction to the entitlement of Irish people or people of Northern Ireland under the British-Irish Agreement to be drawn on the basis that they were born north or south of the Border. Obviously, a distinction can be drawn with regard to how they go about proving it, but that is simply one which will be overcome in a non-discriminatory fashion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there such a distinction?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="811"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In so far as this new law permits the Oireachtas to determine the circumstances in which people born north and south of the Border shall obtain Irish citizenship, it would be unconstitutional to avail of this referendum to distinguish between the people of Northern Ireland, as defined in the British-Irish Agreement, and the people of the South with regard to their entitlement. The clear meaning of the Agreement is that they are entitled as of birthright to Irish citizenship. It should be clearly understood that this does not open the way to a second-class status for people born in Northern Ireland who are the children of Irish citizens or UK citizens or long-term residents. They will not be put into a second-class status as regards their entitlement to access Irish citizenship if that is their desire.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister noted the Parliamentary Counsel anticipated this issue, and that it is dealt with in the draft legislation, so that the citizenship right is extended to people whose parents are not alive at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth. That means that people in such a situation do not have a constitutional right, and the right has to be provided by legislation.</P>
    <P>Second, the fact that the Minister has to legislate in this way and anticipate matters in this way means the wording in the constitutional amendment was flawed. The Minister has had to address that flaw through legislation. The most important point is that people in the position referred to do not have the constitutional right of citizenship. It is unbelievable that this would be the intent of the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment merely inserts four words to bring about the desired effect we are requesting. We are asking that after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; on line 17, we would say &ldquo;or at any time previously&rdquo;. That will put it into the Constitution that anyone born of an Irish parent who has died prior to that person&rsquo;s birth would be granted citizenship. It is much better to deal with the matter simply than to deal with it afterwards by means of legislation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Minister&rsquo;s clarification, is this an apology to the SDLP?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s tetchiness about upsetting the SDLP. He should be just as tetchy when saying that parties in the South have &ldquo;manufactured arguments&rdquo; about this referendum.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that about parties.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify that for me, but he did refer to people North and <Col N="812"/>South, and he agreed that people in the South manufactured arguments. The Minister should make it clear of whom he is speaking when he says that, and not allude to any of the political parties in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Senator for the points she has made.</P>
    <P>I am not in the slightest bit tetchy about this subject. When I went home that evening and saw the reaction to what I said, it suddenly occurred to me that what I actually said could have been reasonably interpreted as applying to the SDLP, but it was not my view at the time. I was thinking about the arguments, which were then being advanced by the Paisleyites north of the Border that this somehow warranted the entire scrapping of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. I thought that was a somewhat manufactured argument. People were saying also that because the DUP was saying that in Northern Ireland, it was a reason for not having the referendum, but that is a manufactured reason because if their objection is a manufactured one, arguments derived from it are manufactured also. I do not want to get personal at this stage but I read other arguments which I believe were divorced from reality, clutching at straws and instances of the wish being the father of the thought, in so far as &ldquo;thought&rdquo; is a fair term to apply to it.</P>
    <P>In case it appears we are getting a little adversarial, I commend the Fine Gael Party for agreeing in principle with this referendum, subject to all its reservations about timing and the like. I thank it for drawing the distinction between its reservations on timing and its ultimate stance on this issue. If we are talking about making the parties in Northern Ireland tetchy, I would say very demurely, and with the greatest affection and respect, that Senator Terry&rsquo;s earlier amendment, which we did not proceed with, would have caused much more fluttering of the dovecotes than anything I have ever done or said. Whereas it is right to explore that possibility, if I had run with it, I would have faced a blizzard of abuse.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will, yes. The more I look at this amendment, the more concerned I become about it. For example, one of my family members is married to a non-citizen and they could be affected by this measure. There are many people in that position. There are many people whose <Col N="813"/>children emigrated to America and other countries, married, came back here and presumed their children would be constitutionally entitled to Irish citizenship. Surely this measure puts that in question. I want the Minister to be clear in his reply. If an Irish citizen goes abroad to work, marries somebody who is not an Irish citizen, comes back here &mdash; the spouse does not have Irish citizenship at that stage &mdash; they have a child but the Irish citizen dies before the birth of that child, that child&rsquo;s constitutional right to citizenship will be in question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my reading of it. There is a need for legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The child never had a constitutional right until 1999 in those circumstances. It was a statutory right. The world went on very well without a constitutional right until 1999. The roof will not fall in in similar circumstances now. To be practical about it, anybody who is living in Ireland on a long-term basis is entitled to claim Irish nationality. If that person was entitled to live in Ireland, he or she would be entitled to claim Irish citizenship and nationality after a period of time.</P>
    <P>One of the joys of bringing this back to the Legislature is that we will be able to deal with all of these cases by legislation. We will be able to provide whatever we wish in respect of recently deceased parents who were Irish citizens &mdash; spouse does not enter into this in most cases, it is purely parentage &mdash; and deal with all of those exceptions. We will be able to provide the most minutely tailored distinctions between one category and another as we desire.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry asked me what was wrong with her proposed amendment to the Constitution, but would it deal with a situation where somebody renounced Irish citizenship? If we said &ldquo;who was at any time previously an Irish citizen&rdquo;, would she say that somebody could renounce it? Would she say that even though both parents of the child had renounced Irish citizenship, the child should nonetheless be an Irish citizen? That would be a strange outcome. There is no point putting this into the Constitution. We can deal with all of it in statute form and we can make all the exceptions, concessions and restrictions we believe are apposite to produce a fair result. To take the example, the draftsman of Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment contemplated somebody dying and drafted words on that account, but it equally applies to somebody who renounced Irish citizenship or who was deprived of Irish citizenship by legal process. Do we want to put that into our Constitution without thinking it through?</P>

Why did the Minister use that term when there is no such thing as a non-national who was born in Ireland? That will not be the case until this legislation is enacted.</P>

One parent is sufficient to provide citizenship. Otherwise, the founder of our party and our State would have been in trouble. There is no concern about that aspect. It is now a constitutionally based right if one is born in Ireland, except in very exceptional circumstances, and it was a constitutional right between 1922 and 1937 as well.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Without pre-empting the Minister&rsquo;s reply, nationality and citizenship today are effectively synonymous and interchangeable terms. However, they have different nuances. Citizenship is being a civic member of a state, whereas nationality is membership of a nation. Nation and state are not precisely the same thing. Under the Good Friday Agreement, it is quite explicitly stated that &ldquo;nation&rdquo; has a geographical reference to the whole island of Ireland, whereas &ldquo;State&rdquo;, very emphatically after 1998, refers to only 26 counties. I see no particular reason why one should not continue to use both terms. Citizenship is of the State, while nationality is membership of the nation, and those terms are not exactly coterminous. In this context, they have the same practical consequence, in that membership of the nation entitles one to citizenship of the State. However, one should not <Col N="816"/>fall into the trap of thinking that they are the same. In practical terms, they may amount, for these purposes, to the same thing, but they are not identical terms and do not have identical references.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Interestingly, we could spend many hours discussing whether there is a distinction to be drawn between citizenship and nationality in practical terms today, as they are used interchangeably in many documents and areas. This sounds terrible, but I believe that a theoretical distinction between the two existed in Europe until the Second World War. There were some societies in Europe which counted women as their nationals but refused them citizenship. I may be wrong, but I believe that Germany, at one stage, accorded nationality but not citizenship to women. There may have been some other states. One of the great attributes of de Valera&rsquo;s Constitution was that he guaranteed citizenship regardless of gender. At the time, that was worth saying, although it seems self-evident to us now. In those days, it was not a self-evident proposition in international law that men and women were considered equally entitled to be citizens of every state. There was a distinction, which has now become largely redundant, between citizenship and nationality for the purposes of constitutional law.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I definitely accept the proposition that the Irish nation and State are separate concepts, and that is probably to be found if one examines the text of the Constitution itself. The first part of the Constitution, covering Articles 1 to 3, inclusive, is headed &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The State&rdquo; is the heading for Article 4 onwards, so there are different concepts at play. I am not suggesting that State and nation are the same but that I believe that some states in Europe denied women citizenship while according them nationality. I also believe that there were cases where people were deprived of their rights of citizenship while remaining nationals of that state.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s proposition. I am glad the Minister rather went out of his way to reassure people in Northern Ireland that there will be no diminution of the position they thought they had reached through the Good Friday Agreement and the constitutional changes flowing from it. However, the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement is really based on the proposition that the State and the nation are not identical and that the nation can flow across the borders of the State. If we appear to be tinkering with that again, it could be destabilising.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us examine Article 9.2 of the Constitution as it stands. It states &ldquo;Fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all citizens&rdquo;. A distinction is being drawn there, as it does not state &ldquo;fidelity and loyalty to the nation and State&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a distinction.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a distinction. Perhaps it is a distinction without a difference, but it is there. I believe that Senator Mansergh is right and that there was a case that citizenship was not accorded to all the nationals of many states in Europe. It was a relatively late development that it became available to everyone in a society. I do not know and do not wish to speculate, but there were cantons in Switzerland in which women were denied the vote. However, they were definitely Swiss nationals. I do not know how they could be citizens and not entitled to a vote.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s explanation on the use of the word shows that this amendment affects Article 2, which refers to the Irish nation, whereas Article 9 more specifically refers to citizenship, although it also mentions nationality. By bringing in nationality, the Minister is affecting Article 2 of the Constitution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister might respond to my question about why the concept of a non-national born in Ireland is referred to. The Minister said that a non-national born in Ireland could be a Unionist. However, why was that phrase used in the Immigration Bill 2004 at a time when this referendum was not being considered? The Immigration Bill 2004 became law in February, and we first heard of this referendum <Col N="818"/>after that date. Under Article 2, anybody born on the island of Ireland is an Irish citizen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Entitled to be.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister might explain why that phrase was used in the Immigration Bill 2004.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The phrase is not of 2000 vintage, going back to 1946 at the very least. It goes back to the basic point we discussed at the beginning of today&rsquo;s proceedings. One is not automatically an Irish citizen if one is born in Ireland. One is automatically entitled to Irish citizenship if born in the island of Ireland. The child born to a French couple in Ireland this week is not automatically an Irish citizen. If that child does not do something &mdash; either have a choice made for it by its parents or makes it itself &mdash; consistent with claiming citizenship, he or she will be a French national by descent. Such a child may legitimately be called a non-national born in the island of Ireland. A Unionist in Northern Ireland can be legitimately called a non-national born in the island of Ireland. An Irish citizen who renounces his or her citizenship to become a citizen of a state that does not permit dual citizenship is a non-national born in the island of Ireland. There are many categories to which that phrase may apply and they are of considerable antiquity.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Senator may have seen them, first, in an Act of 2000 does not mean the words were not used many times before and had a clear meaning, which is that it is possible to be born in the island of Ireland and to be either a Unionist or somebody who has nationality of some other state by descent; or somebody who was born here and has been an Irish citizen and has repudiated citizenship with a view to becoming a citizen of some other country. All of those people may legitimately be called non-nationals born in the island of Ireland.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would just add a refinement to that position. There are many Unionists who choose to have Irish nationality alongside British nationality. I say this so that we do not give any impression from this debate that a Unionist is <i>per se</i> non-Irish or not an Irish citizen. Many Unionists are Irish citizens. I gather the post offices in Northern Ireland do a roaring trade in Irish passports, even in predominantly Unionist areas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree. Senator Mansergh is right to remind me that the debate might convey I was suggesting Unionists cannot be Irish citizens. One can be a Unionist and an Irish citizen.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not tetchiness at all. I am now realising that I have been using the phrase &ldquo;Unionist &rdquo; too broadly. What I was trying to get at was somebody who was so &ldquo;Unionist&rdquo;, they would have nothing to do with Irish citizenship, on ideological grounds, and who would never do what Senator Mansergh referred to.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 4, line 11, after &ldquo;OIREACHTAS&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;AND BY THE PEOPLE&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason we are tabling this amendment to the Preamble is that we believe the formula as it stands in the Bill and under the legislation to amend the Constitution is incorrect. Bills to amend the Constitution are not enacted by the Oireachtas, rather they are enacted by the Oireachtas and the people. We feel the formula that has been in use for the past six years is not accurate and could be rectified in this Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a somewhat theological point and I am loath to get into a theological battle at this hour of the evening. However, while not speaking on the advice of the Attorney General, it is my view that Article 46 of the Constitution provides that the method of amending it is by means of a Bill that is enacted by the Oireachtas. Subject to being persuaded otherwise, it is my view that the provision of Article 46.3 is relevant here. It provides: &ldquo;Every such Bill shall be expressed to be &lsquo;An Act to amend the Constitution&rsquo;.&rdquo; The Bill must be expressed to be an Act to amend the Constitution. Having been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, it must &ldquo;be submitted by Referendum to the decision of the people in accordance with the law for the time being in force relating to the Referendum&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the phrase &ldquo;referendum&rdquo; means that the people make the decision in the sense that the people do the enactment. I believe it is a condition precedent to the President signing a Bill to amend the Constitution, that it has been submitted for the decision of the people in a referendum, but the people&rsquo;s act in approving a Bill to amend the Constitution at a referendum is not a process of enactment. It is a process of decision, which amounts to a condition precedent, not a legislative act. However, it does not really matter which way it is because all the amendments to our Constitution have been done in the old way, which seems to follow my understanding of the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Labour Party could possibly argue that the Constitution has never been validly enacted for want of the addition of these words. That would be a radical proposition, to put it mildly. Therefore if the old method of procedure, which is the traditional one, is sufficient to amend <Col N="821"/>the Constitution, we should stick to it. It has not gone wrong yet and it has not been challenged yet. I would be surprised indeed &mdash; famous last words, I suppose &mdash; if this came unstuck in the courts on that basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand the logic of this amendment because if we insert &ldquo;be it therefore enacted by the Oireachtas and the people, as follows&rdquo; and this Bill was passed, then it would be deemed to have been passed by the people, whereas in fact it has to be submitted to the people for referendum. In effect, we would be pre-empting the people&rsquo;s decision. That is the way I would look at it, logically.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>At the same time it still goes to the President to be signed if the referendum is passed. It should surely state, at that stage, that it is enacted by the people. Either way, I will withdraw the amendment at this stage.</P>

   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, for coming into the House to take this motion. In 2001 Ballymote Community Child Care Company <Col N="822"/>Limited lodged its application with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for capital and staff funding for a new play group building providing a morning and afternoon session. Following discussions with the Sisters of Mercy, it donated a new site for which planning permission was sought and granted.</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>In January 2002 Area Development Management Limited met with members of the group to assess 
   its grant application and plans. Some weeks later Area Development Management contacted the group about the grant application and advised it to apply for funding to provide a full day care facility. The group was reluctant to do so but Area Development Management implied that the grant would be looked on more favourably if it did so. A needs assessment survey carried out in a four mile radius of Ballymote indicated that there was a demand for full day child care and an even greater need for before and after school child care.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this with the Minister. There are many such applications before the Department but I wish to impress upon him the importance of this application. A total of 28 people who worked in the playgroup and availed of training went on to full-time employment. The proposed new child care facility will provide employment for 18 people. It will offer 200 play group places per week; 55 full day care places for one to three year olds; 50 places per week for three to four year olds; and 72 places per week for before and after school care. The application speaks for itself and there is no doubt about the demand. I ask the Minister at his earliest convenience to ensure that this project gets off the ground.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Scanlon for raising this matter. The equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06, a seven year inclusive programme, facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to assist people in reconciling their child care needs with participation in employment, training and education. The programme makes capital grant assistance available to community-based and not-for-profit groups or organisations and self-employed or private providers to build, renovate, upgrade or equip child care facilities. The programme also makes grant assistance available towards the staffing costs of community-based and not-for-profit child care facilities which have a clear focus on disadvantage and support disadvantaged families who are in work, training or education. It also makes available funding under a range of initiatives aimed at enhancing the quality of child care provision.</P>
    <P>The programme&rsquo;s guidelines lay out the criteria against which capital grant applications and staffing grant applications are appraised. These <Col N="823"/>include the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the applicant group to implement the project; the level of integration and co-ordination with existing services to avoid duplication; and value for money. Area Development Management Limited which is employed by my Department to carry out the day to day administration of the programme, undertakes a thorough assessment of all applications to ensure that they meet the programme&rsquo;s criteria. In addition, all large-scale capital grant applications undergo an intensive appraisal by an independent external building specialist. All applications are then considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, before I make the final decision on the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
    <P>Funding of almost &euro;437 million has been made available by the European Union and the Exchequer under the National Development Plan 2000-06. To date, of that &euro;437 million, &euro;258.6 million has been approved for capital, staffing and quality improvement projects. Much of the remaining funding will be required to meet the ongoing supports to projects until the programme ends. My Department has carried out a thorough review of the programme with a particular emphasis on the capital programme. The review shows that every county has benefited from considerable support for new child care facilities under the equal opportunities child care programme. In all, funding to create some 28,300 new places has been approved. This will, when fully drawn down, bring an increase of 50% in the number of centre-based child care places throughout Ireland since the start of the programme in 2000. Included in the total figures I mentioned earlier are approvals for the creation for 508 new child care places and the support of 338 existing places in County Sligo.</P>
    <P>The equal opportunities child care programme originally set aside over &euro;140 million capital funding to create new and enhanced child care places. The review is also looking at all existing financial commitments under the programme to ensure that all capital projects which have already received grant allocations will proceed. The amount now being set aside for capital grant assistance is increasing by about &euro;16 million to &euro;157 million and a further additional amount will be made available shortly following the conclusion of some technicalities by the BMW regional assembly. This additional funding was made available in recognition of the programme&rsquo;s success to date and its capacity to develop and support quality child care. The public investment is also directly levering some private investment in the sector, estimated at approximately &euro;14 million. I must be sure that all funding already committed, and yet to be committed, can be fully <Col N="824"/>drawn down by the end of the programme, which is end 2007 for much of the investment.</P>
    <P>Given the time constraints on the programme and the need to commit the remaining capital to those projects which best meet the programme&rsquo;s targets I asked Area Development Management to carry out a thorough appraisal of all capital projects in the pipeline to determine which projects will best meet the programme criteria, including geographical location, the range of services being offered and value for money.</P>
    <P>The application for capital grant assistance received from Ballymote Community Child Care is being assessed in the context of the outcome of the detailed programme review. In addition, as the group&rsquo;s application for staffing grant assistance relates directly to the capital grant application, it will be considered following the completion of the appraisal process of the capital grant application. I have asked Area Development Management to undertake this thorough appraisal of all capital projects on hand as quickly as possible and I hope that my Department will be in a position to bring forward completed appraisals and recommendations soon. The programme has been such a success that I hope to persuade my colleagues in Government to create an additional programme to run after the 2007 deadline so that this will not be a line of funding moving towards a sunset. It has been so successful that there is a very strong case to extend it beyond that period but that decision must be taken by Government as a whole in the light of budgetary circumstances which have yet to be examined.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is aware that razor wire was erected around part of the boundary of Farmleigh prior to the visit of EU leaders last weekend in order to provide additional security to the House and its visitors. I am concerned that there will be a delay in taking down the razor wire. Perhaps the Minister will inform me that it has already been taken down. It was not down this morning, but I hope to hear that it will be removed. A local garda told me that he did not think it would be taken down. I believe it should be removed.</P>
    <P>There was no threat to visitors in the house because of the high level of security provided by garda&iacute; in the area. Roads in the area were closed except for access. In addition to the razor wire that was recently erected, a permanent thin line of razor wire is attached to a fence inside the main wall of Farmleigh. Other security measures in place there, such as cameras and security staff, are sufficient for most events that take place. With so many important visitors involved, I can understand that the events of last weekend were exceptional and that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na felt it <Col N="825"/>necessary to provide additional security. Additional razor wire was also erected for the visit of the Chinese premier and I had to push hard to ensure it was removed following that visit.</P>
    <P>I am being brief in the hope the Minister will inform me that the razor wire will be removed. If that is not the case, I must impress on him that this is doing nothing for Farmleigh in terms of the number of people who go there to enjoy its wonderful facilities. The presence of razor wire turns the place into a prison. It was bought by the State with taxpayers&rsquo; money to be enjoyed by the public as often as possible. It should not be turned into a fortress. I hope that will not be the case and that the Minister will inform me that, as we speak, the razor wire is being removed or will be taken down by the end of the week.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Senator on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon.</P>
    <P>As Senator Terry stated, additional razor wire was installed on the perimeter wall of Farmleigh House as a temporary measure in response to the security arrangements surrounding the EU accession event taking place there on 1 May. The Senator will be glad to hear that, as we speak, the temporary razor wire is being taken down.</P>
    <P>The installation of temporary razor wire is a matter for consideration in light of the security situation obtaining for any particular event being held at the house. It costs a great deal of money to put it up. I agree that it looks ugly. I also agree that it gives a wrong impression. However, it is not the kind of thing that is erected on a whim. Depending on the security situation, it may be necessary to put it back up again but, in general terms, it is desirable that it should not be there.</P>
    <P>The Senator correctly said that, in any event, permanent razor wire of a more subdued kind is in place on an internal perimeter fence. That will not be taken away. It is expected that things will be back to normal within 24 hours.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is disgraceful that I have to raise this issue again. The Department is conscious of the urgent necessity for a new primary school at Kilfinane, County Limerick. I previously raised the matter in the D&aacute;il. The people of Kilfinane and surrounding area were delighted prior to the last election when it was indicated that a new school would be provided in the area. It is almost two years since the general election and there is no indication when work will commence on a new school.</P>
    <P>Kilfinane national school is a co-education primary school and in September 2003 had an <Col N="826"/>enrolment of 134 pupils. The staffing consists of a principal, five mainstream teachers, one resource teacher and one shared learning support teacher. The school was built in 1909 and is a listed building. It was recognised in a feasibility study carried out in 1999 that it would not be possible to upgrade or extend the existing building. A site was secured in the area in 2002 and the school committee raised &euro;60,000 to part fund the project, as it was obliged to do. The current educational environment in which teachers and pupils have to operate is not satisfactory. The Department of Education and Science is aware of these conditions so I do not need to elaborate on them. It is imperative that the Department gives approval to the project as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last general election the school committee was told the project was on the list and would be carried out in due course. I am aware the Minister has announced the 2004 school building programme. It is imperative that the Minister includes it in the next school building programme. I look forward to a positive reply from the Minister of State.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the position regarding Kilfinane national school, Kilfinane, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>Kilfinane national school is a co-educational primary school with a current enrolment of 134 pupils. Enrolments have decreased in recent years from 163 pupils in the school year 1998-99 to 134 pupils in September 2003. The original school, which was constructed in 1909, is subject to a preservation order. The school authorities applied to my Department for capital grant aid to fund an extension and officials in the school planning section of my Department considered this application. The outcome was that the long-term accommodation needs of the school should be based on a teacher allocation of principal and five mainstream teachers plus a shared remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>A feasibility study was commissioned to examine the options for development at the school. Among the issues considered was whether it would be preferable to upgrade and extend the current building or provide a new school on a greenfield site. The feasibility study outlined a number of problems associated with remaining on the current site, for example, limited expansion possibilities and any planning application would have to reflect the listed status of the building. A possible new site was identified in the area and it was found to be generally suitable for the construction of a new school. The Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of <Col N="827"/>my Department in regard to site acquisitions, was requested to commence negotiations for purchase of the site. However, the diocese decided to purchase the site for the school and I understand it has now done so.</P>
    <P>Once the site has been procured the next step in the process is the commencement of architectural planning for a new school. Consideration will be given to this in the context of an overall review of projects, which the Minister referred to when publishing the 2004 school building programme. At that time he outlined that his strategy going forward will be grounded in capital investment based on multi-annual allocations. Officials are reviewing all projects, which were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme, with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005 and Kilfinane national school will be <Col N="828"/>considered in this regard. The Minister expects to be in a position to make further announcements on this matter in the course of the year.</P>
